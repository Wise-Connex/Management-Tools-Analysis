      "abstract": "<jats:p>When an organization needs to use scenarios as a framework for logically discussing internal and external issues, it should be aware of the two predominant causes of failure of scenario projects: (1) a lack of agreement on the purpose of the effort; and (2) a lack of understanding about how scenarios might help different organizational cultures and styles. To avoid these pitfalls, leaders need to first assess the potential usefulness of scenarios using the culture of their organization and the goals of the effort as context. This article discusses three organizational cultures and illustrates how each uses scenario planning for three different purposes (directional strategy, contingency planning, and learning and team building). “Leader‐driven organizations”: if the purpose of scenario planning is for setting direction, then scenarios are used to structure debate; however, in the end, the leader decides the direction and everyone follows, leaving the debate behind. If the purpose of the scenario work is for contingency planning, then scenarios would primarily be used to sensitize the leadership group to possible changes; not decision making on a specific topic. When learning and team building, then the leader driven culture use scenarios to open up the idea space in search of the out‐of‐the‐box ideas. Ideally, leaders make scenarios a way for people to work new ideas into the planning and decision‐making system. “Plan‐driven cultures”: such companies value stability. If the scenario work is for setting direction, then the outcome will only be valued if the events leading to an endstate are treated as critical path lists. “Evidence‐driven cultures”: develop in highly capital‐intensive industries that have long time horizons. Because long‐term commitments cannot be changed quickly, real evidence is of paramount value to these cultures. Scenarios provide a framework of expectations to match up with the real world as it develops.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>From the point of view of a successful scenario writer for Royal Dutch Shell, there are several there are several artful techniques that go into crafting and presenting business scenarios. The first is art of keeping it short. To do this at Shell the author produced two different products based on two distinct mental disciplines: (1) thorough research leading to rich, fully articulated stories (the full scenario book); and (2) the distillation of these stories into essential concepts and images (a little book that was widely read and distributed). Any scenario author seeks to create new patterns of thinking in the mind of the managers. Therefore, model the scenario as if it were a stage set created by words. The managers are the actors who will animate it by their participation in each alternative scenario world. This then is the design goal for any scenario writing: engage the managers to step into the play and make it their own. The author’s method is to stimulate the development of scenarios in their minds to the point that they are just not hearing a memorable story but they are experimenting with it and imagining alternatives.</jats:p>",

The paper is an attempt to analyse India's policy shifts and to examine changes in trade performances following the major reforms in 1991. It tries to have a picture of India's trade status and trade growth in 1990s as compared to the pre-openness period, and also relative to some selected developing economies. The analyses revealed that India became more open in 1990s, and its volume off oreign trade registered considerable growth in the post-openness period. However, India has been maintaining higher trade barriers compared to almost all economies of the comparison group, and its share in the global trade remained negligible. The empirical analyses also show that there has been positive and strong association between India's foreign trade and economic growth over the period under study, however, there is no indication that openness has been contributing in improving the productivity of domestic capital in India. </jats:p>",

These changes include a new regulatory environment which is still under construction, in particular the requirements for environmental protection. In this context, Resolution 293 of Brazilian National Environmental Council (CONAMA) was enacted regulating Facility Response Plans for oil spill incidents. These plans, which should be approved by the competent authority, include a vulnerability analysis that should discuss the probability of oil reaching certain areas as well as the environmental sensitivity of these areas. Oil spill modeling is an important tool to estimating the areas likely to be affected by an oil spill. Although oil spill modeling is also part of the environmental studies required in the environmental permitting process for oil E&amp;P activities, there are not well defined criteria to compose the oil spill scenarios to be modeled. In order to demonstrate the impacts of different approaches in the results of oil spill modeling, a case study is presented related to an offshore drilling activity.</jats:p>",

The electron heating events were located within magnetic holes/cavities/bubbles and were accompanied by nonlinear ± 14 nT peak-to-peak (f ~ 0.6 to 0.7 fcp) obliquely propagating proton cyclotron waves. The electrons appear to be heated isotropically. Electric bipolar pulse (electron hole) onset events were also detected within the heating events. We propose a scenario which can link the above phenomena. Nonlinear Alfvén waves, generated through cusp magnetic reconnection, propagate down magnetic field lines and locally heat electrons through the ponderomotive force. The magnetic cavity is created through the diamagnetic effect of the heated electrons. Ion heating also occurs through ponderomotive acceleration (but much less than the electrons) and the protons generate the electromagnetic proton cyclotron waves through the loss cone instability. The obliquely propagating electromagnetic proton cyclotron waves accelerate bi-streaming electrons, which are the source of free energy for the electron holes.\n                    </jats:p>"
