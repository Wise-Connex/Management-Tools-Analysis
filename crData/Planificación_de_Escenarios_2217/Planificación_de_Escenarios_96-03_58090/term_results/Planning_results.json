      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author draws on the distinctions between representations of space and spaces of representation contained in Lefebvre's Production of Space, and examines the postwar modernisation of Glasgow. In the first part of the paper he considers the images of the city presented in the city's two postwar master plans; one drawn up by central government, the other by local government. These two very different representations of the space of Glasgow as a modern city sparked off a political struggle over the making of the built environment which has left its imprint on the city's contemporary urban landscape. In the second part of the paper he uses the work of several Glasgow poets to illuminate the consequences of the modernisation process for the lived spaces of the city—the spaces of representation. The poets' reading of the modern city vividly illustrates the effects of the colonisation of concrete space by the abstract spaces of the master plans. Weaving together these two different, but closely related, discourses about the city—planning and poetry—he provides a specific example of the significance of Lefebvre's conceptual framework for making sense of the urban landscape of the modern city. </jats:p>",

In this paper we explore the relationship between land-use planning, the supply of housing land, and the supply and price of housing. It is based on two pieces of empirical research. In the first study, an investigation was conducted of the extent to which land supply, and particularly the operation of the planning system, had affected house prices in Britain during the 1980s, and how far planning had placed a constraint on land supply or simply reorganised that supply. In the follow-up study a single planning area was looked at to examine the extent to which increased land allocations in one area can compensate for constraints on land supply in another. We conclude that the planning system imposes significant costs, which include the exacerbation of price increases in periods of economic growth, but without being able to generate higher housing output during recession. In addition the planning system tends to foster a narrower range of housing types and densities than would be expected in its absence, and so restricts the choice available to consumers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the reasons why it is proving so difficult to implement enabling policies to make urban space more accessible for women and other disenabled groups, with particular reference to the provision of public toilets in Britain, are investigated. Toilet provision is described, and factors are identified which have contributed to the situation, with reference to the governmental, professional, and organisational context. Alternative approaches to implementation are considered and examples are drawn from North American zoning-based systems. Although land-use zoning has a reputation for being socially divisive it is argued that zoning ordinance systems can be used constructively as a means of achieving social provision such as toilet facilities. It is concluded that, although it is important to solve existing problems by modifying existing urban structures, a more radical reconceptualisation of the city is needed to meet the needs of the majority of its users. To achieve this there is a need for a change in the subcultural values of the decisionmakers and for governmental support. </jats:p>",

In addition, very little has been said about what specific planning processes would be most appropriate in supporting business activities that have exceptional opportunity for growth, given their positive results in the early experimentation phase. Ideally, innovative business activities, followed by the rapid expansion of successful experiments, will strengthen the core business of the firm. While the classical strategy process can do an adequate job within the context of an established business, different strategic planning processes are required in the early stages of development and rapid expansion. Each of these business contexts requires a strategy process tailored to its unique environment and issues.</jats:p>",

The experience acquired at the company’s considerable expense literally walks out of the door and the company has to replace the individual, often from outside. For organizations, job change, which has always been continuous, has been accelerating over the past decade as individuals switch their employer every six years. Even though most professionally managed companies run induction courses, most new managers will readily admit that the components that most inhibit their early passage to full productivity relate to understanding and accommodating their new employer’s individual corporate culture, management and communication styles, and the detail of recent events. Because of the difficulties of imparting such information, companies generally leave individuals to assimilate these intangibles as best they can, usually by osmosis. The evidence suggests that it can take 12 months ‐ and often much longer ‐ to become fully productive. Lack of continuity has an insidious effect on productivity and competitiveness. Outlines a cost‐effective solution to high job mobility.</jats:p>",

For almost fifty years the Mexican Oil Company dealt with volumetric targets and within an administration scheme very similar to any federal agency, instead of an international oil company, as it really is. A deep process of structural change started in 1990, aimed to maximize the assets economic value. Within this context, it became necessary to structure a financial planning scheme to monitor the huges investments of the industry, which projects are undertaken in a long term framework and the capital resources applied for those projects have a very important leverage in the Mexican economy. Despite several limitations that the Mexican Government still applies on PEMEX, mainly regarding budgeting and taxation, the Company has been developing a \"sui generis\" financial model to enable the top management to design mid and long term financial plans, taking into account the predefined strategies, objectives and targets. Considering that PEMEX is placed among the ten most important worldwide oil industries and also the greater flexibility on federal regulations, the Company is obliged to increase its financial planning efficiency in order to achieve the same operation level of other international oil industries.</jats:p>",

The proposed strategy is to rationalize these with regard to the forecast future growth of new services in the district. The strategy comprises an office scenario and three service depot scenarios. Options are tested using a form of cost‐benefit analysis. The disposal of surplus properties is to assist in realizing the strategy. Uses a case study of the office scenario to describe the financial analysis. The options include do nothing (i.e. continue to use the existing depots in several locations ‐ the status quo); lease single premises; buy premises (i.e. an existing building) and build new premises (i.e. buy a site and construct purpose‐built accommodation). The lease option and the buy option are illustrated. Employs after‐tax discounted cash flows to model initial costs, recurring costs (rentals where relevant, energy costs and other operating costs) and annual savings (reduced payroll due to operating efficiencies). Net present costs are calculated in order to rank the options and these results cleary show that the lease option is preferable to the buy option.</jats:p>",

When multiple robots collaborate to manipulate one object, a redundant system is formed. There are a number of trajectories that the system can follow. These can be described in Cartesian coordinate space by an <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>th order polynomial. This paper presents an optimisation method based on the Genetic Algorithms (GAs) which chooses the parameters of the polynomial, such that the execution time and the drive torques for the robot joints are minimized. With the robot's dynamic constraints taken into account, the pitimised trajectories are realisable. A case study with two planar-moving robots, each having three degrees of freedom, shows that the method is effective.</jats:p>",

But with hoshin management—a technique that links daily business activities with strategic objectives—that is changing. A number of world‐class organizations, such as Hewlett‐Packard, Intel, Milliken, Texas Instruments, Zytec, and Procter &amp; Gamble, are using this relatively new management system to steer their organizations toward success.</jats:p>",

A group of second year Bachelor of Education (Music) students and Diploma in Education (Music) students were placed in a local school under the supervision of their university specialist methods lecturer and were required to teach a specified lesson to a junior secondary class on three occasions. Before teaching these lessons, every preservice teacher was interviewed and asked to justify each of their planning decisions. Responses for the planning decisions at each stage of the study were grouped into categories. The results show that some categories of responses remained the same, while others changed throughout the study. The study also revealed that the preservice teachers operated on two sets of lesson agendas: the written agenda which was influenced by the university pedagogical programme, and the unwritten agenda influenced by the preservice teachers' beliefs about teaching.</jats:p>",

Although they consist of uniform elements, which interact only locally, cellular automata are capable of showing complex behavior. This property is exploited for solving path planning problems in workspaces with obstacles. A new automaton rule is presented which calculates simultaneously all shortest paths between a starting position and a target cell. Based on wave propagation, the algorithm ensures that the dynamics settles down in an equilibrium state which represents an optimal solution. Rule extensions include calculations with multiple starts and targets. The method allows applications on lattices and regular, weighted graphs of any finite dimension. In comparison with algorithms from graph theory or neural network theory, the cellular automaton approach has several advantages: Convergence towards optimal configurations is guaranteed, and the computing costs depend only linearly on the lattice size. Moreover, no floating-point calculations are involved. </jats:p>",

The paper describes the basic principles of a GA and the particular implementation developed. The code represents each plan in the population as two paired lists comprised of beam identifiers and relative weights. Reproduction operators, which mimic sexual reproduction with crossover, mutation, cloning, spontaneous generation, and death, manipulate the lists to grow optimal plans. The necessary gene pool is created by software modules which generate beams, distribute calculation points, obtain clinical constraints, add wedges, and calculate doses. The code has been tested on a set of artificial patients and on four clinical cases: prostate, pancreas, esophagus, and glomus. All demonstrated consistent results, indicating that the code is a reliable optimizer. Additional experiments compared the results for a full set of open beams to the geometrically selected set and the GA code with simulated annealing. Geometric selection of beam directions did not significantly compromise optimization quality. Compared to simulated annealing, the genetic algorithm was equally able to optimize the objective function, and calculations suggest it may be the faster method when the number of beams to be considered exceeds approximately 70.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within urban studies, attentiveness toward social and cultural heterogeneity has come to involve a critique of metaphors of the city's visibility, on account of the association of vision with particular technologies of power and domination. This critical posture sometimes includes an overgeneralization in which the city's visibility is imagined as a screen which excludes and opposes the heterogeneity of everyday life. The resulting dualism restricts our attentiveness to difference and performatively repositions the critical subject within the same theatre of representation we had hoped to avoid. Although the work of Michel de Certeau describes the theoretical schema which devolves this danger, that of Jean-François Lyotard indicates directions by which critical urban studies might imagine the city's visibility differently, avoiding false generalization, dualism, and the presumption of a critical position. Through Lyotard, critical urban studies may grasp the paradox of an immemorial visibility, which proposes an ever-present difference within, rather than beyond, representation and visibility. The idea of the city's immemorial visibility suggests alternatives to the current tendency to canonize the investigation of everyday life, pointing instead toward formal experimentation in our representation of cities and toward the investigation of specific technologies which target our urban vision. </jats:p>",

I illustrate these assertions through the analysis of four gentrification texts: academic, journalist, realtor, and gentrifier. I conclude that representations of gentrification and their expression through sites of difference need to be more nuanced or mobile, especially as many of these dualisms are becoming or can be displaced. A middle ground or space should be sought, for it is at the overlap and displacement of difference that the identity of gentrification is most traceable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is increasingly recognised that cartography is a contested practice, embedded within particular sets of power relations, and that maps are bound up with the production and reproduction of social life. The author begins by emphasising the importance of these issues for considering how the city has been mapped and represented through cartographic schemes, and draws on debates around the power and politics of mapping, and contentions that maps are ‘preeminently a language of power, not of protest’. However, it is argued that maps and mapping have not been entirely the preserve of the powerful, and the main part of the paper is devoted to examining some specific challenges to ‘official’ cartographies of the city. The author focuses on the radical art and political group, the Situationist International, and its avant-garde predecessors of the Lettrist International, who sought to appropriate urban maps and cartographic discourses and to develop a new form of ‘psychogeographical mapping’ during the 1950s and 1960s. The paper provides an account of their subversions, and an assessment of how their concerns might inform contemporary discussions on cartography and the mapping of urban space. </jats:p>",

First, I hope to use the concept of the palimpsest from historical geography as a stage on which other ways of portraying the city can be interrogated. These other envisionings I subsequently stage are the visions bound up in touristic sights, that is in the pictures used in and created by heritage displays; and the ‘dispersed memory’ of archive pictures, principally the Reece Winstone archive of Bristol By studying the connections and disjunctures in this triptych I hope to suggest the importance and complexity of technologies used to envisage the city. I try to suggest that pictures of the city cannot be used as naive documents to illustrate the passage of time—despite how often they are used to do this. Different senses of historicity are manufactured through the space—times created by different processes of envisioning the city. I suggest the interlinkage of these technologies echoes through a specifically urban ‘picturesque’ photography that coalesces a sensitivity to the passage of time with a detailed cognisance of the city in visual depictions of Bristol. </jats:p>",

This enables management to identify strategic portfolio units (SPUs) based on market interconnectedness, as well as competitive strength, and market attractiveness. SPUs incorporating market interconnectedness enable management to establish directions for future growth and determine how expansion or retraction of the portfolio in a given direction impacts other portfolio units. Opportunities to leverage core competencies across portfolio units in international markets and to reconfigure portfolio units and operations so as to achieve greater synergies can also be identified. </jats:p>",

New requests for bookings of elective surgery arrive each day. Such procedures preferably would be performed as soon as possible, but admitting too many patients may result in exceeding a day's capacity, possibly necessitating turning away some emergency cases. So the problem facing the hospital at the start of each day is how many of the additional requests for elective surgery to assign for that day. We provide a stochastic dynamic programming model for this aggregate advance scheduling problem. The model has some novel mathematical features. We analyze it and characterize the nature of the optimal policy, which is not necessarily of a control-limit type. Plausible numerical examples which confirm our theoretical results and provide additional insights are reported. </jats:p>",

Management of energy demand is, therefore, a central concern of environmental policymakers. But how does local environmental policy actually shape local energy-management practices? Rather than analysing how the intensity of energy flows are shaped by institutions and regulatory forces, makers of local environmental policy have tended to adopt a ‘rational’ modelling approach, increasingly divorced from the operational realities of the restructured energy sector. Such an approach misses the way in which privatised utility companies are now reaching ‘beyond the meter’ in order to manage local energy consumption actively. In this way privatised utilities are emerging as important regulators of energy flows in the territories they serve. Local environmental policy is largely bypassed in this process. Policymakers therefore need to acknowledge the role of regional energy companies as key energy managers and to coordinate local energy policy accordingly. </jats:p>",

Starting from the first attempts to measure the vulnerability component of risk (the latter given as the combination of hazard and vulnerability) which have been carried out in Italy but which considered only single buildings, the method used until now is broadened to take into account also the vulnerability of the subsystems which are part of regional systems as well as social and economic vulnerabilities. Some important parameters have been identified to evaluate these vulnerabilities, and put in a framework which aids the assessment of overall regional and urban vulnerability. According to the authors’ opinion such a framework can be very useful in addressing planners’ and public administrators’ decisions both on preventive strategies and during the preparation of reconstruction plans. This framework has been applied to a small seismic settlement in Lombardy, Toscolano Maderno.</jats:p>",

Consensus specifies a methodology by which agents exchange information indicating their preferred actions, integrate these different sets of actions, resolve any conflicts that exist, and choose a joint set of actions. Within the framework of the Consensus protocol, two different heuristics are proposed for resolving conflicts which overcome the computational complexity of an exhaustive search. An implementation of the Consensus protocol is analyzed experimentally to assess its performance in resolving conflicts. The experimental results indicate the trade-off between the cost of planning and the quality of the plan produced with respect to the heuristics used for resolving conflicts. </jats:p>",

It is found that, geographically, foreign manufacturing investment clusters in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, with Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, and Shantou as the secondary centers of concentration. Sectorally, investment from Hong Kong is concentrated in the electronics, garment, and textiles industries, whereas investment from other countries is centered in electronics, construction materials, transport equipment, and chemical industries. Foreign manufacturing investment in Guangdong is directed at a diverse array of activities, of which a significant amount involves work that is technologically similar to that conducted in the source countries. These beneficial impacts are attributable primarily to the extensive production decentralization from Hong Kong, the social affinity between Hong Kong and the Zhujiang Delta, the ability of the state to control foreign investment flows, and the entrepreneurship and ingenuity of individual locales in the province. The impacts are especially concentrated in the Shenzhen region. This region, along with the Foshan and Guangzhou regions, is likely to become a major industrial district in Pacific Asia. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the influence of macrosocietal shifts on municipal reforms in metropolitan areas, as reflected by the cyclic swing from periods of increased efforts to rationalize metropolitan governance to periods of acceptance and promotion of a fragmented pattern, is demonstrated. An analogy between the changes in industrial organization and municipal organization is suggested. The paper is focused on Israel's economic core region—the Tel Aviv metropolis—with surveys of reports of commissions dealing with municipal reforms and of boundary commissions assessing claims for municipal boundary changes between 1960 and 1993. A unique feature of Tel Aviv is the region's past failure to implement proposals for major rationalization during a period when such reforms were common in countries with similar political systems. This failure was a result of specific political and geographical factors that counterbalanced the broad processes that supported reform. The subsequent period of economic stagnation weakened prospects for comprehensive reforms. Renewed growth in the 1990s has intensified pressures for municipal change but has not been associated with the comeback of old notions of metropolitan government. Rather, flexible modes of cooperation and coordination appear to be preferred, priority being given to reorganizing local government in the urban—rural fringes of the metropolis rather than dealing with the inner parts of the metropolis. </jats:p>",

Often one site may be protected by a multitude of designations. However, international designations are commonly implemented through national mechanisms. Using the Forvie Sands and Ythan Estuary area of northeast Scotland as an example, we review the effectiveness of multiple environmental designations. After an examination of existing and proposed designations for the study area, overlaps and loopholes in environmental protection are identified. We conclude that protection from more than one designation may either afford the site additional protection or emphasise the importance of the site at different levels; local, national, and international. The principal loophole relates to unregulated activities undertaken beyond the designated site which may have an adverse effect on the protected area. Possible solutions include extending the designation to include the sources of the threat or to combine an appropriate designation strategy with effective regulation of the threat itself. In developing designation strategies, environmental protection agencies should consider these options. </jats:p>",

However, despite some notable exceptions, researchers have been wary to approach this topic empirically. This paper represents an empirical attempt to try to unravel the impact on economic performance of what has been one of the most significant processes of institutional change in Western Europe in the past few decades—the regionalisation process—by taking the case of Spain, one of the countries where the shift from a highly centralised to a decentralised structure has been most profound. Results show that, at least in the early stages, the emergence of the Spanish regional state has had slightly beneficial effects on the relative growth performance of regions achieving the greatest level of autonomy when compared with their growth rates in the high point of Spanish centralism. Nevertheless, it is still too early to assert whether this positive influence will be a long-lasting one or can be attributed mainly to the dynamics of institutional change and, thus, will wane with time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Historically, citizen input into the capital budgeting planning and project selection process has been sporadic and often limited to the most politically-attentive, “connected” individuals and groups. The near-sightedness of such an approach has become apparent as the public’s cynicism toward government has intensified, along with its reticence to support bond referenda, and its propensity to file equity-oriented lawsuits criticizing capital project decisions. To combat these problems, local governments across the U.S. are broadening constituent involvement in their capital budget process, especially at the front-end where possible projects are identified and selected for inclusion in the capital improvement plan. This article examines the four major approaches that are being utilized: decentralizing public hearings; using community-wide public opinion surveys to gauge public support for various projects and revenue-raising options; expanding citizen access and input to, and feedback from, government interactive data bases; and creating more formalized roles for citizens on capital budget planning committees. Each of these approaches has its own assets and liabilities which are delineated.</jats:p>",

Wildavsky's model of budgetary behaviour for ‘poor and uncertain’ budget makers is applied to explain the financial decisions of local authorities in the circumstances of postcommunist transition. The scope of independence of local budgeting is examined in both countries with regard to legal restrictions on municipal revenues and expenditures and also in regard to the relationship between local government and the intermediary level of state administration. Two hypotheses are tested concerning the capital expenditures of the municipal governments under study. The first seeks to explain the impact of state grants on the level of municipal investments, depending on the way they are distributed—directly from the centre or through the district offices. The second hypothesis concerns the consequences of electoral rules on budgetary decisions of the respective councils. At the end, a map of municipal incomes is produced for each country, both reflecting the west—cast gradient of modernization. </jats:p>",

In this paper, dynamic wedge fields that are produced by moving one of the collimator blocks during irradiation are studied. Since these wedge fields differ from those of mechanical wedges, certain requirements are to be met on the treatment planning system. A pencil‐beam‐based treatment planning system that uses the resultant energy fluence distribution from the dynamic collimator movement has been extensively reviewed. In calculations, the system treats the dynamic collimated field as a single, modulated field that yields calculation times close to those for open beams. Details are given on the theoretical model used for the calculation of dynamically generated dose distributions. Measurements of depth doses, profiles, and output factors in dynamic wedge fields indicate that calculations accurately predict the outcome from dynamic wedges without any additional measurements other than those used for characterization of static open beams.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the detailed patterns of British property valuation and local revenue raising under the council tax are compared with those prevailing under the domestic rates. The results of matching individual council-tax valuations with rateable values for the 47000 domestic properties that make up the Inner Area of Cardiff, Wales, are reported. A geographical information system is used to identify the disaggregate pattern of properties which have been assigned higher or lower relative values after the abolition of the domestic rates. The findings are seen as significant in describing the intraurban geography of property values in Britain: properties constructed by local authorities now attract significantly lower relative valuations; pre-1919 private-sector housing is now more highly valued; and different construction types (for example, purpose-built flats, converted flats, and ends of terraces) attract quite different valuations under the two regimes. Overall, the distribution of rateable values vis-à-vis that of council-tax bands is likely to have had a multifaceted effect upon local revenue raising, and the authors begin to explore its changed geography in some detail. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an analysis of the effects of suburbanisation processes on the finances of cities in West Germany, taking the metropolitan area of Bremen as an example. The main thesis is that, under the present socioeconomic conditions, the German system of public finance and public responsibilities has led to a growing gap between the financial situations of central cities and of their surrounding communities in urban agglomerations. For the purpose of describing the differences in developments in the central city of Bremen and its suburban area, the main local tax revenues, as well as some indicators of ‘fiscal stress’, and their developments between 1982 and 1992 were analysed. The empirical results verify a significant shift of economic and financial strength to the suburban belt during the period under investigation. Although since the beginning of the 1970s a severe imbalance between the development of revenue and of expenditure needs has generated a dramatic budget situation in Bremen, in the surrounding communities in Lower Saxony budgetaty situations were sound in every respect. Similar processes, which have led to a relative weakness of revenues and increasing debts, have been observed in other central cities in Germany. Obviously the negative effect of suburbanisation processes on the financial situation of the central city is not a problem specific to Bremen. Generally, the larger cities are convinced that their functions for the hinterland and the resulting burdens have not been adequately taken into account in the systems of municipal finance and fiscal equalisation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Optical coordinate measurement systems will benefit from developments similar to those taking place in robots, namely off-line programming capability and intelligent sensors. Research work towards these goals is reported here. An experimental system with CAD model-based measurement planning and vision control has been constructed and its feasibility demonstrated. The system comprises a measurement planning tool, a measurement robot with vision guidance and a means of visualizing and comparing the measured results with the design data. The measurement planning tool is based on a commercial CAD system and enables the use of existing CAD models of the objects to be measured as a basis for planning. It generates a measurement model file (MMF) containing instructions for controlling the measurement robot, which is an optical coordinate measurement device based on the laser rangefinder principle and supplemented with a vision system for guiding the measurement to planned target points. The measured coordinate values can be compared with design values either graphically or numerically. The performance of the experimental system was demonstrated and evaluated. In the demonstration case a measurement sequence was planned and saved in the form of a MMF, whereupon the measurement robot was able to execute the sequence reliably according to the MMF and measure the planned target points with vision guidance. The pointing repeatability of the vision guidance function was 0.019 mRad (standard deviation), which is equal to 0.19 mm at a distance of 10 meters, and the corresponding pointing accuracy was better than 0.04 mRad. The 3D measurement had an average repeatability of 0.3 mm (standard deviation), and the absolute accuracy of averaged measurement results was better than ±1 mm (for x, y and z) in 81% of the cases. The next phase of the work will include piloting the system in an industrial application. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The construction of social indices to compare local areas from census and other data has an important influence on the allocation of public resources. There has been debate in past years on the choice of variables for such indices and on the means used to combine percentages measured for more than one variable. More recently the percentage and its z-score have given way to the signed χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic as a more appropriate means of identifying concentrations of need. In this paper the relative merits of the signed χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic, the percentage, and the raw count are discussed in relation to two separate objectives in resource allocation: identification of concentrations of need (geographic targeting) and calculation of local budgets (resource distribution). The signed χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic is shown to overcome disadvantages of the percentage when identifying high concentrations of need but entails its own disadvantages. It is arbitrary in its construction, its ranking of areas is dependent on the choice of a reference area, and it is misleading for areas of low concentration of need. These conclusions apply both to comparison of large local areas such as local authority districts and to comparison of small areas within a locality. Alternatives are discussed. </jats:p>",
