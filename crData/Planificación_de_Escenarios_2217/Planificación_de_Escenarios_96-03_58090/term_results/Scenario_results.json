      "abstract": "<jats:p> The glacial record has shown that atmospheric methane concentrations have fluctuated in the past, particularly during the Bølling-Allerød interstadial. We used an inverse photochemical carbon- cycle model to interpret the magnitude of effect that glacial-interglacial atmospheric methane variations have on the global carbon cycle. The results of this modelling suggest that an observed variation in atmospheric <jats:sup> 14</jats:sup>C during this time period may be the result of oxidation of the increased atmospheric methane. We re-examine methane clathrate in palaeosols as a potential source of the methane, and the influence of deglaciation and subsequent heat transport from advecting groundwater in these sediments may be a plausible mechanism by which atmospheric CH4 concentrations abruptly increased during the Bølling-Allerød. </jats:p>",

M. Nevins et al., Proceedings of the International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, Würzburg, 1992 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1992), Vol. 3, p. 279]. A distinguishing feature of this study is that we use a theoretically derived transport model that has been empirically calibrated against Ohmic, low-confinement and high-confinement mode discharges from seven different tokamaks. Heating and deposition profiles predicted by the ACCOME current drive and magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium code [R. S. Devoto et al., Nucl. Fusion 32, 773 (1992)] are incorporated into the time-dependent BALDUR one-and-one-half dimensional transport code [C. E. Singer et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 49, 275 (1988)]. We consider various scenarios of fast wave, lower hybrid, and neutral beam heating and current drive and evaluate the effects on the evolution of density and temperature profiles.</jats:p>",

During the Last Glaciation Maximum, at ca. 18 ka BP, both the Weddell and the Ross Gyres as well as near‐coastal circulations probably lost their importance in the maintenance of Antarctic krill populations due to cooling of the water column and development of multi‐year sea ice. Within the ACC at that time, some smaller‐scale circulations related to islands and seamounts could have played a major role in controlling krill distribution. If, nevertheless. refugia for self‐maintained krill populations remained in the near‐coastal zone, particularly in the eastern Indian sector, geographical isolation might have caused divergence between the two species of the gregarine <jats:italic>Cephaloidophora</jats:italic> commonly infesting krill at present.</jats:p>",
