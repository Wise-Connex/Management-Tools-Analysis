The model has two components: coordination of buildings and spaces, and standardization among cities. A variety of coordinated arrangements of buildings reflect urban planning, including simple coordination, formality and monumentality, orthogonal layouts, other forms of geometric order, and access and visibility (view-shed). Standardization among cities is analyzed in terms of architectural inventories, spatial patterns, orientation, and metrology. The political and social significance of ancient urban planning is then discussed using Amos Rapoport's model of levels of meaning in the built environment. </jats:p>",

This article describes how public restrooms have historically discriminated by class, race, physical ability, sexual orientation, as well as gender. It examines how public restrooms pose special health and safety problems for women, men, children, elderly, persons with disabilities, and caregivers. It chronicles potty parity legislation, examining impacts of and backlash from recent laws. It presents new developments signaling a growing international movement and a quiet restroom revolution: the newly formed World Toilet Organization, American Restroom Association, increased family and unisex restrooms, and technological inventions such as automatic self-cleaning public toilets. It proposes innovative solutions about how twenty-first-century public restrooms can make cities more livable; offers roles for planners, designers, and civic officials, and suggests new research directions. Sources include an extensive literature review of relevant legal research, scholarly publications, and media coverage.</jats:p>",

In effect, we challenge what has traditionally been regarded as the essence of strategic or ‘forward’ planning: the plan as a statement of what the city ought to become. Using Lacanian-inspired analysis we seek to understand how urban issues may be identified as metaphorical deficiencies or illnesses, to which planners apply a therapeutic salve in the form of strategic policies. Turning to the psychological utopianism of Ernst Bloch, a Freudian-inspired predecessor of Lacan, we suggest a way forward in Bloch's immanent transcendent conceptualisation of hope. We suggest replacement of the transcendent term ‘utopian’ by ‘utopic’, as a practice which is critical, inclusive, and dynamic; performative rather than normative. </jats:p>",

The article begins by illustrating the complex nature of these phenomena, noting variation in the types of facilities considered LULUs, the range of participants who exhibit NIMBY responses, and the varied manner in which these phenomena have been described. The focus of the article then moves to the influence of perceptions relative to NIMBY and methods available to respond to NIMBY concerns. The article summarizes research in these areas with the purpose of reminding us of what we know about NIMBY and LULU phenomena and what continues to challenge planning practitioners. The literature review points to research opportunities and the need to integrate the findings of previously distinct areas of inquiry to inform planning practice.</jats:p>",

Penn Center clearly demonstrated that local planners lacked the political, legal, and financial tools to control urban redevelopment projects implemented by private actors. Such constraints help to explain why even housing-oriented liberal officials such as those in Philadelphia supported the broadening of federal urban redevelopment legislation beyond its original “primarily residential” orientation. </jats:p>",

Payoff functions are introduced, and strategic forms of versions of Duel and Russian Roulette illustrate the idea. Matrices and vectors are reviewed because of their use with payoff matrices. Strong and weak domination are defined. The iterated deletion of dominated strategies is illustrated using the game of Duel. The iterated deletion of dominated strategies is related to backward induction. Problems of credibility and commitment are discussed in the context of subgame-perfect equilibria in simple Cournot and Stackelberg games. The application of subgame-perfect equilibria is discussed when players may only be boundedly rational.</jats:p>",

Many of these areas such as planning involve decision making by public authorities who will be directly affected by equality legislation and must act compatibly with the protections contained in the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’).It is necessary to consider in any particular area how the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA 1998’), the Equality Act 2006 (‘EA 2006’) and the Race Relations Act 1976 (‘RRA 1976’) may affect the legal framework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many societies have made the transition from high mortality and large family sizes to settings where most children survive, small families are desired, and most people control their fertility. In the early 1960s, the average woman could expect to have almost five children over her life, but now she can expect to have fewer than three children. The conscious use of contraception and abortion to control fertility thus assumes paramount importance in explaining basic aspects of contemporary human society. However, substantial differences exist in fertility and contraceptive levels and access to services between developed and developing regions of the world. For example, while in more developed regions women now have fewer than two children on average and nearly 7 in 10 women in marital or consensual unions use contraceptives (mainly sterilization, the pill, or the male condom), women in Africa have about five children on average and fewer than 3 in 10 women in marital or consensual unions use contraceptives (mainly the pill, injectables, and implants) (United Nations 2004). Other factors such as social structure, culture, gender relations, and economic opportunities also contribute to these regional differences.</jats:p>"

Drillstring washouts in particular create a problematic situation in an ER drilling operation, as it necessary to spend extensive time circulating and rotating at high rates to sufficiently clean a high angle wellbore to a level that allows a safe and trouble free trip1,2,3. When a washout occurs prior to the completion of the cleanup process (which they almost always do), the operator is faced with a difficult choice: a.) continue to circulate until the hole is clean, running the risk of enlarging the washout and potentially creating a twist-off, or b.) attempt to pull out of a dirty hole, which may (and often does) result in tight hole and/or stuck pipe.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A case history is presented where a drillstring washout occurred on a long extended reach well prior to the completion of the cleanup process. Attempts to trip the string proved futile, and it became apparent that the string would probably become stuck during further attempts to pull out of the hole. A modified version of the traditional backoff technique was safely used to separate the pipe below the washout without the drillstring actually being stuck. The entire string was subsequently recovered, saving &amp;gt;13MM NOK (2MM USD) in lost time and equipment. This is believed to be the first ever successful backoff of a free drillstring.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasingly, foreign contacts are a daily fact of life for many companies. It is therefore remarkable that little to no empirical research has been conducted into the language policy applied by such organizations. Companies with transnational contacts are generally assumed to use English throughout the world as a “lingua franca,” yet whether this is actually the case is questionable. In a multicultural Europe that is striving to unite, there may well be other languages that could qualify as the international language of choice. Research is needed to investigate which language or languages are chosen, by whom the choice is made and why, in certain situations, speakers switch to different languages. This article focuses on the report of an empirical study addressing these aspects. A case study of a Dutch parent company that runs a holiday centre in Germany is presented in order to analyse micro-level interactions which can only be understood by considering the language choice as a result of the way in which the environment is “enacted.” For this analysis, use was made of an interview conducted with the Dutch head of the human resources department, along with transcripts of audio-recorded conversations, and also documents such as the mission statement.</jats:p>",

In developing this point, I argue that, although notions of dwelling and comfort are key to Utopia and architecture, the ‘unhomely’ and ‘unsettling’, which also appear in aspects of thought on performativity, are a crucial and as-yet greatly underscrutinised part of thinking about Utopia. I attempt to question what we consider ‘good’ or desirable, and hence to enlarge the frame of what we consider ‘utopian’. Through this, I consider the potential beginnings of an extended uncanny Utopian ethics. </jats:p>",

It outlines the larger context of this debate and identifies its protagonists and the main issues at stake in it. In addition, it presents an interpretive scheme for the analysis of the variety of approaches that have so far been developed within this field. This scheme relates these approaches back to two clashes of different language ideologies. The first clash is between instrumentalism and constitutivism. The second clash is between transparency and hybridity. Finally, the paper explains why the sociolinguistic literature on language policy should interest political philosophers, and vice versa: why sociolinguists should engage with political philosophy.</jats:p>",

Since the majority of PM tasks requires that equipment be stopped, these tasks can generally only be performed during nonproduction shifts, breaks, or other scheduled downtime. Thus, there is a trade-off between time dedicated to production and time available for preventive maintenance. One approach to mitigate this trade-off is to perform maintenance during scheduled production time by strategically shutting down equipment for short time periods. This research developed a systematic method on when to shut down equipment to do maintenance in an automotive assembly environment. It is called maintenance opportunity. The method incorporated real-time information about production and machine failure conditions. A simulation-based algorithm is developed by utilizing the buffer contents as well as machine starvation and congestion to obtain maintenance opportunities during production time.</jats:p>",

The backdrop to this engagement is an emerging diagram of the molecular processes and pathways in which affect is implicated. The emergence of this diagram not only foregrounds the importance of thinking critically about how affect is caught up in a range of techniques and technologies: it also raises the question of how to attend to molecular affects—and their implication in the matter and movement of thinking—without falling back upon a kind of biological or physiological reductionism. I provide a provisional answer to this question. In doing so I draw support from a range of thinkers, including Lucretius, Spinoza, Deleuze, and Guattari, each of whom points to the possibility of cultivating a kind of molecular logic of sense. In moving towards a conclusion, I speculate about how this logic productively complicates the thinking space of human geography. </jats:p>",

There is a lack of understanding of why\nthis works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of\nproblem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the\ncost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of\nstructure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0\nand 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International\nPlanning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of\nSAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted\nsynthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and\nthat are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search\nspace. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure.\nThe CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the\nlength of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the\nbest possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of\nstructure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of\nbranching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential\nlower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of\nvariables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations\n(and backdoors), showing a doubly exponential gap between the two structural\nextreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments --\nilluminate the prototypical patterns of structure causing the empirical\nbehavior observed in the competition benchmarks.</jats:p>"

The primary objective of this research is to provide realistic models to optimize vehicle dispatching when customer locations and demands vary from day to day while maintaining driver familiarity with their service territories, hence dispatch consistency. The objective of increasing driver familiarity tends to make routes or service territories fixed. On the other hand, to serve varying demand it is advantageous to reassign vehicles/drivers and service territories each day. To balance the trade-offs between these two objectives, we developed the concepts of “cell,” “core area,” and “flex zone,” and created a two-stage vehicle routing model—strategic core area design and operational cell routing—and explicitly evaluated the effect of driver familiarity through the use of learning and forgetting curves. </jats:p>",

The discussion fixes on three objects located within the park which play an important role in the representation of the site's past despite being labelled as ‘noncontributing’ in the site's National Historic Landmark's nomination. The biographies of a bronze bell, a granite monument, and a group of wax mannequins as sketched out here suggest novel ways to be sensitive to the many and often unexpected contributions brought by the materiality of an object in practices of remembrance. </jats:p>",

However, relying on local capacity opens up the possibility of establishing highly uneven management practices. The purpose of this paper is to explore the roots and effects of uneven environmental management. I develop a conceptual framework that identifies key elements of regional environmental-management regimes and then use it to compare experiences in two areas designated as Canadian biosphere reserves in 2000: Clayoquot Sound, BC, and Redberry Lake, SK. Analysis reveals that differences in property instruments and civic sectors affect the institutional capacity of each locality, opening the door for private forms of environmental governance in Redberry Lake. To explain how property instruments and civic actors operate, I illustrate how processes associated with property exchange, reterritorialization, valuation, and planning work together to produce a relatively robust and public regime at Clayoquot Sound and a more private form of stewardship at Redberry Lake. In consequence, uneven environmental-management practices may take root and reinforce social inequalities across the two regions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I demonstrate the analytical potential of the concept of hybridity for understanding localized agrofood networks, that is, production systems whose products are embedded in the history, geography, and culture of a particular place and community. I use the notion of hybridity as a way of describing how local producers do not necessarily follow one specific production logic, whether of scale or variety. The research shows that they exchange, borrow, absorb, and appropriate practices, technologies, knowledge, and conventions from all available models of production. The nature and the extent of the exchange, and thus of hybridization, vary according to the nature of the product, to the position a particular firm occupies within the network, and ultimately, to individual and collective conceptions of how production can and should be organized. The specific ways that firms coordinate transactions between one another and how they develop relations with markets also reflect the producers' choices among different models of organization. Hybridity matters in relation to rural development policies. The entry of local food products into modern marketplaces through a series of intermediate steps, some modern, some traditional, opens up an opportunity to rethink the alleged opposition between industrial and artisan production within localized food networks. As I will show, between industrial and artisan producers, objectives may diverge, but there can also be strong positive exchange. Although industrial producers link up with buyers by serving increasingly wide, even global, markets, artisan producers help retain expertise within the territory of production, anchoring the product deeper into the culture, history, and geography of the area. Institutional actors should recognize and enhance such synergies apart and beyond the technical aspects of production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, a day‐ahead planning algorithm for a multi‐reservoir hydropower system coordinated with wind power is developed. Coordination applies to real situations, where wind power and hydropower are owned by different utilities, sharing the same transmission lines, although hydropower has priority for transmission capacity. Coordination is thus necessary to minimize wind energy curtailments during congestion situations. The planning algorithm accounts for the uncertainty of wind power forecast. Only planning for the spot market is considered. Once the production bid is placed on the market, it cannot be changed. The solution of the stochastic optimization problem should, therefore, fulfill the transmission constraints for all wind power production scenarios. An evaluation algorithm is also developed to quantify the impact from the coordinated planning in the long run. The developed planning algorithm and the evaluation algorithm are applied in a case study. The results are compared with uncoordinated operation. The results of the case study show that coordination with wind power brings additional income to the hydropower utility and leads to significant reduction of wind energy curtailments.

It involves finding lines and corresponding frequencies in a transport network such that a given travel demand can be satisfied. There are (at least) two objectives: the transport company wishes to minimize operating costs, and the passengers want to minimize traveling times. We propose a new multicommodity flow model for line planning. Its main features, in comparison to existing models, are that the passenger paths can be freely routed and lines are generated dynamically. We discuss properties of this model, investigate its complexity, and present a column-generation algorithm for its solution.

Because both gender and disability status impact the postsecondary trajectories of young adults, helping young women with LD meet the demands of adulthood, including responding to opportunities for self-determination, is a salient issue. Using qualitative interview data and analysis, this study examined the perceptions of adolescent females with LD regarding self-determination during transition. Findings indicated that participants perceived they were self-determining individuals, yet several key component skills necessary for self-determination were missing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Community participation has become the new orthodoxy within urban regeneration policy in the UK. Yet, it remains a perennial problem for policymakers, especially at the neighbourhood level. A major reason for this, it is argued, is that policymakers often set up local partnerships with insufficient knowledge of the ‘culture’ (i.e. structure, processes, practices, relations and agents) of the neighbourhoods and communities they seek to regenerate and involve in decision-making. Furthermore, policymakers also lack a critically reflective understanding of their own cultural practices. It is argued that collaborative planning theory and applied ethnography offer policymakers a way forward in realising more effective community participation. Collaborative planning and applied ethnography provide a governance and methodological framework that have the potential to promote inclusionary argumentation and consensus building, and give partnership stakeholders an opportunity to become more aware and critically reflective of their cultural relations, practices and processes, thus paving the way forward for more effective community participation. </jats:p>",

In this paper I look at interactions between travelers and locals that reveal differing spatial imaginaries of ‘modernity’, and at how these reflect and produce different narratives of who is modern and where modernity exists. By using ethnographic material, I examine discursive and material interactions surrounding modernity through the examples of travelers' practices of photography, dress, and knowledge of Muslim women's veiling. In this paper I look to a located, gendered, and particular expression of an Islamic modernity, one that embraces improvements in quality of life that modern technologies of health care, agricultural production, and sanitation may bring, and which simultaneously embraces nonsecular ways of being in the world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper begins as an investigation of the spatiality of the state in Turkey. In everyday life the state is experienced and recognized through a multiplicity of sites, agents, institutions, techniques, and regulatory capacities. Given this fragmentation, I ask how it is that the state is conceptualized as having a reality beyond its incoherence. Through a discursive analysis of focus-group discussions with lower-class and lower-middle-class men and women in Istanbul, I trace the spatial–temporal techniques through which state power is enacted. I argue that this power operates through referral and deferral, circulation and arrest; it is the power both to set in motion and to suspend the circulation of people, documents, money, and influence that marks out the space–time of the state. Further, my reading of focus-group texts suggests that it is through the operation of the space–time of the state that individuals both submit to state power and become subjects of rights—that is, citizens. At once establishing the authority of the state and the self-recognition of the subject, the Althusserian turn towards the law is a gesture of conscience or guilt. However, I argue that not all subjects are equally guilty in their imagined relationship to the state, some are more guilty than others, and, in this inequality, difference enters into the process of subjection. Focus-group participants discuss how acts such as showing identity cards or performing labor function both to assert their innocence and to mark them as guilty. By tracing out how spatial techniques of power and processes of subjection are discussed among particular groups of people in Istanbul, I hope to speak in an alternative voice to the usual top-down narration of the Turkish ‘strong state’. Finally, this paper is an attempt to wrap an argument around the secret of the state, around the desire, despair, and guilt that infuse the relational production of citizen and state. </jats:p>",

Both policies affect European utilities considerably. As a consequence, only those utilities that can produce electricity with cost-efficient and environment-friendly technologies will gain a comparative market advantage. The author investigates the impacts of the European energy and climate policy initiatives on the electricity market. It emerges that emissions trading leads to higher electricity prices and triggers a substitution process—from the use of coal to the use of gas and renewable technologies. Both policies have complementary effects, but only because the electricity market is not yet fully competitive. </jats:p>",

The engagement of two leading international design firms—Renzo Piano Building Workshop and Foster and Partners—by Australian developers for new Sydney office towers (Aurora Place and 126 Phillip Street, respectively) is analyzed in detail. I identify three areas where the design of office buildings is seen to make a commercial difference: in lubricating the planning-approval process in sensitive urban contexts; in adding value to the building through reconciling urban context and architectural form with commercial development rationalities; and in selling the interior space of the building to prospective commercial tenants. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors sketch a framework within which the contributions to this theme issue can be understood. In particular, they discuss various frames of reference or ways of thinking that can be brought to bear on the challenges that arise in evaluating attempts to govern environmental risks. The discussion is divided into three sections. First, they discuss the factors that have led to the emergence of new ways of governing those corporate activities that are associated with the generation or management of environmental risks. Second, they problematise these new forms of governance, adopting the United Nation's Global Compact as an example, and drawing particularly on the insights derived from the contrasting perspectives associated with communicative and strategic action. As an alternative to both of these perspectives, they next focus on the Foucauldian concept of governmentality. The need for analyses to consider (a) the nature of the ways in which different risks are problematised, (b) the character of different governance regimes, (c) the significance of the organising ideals that guide the operation, and (d) the evolution of the multidimensional processes through which risks are governed, are highlighted. They conclude by suggesting that new ‘governmental technologies’ are unlikely to enable either ‘governance at a distance’, for instance, by creating opportunities for new forms of engagement and new spaces of accountability, or ‘governance of the self’, for example, by instilling values and developing technologies which allow corporations to govern their own activities more effectively. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with discourses of threat and security deployed by the United States and India after September 11. In the context of the United States these discourses have been used to justify war in Afghanistan and in Iraq and have revolved around the subject of the Muslim male as perpetually dangerous. Eager to support the United States in its war against terror, India echoed the construction of the Muslim male as dangerous, which served to fulfill India's own internal and regional supremacy agendas. Bolstered, therefore, by the emerging discourse of Muslim terrorists, in 2002 the Hindu Right was complicit in orchestrating genocide against Muslims in Gujarat where 2000 Muslims were killed and 150000 Muslims were rendered homeless. Examining these and other incidents, I examine the similarity in discourses of threat and security deployed by the United States and India. I argue that the similarity in discourses emerges because of a particular understanding of time and space. I make two interconnected arguments: first, time and the very understanding and construction of history are distorted, collapsed, and twisted such that revenge for past atrocities and the threat of future ones are used to justify preemptive military action. Second, there is a particular geography to this doctrine of threat and security that is being established by demarcating us against them. This new spatial arrangement is being formed contingent on a particular understanding of time and history as a linear singular narrative and on the creation of political alliances between India, the United States, and Israel. </jats:p>",

Yet how well these vocabularies actually adhere to personal practice is something which could be better explored. Recent accounts of consumption, meanwhile, are committed to closely observed contextual experience. Yet, physical things can seem somewhat subdued in these accounts. With these ideas in mind, in this paper I align a geographical embrace of material vitality and an in-depth approach to practised consumption. I report on a period of ethnographic work with seven garden centres in London to reconsider the ways in which contemporary urbanites encounter the items on sale there. In the London garden centre there are some different ways of approaching life and some changing cultures of control, as the rumbling agencies that certain products purvey are both openly enjoyed and nervously negated. Exploring the unease associated with this situation and its impact upon personal behaviour and physical format, I reflect, in particular, on the current experience of plants. The conclusion that follows is potentially perverse as, although we can benefit from being with life, it seems that, in certain city spaces at least, we now deal better with that which is more dead. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although economic-geographical research has recently been the subject of ‘cultural’, ‘institutional’, and ‘relational’ turns that stress the situated, relational, and embedded nature of economic activity, these concerns are usually elaborated through analyses of industrial, not financial, circuits of capital. In this paper I address the neglect of the financial elements of production networks by exploring the geographies of some of the financial practices of a group of microbusinesses in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter. I argue that the Jewellery Quarter is an important financial space for these firms and illustrate how their production regimes are produced and reproduced through different spatiotemporal financial relationships with suppliers, customers, and financial intermediaries. By contrast with the undersocialised treatments of agency that predominate in firm finance literatures in economics and finance, I illustrate the situated, idiosyncratic, and often very personal nature of the financial knowledges, practices, and networks that reproduce these firms. This financial ‘cut’ through the Jewellery Quarter treats firm finances as integral to firm behaviours and strategy and uses this vantage point to assess the potentials and predicaments facing these firms that are regarded as strategically important for the future of the Quarter. </jats:p>",

In contexts with price‐sensitive demands, economies of scale in production, and multiple capacity options, such integrated planning problems can quickly become complex. To address these complexities, this paper provides profit‐maximizing production planning models for determining optimal demand and internal production capacity levels under price‐sensitive deterministic demands, with subcontracting and overtime options. The models determine a producer's optimal price, production, inventory, subcontracting, overtime, and internal capacity levels, while accounting for production economies of scale and capacity costs through concave cost functions. We use polyhedral properties and dynamic programming techniques to provide polynomial‐time solution approaches for obtaining an optimal solution for this class of problems when the internal capacity level is time‐invariant. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The focal figure is Marietta Pallis (1882–1963), ecologist and artist, who rented and then owned the marshland property of Long Gores, Hickling. In this paper we consider Pallis and friends' engagement with land and its management, their relationship to the locality as residents and employers of servants, and their literary consideration of local culture in terms of architecture and dialect. We emphasise the currencies of the local informing their actions, and reactions to them, and the related geographies of private life. Pallis and friends' relationship to land, their relationship to people, and their commentary on local character and identity make sense through and foster geographies of local life. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although recognition of the significance of gender divisions continues to transform economic geography, the discipline nevertheless remains highly uneven in its degree of engagement with gender as a legitimate focus of analysis. In particular, although social institutions are now widely regarded as key determinants of economic success, the regional learning and innovation literature remains largely gender blind, simultaneously subordinating the female worker voice and making invisible distinctively gendered patterns of work in the face of an increasingly feminised labour force. Focusing on the industrial agglomeration of information and communication technology firms in Cambridge, England, we first outline the nature of the inequalities in patterns of work and social interaction among female versus male employees within Cambridge's high-tech regional economy. Second, we demonstrate how these inequalities in turn constrain female employees' abilities to contribute to key processes widely theorised to underpin firms' innovative capacities and economic competitiveness. Specifically, these self-identified constraints centre on female workers' abilities to: (a) act as agents of information and knowledge diffusion between firms; and (b) use new information and knowledge once they enter the firm. Overall, our results suggest that gender issues of social equity at the level of the individual worker need to be explicitly integrated with issues of economic competitiveness at the levels of the firm and the region. This is a case not simply of female employees being socially excluded at work, but of their simultaneous exclusion from key elements of firms' productive processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine how new forms of multicultural intimacy are imagined in contemporary Britain, and how they are invested with particular ideals of mixing, loving thy neighbour, and feelings for the nation. I trace these discursive themes in a myriad of social locations and forms—a television documentary titled The Last White Kids, reviews of the documentary in the press, and government policies on community cohesion. A key point of this paper is that racial, ethnic, and cultural relations are not only negotiated and ‘managed’ in literal spatial locations, but also imagined through specific emotional and ethical injunctions, such as ‘embracing the other’ and loving they neighbour. Moreover, these injunctions are imagined in the ambivalent spatial terms of obligations to, and dangers of, proximity—an ambivalence that is inflected with articulations of ‘race’, class, and gender. The analysis thus explores how the imperative of neighbourly love refers to both the desires for and anxieties about what the intimacy stems from and fosters. Who gets close to whom, and under what circumstances, is not left to chance. </jats:p>",

In settings with time‐to‐event or binary outcomes, the required sample size depends on the control‐arm event (response) rate. An accurate estimate of this rate is not often available at the planning stage. Therefore, non‐comparative control‐arm or pooled‐arm event rates from an ongoing trial are sometimes released for sample size adjustment or planning purposes. It is shown that such non‐comparative data release may still contain information on the relative treatment benefit and may thus adversely affect the ongoing trial. A simple approach to minimizing the effect of the data release is suggested. Published in 2007 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This work is based on ethnographic research that examined the relationship between regulators and residents in the major chemical and petrochemical centres of Grangemouth (Scotland) and Ludwigshafen (Germany). In Grangemouth a period of rising economic insecurity coupled with intensified public concern about safety has brought regulatory authorities and the town's population into ongoing dialogue. This dialogue has been uneasy, and marked by considerable public suspicion; but it has been a dialogue of sorts, nonetheless. In Ludwigshafen the prevailing mood has remained one of confidence in the town's massive chemical industry: the notion that a routine dialogue between regulators and residents might be either necessary or desirable has rarely been articulated by either side. Questioning the tendency in the literature on public engagement in environmental policy issues to associate such engagement with trust, we suggest that, in these two case studies at least, the opposite applied. It was manifest distrust and frustration which provoked animated public engagement with government and officials in Grangemouth recently. Equally, it was the depth of trust and familiarity, built up over decades, which facilitated public disengagement from issues of environmental regulation and governance in Ludwigshafen. </jats:p>",

However, transforming racially skewed ownership and skill patterns is proving a particular challenge. In this paper we outline some of the initiatives that have been introduced to stimulate socioeconomic change within the industry. By utilising analytical tools such as commodity chains, networks, and cultural approaches we demonstrate that a complex array of forces is driving change on the ground. Such forces include national imperatives derived from the legacy of apartheid and the concerns of consumers in the global North. We conclude by considering the types of local and global constraints that need to be challenged if these initiatives are to be successful in facilitating meaningful socioeconomic transformation within the wine industry. </jats:p>",

This article describes the efforts of faculty from two university business schools that incorporated the HRIS module of an ERP system into their HR management courses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Between the early 1970s and the late 1990s, state-sponsored deregulation and its market repercussions, combined with technological change, sparked profound changes for employees in the heretofore highly unionized US telecommunications sector. In this paper I examine the responses that this industry-wide restructuring of technical labor has prompted within two unions—the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA). With some success, the CWA has ‘scaled up’, employing innovative national bargaining and organizing tactics in the centralized workplaces of the companies once affiliated with the AT&amp;T Bell System and developing transnational relationships with other countries' telecommunications unions. However, these strategies have not prevented the CWA from losing ground. In contrast, the IBEW's inherent capacity to represent workers on a labor-market or ‘geographic’ scale, and thus to take advantage of the localization of technical work in the industry, has created new opportunities for that union and helped its construction division to reverse a decades-long trend of decline. However, the IBEW has not deliberately ‘constructed scale’ in this environment. Rather, the union has embraced an opportunity presented by a shift in industrial structure which favors its traditional strengths. Thus, the pursuit of the geographic or ‘horizontal’ approach does not align the IBEW with the progressive social movements that many labor geographers associate with localized activism. The case study of the two unions suggests that the existence of distinct traditions in the American labor movement—a craft tradition linked to multiemployer bargaining at the local level and an industrial tradition linked with a strong focus on workplace-based bargaining, national norms, and an active national state—has important implications for the understanding of how labor organizations relate to scale. </jats:p>",

From neighbourhood renewal to lay ecologies, people are being ‘given’ all kinds of agency in the making of economy and ecology. Yet relatively little has been said regarding the financial organisation of this new populism, which is often achieved through calculation and audit, and the framing of a return. In this paper we look at the uneasy coalition of civic action and its calculability. It focuses on the funding and running of a British Pakistani and Bangladeshi women's gardening initiative in inner city Birmingham, England. We fuse empirical work with gardeners and funding agencies with theoretical understandings of calculation in order to argue for a mode of organisation that not only includes a responsibility to act but also a responsibility to otherness. Rather than arguing for or against calculation, we describe a more diverse ecology of action and in so doing open arguments for reconfiguring the ways in which sustainable activities are funded. </jats:p>",

In this paper we explore what happens when the land-use demands of new paradigms of nature conservation collide with preestablished modes of spatial regulation, taking as our focus the implementation of the European Union Habitats Directive in estuary spaces in the United Kingdom. We provide evidence of the ways in which ecological regulation is reshaping political–economic landscapes and offer insights into the direction of ‘postmodern’ nature conservation practice, including the extent to which theoretical notions of hybrid and nonequilibrium systems have become absorbed into conflicts around ecological regulation. </jats:p>",

In introducing and exploring accounting practices, the theoretical allegiances of accounting are also outlined in order to situate accounting as a social science discipline which experiences similar debates to other areas of scholarship. The authors also extend discussion of risk governance and accounting by reference to the ‘new’ literature on risk from writers such as Adams, Beck, and Lash. It is suggested that the insights from these broader theorists on risk apply equally to conventional accounting and attempts via SEAAR to create an expanded governance framework. In particular, Beck identifies a number of critical aspects of risk governance that are also central to an understanding of accounting, including: the danger of seeking verifiable and neutral truth; the causal denial of harm; the contestation of expert and lay knowledge of risks; social construction of risk; and the radicalisation of rationality. Paraphrasing Beck, it is argued that accounting and accountants are incapable of managing the risks of industrialisation as they are implicated in the creation and multiplication of these risks, yet accounting and accountants, in particular those engaged in SEAAR, can play an essential role in identifying these risks. It is further argued that the contribution of SEAAR to risk governance will largely depend upon a radicalisation of accounting rationality in practice. </jats:p>",

The authors consider (a) the reasons why some companies have taken the first step in this transition by exploring the potential of more open and communicative approaches to environmental risk management, and (b) the effects that opening up can have, particularly on perceived levels of trust between corporations and stakeholders on matters relating to environmental risk. For the companies surveyed, the nature of their activities, the significance of formative events, and the failure of more traditional forms of risk communication to reduce conflict and to build trust amongst stakeholders have impelled them to experiment with new approaches to risk communication. It is found that, in the short term, such experiments are seen by managers to have had mixed effects: in contexts where trust had already been lost, open engagement can lead to an initial deterioration in relations between companies and stakeholders. However, it is also argued that in the longer term trust can be built through such open engagements. It is suggested, therefore, that opening up and engaging on matters relating to environmental risk may lead to a ‘j-curve effect’, with an initial deterioration in levels of trust being followed by a gradual improvement in levels of credibility and shared understanding over time. </jats:p>",

The authors examine the factors that have motivated and guided technological innovation, based on an examination of multinational companies developing genetically modified (GM) crops for the European market. The analysis is based on an inherently interdisciplinary approach to the study of innovation, which incorporates factors that are governed endogenously through the processes within companies (that is, strategic decisionmaking) and exogenously through interactions between firms and their external constituents (that is, government policies and regulations, and stakeholder and public perspectives and engagements). It is found that the introduction of GM technologies in Europe has been shaped significantly by public perception and societal reactions. It is also found that the aspects of industry strategies which contributed most to the course of European public opposition to GM crops were: (a) the choice of first-generation GM products; (b) interactions between pesticide-product and biotechnology-product strategies in different companies, and industry's efforts to present their sector and its products as contributing to sustainable development; (c) cultural and world-view differences between companies; and (d) company responses to European biotechnology policies and risk regulation. It is demonstrated that actions which seem rational to individual actors (corporations, governments, public interest groups) can have counterintuitive, and often counterproductive, outcomes in the longer term and when considered from the perspective of interactions within broader governance processes. </jats:p>",

The Pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS) uses an algorithm in which only the physical density of the absorber is required for calculating the characteristics of the modulator. The intensity modulator consists of cubic blocks (attenuator) of a tungsten alloy, plus cubic blocks of polyethylene resin foam that fill the spaces between the attenuator blocks and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) boards that act as the platform for the modulator. By measuring the transmission for various thicknesses of attenuator and by deriving values for the total physical density of the modulator, we determined the optimal effective density by comparing the curves fitted for the actual transmission data with the transmission calculated by the TPS. Using these effective densities, we examined the accuracy of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20085-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20085:equation:acm20085-math-0002\" /> for dose profiles of specific geometric patterns. The levels of consistency between the measurements and the calculations were within a tolerance of 3% of the dose difference and had a 3‐mm distance to agreement for the ladder‐, stairstep‐, and pyramid‐shaped test patterns, except in the high dose gradient region. In this modulator assembly, leakage occurred from the slits between the cubic blocks. This leakage was about 1.6% at maximum, and its influence on dose distribution was not crucial. In the TPS, in which physical density was the only user‐controllable parameter, we used the effective density of the absorber deduced from the effective mass attenuation coefficient. We conclude that the intensity modulation compensator system, together with a piled cubic attenuator, is clinically applicable, with an acceptable tolerance level. For the intensity map of the IMRT plan, measurements in treatment fields met 3% and 3‐mm criteria, excluding some regions of high gradient, which had a discrepancy of less than 5% and 4 mm.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.53.Mr, 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

The purpose of this work was to determine the rates and predictors of guardianship planning and preferred guardians among HIV-infected parents.</jats:p><jats:p>PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. Data were analyzed from interviews with 222 unmarried parents (who had 391 children) from a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving health care. Outcome measures included parental report on the level of guardianship planning and on who their preferred guardian for each child was. Level of guardianship planning was categorized as follows: (1) parent had not identified a guardian; (2) parent had identified a guardian, but the guardian had not agreed; (3) identified guardian had agreed; and (4) legal documentation of guardianship plan was complete. We conducted bivariate and ordered logistic regression analyses on the level of guardianship planning and multinomial logistic regression on identification of preferred guardians.</jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS. Twelve percent of unmarried HIV-infected parents had not identified a guardian; 6% had identified a guardian but gone no further; 53% said the identified guardian had agreed; and 28% had prepared legal documentation. The preferred guardians included other biological parents (17%), spouse/partners who were not biological parents (2%), grandparents (36%), other relatives (34%), friends (7%), unrelated adoptions (1%), and others (3%). Parents with the lowest CD4 counts and parents living without other adults were more likely to have completed the guardianship planning process. Nonrelatives were most often preferred by mothers and parents with higher CD4 counts; grandparents were most often preferred by younger parents and parents who prefer speaking Spanish.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSIONS. Pediatricians and others who take care of children with HIV-infected parents may be able to provide counseling and referrals for guardianship planning.</jats:p>",

One change identified is a newfound cultural recognition of disabled sexuality. In this paper I extend these arguments by considering the kinds of sexuality projected onto the disabled body at the intersection of regimes of disability, sexuality, and neoliberalism. I provide a governmentality/queer reading of visual representations of disabled sexuality and of two self-help disabled sex manuals to argue that interest in disabled sex may witness an investment in the ongoing production of normative sexualities, what Foucault called a ‘truth of the self, within the context of neoliberal spatialities of disability. Based on dominant cultural understandings of sex as ‘natural’, ‘predictable’, and ‘representable’, these self-help manuals serve to produce a framework that depoliticizes the claims of disability culture movements. These manuals render the project of disabled sexual liberation a personal project of self-governance that scarcely challenges contemporary structures of (neo)liberalism. </jats:p>",

This article argues for a more systematic use of theories in planning and evaluating quality‐improvement interventions in clinical practice. It demonstrates how different theories can be used to generate testable hypotheses regarding factors that influence the implementation of change, and it shows how different theoretical assumptions lead to different quality‐improvement strategies.</jats:p>",

The approach of the study involved a statistical analysis on the basis of the formerly 23 urban districts of the German capital of Berlin. Correlation and regression analyses of empirical data from the settlement structure, the traffic structure and income have found that the number of jobs per district and the share of the well-off population can best describe the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from traffic in Berlin. Also the number of residents, the total built area, the number of cars and the amount of traffic area are positively related to the dependent variable. Therefore, the possibilities to reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from road traffic for urban planners seem limited: a restriction of space dedicated to traffic and a change of transport means for commuting represent leverage points, according to the analysis. The other significant indicators are less able to be influenced by local and regional decision-makers-an alteration in the means of mobility to less CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emitting alternatives is needed if CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from road traffic are extensively to be decreased. </jats:p>",

Radiotherapy plans were generated using a four‐field box technique and dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions. First, plans obtained for full‐ and empty‐bladder scans were compared. Second, situations in which a patient was planned on full bladder but was treated on empty bladder, and vice versa, were simulated, assuming that patients were aligned to external tattoos.

When the multileaf collimator pattern was applied in reverse, substantial underdosing of the planning target volume (PTV) was observed, particularly for patients with prostate shifts in excess of 0.5 cm in any one direction. However, the prostate shifts showed no correlation with bladder filling, and therefore the PTV underdosing also cannot be related to bladder filling.

Fracture rates were higher in men before age 60 (1.8 : 1), and thereafter in women (3.1 : 1). In the age group of 60–64 years, the female : male ratio was 8.2 : 1 for cervical versus 1.8 : 1 for trochanteric fractures. Treatment for osteoporosis was under‐utilised. HF in people aged &gt; 60 years will almost double by 2011, and increase 2.5‐fold and 5.4‐fold by the years 2021 and 2051, respectively.
