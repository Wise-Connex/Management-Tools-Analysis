      "abstract": "<jats:p>Family planning in Pakistan has a long, interesting, expensive\n      and generally unsuccessful history. Recently, after a pause of several\n      years, vigorous public-sector efforts to control population growth have\n      been resumed. This has been called \"the new beginning\" by Pakistan\n      officials. This note will relate the details and also the genesis of\n      this recent renewal of family-planning activity. The first \"beginning\"\n      was the programme launched in 1965 [4]. This programme grew rapidly and\n      attracted considerable attention internationally. By the mid-Seventies\n      it was clear that the programme's impact had been overrated and that it\n      was on the verge of stagnation. Under the strong urging of USAID, the\n      major donor group, a last desperate effort was made using a strongly\n      supply-oriented approach. This so-called \"inundation scheme\" also proved\n      a failure and by 1977 the programme had virtually come to a halt [5].\n      The Fifth Five Year Plan (1978- 1983) endorsed population control but\n      called for an integrated health- and family planning approach. A new\n      programme of training, mass education and improved service-delivery was\n      laid out in the Plan, but, in fact, little seems to have been\n      accomplished or even attempted in the' early part of this period. The\n      programme had been discredited and had been all but shut down. But the\n      need remained. Pakistan's fertility was shown by the World Fertility\n      Survey results for 1975-76 to be essentially unchanged in 20 years - a\n      total fertility rate of some 7 births per female over her reproductive\n      career, resulting in an annual growth rate of about 3.0\n      percent.</jats:p>"

The lack of consensus is symptomatic of weaknesses which demand evaluation aid reconstruction of available theory. To provide a stable foundation for such efforts, the basic purposes of the planning process are re-examined. The analysis Is based on an open model of the organizational information system - the set of all manual and computer-based systems that produce information in a firm. This model suggests that overall viability depends upon the relationships between system outputs and their users; system inputs and their sources; and systemic processes and their input/outputs. The three concepts effectiveness, economic efficiency, and technical efficiency are defined as success criteria of these relationships, and their impact on overall system viability has been expressed in a simple algebraic formula. In a dynamic environment, the formula predicts that overall viability will continually decline unless there are compensating increases in effectiveness, economic and technical efficiency. Thus these three success criteria constitute permanent objectives of information systems planning.</jats:p>"

First, the landscape, the spatial structure of the public good, and the decision framework are described both for the individuals involved and for the planner. Then, the issue of decentralisation is discussed in the case where land rents go to absentee landowners. An explicit comparison between private goods, public goods, and externalities in a spatial context follows, and the first part ends with the problem of allocating land to public goods. The second part deals with some conceptual applications. </jats:p>",

This test can be used, among other purposes, to discriminate among models with different tree structures. It can be implemented by hand using the results of sequential estimation of the models under consideration. The other test consists of comparing the sequentially estimated parameter values with values produced by an asymptotically efficient estimation technique.

This paper begins with the question of whether any theories of reference, meaning, or truth would be possible within such a view of society. In the first part of the paper, some of the historical approaches taken to reference in both space–time languages and attribute languages are discussed. A distinction is made between the more formal types of reference used in such languages and reference as it is used in everyday discourse. In the second part of the paper, an alternative view of reference, derived from Quine's web-of-belief concept, is suggested, and it is demonstrated that this view of reference is capable of dealing with fictional as well as nonfictional entities. Reference is relativized to a language, sentences are true or false, and words can refer or ‘talk about’ different entities, but this is all within a particular discourse. </jats:p>",

In Buffalo, Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux implemented a comprehensive series of parks and parkways that pioneered the concept of the metropolitan recreational system. Initially conceived between 1868 and 1870 and substantially constructed by 1876, Olmsted and Vaux's Buffalo park system carefully modified the city's original plan, framed in 1804 by Joseph Ellicott, and introduced progressive design features inspired by the example of the Second Empire in Paris.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Five related issues involved in the analysis of services are discussed. First, it is shown that it is incorrect to suggest that there is a single route to the contemporary economy with high employment in the service sector. The Fisher–Clark thesis is discussed and criticised. In the specific case of the United Kingdom it is shown that service industries were of considerable importance even during the supposed heyday of Victorian manufacturing industry. This is shown by analysing certain regional indicators. It is further suggested that the crucial role of especially financial services cannot be understood separately from the broader Makler or middleman economy which in part predated the extensive growth of manufacturing industry. Second, some of the recent arguments of Gershuny and Miles are analysed. It is shown that their formulations are insufficiently social, both in the sense of ignoring changes in the social relations underpinning capitalist production both of manufacturing and of service industries, and of neglecting the impact of ‘social struggles' on the forms and levels of service employment. Third, a number of criteria are discussed by which different service industries can be separated off from each other. The criteria considered are ownership, market, product, degree of ‘commodification’, function, and character of the exchange. A classification based on elements of each of these is proposed in order to deal with UK data sources. Fourth, analysis is developed of eleven different forms of service sector restructuring. Some consideration is paid to the problems of explaining which of these will be found in particular sectors. Particular attention is devoted to considering the degree of importance of the ‘labour’ factor. Last, some of the processes affecting the ‘private consumer services' concerned with tourism are analysed. In particular, attention is devoted to aspects of the physical and social setting within which the service delivery takes place. An attempt is made to demonstrate which particular forms of service sector restructuring will be found in those tourist services in British coastal resorts. The exceptionally complex nature of the forces affecting employment levels in such places is shown in some detail. </jats:p>",

Where spousal veto acts as a barrier to family planning services it represents a serious threat to the lives and health of women and children. Removal of spousal authorization requirements has been shown to increase the use of family planning services. The Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, for example, removed their requirement in 1982 and clinic utilization increased by 26 per cent within a few months. Courts of several countries have held that spousal veto practices violate principles of personal privacy and autonomy and the right to health care. The effect of such judgements has been to reinforce rights to sexual nondiscrimination found, for example, in national constitutions and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. This article discusses the nature and application of spousal veto practices, explains how such requirements can violate certain human rights, and explores possible remedies to this problem, including ministerial, legislative, and judicial initiatives. </jats:p>",

Several key questions of direct relevance to this concern are explored, notably, Giddens's comments on this score; the relationship of these comments to wider debate on the connections between theoretical and empirical work; and the possibility of locating structuration theory within the concept of hierarchies of abstraction. </jats:p>",

The modelling framework incorporates both an endogenous cyclical mechanism of the type used in accelerator models of investment, to reflect the long production lags in building activity, and the exogenous influence on the building cycle of variations in economic factors such as gross domestic product and interest rates. The modelling technique used to formulate the theoretical framework is based upon a transfer-function model of the Box–Jenkins type, incorporating an error-correction mechanism to reproduce the short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium relationships between the variables.

Past research suggests that the pattern of intraurban migration can be rationalised using a model based upon an individual's mental image of the city. The mental image both facilitates search, and acts as a behavioural constraint upon the resident when he or she is searching for new accommodation. However, cognitive mapping per se has been less than exemplary in exposing the elusive bond between urban images and housing search behaviour. It is suggested that mental schemata are more appropriate than mental maps in delineating behaviour, as they represent cognitive structures and coding systems which enable the individual to respond to the shifting patterns of environmental stimuli. Personal construct theory is used to investigate the mental schemata of relocating renter households in London, Ontario. A strong correspondence between the respondents' mental construction of their environment and their overt behaviour (that is, where and how they searched) is reported. Several observations are made concerning the characteristics of renters, housing search, and the suburban–downtown split in the rental housing market of London. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The US federal system is undergoing significant change in numerous respects, one of which is the tax treatment of business. Taxes with an initial impact on business have traditionally provided a large amount of revenue to state and local governments, and they still do. But the business share of state and local taxes has decreased significantly compared with what it was several decades ago. Moreover, since interstate tax competition has intensified, the business share of taxes may continue to decline. The intensification of interstate tax competition is related to the increased priority of economic development as a goal of state policy. The severe unemployment of the early 1980s is probably the single most important factor in heightened concern about job creation. The increased openness of the US economy—implying especially acute problems for state economies dependent on heavy industry and farming—has also contributed. The decrease in federal corporation tax rates has made state taxes loom larger, and corporations have become more sophisticated about playing states against each other. In this paper, recent trends in business taxation are described and analyzed. The concern is not with evaluating these trends or suggesting how future policies might be changed. The paper may, however, contribute to the formulation of future policies by bringing together in one place a brief discussion of the disparate trends that have been affecting how state and local governments tax business. </jats:p>",

This tax would be defined on the base of business payroll, profits, interest paid, and rent. It would include businesses, professions, and administrative bodies. The reform is outlined and possible criticisms are assessed. With appropriate definitions of tax base and an enlargement of the group of taxpayers, the value-added tax is argued to be the best approach that is need-oriented, is organised on the benefit principle, has horizontal balance, is economically stable, and is perceptible. </jats:p>",

The focus is on the educative function of health promotion. A short summary of relevant learning theory is presented. Some obstacles (pitfalls) encountered in cross‐cultural transfer of information, knowledge and skills are presented and the effects of this learning process on the learner and teacher are explored. Examples of possible conflict situations drawn from the author's experiences and research are presented. Variables which influence planning and implementation of health education in cross‐cultural settings are examined. A cyclical model which identifies critical questions to be asked and decisions to be made in a four‐phased process of assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation is described for the use of health educators in transcultural settings. The need for systematic cultural assessment prior to planning is stressed to ensure relevancy, acceptance and positive outcome of programmes. Cooperative efforts of health educators with existing systems and traditional teachers and involvement of clients during all phases of the decision making process are suggested.</jats:p>",

Comparison of the two countries shows major deficiencies with both tax systems, as well as with many reform proposals.

However, from the point of view of local government the tax has many advantages: particularly, that it is a large source of revenue, it is fairly autonomous, and it links businesses to local authorities. Reform is nevertheless required, but it is argued that this should be based on revitalisation of the present business tax, primarily by widening its tax base or by the institution of a new tax on the local value-added. </jats:p>",

The latter, a goal of regional policy in all Central European nations, also has neither completely eradicated preexisting regional problems nor forestalled the emergence of new ones in old, highly specialized heavily industrialized areas. The lingering and the newly recognized regional problems have led many European regional scientists to call for new regional policies to cope with a new set of world economic conditions. </jats:p>",

Un examen de la documentation comptable portant sur l'aspect fiduciaire, sur l'obligation redditionnelle et sur l'information incitative, ainsi que diverses études en théorie organisationnelle et en sociologie, nous amènent à poser l'hypothèse que la publication de l'information financière exerce sa plus forte influence sur la planification stratégique à travers quatre phases du processus décisionnel.</jats:p><jats:p>Les informations probantes recueillies au moyen d'une étude de cas qui a nécessité la distribution, à des gestionnaires de sociétés ainsi qu'à des vérificateurs, d'une description d'une société d'électronique fictive œuvrant dans un secteur industriel dynamique et complexe, appuient l'hypothèse fondamentale. Sont examinées également diverses conséquences sur les décisions de gestion, la promulgation de politiques relatives à la publication de l'information financière et les possibilités de recherche future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains a review of the local systems of taxation in Britain and Germany as well as the policy debate. The main contribution, however, is to evaluate the burdens of the two fiscal systems on the user costs of capital. Comparisons are made first within each country of the burdens of local business taxes on different assets, sectors, owners, and sources of finance. Comparisons are then made between Britain and Germany over the period 1960–84 by adding progressively higher levels of standardisation: Standardised depreciation rates, inflation rates, distribution of assets and ownership, and capital allowances. From the empirical results it is demonstrated that local taxes decrease the aggregate real rates of return on investment projects by 0.6% (1960 and 1970) and 0.8% (1984) in Germany, and by 0:6% (1960), 0.7% (1970), and 1.1% (1984) in Britain. Thus, although aggregate burdens were comparable in the 1960s and 1970s, recent developments in Britain have resulted in a significant increase in local tax effects. These developments are even more strongly developed for particular assets and industries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an extension of previous research on the geography of union elections. A model of union organization is proposed, relevant to the institutional and political structure of US labor legislation. Implications are drawn for unions' organizing strategies, and their likely electoral performance at the local level. It is argued that the structural imperatives faced by unions are inherently incomplete; local discretion is built-in to the structure of labor relations. Alternative empirical forms of the proposed model are considered and the advantages of a probit methodology discussed. Empirical analysis is based upon representation elections involving the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union and the United Auto Workers union over the period 1970–82. To illustrate the implications of the derived empirical results, a series of scenarios are discussed involving both unions and their possible options for organizing at the local level. </jats:p>",
