The approach to community development administration has been to create within each district separate administrative units for rural planning and development called blocks; to give each block a unified organization consisting of government personnel specially trained to work with village people; to provide each block with assured funds according to the provisions of schematic budgets formulated by the Government of India; to establish it as the common agency for all development departments working in rural India; and to ensure its efficient working through a series of co-ordinating committees and controlling authorities at the district, state, and national levels. National objectives have been stated in the five-year plans in terms sufficiently flexible to allow adjustment within each state to suit local circumstances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Western world economic planning refers to various forms of programming the economic activity of a country under government initiative and supervision. Economic planning is thus more than government intervention; it requires the participation, on a voluntary basis, of private economic agents and governments at various levels. It works more or less through market mechanisms and essentially implies an interaction in the formulation of plans between individual economic agents on the one hand, and governments on the other.</jats:p><jats:p>Economic planning has two major economic effects:</jats:p><jats:p>1. It reduces uncertainty by making forecasts about economic conditions and by providing market information (market conditions, prospects, expected behaviour of economic agents, etc.). These forecasts are more or less detailed and are made public. This aspect of planning we call the information effect.</jats:p><jats:p>2. It modifies the content of economic decisions both in private and public sectors either because new goals of economic policy are formulated and accepted, or because government intervention acquires a new dimension. The result is a change in the economic structure of the country. This aspect of planning, the intervention effect, is not discussed in the present paper.</jats:p>",
