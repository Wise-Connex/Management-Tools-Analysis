It therefore cannot be implemented only from the national level but must be aimed at mobilizing also the self-organizing potential at regional and local levels. Technological change and regional structures turn out to be closely interrelated. </jats:p><jats:p> For this theme issue contributions have been invited on general aspects of technology policy (Zegveld), on its regional implications (Malecki and Nijkamp), and on the relevance of sectoral policies and entrepreneurial strategies on the spatial diffusion of innovations (Dyckman and Swyngedouw). In further papers, three spatial types of technology policy are represented: A spatially deconcentrated major technology project in the form of the French technology city Sophia-Antipolis (Perrin), a decentralized three-tier national technology policy in Japan (Kawashima and Stöhr), and a federal setting of technology policy in the case of the USA (Premus). </jats:p><jats:p> In drawing conclusions from the papers in this theme issue, its editors discuss the question of how technology policy and regional policy can join to help create a broad entrepreneurial and innovative climate at the local scale. </jats:p>",

Although the need for liberalization is fairly widely accepted, debate over how far and how fast to proceed has continued. One view initially proposed by Chen Yun sees China moving towards a system where a “planned economy is primary, and markets are supplementary” (<jats:italic>jihua jingji wei zhu, shichang tiaojie wei bu</jats:italic>). Others advocate moving beyond Chen Yun's vision to a system where, in fact if not in name, allocation takes place primarily through markets. Li Peng's government work report to the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress suggests that the current consensus leans towards the latter, more progressive view:</jats:p><jats:p>The focus of reform of the planning system is to transform the function of state planning organs, gradually reduce mandatory planning and expand guidance planning, … use economic instruments, and gradually establish a new economic mechanism where “the state regulates markets, and markets guide enterprises” (<jats:italic>guojia tiaojie shichang, shichang yindao qiye</jats:italic>).</jats:p>",

Evidence of this process is examined with reference to social collectivities widely separated in time and space. A systematic approach to the analysis of purification is suggested, drawing on Douglas and Bernstein. An account of the process in industrialized societies focuses on consumption and the interaction of social groups and the built environment, within a structurationist framework. It is argued that the spatial sciences have generally failed to recognize the problematic nature of purification. Rather, they are implicated in the purification process where theory is translated into practice. </jats:p>",

It becomes imperative that enterprises be autonomous and their activity co‐ordinated by markets. Collectivists therefore switch to the idea that such enterprises should be run by the collectives of their workers.

I call for a unified approach to industrial location and organization, or, rather, to the spatial division of labor and modes of organization. To do this one must first reopen the question of the division of labor and its obverse, the integration of complex production-systems. One must also go beyond the important inquiry by Scott and others, as to vertical integration/disintegration, to consider a wide range of possible means and modes of organization available, including variations on market exchange, several forms of workplaces, a wide range of firm size and scope, territorial complexes from the industrial district to the nation-state, and differing industry alignments. Last, one must treat geography as integral to the matter of organization, rather than as an outcome of preexisting organizational units that make location decisions. The puzzle of geographical organization is presented as a whole, but without yet trying to put it together for any particular sector, place, or time. </jats:p>",

It is argued that, in capitalist society, this production of meaning has typically supported shifts in capital accumulation, social reproduction, and legitimation in ways crucial to the reinforcing of dominant interests. Its effect has been to help counteract instability, system ‘degeneration’ (from the standpoint of such interests), and any fundamental transformation of the social system, This effect is termed ‘counteraction 1’. From considerations of urban design as production of values and as a body of practice, it is concluded that an urban design practice that is counteractive to dominant interests is, however, possible (‘counteraction 2’), Such a practice will be characterised by three ‘rules’, relating to the aesthetic program, the discursive penetration of the social context of urban design, and the breaking down of the present autonomisation and obfuscation of design as a domain of social interaction or discourse. </jats:p>",

A framework of adult education technology is developed and then compared. A combination of interviews, organization history, and record and report analysis provided the comparative data. It was found that program planning (technology) did vary among organizations, however, the framework of technologies employed was not sufficient to describe the mixed types of technology encountered. </jats:p>",

The module is designed to generate annual sequences of fire start times that are consistent with local fire history. A three-stage approach was employed: (1) For each day of a simulated fire season, a random draw from a Bernoulli distribution is used to determine if any fires occur; (2) if any do occur, a random draw from a geometric multiplicity distribution determines theft number; (3) ignition times for each fire are then randomly drawn from a time of day (beta or Poisson) distribution. This approach and specific distributional forms were selected after analysis of historical fire records from California's Sierra foothills and Central Valley. Fire sequences generated with the module appear to capture historical patterns with respect to diurnal distribution, interfire times, and total number of fires per year. For.

The central focus is on overcoming technical, financial, labor market, and community locational barriers to high-technology expansion. The old practice of ‘smoke-stack’ chasing has given way to inward-looking policies that encourage business start-ups and expansions. Key objectives of state and local government policies are to increase the flow of new ideas into the innovation process, to shorten the time for its initial introduction into a new product or process technology, and for a more rapid assimilation of new technology through-out the regional industrial structure. </jats:p>",

Grace Company, one of the nation's largest suppliers of phosphate-based chemical products. The mathematical model underlying this system includes production, distribution, multiple time periods, and multiple commodities. W. R. Grace initially formulated the model as a linear programming problem with 3,696 constraints and 21,564 variables. We developed an innovative modeling/solution approach to enhance top management's understanding of the model and to make the problem more tractable for the company's DEC 20/60 computer. The key features of this modeling/solution approach are: decomposition of the problem into a generalized network component and a small linear nonnetwork component, transformation of the generalized network component into a pure network, incorporation of most of the nonnetwork component into the pure network via an innovative relaxation approach, and incorporation of the remainder into the objective function via Lagrangian procedures. We solve the resulting model relaxation using highly efficient pure network solution techniques to obtain an advanced starting basis for a basis partitioning algorithm. This approach reduces solution time approximately 10-fold. In addition, W. R. Grace used insights gleaned from the solutions to make multimillion dollar decisions. </jats:p>",

A collision‐free space is represented by an articulated tube with parameters of reference points and path tolerances. For obstacle avoidance, the end effector is constrained to move inside of the tube. An algorithm which will find suboptimal solutions for optimizing both path and velocity history of the trajectory by the use of piecewise joint‐space polynomials is presented. This algorithm exploits the robot arm dynamics in realistic environments where obstacles are present and the minimization of task time is desired with smooth motion. Experimental results show that as the path tolerance increases the new algorithm takes advantage of the spatial freedom to provide solutions superior to conventional approaches and to methods based on predefined paths.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the present period of drastic technological changes, the best way of increasing the innovative capacity of an economy is no longer to accumulate resources in strategic fields nor to increase incentives to private firms and other actors, but to develop networks of creative interrelations between them. This depends more on collective processes than on traditional public decisions. In that perspective, local synergies and properly organised capacities of territorial structures are of great potential. In this paper it is proposed that the conception of technology policy be revised along such lines. Careful analyses of far-reaching experiences like Sophia-Antipolis bring about creative insights and help to build effective technology policies. In the first part of the paper the history of Sophia-Antipolis is analysed in the perspective of technology policy. In the second part we draw lessons regarding two issues: The territorial basis of technology policy, and the new forms of ‘public’ action. </jats:p>",

Benefits were measured as the cost savings in public expenditures avoided by providing family planning services to lowand marginal-income women. Iowa data for AFDC, food stamps, and Medicaid payments were used to calculate benefits. The total benefit savings were adjusted to reflect the impact of family planning services on preventing births. The adjusted savings were accrued over one-year and five-year time frames and for four age groups (14-19, 20-29, 30-34, and 35-44). lin the base year, the cost of providing family planning services in Iowa to the more than 56,000 women who used them was $3.1 million, or $59 per user. Results showed that the benefits of family planning services were highest for teenagers who would become eligible for public assistance programs upon the birth of a child. </jats:p>",

Descriptive responses of these women indicated high interest in retirement planning, but their level of planning raised serious concern for the future. Special emphasis on three social‐psychological concepts—risk taking, “math anxiety,” and locus of control—offered a unique perspective in this study. Multiple regression analysis found the following characteristics of women most active in retirement planning: higher household income, expected a pension, positive orientation toward finan cial risk, perceived control over chance, general willingness to take risks, internal belief in the ability to control one's life, comfort with math ability, and older age.</jats:p>",

A further refinement is the transformation of this model into a multiregion model, which makes use of gravity interactions in order to simulate cross-boundary interactions.

The resultant information system can be used in a flexible manner to produce distributions not currently available from aggregate sources.

The rate of profit in the wood industry generally rose, until a dramatic fall since 1979 onwards; this fall was largely due to a collapse of market prices and to the effects of that collapse on the technical composition of capital (via changes in the rate of capacity utilization). Profit rates in the furniture industry have generally been rising because the rate of exploitation has risen, even though techniques of production have changed only slowly. In the paper industry profit rates have generally fallen, in response to rapid changes in technology. There is generally short-run variation in the technical composition of capital, which, therefore, is affected by market conditions as well as the technology embodied in fixed capital. </jats:p>",

This information can be incorporated in a knowledge‐base and used as an aid in determining when production problems are occurring in the field. This information can also be used in the pre‐construction period by providing managers and estimators with expert knowledge of expected productivity and required crew size. A prototype expert system was developed for the construction of precast concrete structures. The rules were obtained from construction experts with extensive experience in this type of construction. The system provided advice concerning the best crew size to use based upon the construction site characteristics.

Growth satisfaction is a positive function of work success, elation in response to success, job scope and context satisfaction. Subjects are 130 salespersons. The findings question a basic tenet of job enrichment theory; namely, that motivation is a function of job design, and supports the proposition that individual differences in affective responses to perfor Mance predict unique variance in motivation and growth. </jats:p>",

These elements and their relationship with patterns of regional development are highlighted in this paper. The ‘modernization’ strategy in France is examined first, and then the regional dynamics of high-technology production are explored. Subsequently, the role of military expenditure in regional development processes is evaluated. It is concluded that this implicit policy has dramatically altered the character of industrial activity bundles in selected regions and has greatly influenced their potential for future technology-intensive growth. The regional subsidies and incentive policies have proven less important, insofar as modernization and technological change is concerned, than the military expenditures. It is argued that there is little evidence that the impressive military procurement program is integrated with other aspects of regional policy and no evidence that it is playing a role in the industrial restructuring of the older industrial areas. </jats:p>",

The traditional planning approach for addressing this problem has involved devising schemes for large water development projects, which for many years included the importation of water from other states. Now the attitude towards water resource management is changing, and it is generally agreed that better management of existing supplies is the preferred approach. In this paper we review some of the changes that have recently occurred in Texas, including attempts to streamline the water institutions in such a way that they might be more responsive to the need for more comprehensive management of water resources statewide, with greater emphasis on social and environmental concerns.</jats:p>",
