They have a common goal, the enhancement of man's environment. The first question is whether or not they should converge or diverge; this being answered affirmatively, then the question is how? This is considered in relation to control over the development of projects. Advanced practice is reviewed here, and then how practice could be improved by environmental impact analysis being matured into development-impact analysis with impact being seen as three sequential aspects: physical, activity, and welfare. The conclusions can then be translated into planning analysis, through the use of planning balance-sheet analysis, aimed at drawing a conclusion which is more suitable for decisionmaking than the conventional environmental impact analysis. The merging of the two streams would both sharpen the use of environmental impact analysis as currently practised and raise the level of performance of conventional planning analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For its World Employment Conference in June 1976 the ILO\n      prepared a report [2] in which it put forward the idea that the\n      development strategy for the future should aim at meeting certain \"basic\n      needs\" for the poorest 20 per¬cent of the people in the different\n      countries of the world. One point ILO put across was that it would take\n      considerably less time to reach a given set of basic needs targets if\n      income within the different countries could be redistributed for the\n      benefit of the poorest 20 percent. The ILO demonstrated the magnitude of\n      the problem by the help of illustrations drawn from a working paper\n      prepared for the ILO [1]. The minimum basic needs which are listed by\n      the ILO include personal consumption items like food, clothing and\n      housing, and services which in many countries are provided by public\n      authorities like water, health, sanitation and education. In addition\n      the ILO report also stresses qualitative elements of development, and\n      calls for greater participation of the poor in decision¬making in\n      matters concerning their own future.</jats:p>"

The focus is on new housing production. The findings are that EIR shows some promise of enabling communities to better protect themselves from adverse side effects of new development. At the same time, EIR adds what appears to be a modest increment to the overall costs of new housing. However, because EIR has expanded local government planning options, one of the side effects of EIR is likely to be the enhanced ability of localities to exclude moderate income families from new housing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is considerable concern amongst development planners at the large and apparently growing areal disparities in the level of development in many underdeveloped countries. A number of theoretical studies support the view that economic growth inevitably results in widening disparities in the initial stages of economic development which may or may not be reversed with later growth. Empirical studies, although frequently lacking in comparability and deficient in data, confirm the existence of widening disparities in a large number of countries. Some planners have questioned the policy of maximising growth of gross product as the panacea for under-development and attempted to ensure more even patterns of development. Where economic and political unrest, including “insurgent activity”, have occurred, and have been equated by government officials with regional concentrations of poverty, further weight is given to policies directed towards reduction of regional disparities. However, where the results of schemes aimed at reducing regional imbalance have been assessed the success rate is slight. This paper examines the experience of Northeast Thailand, the Korat plateau, as an example of a backward region that has had considerable planning effort directed at it over the last twenty years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When an investor enters the real-estate market, can he detect a profitable parcel of land simply by observing how its price (or, more realistically, prices of like parcels in its general vicinity) has behaved in the immediate past? For example, if we observe land prices in a certain area of a city or even of a country to be rising at a rapid rate, is it reasonable to expect prices there to continue to rise at this rapid rate? If so, the market is said to be ‘inefficient’. Current prices in that market do not fully capitalize expected future price changes. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper asks if the Tokyo land market is inefficient and concludes that it is. If the government data on this market can be trusted, there are wide divergences in mean rates of appreciation across parcels that cannot be explained by differences in risk and that are not being closed through arbitrage. It appears that an investor in land can make an above average return on his funds by discovering where land prices have been rising at an above average rate and by investing in land in this area. If sustained by similar analyses of other land markets, this finding will give quantitative content to land economists' intuition that land markets are different from other speculative markets (for example, the stock and commodities markets), which are well known to be highly efficient. </jats:p>",

In this paper we discuss the concrete application of stochastic programming to a multiperiod production planning problem in which the demand for the products during the various periods is assumed stochastic with known probability distribution. Since the resulting stochastic program does not possess the property of “simple” recourse no direct use can be made of existing methods that have been proposed in literature for solving problems of this type.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes the results of a two-and-a-half year effort in proactive planning at the Bureau of the Census in Washington, D.C. Most large-scale organizations merely react to their future(s) instead of actively planning for and thus anticipating the future(s) they would like to bring about; would the Bureau be bold enough to try and break out of this pattern by engaging in what Ackoff and others have termed proactive or interactive planning? This paper not only describes the substantive results of the effort, but more importantly, the methodology that was utilized and developed to achieve those results. </jats:p><jats:p> Approximately 120 self-selecting participants from all branches and levels of the Bureau (from secretaries to division heads to the Director) were first given the explicit instruction to think as freely as they could about the year 2000 (i.e., not to be hampered by current constraints in the internal or external environment) and to write out a scenario indicating what for them the Bureau should be like in the year 2000. Because of the difficulties that most people experience in freeing themselves from current operating constraints and in thinking significantly beyond the current time frame in which they exist, a series of psychological exercises were designed to make the participants aware (1) of the source of the difficulties and, as an important side benefit, (2) of the often deep and intense psychological differences between them. Above all, these exercises, including lectures on the philosophy of inquiring systems, were designed to make the participants more conscious of the different assumptions that different planners unconsciously bring with them to the planning process. What one type of planner often takes as a “given” another takes as a “taken,” i.e., as an unwarranted assumption. Different planners have different innate preferences for different givens, sources of data, kinds of information, methodologies, etc. </jats:p><jats:p> One of the most important aspects of the methodology concerned the use of a recent social systems design technology developed by Ralph H. Kilmann, which was applied to cluster (via multivariate analysis) the ideas contained in the scenarios on the future and the people who produced them into a strategic-planning design (from questionnaire data on individuals' task and people preferences). The MAPS Design Technology (Multivariate Analysis, Participation, and Structure) thus answers the question, “Who is ‘best suited’ as a group to work on which set of ideas and issues?” Several such groups resulting from the MAPS analysis were utilized to write characteristically different reports on the future. When the groups were satisfied with their reports and when they and the project directors felt that the reports of the groups differed significantly from one another, representatives were selected from each MAPS group to form an executive group. The latter was charged with the task of integrating the diverse themes of the different MAPS groups and of writing a final report for presentation to the executive staff of the Census Bureau plus the advisory committees of various Professional societies and interest groups which advise and assist the Bureau and its programs. </jats:p><jats:p> … The planner has to leave off being a precise scientist. He needs to encourage radical viewpoints. In fact, I would be tempted to say that whenever planning begins to look as though it is following tried and true procedures that have worked in the past then planning is in danger of becoming useless. Good planners are continuously asking the most searching, radical, and ridiculous questions (e.g.: Should banks be involved in the handling of cash? Should the post-office department be involved mainly in the transmittal of letters? Shouldn't the soft-drink companies be selling cheap nutrients to foreign countries? and so on). Since there is limited technology available in this area, the best way to proceed is to select planners with radical and unreasonable minds, if you can find them. If not beware of accepting the planner's version of what you can do and what you cannot do. </jats:p>",

The author proposes as the base of such a system a table giving the expected duration of various life states (education, employment, retirement, etc.). This would be supplemented by a family of social co‐efficients and fixed‐weight index numbers that slot into it, allowing inter‐temporal and international comparisons. The system would facilitate analysis of inequalities (regional, ethnic, etc.) and social change, and government planning of such change. It would also provide a framework for the development of national systems of social statistics.</jats:p>",
