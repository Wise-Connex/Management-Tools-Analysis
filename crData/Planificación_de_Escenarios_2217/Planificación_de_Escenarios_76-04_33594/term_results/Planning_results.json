Goodwin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Johns‐Manville, Planning Review initiates a series of articles designed to elicit the opinion of top management on the effectiveness of planning and the proper direction for the state of the art. In simple terms the question is, “How are planning and the planning process viewed from the CEO's office?” Dr. Goodwin was chosen to be the first CEO interviewed because he is one of those rare chief executives who was promoted to top management after a stint as chief planner. Obviously, he is well acquainted with the methodology of planning, the various ways it can be utilized by a corporation, and its potentials. Other executives interviewed in the series will be selected on the basis of their professional experience with planning before their promotions. In this first interview, the interviewers — Robert J. Allio, President of NASCP, and Robert Randall, contributing editor to Planning Review — attempted to make the session informal and more a conversation than an interrogation. For this reason, specific and detailed questions about the Johns‐Manville planning cycle and organizational structure were omitted. Instead, the time spent with Dr. Goodwin gave Planning Review an invaluable chance to learn about his attitude toward planning. Planning Review would like to take this occasion to thank Dr. Goodwin for being so generous with his time. To condense the hour and a half of insight he so cheerfully gave the interviews, the editors have blue‐penciled extensively. In addition, much of the responsibility for the interview's organization rests with the editors. Interestingly, although the interviewers provided Dr. Goodwin with a list of questions in advance, these never became a central part of the discussion. Chief executives tend to answer questions they raise themselves.</jats:p>",

Physical data indicate that articulatory shifts thought to occur in synchrony may be out of phase by amounts that are not negligible as compared with the durations ascribed to entire segments. Whether such phase variations are subject to the speaker's control in any direct way, or whether they reflect certain physiological constraints on the speech apparatus, is still to be settled to everyone's satisfaction. Moreover the same question is appropriately raised with respect to shifts that are apparently very precisely synchronized, i.e., involving tolerances of a few tens of milliseconds. An interesting case involves the precise timing relation between supraglottal and laryngeal gestures in stop-vowel and vowel-stop sequences. In the former this timing relation is variable, yielding distinct stop categories, and this variation is presumably under speaker control. In the latter there appears to be less variability in the timing of closure and extinction of glottal tone. Instead, there is significant variability in vowel duration, ascribable to properties of the following stop. The present paper presents data reporting on the durational relations among prevocalic stops, vowels, and post-vocalic stops in one- and two-syllable nonsense words. The utterances measured were produced by a single speaker under conditions designed to minimize variability, so that obtained measures of variation might serve as baseline values to be compared with segment duration data from less restricted speech samples.</jats:p>",

Within such a process the early stages are concerned with explaining the relatively trivial characteristics of the phenomena of interest, and the later stages are devoted to explaining more important behavioural issues. Coleman (1964) calls this approach the ‘method of residues’, and its power is first demonstrated here by a reinterpretation of the well-known gravity model. An ad hoc test of the method on the Toronto-centred region serves to emphasise the need for a more formal approach, and thus an analogy between the method and the Bayesian viewpoint is introduced. A method of information minimising, more general but consistently and unambiguously related to the method of entropy maximising, is used to make the formal approach operational, and the method is used to generate an ‘extended’ family of spatial-interaction models. A number of spatial-interaction models are derived, and the paper is concluded by a test of two of these models on the Toronto-centred region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The analysis of traffic and transport alternatives by means of mathematical models is well-established as an aid to design and economic assessment. The emphasis in the past has been on the traffic effects of the policies involved, and it is only recently that methods have been devised to give approximate estimates of the levels of and degree of exposure to noise, air pollution, and pedestrian interference as an essential part of the study of traffic and transport proposals. This paper covers the design and use of special models, and the collection and analysis of noise and pollution data in a form suitable for forecasting. The application of the techniques is illustrated by means of models of Coventry drawn from the Transportation Study report. One model was designed to simulate conditions in 1967, and another to simulate extreme (and unlikely) conditions in a future where congestion and pollution are both severe. The environmental impact estimation process has been integrated into the RRLTAP transportation modelling research system. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are brought out by an illustrative application. Special attention has been paid to the different pollution estimation equations as a basis for forecasting, and the degree to which a particular choice could affect the results. </jats:p>",

Goal programming is a modification of linear programming designed to solve problems characterized by a large number of conflicting objectives. The solution is obtained by expressing all objectives as constraints and minimizing the deviation of the allocation from the respective targets and standards. If lexicographic ordering of objectives prevails, the constraints can be introduced in order of their importance. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper first discusses the theoretical basis for goal programming and then presents the mathematical formulation and the numerical evaluation of a hypothetical industrial-location problem.

However, the major difficulty in using the suggested approach is the inadequate knowledge of the process of adoption. Therefore, a model of adoption is proposed. The methodology consisting of a heuristic built around automatic interaction detector (AID) is described. The validity and the salient features of the proposed adoption model are discussed. </jats:p><jats:p> The segmentation scheme is proposed on the basis of the stages of adoption in family planning.

Even when the decision has been made to provide family planning advice, information and service, debate often arises as to the best method of administering a family planning programme—whether to integrate it with maternal and child health (MCH) services, offer it post-partum, or provide it independently of all other health activities.</jats:p><jats:p>The Danfa Comprehensive Rural Health and Family Planning Project, Ghana, is investigating the general problem of health service delivery, including family planning, and is doing so with a firm commitment to efficient management, staff training and supervisory maintenance. An established research design and ongoing evaluation efforts, including cost and functional analyses, are an integral part of the project. While it is believed that the integrated MCH/Family Planning approach will yield optimal results in family planning acceptance (as well as reduction in morbidity and mortality), other alternatives of health care and family planning service delivery are being evaluated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The documentary evidence of aggregate studies suggests that high rates of productivity growth in many firms and industries are accompanied by high rates of output growth and, to a lesser extent, employment growth. The productive efficiency of firms within regional components of industries, however, has not been studied empirically. This paper summarises the results of an empirical investigation of the regional-development role of best-practice firms in the Pacific Northwest plywood and veneer industry. The study examined the interrelations between growth impacts of productivity performance and output and employment change, and the relative growth impacts of high productivity, best-practice firms vis-à-vis less productive, non-best-practice firms. The findings are discussed in relation to the process of regional-growth and regional-development planning. </jats:p>",
