The research on attainable (and not attainable) teaching outcomes with computer simulations is now fairly clear. SimCity provides a dynamic decision-making environment in which students can learn such teaching objectives as (1) systems thinking, (2) problem-solving skills, and (3) “craft” in the planning profession. However, SimCity has inherent weaknesses that prevent it from being a one-size-fits-all teaching tool for all students. The article concludes with a discussion on which type of students do better with SimCity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planners have significant influence on the fiscal landscape of communities through the day-to-day decisions they make and the plans they implement. To better understand how our educational system addresses fiscal issues in the training of planners, the author surveyed planning instructors from across the United States and Canada and analyzed a series of public finance course syllabi. This article presents the results of this analysis and contrasts the planning instructor survey results with the results of a national survey focused on practicing planners. In this second survey, planners were asked to provide their perspectives on the importance of public finance to effective planning. Taken together, the survey results provide an interesting picture of the significance of public finance to planning academics and practitioners. This research is intended to assist planning programs in evaluating their curricula for attention to public finance and the needs of the planning profession. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper draws on the importance of public participation in improving several aspects of the land-use planning and decision-making process and regards the lack of adequate tools as an important barrier hindering effective implementation of participation in planning practice. The hypothesis is that extensive research into local knowledge, especially regarding values and goals, followed by a careful and focused preparation of expert proposals could improve the effectiveness of the participatory process. The paper therefore focuses on the development of methodologies to obtain knowledge from local residents and to integrate it effectively with expert knowledge to produce an input for the communicative process, whereby interaction and communication can bring about consensual planning proposals. The methodology discussed in this paper is an innovative combination of several tools already recognized within spatial and/or participatory planning, such as public surveys and participatory workshops. Connecting these tools can be shown to ameliorate their individual drawbacks and to achieve synergetic effects in all aspects. The use of support tools, such as cognitive mapping, statistical analysis, and suitability modeling, to assist these processes is also discussed. The study was implemented as a pilot project testing the proposed methodology in a case study of land-use planning for a local community in Slovenia, which is currently undergoing significant change from a rural community into an urban community. The results have shown that the use of a traditional questionnaire, combined with the mapping of chosen responses, proved effective in the acquisition of existing local knowledge. The result also showed that in-depth analysis of local knowledge and values and consideration of both in preparing alternative expert planning proposals proved to be a valuable input into traditional participation workshops, thus fostering an interactive participative planning process, whereby conflicts could be resolved while searching for a consensual solution. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Accra, Ghana's capital, has solid waste collection and disposal problems that, like most cities in Africa, are concentrated in poor residential neighborhoods. Efforts to improve solid waste management have focused on improving solid waste collection. A practical, low-cost concept that has not been explored is recycling organic solid waste into compost for urban cultivation. This research explored the feasibility of recycling organic solid waste into urban cultivation as a sustainable waste-management strategy in low-income neighborhoods. The main hypothesis of this study is that a significant proportion of solid waste can be diverted from inefficient disposal by redirecting the organic fraction into urban cultivation. The study revealed that waste-based urban cultivation could significantly reduce quantities of organic solid waste for disposal, and minimize waste collection and disposal cost. Challenges to implementing the concept include overcoming the issue of land availability and motivating stakeholders to initiate, implement, and sustain such projects. </jats:p>",

A reading of important cyberpunk novels shows the way in which the ideas of formal urban theory, such as the idea of global cities, cities as communication systems, and the Los Angeles school of urban studies, have been incorporated into this facet of popular culture. The analysis suggests that science fiction can help planners to understand the influence of a range of social theories on public understanding of planning issues. </jats:p>",

Studies that address the relationships between social behavior and environmental quality of the street tend to separate the study of physical features from land uses and hence do not address the interrelationships between behavioral patterns and physical features of the street and its sociability. This article is an empirical examination of behavioral responses of people to the environmental quality of neighborhood commercial streets. Structured and semistructured observations are used to study stationary, lingering, and social activities on three neighborhood commercial streets. Eleven land use and physical characteristics of buildings and the street are identified based on the literature review and extensive observations. These are measured and tested to understand which characteristics support stationary, lingering, and social activities. The findings reveal that people are equally concerned with the social, land use, and physical aspects of the street. Seating provided by businesses, seating provided by the public authorities, businesses that are community places, personalized street fronts, and sidewalk width particularly contribute to stationary and social activities on neighborhood commercial streets. </jats:p>",

When people move in urban space they perceive first the street network as structuring this space. Therefore, streets are a good candidate for investigating structural salience. This paper investigates different structural representations of the urban fabric, and measures to describe the structural salience especially of elements of the street network and dependent elements. The measures are taken from topology and network analysis. The goal is to identify a generic model of structural salience for urban elements that favors the automatic identification of references for route directions. The proposed model is illustrated by a case study applied to a small city in northern France. </jats:p>",

It argues that while the status of Welsh has been improving perceptibly in Wales since the devolution process in 1998, there is still much disagreement on the meaning of a bilingual Wales. Building on Laponce’s concepts of collaborative and competitive bilingualisms, it discusses the positions of the main actors involved in the bilingualism debate in Wales. It also identifies some lessons from the Welsh case for furthering our understanding of the politics of language planning and policy-making.</jats:p>",

Progress on the Cairo agenda has slowed for numerous reasons, however. The United States, once an enthusiastic promoter of this agenda and still the world's leading reproductive health donor, has revised its reproductive health policies radically since the 2000 presidential election of George W. Bush. This study examines how policies have been reconfigured in five key reproductive health areas, sparking controversy both in the United States and internationally. These categories are the content of sex education, access to emergency contraception and to abortion services, condom effectiveness, and HIV/AIDS prevention. The analysis presented here elucidates how ideological considerations have superseded public health and ethical concerns and reflects on health and ethical consequences.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we present a partnership‐mentoring model for enhancing management capacity that has been piloted in Ethiopia and may be useful in other developing countries. The model included needs assessment and baseline evaluation using a hospital management indicator checklist, deployment of 24 Fellows (US and international hospital administrators) for 1 year to work as mentors with hospital management teams in 14 Ethiopian hospitals, continuing didactic and practical training in quality improvement methods for hospital management teams, and 24 management improvement projects to be completed during the year with plans for replication more broadly as appropriate. Surveys of Fellows and Ethiopian managers within the first quarter of onsite activity found high levels of trust in one another's abilities and intent to implement changes. The partnership‐mentoring model promotes sustainability and may provide other countries with approaches for improving the quality of hospital care through improved hospital management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the relationship between patterns of trip chaining and urban form. The goal is to examine whether lower density environments are related to more frequent reliance upon trip chaining and more complex tours. The analysis uses the 2001 National Household Travel Survey to evaluate household individual travel and trip characteristics alongside a basic measure of residential density. Two estimation techniques, the ordered probit and the negative binomial model, are used to evaluate the factors associated with the tendency to combine trips into more complex tours, measured as the number of stops. The results indicate that, accounting for key household and traveler characteristics, lower density environments lead both to a greater reliance upon trip chaining and to tours that involve more stops along the way. This is followed by a household level analysis of tour generation. Crane and Krizek have suggested that more accessible areas will tend to generate more tours. However, we found no evidence for this in our analysis. </jats:p>",

This article argues that the proposed solution would respect the rights to autonomy of the individual to a sufficient degree and stands a greater chance of being both practicable and effective than the alternatives.</jats:p>",

Given the severity of the AIDS pandemic in sub‐Saharan Africa, the potential societal benefit of testing is invoked to call for its massive expansion and to justify a shift from voluntary to routine testing. Surprisingly little evidence has demonstrated, however, that such a shift will result in the intended benefits to communities, particularly that of reducing the horizontal transmission of HIV. This analysis addresses and critiques the assumptions underlying a serostatus‐based approach to behavior change and discusses the ethical consequences of transferring control of the decision to be tested from the individual to the provider. It concludes with a discussion of the implications for HIV counseling and testing policies and proposes alternatives to routine testing that have the potential to be effective while preserving the right to know one's HIV status.</jats:p>",

Fear that their private information will become known, particularly to a parent, has been shown to be a major factor in adolescents’failure to seek the services they need. The tension between parental interests in guiding the development of children and public interest in maintaining a healthy population is considered in light of the ethical principles that bear upon these decisions. In practice, health‐care workers are the intermediaries who must ensure that the privacy rights of adolescent clients are protected. They are bound through obligations engendered in human rights conventions as well as by ethical principles, especially that of nonmaleficence, to provide the young with information and confidential services, skills that must be acquired through training.

This study contends that the right of individuals to refuse testing ignores the right of their sexual partners—male or female, regular or casual—to be informed of the health risks to which they may be exposed on entering or continuing a sexual relationship or engaging in particular sexual acts. If, as the UN has declared, all persons have the right to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination, and violence, then all persons have the right and the responsibility to know their own and their partner's serostatus and to protect themselves and their partner(s) from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Support by AIDS activists for policies of routine STI/HIV testing, counseling, and disclosure between both partners in a sexual relationship would help to promote an ethic of equal rights and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences.</jats:p>",

In 1996, a qualitative study explored the changing dynamics of concurrent sexual partnerships, using a variety of researchers and methods. Although most international ethical research codes prescribe the informed consent of research subjects, the present author, as principal investigator for that study, included the mystery‐client method, which omits informants’consent. Five trained, pilot‐tested, and closely supervised male researchers contacted 101 bar girls and “freelancing” women in trading and urban centers to assess the women's ability to negotiate condom use. The men posed as clients but were instructed not to have sex with their informants. This approach provided important contextualized information to improve HIV transmission‐prevention programs, yet it raises ethical concerns. This article is intended to contribute to the dialogue and debate on ethical research involving mystery clients and to encourage other researchers to share their ethical dilemmas and show how they have addressed them.</jats:p>",

From the 2003 Master Property data file of the city, two sets of owner-occupied single-family houses were randomly selected (one to construct the models, and the other to rest the models). Besides conventional housing attributes, remote-sensing information, in particular the fractions of soil and impervious surface representing degraded neighborhood environment conditions, is added to improve the model. Spatial regression and geographically weighted regression approaches are employed to examine spatial dependence and heterogeneity. Results reveal that these spatial models tend to perform better, especially in terms of model performance and predictive accuracy, than the ordinary least squares estimates. </jats:p>",

Many people become infected with HIV because they are unaware of the positive serostatus of their sexual partners. Informing or warning the sexual partners of HIV‐positive patients of the patients' serostatus could assist in curtailing the spread of HIV/AIDS because sexual partners can thereby choose to avoid having unprotected sex with infected persons. By law, however, doctors have a duty to their patients to protect their medical confidentiality. Doctors, therefore, face a dilemma concerning which should prevail: patients' right to privacy and confidentiality or the importance to society of controlling the spread of the pandemic. Most medical regulatory bodies do not take clear‐cut positions on the issue, leaving the decision to the discretion of individual doctors. The question of whether doctors should be legally empowered to breach the confidence of patients to protect the patients' sexual partners is discussed here with reference to the existing laws of Canada, the United States, and Nigeria.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology incubators have emerged in many places as a tool in facilitating the establishment and survival of high-technology firms. Some incubators develop quickly and produce a fast-increasing number of new ventures, while others remain stable in size. Despite a growing public investment in technology incubators, systematic studies of the factors determining their growth are scarce, meaning that policy decisions are taken without sufficient practical insights into critical conditions for growth. In response to that situation, we explore several factors in determining differences in growth patterns. We use a quantitative approach derived from the field of artificial intelligence that matches with meta-analysis and qualitative (and sometimes fuzzy) data—that is, rough set analysis. Benefits and challenges of rough set analysis are discussed, including experience with a stepwise procedure with various accuracy checks. The findings suggest that a strong performance of incubators mainly rests on diversity in stakeholder involvement and a location in nonmetropolitan areas. Rough set analysis turns out to be a helpful tool in comparative project analysis, but there is still a need for standardization of measures used in the interpretation of the results. </jats:p>",

It is argued that the key for a successful policy response is in the organization of connectivity between the domains of the private sector, the internal regional policies, and the transregional policies. However, city-regions exist within different institutional settings, and organizing connectivity has to adapt to such differences. The article constructs a typology of these varied institutional settings based on research of nineteen European city-regions. Each type of institutional framework has its particular risks and opportunities, and these need to be taken into account in generating the appropriate form of informal planning strategy and maximum connectivity. </jats:p>",

A test case of Singapore's urban space was conducted by evaluating the visibility of three alternative urban design scenarios and their potential impacts on the visual quality of open space. Both directional and nondirectional approaches were applied to the mapping of visibility based on the 2D and 3D indices. The proposition that 3D visibility indices are more effective than 2D indices was verified. The findings show that the 3D indices are sensitive to the changes of z-dimension. </jats:p>",

This research therefore attempts to combine two different approaches, namely the formal approach and the spatial approach, for the comprehensive understanding of the architectural grammar. To bridge the technical gap between these two approaches, a new graph-theoretical method is introduced by which configurational information is linked to a shape generation model. From a series of analyses it is found that there exist clear principles that generate all the typical house plans in the city. </jats:p>",

The findings of this study show that inner-ring suburbs were increasingly vulnerable to socioeconomic decline relative to other metropolitan subareas. In contrast, the outer-ring suburbs continued to thrive, drawing most of the new population and housing development in the context of intrametropolitan spatial differentiation. The downtowns and some parts of the inner city showed a gradual recovery from the pattern of deterioration. By recognizing the interdependence of all the subareas and applying sound, holistic policies, the public policy decision-making entities can ensure the future stability of the inner-ring suburbs as well as all the surrounding areas of a metropolitan region. </jats:p>",

In this article, it is argued that universities could be a driving force for urban development, provided cities succeed in embedding knowledge in the local social and economic networks, which is seen to depend to a large extent on the balance in the process of exchange between the various stakeholders of higher education: students and academic communities, entrepreneurs, and local communities. A model of sustainable city-university relationship is proposed and matched with evidence from nine case studies of European cities hosting a large higher education sector; the role of policy and planning to sustain and enhance such links is also brought to the fore through the illustration of various best practices in the case studies. </jats:p>",

Essential to the practice of critical infrastructure planning and drills are two pieces of knowledge. One concerns the interactions within a CI system (intradomain interdependencies), and the other concerns the interactions among the CI systems (cross-domain interdependencies). A thorough understanding of these two interwoven CI interdependencies is crucial to such tasks as vulnerability assessment, scenario composition, and homeland security drills. In this paper we present a new approach that facilitates the learning of the interdependencies. Employing a loosely coupled system of GIS and an ontology-based object modeling system developed in this study, it represents and visualizes the intradomain and cross-domain CI interdependencies both diagrammatically and geographically. The system and its knowledge representation methodology were tested through a case study in the Southeastern United States. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its revival in 1989, the reproductive health and family planning program of Iran has made great strides in raising the contraceptive prevalence rate and reducing fertility. The majority of couples are using modern methods promoted and provided by the national program, although a sizable proportion of couples continue to depend on the traditional method of withdrawal. The longstanding urban–rural gap in contraceptive prevalence rates has been reduced to about 10 percent, which is mainly the result of better‐educated urban couples' continued practice of withdrawal. Despite its enormous success in meeting the needs of married couples, in narrowing the urban–rural gap in access to and use of modern contraceptives, and in reducing fertility, the Iranian family planning program is open to criticism for confining its target audience to married couples and failing to address the issue of abortion. The restrictive aspects of the program are often justified on the grounds of religious values and fear of encouraging sexual promiscuity. Because of the theocratic nature of the political system and the immense power enjoyed by Shiite ulama (religious leaders), no step can be taken to address these restrictions without their implicit support and approval. This study describes some of the ethical issues facing the reproductive health program of Iran and indicates how pragmatic approaches adopted by the ruling Shiite ulama to solve some of the social and medical challenges of a rapidly modernizing society may be extended to overcome ethical hurdles faced by the reproductive health program.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally, researchers have used elaborate regression models to simulate the retail petrol market. Such models are limited in their ability to model individual behaviour and geographical influences. Heppenstall et al presented a novel agent-based framework for modelling individual petrol stations as agents and integrated important additional system behaviour through the use of established methodologies such as spatial interaction models. The parameters for this model were initially determined by the use of real data analysis and experimentation. This paper explores the parameterisation and verification of the model through data analysis and by use of a genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that a GA can be used to produce not just an optimised match, but results that match those derived by expert analysis through rational exploration. This may suggest that despite the apparent nonlinear and complex nature of the system, there are a limited number of optimal or near optimal behaviours given its constraints, and that both user-driven and GA solutions converge on them. </jats:p>",

These include women's right to be informed about the contraceptive method and its mechanism of action, pharmacists’conscientious objection concerning the dispensing of emergency contraceptive pills, and rights and equality of access to the method, especially for poor women and minorities. In both countries, arguments in support of expanding access to the pills were shaped by two competing orientations toward health and sexuality. The first, “harm reduction,” promotes emergency contraception as attenuating the public health risks entailed in sex. The second orientation regards access to pills as a question of women's right to engage in nonprocreative sex and to choose from among all reproductive health‐care options. The authors contend that arguments for expanding access to emergency contraceptive pills that frame issues in terms of health and science are insufficient bases for drug regulation; ultimately, women's health is also a matter of women's rights.</jats:p>",

A small business is not necessarily a little big business, so the elaborate corporate strategic planning process may not be strictly applicable to small enterprises. Consequently, within the constraints of their \"smallness\" what approaches to strategic planning can entrepreneurs use that will represent a middle ground of planning paralysis and no planning at all? This paper critically evaluates the importance and benefits of strategic planning to SMEs. It suggests that if planning is tailored to the appropriate stage of development of a typical small enterprise, then the few that may evolve as they grow could be developed into a strategic plan that provides direction for future growth.</jats:p>"

During normal operation these wells flow to a common separator at the topsides. Production allocation to each well is done by subtracting the topsides separator measurement by the subsea multiphase flow meter reading dedicated to one of the wells and manually splitted between the other two wells. When the topsides separator started showing some water production, more rigorous well testing is required to know where the water comes from. The information is crucial for the depletion plan of the field. Since well testing would cause some production deferment, its objectives were expanded to include subsea pigging valve integrity testing, subsea multiphase flow meter validation, and rigorous fluid sampling. The program was executed smoothly and met all its objectives. The formation water was identified from the unexpected well; thus suggested re-visiting the reservoir model. Although not predicted by the transient simulation works, slugging was experienced when the weakest well was producing by itself but it was managed through topsides choking. The key success for the smooth operation was a well-thought plan developed by a multi discipline team and the guidelines based on transient simulation works.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>King and King West oil fields are 100% BP operated and located in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The fields consist of three subsea wells, i.e. King D5 and D6 wells and King West D3 well located in a water depth ranging between 5200 and 5400 ft. They are tied back to the Marlin Tension Leg Platform (TLP) located in 3200 ft water depth. D3 well is connected to D5 well through a 2.3 miles, 6 by 10 inches pipe-in-pipe flowline. D5 and D6 wells are then connected to the TLP via a 17 miles, 8 by 12 inches dual active heating flowlines (Figure 1). The flowlines connecting D5 and D6 wells to the TLP are designated as the West and East flowlines, respectively. A remotely operated subsea pigging valve located close to D6 well is normally open. D5 and D6 wells are producing from the same reservoir while D3 well is producing from another reservoir. For reservoir management purposes, D3 well is equipped with a subsea multiphase flow meter (SS MPFM) located in a jumper between the wellhead and the flowline.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Fig. 1- King/King West Field Layout</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Marlin TLP processes production stream coming from 3 dry tree wells (two oil wells and one gas well) and 5 subsea wells (three oil wells and two gas wells). The well fluids go to three three-phase separator (HP, Test, and IP) set at the same pressure (Figure 2). The oil flows through the LP separator and the gas goes to the compression system before they both going to the export system. The produced water is treated and dumped overboard. D3, D5, and D6 wells are normally flow to the IP separator. However, the topsides piping and manifold systems allow any well to flow to any separator providing it does not upset the plant, mainly the water treatment process</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

To date, only stationary tumors have been treated. In the presence of motion, scanned ion beam therapy is not yet possible because of interplay effects between scanned beam and target motion which can cause severe mis-dosage. We have started a project to treat tumors that are subject to respiratory motion. A prototype beam application system for target tracking with the scanned pencil beam has been developed and commissioned.</jats:p><jats:p>To facilitate treatment planning for tumors that are subject to organ motion, we have extended our standard treatment planning system TRiP to full 4D functionality. The 4D version of TRiP allows to calculate dose distributions in the presence of motion. Furthermore, for motion mitigation techniques tracking, gating, rescanning, and internal margins optimization of treatment parameters has been implemented. 4D calculations are based on 4D computed tomography data, deformable registration maps, organ motion traces, and beam scanning parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>We describe the methods of our 4D treatment planning approach and demonstrate functionality of the system for phantom as well as patient data.</jats:p>",

One approach to bring surveillance and planning together in a quantitative manner is to use a series of discrete reservoir descriptions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>There have been some recent advances in quantifying the value of surveillance1,2 and in developing depletion options3,4,5 that span the range from pattern balance to new field development. Previous work has generally been based on a single reservoir description, with the assumption that a pattern balance option developed on the single model is suitable for application in the field. This paper covers the extension to multiple models, where we can seek the optimum choice of things that we can control in the depletion plan across the multiple reservoir models that we can't control. We can use surveillance to try to distinguish between models if we can identify the surveillance prize.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Informed by the surveillance prize, the next step is to test different surveillance options to search for the most effective, with a quantitative business value.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The surveillance most likely to be of use to pattern balancing is interference and multirate well testing, where the use of discrete models allows the reservoir engineer to explicitly test how the different reservoir models will behave.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>All of this requires the efficient handling of large amounts of information, enabled by a combination of computer assisted tools such as BP's TDRM6 and effective reservoir monitoring and data mining through technologies such as the Field of the Future program7,8.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>There has been considerable work reported on the task of optimizing pattern balance9, which even for a single known reservoir can consume large amounts of simulation time.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A typical process has involved developing a depletion plan on a single model, and using adjoint techniques to find an improved production scheme10. The production and injection controls can include rate changes, but the bang-bang option where the chokes are either open or closed has the advantage of limiting the degrees of freedom whilst still allowing near optimal production11.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The step in this study is the use of multiple alternative history matches. If the history match process were performed correctly, we should have a range of models that captures the true reservoir description, as well as alternatives that show the range still allowed within the constraints of surveillance2,12 information. We can test the same depletion plan on the different alternatives and gain a better understanding of what outcomes are possible, and search for an operational approach that satisfy the requirements for managing risk and delivering incremental value. We have to be careful in the selection of models from the history match process, since any technique other than an exhaustive search must have introduced a bias. Selecting models at random from a list of those acceptable to surveillance is only acceptable if the search routine itself has not introduced a bias13.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The key result is that the smaller depletion plan options such as pattern balance are sensitive to the reservoir description. As a consequence, any production optimisation has to account for subsurface uncertainty. Of greatest concern is where the options are highly specific to each possible reservoir description. For Harding, the range in outcomes for a particular depletion plan precludes a clear decision as to which depletion plan is better, identifying a surveillance prize.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Europe’s cities are changing. Though not as breathtaking and overwhelming as elsewhere in this world, the transformation of its urban areas clearly points to forces that are as fundamental and irrevocable, in Europe as well as elsewhere. Its extensive local tradition of state-induced planning has increasingly come under stress through liberal reforms compounding with the forces of capital and globalization – forces which it seeks to benefit of as well as compensate for. In urban design, the question of who produces the city and its environment, has therefore become more than just a marginal issue. As the production of urban physical space increasingly takes shape through an interplay (a so-called co-production) of many actors and agents, urban design is increasingly having to face up to this challenge. The paper focuses on issues of urban design within a larger urban territory, situated on a regional scale. It draws on research carried out in and around the city of Amsterdam (Holland), and focuses on the urban disciplines’ changing position within this particular European context. Starting from current practices covering Amsterdam’s urban fringe, it will try to contextualize these efforts, putting them into perspective to the development of what essentially still is periurban space: a regional territory in between urban centers that defies clear representation and delineation. The question will be raised how and to what extent the urban disciplines (urban design and urbanism) can be seen to contribute to this elusive territory. Starting from a range of interpretive maps and schemes, this text will try to define an alternative approach. It redefines the territory as a feasible field for design interventions, thereby assessing design’s agency in terms of the shared interests and possibilities that it might allow to open up.  Peri-urban developments epitomize, to a certain extent, the current state of urban planning in Holland. Operating in the periphery of central city developments, its piecemeal and rather discontinuous development comes about in spite of the country’s extensive tradition in planning and collective scheme-making. For many decades, city planners have been working hard to contain Amsterdam as a city within clear formal bounds. However, the plans that try to keep the city’s wider regional territory to an order currently seem driven rather by failure of containment and control than by adaptation to development forces. This current paradox in planning lies at the heart of developments in the urban fringe. As the region becomes a growing arena of planning aspirations - market forces and institutional forces of all sorts and sizes - these developments also question the urbanist métier itself, casting doubt on its devices and their remaining agency. This paper, therefore, goes by the assumption, that as the ‘overall plan’ becomes more and more implicated, there will be a growing need for urban design to explicitly mediate and reclaim its position within a growing field of multiple actors. Rather than any defined or demarcated physical entity, this very field of enterprises (past and present) defines the current object of urban design. It is the material terrain for both urbanism and this paper.</jats:p>",

Our evaluation of  Probabilistic-FF shows its fine scalability in a range of probabilistic domains, constituting a several orders of magnitude improvement over previous results in this area.

In order to enhancing the efficiency of the assembly sequence\nplanning, knowledge-based Petri net, combining an usual Petri net with expert’s knowledge and\nexperiences, is proposed to construct the assembly model. With the complexity of the product, the\nproduct’s assembly model size will be too large to analysis. So the basic subnets are used to reduce\nthe large PN.

The main challenger for product family planning originates from difficulties in mapping customer needs to product family specifications. This paper intends to develop a method to improve the mapping process by reusing knowledge from purchased products according to the satisfied customer needs. A knowledge discovery model for product family planning is proposed, where clustering is adopted to partition the purchased products so that commonality of product family could be effectively addressed and rough set is employed to extract the more concise decision rules. A case study of air condition is reported to illustrate the feasibility of proposed approach and associated algorithms.</jats:p>"

Conspicuous by its absence until recently has been any systematic discussion of leadership, and more specifically the process of succession planning. In this paper I will argue that neglect of succession planning reflects a series of widespread assumptions which, even if once valid, can no longer inform strategic planning for academic libraries. Although it is clear that there are risks attached to succession planning, the experience of Cambridge University Library highlights both the need for such an exercise and the advantages that it can bring to the profession of academic librarianship as a whole.</jats:p>"

Il suo carteggio con il filosofo francese Louis Couturat, recentemente pubblicato, maturato intorno al problema di una lingua internazionale per la comunicazione scientifica, evidenzia anche altri aspetti della personalità di Peano, ma soprattutto mette in luce l’impegno di Couturat nelle proposte di soluzione di tale problema. I due protagonisti convengono sulla necessità dell’adozione di una lingua artificiale, ma all’atto della scelta le vedute non sono più coincidenti. La nascita dell’Ido e il passaggio entusiasta al nuovo progetto da parte di Couturat, che prima era un appassionato fautore dell’esperanto, mentre Peano rimane un fautore del suo latino sine flexione, raffredda i rapporti tra i due e il loro contatto si interrompe bruscamente. Il carteggio è pubblicato con grande apparato critico, accuratezza di documentazione e acutezza di interpretazioni, anche se rimane qualche minima sbavatura. La questione se gli sforzi di Couturat e la nascita dell’Ido abbiano portato un vantaggio alla soluzione della comunicazione internazionale rimane senza una risposta definitiva.</jats:p>",

In building terms, an ecologically fit building involves the existence of appropriate schemes of enclosures and exposures of indoor spaces which is achieved through fundamental building features like relations with the ground, properties of building mass, treatment of the building envelop and roof performance.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>While the debate on the conflicting aspects of the two extremes, namely the international style and regionalism, continues to occupy architectural media, a new paradigm of place dependent ecological architecture has to be formulated. In this connection it is not surprising to notice that vernacular built form based on building traditions are ecologically fit and may well constitute a sound source of information. This study aims at deciphering relevant clues to be utilized as design guidelines through the analysis of fundamental building features of vernacular built environments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering the complexity and uncertainty of production planning in large manufacturing enterprise, hierarchical planning and scheduling is an effective solution to overcome the difficulty of scheduling both in long term and short term. Choosing a discrete task-oriented manufacturing factory as prototype, a hierarchical planning and scheduling model is developed, which consists of key resource leveling, detailed operation scheduling and workshop control. The upper level optimizes the bottleneck resource allocation based on aggregate networks of product, to make a feasible long term plan; short term schedule is then generated in medium level, using more detailed network; the schedule is finally executed in bottom level, which introduces a re-scheduling strategy to eliminate the plan error. To solve the model, the universal aggregate task network model and the algorithm for each level are researched. The simulation result demonstrated that the hierarchical method is valid and valuable in practice.</jats:p>"

La angla disvastiĝis rapide inter eŭropanoj, sed samtempe ankaŭ la aliaj fremdaj lingvoj estas lernataj pli ofte ol antaŭe. Ĉiu plivastigo de EU plifortigis la pozicion de la angla, sed la angla estas same ofte parolata ol la franca aŭ la germana, eĉ en la ses unuaj ŝtatoj-membroj, kvankam denaskaj parolatoj de la angla estas tre malmultaj en tiuj landoj.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper is devoted to the analysis of the main con- temporaty notions of metropolization in the doctrine of the EU, its development, pluses and minuses and to the consideration of the present processes taking place in this respect in modern- day Lithuania.\n\n\nIn the beginning the author widely points to the main terms, such as metropolis, region metropolitan region, and shortly reviews the history of the EU, its territory planning principles. He reveals the early roots of these conceptions found in the works of utopian thinkers – Sir Thomas More, Robert Owen – productively continued in the territory planning blueprints of the19th century accomplished by A. Soria у Mata and E. Howard. An important stage of modern regional planning, paving the way to the later EU steps in this sphere, were wide-scale planning projects of the early decades of the 20th century and especially post-war regional programmes like Great London development. All these achievements of the past in regional planning enabled to arrive at an idea of uniting efforts on a European scale which took place in 1970 and to proclaim the Europe’s Regional Planning Chart seventeen years later. The prominent Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992 finally balanced the interests of the whole Europe and laid down the fundamentals of its “common home”.\n\n\nThe regional situation in Lithuania, as in all the new EU member states, is rather multipartite. Its greatest drawback is lack of its own representative in the highest echelon of the Baltic Sea Region urban categories – in the composition of cities officially included into the list of the so-called european Cities. This status provides the most prestigious situation and evident advantages in the international urban network as well as in the intercon- nectional relations and cooperation of the largest metropolies. Eventually the grade of euro City presents as if an important “gate” to the wide field of various beneficial actions overgrowing national borders. The author reports his position towards Lithuania’s abilities “to delegate” its representative to the top of the BSR city hierarchy.\n\n\nAccording to the arguments given in the paper, an exclusive chance to achieve this international appreciation is through employing a unique and unprecedented situation of the country, namely, existence of the twin cities of Vilnius and Kaunas, similarity of their size and typological feature, their close many-sided cooperation, distinction by intensive oncoming commuting flows and so on. Studies of labour market show that in this spontaneous urban belt a qualitatively new model of “job-residing” location comes into being: to settle in one city and to work in the other one. Together with improving communication between these cities and mounting traffic rate, this process will certainly flourish. By a reasonable regulation and stimulation of these spontaneous processes, a great combined metropolitan unit (“dipolis”) containing Vilnius and Kaunas can be formed.\n\n\nInexorable processes of globalization definitively stimulate necessity to shake-up local and national economies, to revise essentially inveterate principles of territory planning. Processes taking place globally within the last decades show unceasing trends to join cities, towns and townships network into united polycentral or bipolar systems along the main communication channels. A model of concentrated location of urban units (as the opposite to their geographically dispersed, gradually developed network suggested by W.Christaller) seems to be more rational and advantageous in numerous aspects.\n\n\nTherefore, resuming all these considerations, a new essential question arrises: is the idea of sustainable development formulated in 1987 by Gro Harlem Brundtland the only and undisputed alternative in territorial development?\n\n\nMetropolizacijos procesai ES teritorinio planavimo doktrinoje ir Lietuva\n\n\nSantrauka\n\n\nPeržvelgiama Europos Sąjungos sukūrimo chronologija, jos teritorinio planavimo doktrinos ištakos, pagrindiniai Europos „bendrųjų namų“ pamatus padėjusios Mastrichto sutarties teiginiai. Atskleidžiamos šiuolaikinių globalizacijos procesų stimuliuojamų didelių metropolinių regionų formavimosi procesų priežastys. Pritariama vis dažniau pasigirstančioms abejonėms, ar kelis dešimtmečius vyravusios darniosios plėtros samprata teritorinio planavimo procese yra vienintelė ir nenuginčijama alternatyva. Šiuo požiūriu Baltijos jūros regiono ir nusistovėjusių teritorinių struktūrinių vienetų (NUTS ) kontekste Lietuva stoko ja ryškaus urbanistinio centro, galinčio pretenduoti į oficialiai pripažintų European City rango miestų sąrašą. Vienintelė galimybė tokiam metropoliniam centrui sukurti – tai Lietuvos Respublikos teritorijos bendrajame plane numatytas Vilniaus ir Kauno potencialų sujungimas.</jats:p>",

Higher scores on the BTPI Closed-Mindedness and Low Expectation of Benefit scales were associated with more negative attitudes toward counseling. Furthermore, higher scores on Closed-Mindedness, Problems in Relationship Formation, and the Treatment Di ficulty Composite were associated with lower expectations to become actively involved in counseling. Participants reporting higher levels of psychological distress on the BTPI were less likely to expect warm therapeutic relationships and to take active roles in treatment. Relationships between attitudes and expectations about counseling were also evaluated. Participants reporting more positive attitudes toward counseling reported higher expectations to work with warm, empathic counselors and to take active roles in counseling and lower expectations for prescriptive, doctor-patient relationships with counselors. </jats:p>",

There has been less interest, though, in critically probing the circumstances under which participatory research takes place: in other words, the sociospatial contexts within which such research approaches are chosen. One explanation may be that participatory action researchers sometimes infer that the reasons for their choices are primarily ethical and political. In this paper, I consider this and other assumptions about participatory action research, drawing upon my own involvement in two action research projects in Ottawa, Canada. I argue that reflecting on this question is a particularly timely undertaking, given the ‘actually existing neoliberalisms’ in which professionalization and partnerships are becoming more prominent. I begin by reviewing what has been said about participatory action research and the circumstances under which this approach is likely to be selected, and reflect on how these discussions might be enhanced by linking their circumstances specifically to emerging analyses about spaces of neoliberalism. Using these insights, I then examine the sociospatial context for the two studies and how their characteristics had specific effects on their methodological choices. All of these elements provide the scaffolding for consideration of the rationalities that supported the usage of participatory research in one study and the lack of engagement with this approach in the other. </jats:p>",

The workshop outcomes highlighted the need for greater institutionalisation of participatory processes within decision-making structures and wider society, coupled with improved transparency in decision-making and increased emphasis on participatory democracy in the formal education system. Higher levels of funding and logistical support for participatory processes were also recommended, along with improvements to practice through continued innovation and testing of methods, as well as enhanced opportunities for collaborative learning from past experiences. Challenges in representing the values and views of diverse publics were identified as a central concern. The HAP approach provided a systematic way of exploring individual and collective thoughts on a complex topic as well as a means of developing ideas into practical action plans. Reflections on the benefits and shortcomings of this method are offered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Unlike most foods, milk is produced fresh at least twice every day, thus recreating, over 700 times a year, a commodity ‘designed’ by the combination of nature, commerce, and law. The paper is a study of the ontogenesis of this commodity in Britain since 1800, stressing the emergence of two new objectivities: dairy science and the law on adulteration. In the words of Christopher Hamlin, what mattered was the “manufacture of certainty, however flimsy that certainty might later be shown to be.” This was achieved by the collection of samples, the generation of facts by the deployment of the laboratory technologies of physics and chemistry, and a semimonopoly over the truth-power of dairy science that was gradually built up by the large commercial companies. A foundation of state-sponsored regulation provided an official legitimation of compositional standards that suited the interests of capital but ignored ‘natural’ variations in quality and often pilloried innocent producers. The public eventually became accustomed to the regulated quality of the milk in its ‘pinta’ and assumed it to be natural. Even the standardization of composition since 1993 has caused very little disquiet among the consuming public, although milk is now a fully constructed commodity like any other dairy product. Mechanical modernity has at last triumphed over a century of ‘milk as it came from the cow’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urbanization in India and south Asia has generated one of the horrifying pictures of poverty in the form of Slum. It has been a very difficult task of dealing with this settlement form which has been the part of many of the growing urban centres of the country with almost 47% population of cities as slums. Aranya project represent a new paradigm in urban planning to resolve the growing issue and discuss one of the critical aspect of urban design and town planning approach with the economically weaker section of the urban population. What makes it special is – the idea of ‘Planning and Urban Design framework of the settlement where people build themselves’. The framework was evolved through understanding the needs of the people. An attempt was made to address the issues of identity and sense of community which is often missing in conventional projects.  The site and services approach to planning and design for the 65,000 population in the Indore city is a new philosophy for handling the urban crisis of slum settlements. The project is the synthesis of the cultural, social and economic needs of the slum population and the more mundane aspect of cost effective site and services, creating one of the richest fabric for ideal habitation of the poor people. The concept for the project is defined by the broad goals of a good habitat – vitality, imageability, equity, efficiency, flexibility and feasibility.  The Aranya project demonstrates the vital aspects of urban design in its design of appropriate typology, hierarchy of streets and open space, housing cluster with human scale, flexibility in addition and growth of built form and an efficient sites and services layout integrated with the architecture of the township. The indigenous character of built form provides a setting for the continuation of fundamental values of society. As per the traditional Indian towns, the level of publicness and the degree of privacy is maintained through a spatial order. The clarity of spatial hierarchy enhances the imageability of the settlement. This was arrived at through a rigorous research of the Indian traditional settlement forms. The Aranya plan uses these universal principles of hierarchy in urban design by creating the centre with public amenities and major urban space moving outwards with series of streets and clusters of houses in hierarchy creating more private residential public realms. The street is also seen as an urban space with human activities and multiplicity. The emphasis on developing a cost efficient layout for services has brought down the cost of the project significantly and hence an important ingredient of the design of the settlement.  Aranya has become the model not only in the professional and the academic world, but also with administration and the implementing agencies. It has been the case study for many of the similar projects. The project has looked at the implementation process as a vital aspect in such a project for the poor. It defines construction of the minimum, so as to allow people to add and develop the house as per their requirements and affordability in the future. This inbuilt into the project, the aspect of sense of belonging and identity, which is a strong social issue for the habitation of the poor.  The efficient site planning, a fresh approach to infrastructure and using the strong traditional urban design principles of the country with a hope to provide the most ideal environment for living to the poor has produced the example of great urban design in the context of rapid urbanization. It has not only been accepted by the people but been a case study for further research in the field. Keywords: Low-cost housing, Innovative sites and services projects, land-use efficiency, affordability, socio-cultural responsive architecture, innovative infrastructure.</jats:p>",

While wildlife and fisheries habitat concerns have strongly influenced the management of national forests over the past decade, the quantity and quality of water is now becoming one of the top priorities. Competition for downstream use of water and instream flows required to maintain or improve aquatic habitat conditions, suggest that the US Forest Service considers water yields to be an important measure of output from new forest plans. While significant research has been focused on the development of hydrologic models, the challenge is to now apply what has been learned to policy analysis. And when assessing a resource that moves across a landscape, a multi-ownership perspective may be needed.

Socialist models for non-market economic calculation have been strongly influenced by the equilibrium model of neoclassical economics. The Austrians contend that these models overlook the essence of the calculation problem by assuming the availability of knowledge that can be acquired only through the market process itself. But the debate in political economy has not yet considered the recent emergence of agent-based systems and their applications to resource allocation problems. Agent-based simulations of market exchange offer a promising approach to fulfilling the dynamic functions of knowledge encapsulation and discovery that the Austrians show to be performed by markets. Further research is needed in order to develop an agent-based approach to the calculation problem, as it is formulated by the Austrians. Given that the macro-level objectives of agent-based systems can be easily engineered, they could even become a desirable alternative to the real markets that the Austrians favour.</jats:p>",

As a result, cities have changed from small, isolated centers to large, inter-connected economic, physical, and environmental locales. Lahore, once famous for its gardens, is facing the growing problem of urban sprawl, resulting in mushrooming of shopping plazas, traffic congestion, loss of open spaces. The city has become a hot bed of multinational companies, banks, telecommunication companies and international food chains. Huge investments, particularly after 9/11, have targeted Lahore and major roads have become gigantic construction sites. Gulberg, once a high class residential area gave way to rampant commercialization and its Main Boulevard paved the way for offices and plazas.  This temporal and spatial dimensions of the land use change from the residential to commercial are little known. The policymakers and public continue to raise concerns about the effects that unchecked transformation of the city landscape will culcated. It is not until we study this metamorphosis from a spatial perspective responding to commercial from residential that have occurred and predict the impacts of changes to come. Without having a clear understanding of these changes, it would be impossible to improve quality of city life. The objective of this research paper is to record these changes for the professionals and policy makers as guidelines. The study of historical perspective and existing information would be beneficial in formulating sound policies for guiding environmentally sustainable growth.</jats:p>",

Strategic preparedness planning goes beyond traditional product/ market strategic planning by focusing on disaster prevention, containment, and response roles. Hospitals, because of their unique mission, size, complexity, the types of materials they handle, and the types of patients they encounter, are especially vulnerable to natural and human-initiated disasters. In addition, when disasters occur, hospitals must develop well-conceived first responder (receiver) strategies. This paper argues the case for strategic preparedness planning for hospitals and proposes a process for this relatively new and much needed type of planning.</jats:p>",

Hydrologic, hydraulic and structural designs of the structures were made using relevant information on topography, soil, rainfall, HFL etc. The dry period discharge in different streams varied from 0.03 to 3.756 m3/s, which can be used as minor irrigation sources by constructing diversion structures and canals. The surface runoff in different streams varied from 21.24 to 111.08 Mha-mm. Part of water can be stored for irrigation in the dry period. Gated structures designed for water diversion will be helpful in combating the siltation problem.</jats:p>"

Examination of organic standards on composting, with a focus on characterizations of composting microbes, reveals the very compromised ability of the NOSB to effect change, however, despite its efforts to build common ground between institutions with very different cultures and historical interests. A focus on discourses of microbes provides insights into the accomplishments of and limits to the influence of the NOSB as well as the larger organic movement. Organizational tactics of the NOSB are best understood within the larger context of institutional commitments to specific forms of agriculture. </jats:p>",

The case shows how communities have sought to confront some of the pernicious social, economic, and environmental effects of relentless modernisation and development by reviving a variety of social institutions and associational practices that underpinned social capital and the ‘moral community’ of the past. Catalytic in this process has been a local Buddhist abbot and ‘development monk’ who has drawn together Buddhist values and northeastern Thai traditional culture to rebuild social capital in order to construct an alternative, neolocalist model of development which these days can be found mirrored in a growing number of rural locations across Thailand. </jats:p>",

Here, the causes of workforce planning inertia are examined, as are examples of promising, if not yet widely adopted, best practices. Finally, the author introduces an integrated model he has been developing that forges stronger links between workforce planning and management of the employment framework itself. The model, which is still a work in progress, is applied to the particular challenge of managing the aging workforce. </jats:p>",

In this paper I begin by reflecting on everyday difficulties using participatory methods with a group of young people who belonged to a youth forum in Stoke-on-Trent, England. These difficulties point to the way that research spaces constitute contexts which can enable the production of certain kinds of knowledge, and to the way that such contexts are influenced by other spaces where people might be asked to participate and self-represent. For my fieldwork participants, official or government-led initiatives around participation in decision making were often seen as problematic. However, I also argue that the young people drew on more embodied or experiential forms of knowledge in their activities, generated through participation in everyday collective practices and sociability. Such knowledge may not have been articulated but was nonetheless powerful. This suggests new ways of thinking about participation and empowerment, both for research projects and for other kinds of intervention. </jats:p>",

Empirical studies are needed that evaluate new forms of collaborative management and assess initiative outcomes. Trail planning and management systems on the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia provided a unique opportunity to design and evaluate a participatory design known as a search conference. This article reports on the design, execution, and outcome-based assessment of a trails search conference, examining specifically the impact of the conference on social learning and trust building outcomes. Generally, the search conference was well received and social learning as well as trust building did occur. Resource managers are encouraged to use a search conference format to explore diverse perspectives on a set of management issues or identifying the range of concerns that different people have.</jats:p>",

The elicited information is presented as influence diagrams and the discussion looks at their usefulness in WDM strategy design and the specification of suitable modelling techniques. The paper concludes that IDs themselves are useful in developing model structures for use in evidence-based reasoning models such as Bayesian Networks, and this is in keeping with the objectives set out in the introduction of integrating DSTs into existing decision processes. The paper will be of interest to modellers, decision-makers and scientists involved in designing tools to support resource conservation strategy implementation.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the difficulty in dealing with the complexity of urban systems and the related difficulty of analyzing and forecasting are twofold: one kind of difficulty lies in the complexity of the system itself, and the other is due to the actions of actors, which are \"acts of freedom.\" Correspondingly, the process of urban planning requires a set of techniques and models that have proved to be of great potential for management of communication, participation, consensus-building and system' simulation. In this paper, we describe the peculiarity of the articulated set of tools that should be used to support planning, allowing the setting up and management of processes of participation and communication tailored to the needs of specific projects — a set of friendly tools that make the relationship between technicians, clients and users effective and efficacious. Following this discussion we present a very flexible software environment based on cellular automata (Cellular Automata General Environment — CAGE) that can be used to simulate planning decisions and can be coupled with other modules dealing with the \"social side\" of complexity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent representations of human–animal relationships in farming have tended to focus on human experience, and to essentialise animal subjectivity in granting them a centred subjectivity akin to that assumed to be possessed by humans. Instead, this paper develops an understanding of the coproduction of domestic livestock animal subjectivities and the technologies used in farming domestic livestock animals, based on an analysis of texts produced by agricultural scientists, farmers, and equipment manufacturers relating to the effects of introducing new robotic milking technologies into dairy farming. Drawing particularly on Foucault's conceptions of subjectivity and biopower, I explore the emergence of particular forms of bovine subjectivity associated with robotic milking. Through an analysis of a wide range of secondary sources, the paper shows that, although robotic technologies have been presented as offering cows ‘freedom’, better welfare, and a more ‘natural’ experience, other relations of domination come into effect in association with such technologies and their spatialities. These are expressed through the manipulation of animal bodies and behaviours, in expectations that cows move and act in particular ways, and through normalisation and individualisation processes. I argue that nonhuman animal subjectivities in agriculture are thus heterogeneous, fluid, and contingent on specific sets of relationships between animals, humans, and technologies and on specific agricultural microgeographies. The paper ends by acknowledging that these relationships need further empirical exploration in terms of both attempts to understand animals’ changed experiences and ways of being, and their ethical implications in particular situations. </jats:p>",

The importance of geographical inequality and unevenness to the process of reshaping welfare has been widely recognised, and the fragmentation and decentralisation of employment and social policies are giving rise to the production of new welfare spaces, which institutionalise the new arrangements, helping to make up neoliberalism in practice. These issues are discussed with the help of case studies of two contrasting areas: Sheffield, a city recently experiencing economic restructuring and high levels of labour-market adjustment and employment deprivation; and Milton Keynes, a city which has been a growth area within the South East since the 1960s and which is earmarked for further employment and the location of planned population and employment growth. The ways in which new welfare spaces are being produced is explored through a consideration of the configuration of partnerships around the governance of workfare, welfare, and competitiveness within these cities. </jats:p>",

Moving away from an economistic view of informal work, I argue that, while there is no single power relationship experienced by all informal workers, informal work more generally can be understood as a space in which multiple actors struggle over meaning and control through the deployment of diverse forms of power. The results presented here suggest that, while Argentines view informal work as a place of exploitation by employers and subjugation by the state, in some circumstances it can also be understood as a space of resistance, as workers attempt, through informal work, to create spaces hidden from control, to redefine the norms and rules which govern this space, and to transform the conditions of existence established by other actors. In focusing on the political function of informal work, this paper attempts to bring to light the complex relationships of power between the economy, the state, employers, and workers within the context of Argentina's economic and political crisis. </jats:p>",

Because of their distinctive vulnerabilities, it is crucial that pediatric needs are incorporated into every stage of disaster planning. Individuals, families, and communities can help mitigate the effects of disasters on pediatric populations through ongoing awareness and preventive practices. Mitigation efforts also can be achieved through education and training of the healthcare workforce. Preparedness activities include gaining Emergency Medical Services for Children Pediatric Facility Recognition, conducting pediatric disaster drills, improving pediatric surge capacity, and ensuring that the needs children are incorporated into all levels of disaster plans. Pediatric response can be improved in a number of ways, including: (1) enhanced pediatric disaster expertise; (2) altered decontamination protocols that reflect pediatric needs; and (3) minimized parent-child separation. Recovery efforts at the pediatric level include promoting specific mental health therapies for children and incorporating children into disaster relief and recovery efforts.

We now asked whether the brain maintains separate representations of the spatial goals for planning hand trajectory and final position. One group of subjects learned a 30° visuomotor rotation about the hand's starting point while performing a movement reversal task (“slicing”) in which they reversed direction at one target and terminated movement at another. This task required accuracy in acquiring a target mid-movement. A second group adapted while moving to—and stabilizing at—a single target (“reaching”). This task required accuracy in specifying an intended final position. We examined how learning in the two tasks generalized both to movements made from untrained initial positions and to movements directed toward untrained targets. Shifting initial hand position had differential effects on the location of reversals and final positions: Trajectory directions remained unchanged and reversal locations were displaced in slicing whereas final positions of both reaches and slices were relatively unchanged. Generalization across directions in slicing was consistent with a hand-centered representation of desired reversal point as demonstrated previously for this task whereas the distributions of final positions were consistent with an eye-centered representation as found previously in studies of pointing in three-dimensional space. Our findings indicate that the intended trajectory and final position are represented in different coordinate frames, reconciling previous conflicting claims of hand-centered (vectorial) and eye-centered representations in reach planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary </jats:bold> The objective of this report is to summarize the results on survival and complication rates of different designs of fixed dental prostheses (FDP) published in a series of systematic reviews. Moreover, the various parameters for survival and risk assessment are to be used in attempt to perform treatment planning on the basis of scientific evidence. Three electronic searches complemented by manual searching were conducted to identify prospective and retrospective cohort studies on FDP and implant‐supported single crowns (SC) with a mean follow‐up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been examined clinically at the follow‐up visit. Failure and complication rates were analyzed using random‐effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary estimates of 5‐ and 10‐year survival proportions. Meta‐analysis of the studies included indicated an estimated 5‐year survival of conventional tooth‐supported FDP of 93·8%, cantilever FDP of 91·4%, solely implant‐supported FDP of 95·2%, combined tooth‐implant‐supported FDP of 95·5% and implant‐supported SC of 94·5% as well as resin‐bonded bridges 87·7%. Moreover, after 10 years of function the estimated survival decreased to 89·2% for conventional FDP, to 80·3% for cantilever FDP, to 86·7% for implant‐supported FDP, to 77·8% for combined tooth‐implant‐supported FDP, to 89·4% for implant‐supported SC and to 65% for resin‐bonded bridges. When planning prosthetic rehabilitations, conventional end‐abutment tooth‐supported FDP, solely implant‐supported FDP or implant‐supported SC should be the first treatment option. Only as a second option, because of reasons such as financial aspects patient‐centered preferences or anatomical structures cantilever tooth‐supported FDP, combined tooth‐implant‐supported FDP or resin‐bonded bridges should be chosen.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Scottish citizens enjoy 25% more spending per head on public services than English citizens, but almost nothing is known about the countries' relative needs and hence about how far this gap is defensible. We explore their spending needs for local authority services, which cover over half the spending concerned. We first compare needs for local personal social services. To do so, we take the complex formulae with which the Westminster government assesses the needs of English local authorities, and we use these formulae to assess the needs of Scottish local authorities. The formulae suggest that Scotland needs 15.3% more per head than does England. We then combine these results with those of two earlier papers exploring other local services to show that the English formulae put Scotland's per capita needs for local authority services as a whole at about 6% above England's. However, we also compare the relative needs of Scottish local authorities as assessed by the English formulae with their relative needs as assessed by the Scottish needs formulae currently used by Holyrood, and we find major differences. This suggests either that at least one country assesses needs with seriously flawed formulae, or that the two countries have different conceptions of need. </jats:p>",

Consequently, conflicts of interest arise between human economic activities and biodiversity conservation. We used a systematic approach to conservation planning to explore different conservation scenarios for the Apennine populations of wolves</jats:italic> (Canis lupus) <jats:italic>and bears</jats:italic> (Ursus arctos marsicanus) <jats:italic>in Italy. The conservation measures we considered were electrified fences and guard dogs to prevent wolves and bears from preying on sheep. We used habitat suitability models of the two species as an estimate of their distributions. Across the study area, we estimated the potential intensity of conflict caused by predation on sheep and the cost of the antipredator measures. We examined scenarios for the conservation of wolves and bears that identified systems of sites where antipredator measures should be applied to either minimize the economic cost of the plan or tackle a predetermined amount of conflict. The overall cost of the conservation plans ranged between €1,486,000 and €16,876,000, depending on the scenario and on the size of the conservation target. Because potential conflict intensity (i.e., potential predation) and cost of conflict resolution were correlated, the scenarios that minimized cost also minimized the amount of conflict that was addressed. Conserving these two species by addressing their predation on sheep was up to 4.36 times more expensive than conserving them by providing suitable habitat in areas of low conflict. Yet avoiding conflicts is not always desirable because it can drastically reduce the options for conservation. Choosing a conservation plan requires consideration of the level of threat to the target species and their sensitivity to conflicts.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

In this article, she suggests that the characteristics of MSI affect the capacity of some pupils to participate in person‐centred planning.

Data were collected with the RAI-HC assessment system, in which the Activities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment Protocol (ADLCAP) is used to identify clients with rehabilitation potential. For study purposes, a client is defined as having rehabilitation potential if there was: i) improvement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home.

Through his artwork, Hurrel has attempted to adopt a material process through which place can be created performatively but, in part due to its nonrepresentational form, it proves problematic, aesthetically and longitudinally, in wholly engaging the community. We will suggest that, through variants of ‘new genre public art’ such as this, personal and place histories can be actively recreated through the redevelopment of contemporary urban landscapes, but we will also highlight the complexities and indeterminacies involved in the relationship between artwork, people, and place. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author addresses the recent proliferation of cross-border regions, or ‘Euroregions’, in Europe. It is argued that EU multilevel governance patterns generate opportunities for entrepreneurial policy organisations to attract policy tasks and resources. This is conceptualised as policy entrepreneurship and applied to a comparative case-study analysis of three Euroregions: EUREGIO (Germany – Netherlands), Viadrina (Poland – Germany), and Tyrol Euroregion (Austria – Italy). The analysis focuses on the ability of these initiatives to establish themselves as autonomous organisations. It finds considerable variation across the cases in this respect. Following on from this, the paper shows how administrative and institutional environments in different EU member states affect the ability of Euroregions to engage in policy entrepreneurship. It is concluded that it is premature to perceive Euroregions as new types of regional territorial entities; rather, they are part of the policy-innovation scenario enabled by EU multilevel governance. </jats:p>",

Using data for the Los Angeles region from 1980, 1990, and 2000, we identify employment centers and describe spatial trends in the pattern of employment inside and outside these centers. We find: (1) a remarkable degree of stability in the system of centers; (2) an increase in the average distance of jobs from the traditional core; (3) the emergence and growth of employment centers; (4) the rapid growth of dispersed employment in outer suburbs. These trends appear to defy simple models of urban evolution and call for a more nuanced portrayal of contemporary regions and the dynamics underlying spatial organization. </jats:p>",

We review the literature on the effectiveness of surrogates for conservation planning based on complementary representation. We apply a standardized approach based on a Species Accumulation Index of surrogate effectiveness to compare results from 575 tests in 27 studies. Overall, we find positive, but relatively weak, surrogacy power. Cross-taxon surrogates are substantially more effective than surrogates based on environmental data. Within cross-taxon tests, surrogacy was higher for tests within the same realm (terrestrial, marine, freshwater). Surrogacy was higher when extrapolated (rather than field) data were used. Our results suggest that practical conservation planning based on data for well-known taxonomic groups can cautiously proceed under the assumption that it captures species in less well-known taxa, at least within the same realm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of oral traditions in the reconstruction and the politicisation of collective memory has widely been recognised in post-colonial theories. Yet, the concrete application of these oral traditions by subaltern groups in projects of cultural politics has often been an ambiguous and discontinuous process. Moreover, poststructural interventions on cultural politics in social movement research, while theorising culture as a collective and dynamic process that produces meaning and shapes social relations, only rarely look at specific cultural manifestations as a privileged site for examining the construction of a subaltern politics of resistance on the ground. In this paper, I argue for oral traditions to be considered as one such specific manifestation in a subaltern cultural politics. I will elaborate this argument drawing on James Scott's conceptual framework on the public and hidden transcripts of social interaction between dominant and subordinate social groups. Beyond the restricted meaning that Scott ascribes to the hidden transcript as dialectically related to contexts of domination, however, I will extend its meaning and significance by focusing on the processes of transition of certain offstage discourses and practices when they ‘storm the stage’ and become part of the public transcript. Empirically, I will show this to be the case of the changing dynamics of mobilising oral traditions among black communities in Colombia. Through a selection of poems, verse, and stories that I recorded among black populations in the Pacific coast region of this South American country, I will show how these poetic forms as offstage discourses (and hidden transcripts) challenge dominant representations of space and are increasingly mobilised as powerful political tools (and public transcripts) in the struggle for cultural and territorial rights. All quotes, interview transcripts, and poems from the original Spanish into English have been translated by myself. </jats:p>",

Formulating and solving such a model poses challenges due to nonlinear pressure‐flowrate relations, a multicommodity network and complex production‐sharing contracts (PSC). A production allocation model is presented that can be viewed as a contractual model superimposed on an infrastructure model. The infrastructure model incorporates nonlinear pressure‐flowrate relationships for wells and pipelines, multiple qualities of gas in the trunkline network and models of facilities. The contractual model is a mathematical representation of the PSC and associated operational rules. The model features are inspired by the Sarawak Gas Production System (SGPS) in East Malaysia. A case study similar to the Sarawak Gas Production System (SGPS) is presented. The final formulation is a nonconvex mixed‐integer nonlinear program and is solved with GAMS/BARON to global optimality.

We challenge the assumption that SLPs should be primarily categorised within concepts of disability. The disability label denies the unique spatial culturolinguistic phenomenon of SLP collectivist identity by replicating traditional colonialist perspectives, and actively contributing to their ongoing oppression.

Fair trade, in particular, has attracted attention as the source of a new international moral economy. In this paper, I seek to widen the frame of discussion, bringing history, geography, and ethics into closer conversation. Looking beyond a conventional progressive narrative, I retrieve the ambivalent moralities of trade and consumption in the modern period. I highlight the role of empire shopping movements as well as of popular free trade and international distributive justice, putting imperialist consumers as well as liberals back into the picture. I offer a critique of a sequential view of traditional ‘moral economy’ being replaced by a modern demoralised ‘political economy’, which underlies current notions of ‘remoralising’ trade. Modern commerce has generated and been shaped by diverse moralities of consumption. Greater attention to the diverse social and ideological lineages of phenomena like fair trade will be useful to scholars reflecting on caring at a distance today. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the nature of legacy planning and how its importance is now recognised by both bidding teams and event planning bodies. The concept of legacy is shown to be broad, encompassing economic, social, cultural, environmental, sporting and political impacts. Several examples of good and less good practice in respect of legacy planning are examined and a detailed review of how London's 2012 organisers are learning the lessons of past major sporting events is presented. To maximise the impact of legacy for major events, this paper suggests it is critical that the legacy vision—a clear articulation of legacy benefits—is in place well in advance of the event. Six ways in which legacy benefits can be secured for major sporting events are recommended: articulating the vision for legacy development as early as possible; legacy business case evaluation; attracting private sector funding for legacy development; the delivery of venues that meet the legacy aspirations of all stakeholders; coordinated venue management and operation; and rigorous evaluation of the wider socio-economic legacy. </jats:p>",

For this, the infinite‐dimensional model is spatially discretized using finite differences. The discretized finite‐dimensional model serves as a basis for a flatness‐based feedforward control design. In the case of constant physical parameters, it is shown that the thus obtained feedforward controller converges to the feedforward controller for the original infinite‐dimensional problem in the limit as the discretization step size tends to zero. In the case of temperature‐dependent parameters, simulation results illustrate the convergence behavior. (© 2008 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

In this paper we explore whether universities can provide points of stability within which such locked-in regions can strengthen their innovation systems and attract external investment in knowledge capital. Using the case study of Twente in the eastern Netherlands, we explore whether universities can strengthen their regional innovation systems. We distinguish local networking from external-investment attraction to show that universities can become temporary venues for ‘local buzz’, building networks which become attractive to outside investors and promoting regional innovation. This suggests that an alternative approach to regional innovation policy, which we term ‘promoting smart hybridity’, may be useful in stimulating growth-based restructuring in such regions. </jats:p>",

This increase in concentration and economic power is itself understood to have evolved from the defining feature of the golden age: a rapid increase in capital investment by large-scale retailers. The author examines the role played by capital investment in the golden age, and demonstrates that whilst capital investment is negatively correlated with turnover it is positively correlated both with margins and with market share. It is suggested that this relationship is significant as it provides evidence that the golden age of retailing did indeed lead to the rise in retailers' economic power which many authors feared was taking place. </jats:p>",

One of the solutions to this problem is the application of high quality modular construction, which defines a new building process as the assembly of pre-fabricated modules in the construction site. As part of this philosophy, AUTMOD3 is an automatic modular construction software environment, developed in the frame of the EU project FutureHome. The system seamlessly integrates architectural design, planning and simulation tools in a well-known CAD program commonly used by designers. Architectural design using previously defined 3D and 2D modules or modularisation of the traditional building design are the main objectives of the AUTMOD3 design tool. The production planning and the on-site modular assembly planning are the main task to be performed by the planning tool. The AUTMOD3 assembly planning tool generates the trajectories, which can be applied directly to a robotized crane develop in the project FutureHome. </jats:p>",

This paper explores whether local environmental service provision in the UK achieves ‘territorial justice’ with respect to deprived and nondeprived neighbourhoods within cities. Territorial justice is argued to pertain when the distribution of service provision to neighbourhoods reflects levels of need for the service. Focusing on the provision of street-level environmental services in four British local authorities, the paper shows that poor and better-off neighbourhoods have different levels of need for environmental services. It then examines whether the services provided are commensurate with variations in need, using observed cleanliness levels within the neighbourhoods to assess this. The author argues that—despite an increasing policy and practice focus on targeting public services towards deprived neighbourhoods in the UK—environmental service provision does not yet take full account of the complex needs of poor places, meaning that they tend to be dirtier than their more affluent counterparts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since various crises concerning food safety in the European Union (EU), institutional reforms have been designed to regain public confidence in regulatory decisions and their expert basis. By Europeanising advisory expertise, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was also intended to help harmonise ‘science-based regulation’ and thus facilitate EU decisions. In evaluating agri-biotech products during 2003 – 05, however, the EFSA procedure extended previous expert disagreements rather than overcome them. The EFSA was designed to demonstrate that expert advice would be ‘independent, objective, and transparent’; yet tensions arose between expert experience versus independence, between transparency versus objectivity, and between harmonisation versus precaution. These conflicts have been shaped by the dominant problem diagnosis, which favours a narrow expert consensus within a specific policy view. Alternative problem diagnoses suggest that expertise should instead be pluralised, so that norms and uncertainties become more explicit. Pressure for EU reform manifests tensions between the dominant and alternative problem diagnoses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Central heating, insulation, and double glazing, such as you might find in many countries with colder climates in the northern hemisphere, are virtually lacking in Christchurch, in New Zealand's South Island. In this city, houses tend to be inadequately heated and rely primarily on a combination of open fires, log burners, and electrical heaters. This form of home heating, combined with local climatic and topographical factors, results in high levels of wintertime air pollution. While much research has been conducted into the air-pollution problem in Christchurch to date, this research has focused on physical contaminants and their effects on health, rather than on the ways in which air pollution is socially and culturally mediated and on the sense-making practices of those who create pollution and suffer its effects. Based on information drawn from focus groups, we argue that reluctance to change behaviour results partly from investments in particular cultural identities which are tied into hegemonic masculinities and understandings of national identity, such as the masculine pioneer heritage established during the colonial period. We also explore the spatial relationships that air pollution plays out within and on the ‘body’ and how it transcends and weakens the bounded body. We believe that analyses which draw on theories of hybridisation, embodiment, identity, and discourse, and which highlight the links between modes of behaviour, identity and sense of place, and the interactions between humans and nonhumans, are able to shed new light on our understandings of public perceptions and responses to air pollution in Christchurch. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in the agricultural biotechnology (agro-bio) sector. Specific objectives are to understand firm-specific strategies utilized to remain competitive in an uncertain business environment, and to examine the impact of government/policy and farmers on strategies. The controversial nature of processes used and the ethical debate surrounding genetically modified organisms (GMOs) contribute to an ongoing struggle for these firms in negotiating their position in society as innovators. Data from surveys of US-based firms and farmers are used to show how firms respond to external conditions and how farmers adjust to the GMO controversy, and, in turn, affect the business of biotech. At first cut, the data suggest that firms are worried only about science; as the survey probes into firm-level evaluation of external actors, the importance of Federal over local – regional initiatives stand out. While states are investing to promote biotechnology clusters, the lack of perceived importance of state/local level efforts to innovators is of particular significance. The discussion also notes the disconnect between policymakers and SMEs. Farmers point out the indirect effect of public opinion in sustaining the business of agro-bio. This study raises questions about gaps in our understanding of the relationship among firms (innovators), users (farmers who are the traditional innovators), and the government (regulator – facilitator) in the agro-bio subsector of the biotech industry. The need to engage other partners (food companies, wholesalers, retailers, consumer groups) in understanding the prospect of agro-bio is evident. </jats:p>",

As large physical constructions, they have the potential to affect urban form. Moreover, HEIs have also begun to act as developers and their locations have become a matter of concern for local politics. In the global era, there are a number of driving forces in the restructuring and location patterns of the HEIs in cities. The nonprofit – private foundation universities (FUs) that were introduced into the Turkish higher education (HE) system in the past decade, and in particular Koç University (KU), illustrate these issues clearly. Possible relations between globalisation and HE are presented with reference to the restructuring of the HEIs. This is related to the desire to locate at the nodes of global flows. The location of the FUs in Istanbul, Turkey, and in particular of KU, is the focus. The motivation of the actors in the process is assessed in relation to the theoretical issues. The authors present the growth coalition and local opposition that were significant in the decision-making process relating to KU. </jats:p>",

The author provides a comparative analysis of the RIS problems in the North East in the United Kingdom and Scania in Sweden and the role of universities in regional innovation policies addressing these problems. The results of this comparison question a one-size-fits-all (entrepreneurial) model to harness university-based knowledge resources for regional development.

The Intuitive Operational Planning Process (IOPP) treats planning as a highly iterative process of incremental refinement in which a single course of action is elaborated and continually evaluated for its suitability. To examine the effectiveness of the IOPP, 12 members of a reserve CF Civil Military Cooperation unit of Land Force Central Area acted as planning staffs and created plans for two simulated planning exercises. Participants employed the IOPP for one scenario and the existing CF Operational Planning Process (OPP) for another. The teams were able to successfully employ the IOPP to develop acceptable plans; however, it was not possible to determine statistically that the quality of these plans surpassed that of plans generated with the OPP because of limitations of the data set. The IOPP was judged to be very easy to use, but teams expressed less trust in it than the existing OPP. The IOPP may foster greater collaboration and commander involvement in planning than the OPP. </jats:p>",

This system involves kinematic redundancy resolution, as well as robot dynamics, including actuators model. The kinematic redundancy is taken into account through a secondary criterion of joint limits avoidance. The optimization procedure is performed subject to limitations on actuator torques and workspace, while passing through imposed poses. The Augmented Lagrangian with decoupling (ALD) technique is used to solve the resulting constrained non-convex and non-linear optimal control problem. Furthermore, the final state constraint is solved using a gradient projection. Simulations on a three degrees of freedom planar redundant serial manipulator show the effectiveness of the proposed system. </jats:p>",

There is considerable controversy surrounding the implications of its strict application for the relevant regions. The existing literature focuses primarily on the equity of the spatial changes to government per capita expenditure that would accompany such a change. In contrast, in this paper we attempt to quantify the system-wide economic consequences—the real, relative resource squeeze that accompanies the financial relative squeeze—on one devolved region, Scotland. The analysis uses a multisectoral regional computable general equilibrium modelling approach. We highlight the importance of population endogeneity, particularly since the population proportions used in the formula are now regularly updated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Despite effective treatments and preventive measures for the major causes of child illness and death in less wealthy nations, child mortality remains high in resource-poor settings due in part to ineffective health service delivery models. Methods: The Navrongo Community Health and Family Planning Project is a longitudinal community trial of alternative organizational strategies for health service delivery in a rural, impoverished area of Ghana. In one area, nurses are placed in communities with doorstep visitation and service responsibilities. A second area includes training of a local health volunteer and community involvement in health delivery. A third area combines both strategies. Under-five mortality rates were calculated and Poisson regression was used to adjust for potential confounding characteristics. Results: In areas with village-based community nurse services, under-five child mortality fell by 14% during five years of program implementation compared with before the intervention, with reductions in infant (5%), early child (18%), and late child (39%) mortality. The volunteer intervention was associated with a 14% increase in mortality, primarily driven by a 135% increase in early child mortality. Areas with both nurses and volunteers saw an 8% increase, with small increases in all age groups. Mortality in a comparison area with standard Ministry of Health services fell by 4% during the same time period. Conclusions: These results suggest that convenient, accessible professional nursing care can reduce child mortality in impoverished African settings. However, they do not demonstrate a beneficial effect of community volunteers and suggest a possible negative impact on children's survival. </jats:p>",

Fennoscandia has experienced major loss of forest biodiversity caused by intensive forestry. Therefore, the Countdown 2010 initiative to halt the loss of biodiversity in Europe is highly relevant to forest management in this part of the continent. As a contribution to meeting the challenge posed by Countdown 2010, we developed a spatially explicit conservation‐planning exercise that used regional knowledge on forest biodiversity to provide support for managers attempting to halt further loss of biological diversity in the region. We used current data on the distribution of 169 species (including 68 red‐listed species) representing different forest habitats and ecologies along with forest data within the frame of modern conservation software to devise a map of priority areas for conservation. The top 10% of priority areas contained over 75% of red‐listed species locations and 41% of existing protected forest areas, but only 58% of these top priorities overlapped with core areas identified previously in a regional strategy that used more qualitative methods. We argue for aggregating present and future habitat value of single management units to landscape and regional scales to identify potential bottlenecks in habitat availability linked to landscape dynamics. To address the challenge of Countdown 2010, a general framework for forest conservation planning in Fennoscandia needs to cover different conservation issues, tools, and data needs.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), an aggressive but possibly curative procedure for cancer, encouraging engagement in ACP is difficult. We conducted this analysis to determine if engagement in ACP among patients who undergo HSCT is associated with adverse outcomes. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Patients and Methods</jats:title><jats:p> Adult patients who were undergoing their first HSCT for hematologic malignancies between 2001 and 2003 were included. ACP was defined as having a living will, a power of attorney for health care, or life-support instructions. Outcomes assessed included the length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and overall survival. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> Of the 343 patients, 172 did not have ACP, whereas 171 did have ACP, and 127 of those were reviewable. Of those with reviewable ACP, 28 patients (22%) completed ACP before cancer diagnosis, 87 (68%) completed ACP after the cancer diagnosis but before HSCT, and 12 (10%) engaged in ACP after HSCT. Patients without ACP before HSCT had a significantly greater risk of death compared with patients with ACP (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.33; P = .001) while adjusting for statistically significant factors. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p> Our study demonstrated that lack of engagement in ACP is associated with adverse outcomes after HSCT. Thus, the patients least likely to have planned for poor outcomes are the ones most likely to face them. Additional studies should evaluate the nature of this association and should seek modifiable explanatory factors that could be the target of interventions. </jats:p></jats:sec>",
