Ribozymes subsequently evolved to be able to cut and paste themselves and riboscripts were acceptive to rigorous editing (adenosine to inosine); the intensive diversification of RNA molecules shaped novel cellular machineries that are capable of polymerizing amino acids—a new type of cellular building materials for life. Initially, the genetic code, encoding seven amino acids, was created only to distinguish purine and pyrimidine; it was later expanded in a stepwise way to encode 12, 15, and 20 amino acids through the relief of guanine from its roles as operational signals and through the recruitment of cytosine. Therefore, the maturation of the genetic code also coincided with (1) the departure of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) from the primordial translation machinery, (2) the replacement of informational RNA by DNA, and (3) the co-evolution of AARSs and their cognate tRNAs. This model predicts gradual replacements of RNA-made molecular mechanisms, cellular processes by proteins, and informational exploitation by DNA.</jats:p>",

This exploratory-descriptive study was based on a quantitative-qualitative approach method. The sample consisted of 171 users, registered at the four Family Health Units that cover the basic area of a secondary service. The study used semi structured interviews with analytical dimensions: infrastructure, accessibility, and team-user relationships. Descriptive statistics was used for calculations of standard deviation, mean and median, assisted by Statistical Package for Social Science, and thematic analysis. The results show predomination of the female gender (87,7%), age older than 60 years old (31.0%), and monthly income inferior to two minimum monthly salaries (34%). Users indicated considerate and affective interpersonal relations as one point of satisfaction and one of the aspects that differentiates health care. Dissatisfaction predominated in terms of environment, a long time spent in the waiting room, and organizational accessibility, impairing care longitudinality and continuity. Studies within this theme give opportunities to users, strengthening their participation in the planning processes and exercising social control.</jats:p>",

In terms of fishery impacts, dynamic ecosystem models provide an opportunity to make advances because they can both evaluate the state of the system and make predictions about the ecosystem under various fishing scenarios. In the framework of the Cost Impact project, a complex high-resolution (500 × 500 m grid) ecosystem model was implemented in Iraklion Bay, Crete. Several management scenarios were simulated to investigate the impacts of trawling on this particular ecosystem (reductions in fishing area, effort, and mortality). Introducing trawling impacts into the model led to increases in pelagic production. All scenarios also resulted in net increases in pelagic production, the level of which, and the degree of spatial variability, was dependent on the particular scenario. Changes in pelagic variables were often noted in areas well away from trawled areas. It was also clear that for pelagic variables and processes, depth of trawling is more important than reduction in trawling area, i.e. a scenario banning fishing in waters shallower than 100 m seems to lead to less change in the pelagic system than a scenario that reduces direct mortality to the benthos.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Tutorial assessment in PBL is thought to be a valid assessment approach and is believed to exert a positive impact on the learning process. Reports, however, have demonstrated that assessment by the facilitator can be unreliable. Training of faculty to conduct this type of assessment has tended to be lacking and is a likely contributor to this inconsistency. This report describes the final in a series of foundation‐building faculty development workshops focused on the instructional methodology of PBL. The PBL Assessment and Feedback workshop reported here introduced the theory and practice of conducting process‐based assessment accompanied by formative feedback. Scenario‐based discussions, mock group demonstration, role‐modeling, and role‐play were utilized as adult learning‐appropriate strategies to familiarize participants with process‐based assessment and feedback. Evaluation of the workshop by participants provided evidence that the majority of participants were satisfied with the methods and content of the workshop. Suggestions for additional training in these assessment methods included additional examples, practice, workshops, or observation and mentoring.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
