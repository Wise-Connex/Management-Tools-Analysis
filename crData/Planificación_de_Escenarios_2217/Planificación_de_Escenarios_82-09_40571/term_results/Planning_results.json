State government planning programs for forest use, management, and protection have major differences from those directed at air and water quality. State forest resources planning has been, to date, chiefly inspired by federal support. Its processes usually emphasize comprehensiveness, a focus on issues, public participation, and direct links with state agency budgets. The occurrence and scope of accompanying state forest resources assessments vary widely. Forest resources planning is now being carried out in 47 states, but only 4 states have supporting legislation. Budgets and staffs are generally small, but hopes for future growth are large.</jats:p>",

Two separate research surveys were conducted, one of 150 listed companies and a second of 15 major South African companies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The question of the extent to which the concrete physical environment allows, causes, or even forces certain forms of behaviour to occur has been excluded from social sciences literature for a long time. More recent studies from environmental psychology show that the built environment, filtered by subjective perceptions, very probably influences the experience and actions of individuals. Town planning and transport planning is orientated towards the needs, demands, or simply the observed behaviour of social groups, segments of the population, and target groups of individuals. However, at this level the evidence about whether a spatiospecific determinant should be added to the sociodemographic, sociocultural, or socioeconomic determinants is very inconclusive. This paper investigates the influence of certain types of area on behaviour, and uses about 70000 weekday records at the level of differentiated groups of people. Everyday behaviour of the groups is quantified by their time budgets and daily programmes with broad groupings of out-of-house activities as well as various indicators of transport mobility. This study shows that with given characteristics of the individual and his household a series of behavioural parameters does not vary in space and thus these parameters can be used as input for behaviourally orientated transport demand models and transferred from one planning area to another. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an overview of a continuing research project which attempts to analyse regional labor market disparities in Austria by means of an econometric model. First, the structure of the labor supply and demand models is described and a set of behavioral hypotheses is stated. The supply side is modelled as a nonstationary Markov chain, where the transition probabilities are variables. A labor market segmentation is assumed to exist, where the barriers to professional mobility are the educational attainment levels. This approach leads to an integrated analysis of the regional education system. Other components of the supply side are the migration, commuting, and labor force participation submodels. The demand side, because of data restrictions, deals only with the secondary sector, regional investment, containing capital flows to and from other regions and labor demand are modelled as a simultaneous equation subsystem. A disequilibrium model was chosen for the labor market as a whole, that is, supply and demand are only equal by coincidence. The statistical basis for the econometric work are cross-sectional data available for a few points in time, based on the ninety-eight counties of Austria. </jats:p>",

Designed also to meet the need for wartime propaganda, the proposals had envisaged a programme of reconstruction aided by the British, carried forward during a period of direct rule, to be followed by advance towards self-government. There were doubts about the amount of aid Britain could promise. There were also doubts as to the wisdom of the concept of direct rule, though in fact the Cabinet accepted the principle without setting a limit to the period. Above all, the Prime Minister opposed further policy declarations on Burma. The war, Churchill believed, was not the time for them. Amery and Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, the Governor, thought that he really believed that no time would be right for them. They were not without hope that he would “come round”. Meanwhile, it was decided that the Burma Government, in exile in Simla, would remain in existence. “I can not help thinking that it would be a bad thing politically actually to do away with the office of Governor of Burma, if only because it would [be] a welcome propaganda point for the Japanese who would doubtless use it to demonstrate either that we have given up all hopes of retaking Burma or that we visualise setting up a Military Government in Burma.…”</jats:p>",

They illustrate the extent of immobile strategies of locational behaviour and the dominance of locational decision situations with a small number of choices and numerous constraints.

In this context it is important to know whether the vector of category-specific activity frequencies is determined by personal, household, or residential location characteristics. These categories of characteristics display a hierarchical effects structure that is statistically analyzable only by means of a hierarchical analysis-of-variance model. The analysis of extensive data from household survey samples of 44000 and 400000 persons, respectively, in two different study areas shows that the obligatory activity levels (work, education/training) can be attributed almost exclusively to person-specific characteristics, and that 70% of the variance for the private activities of individuals can be attributed to personal characteristics, between 15–30% to household characteristics, and only up to 4% to locational characteristics. </jats:p>",

Various methods have been developed for statistically analyzing such persistence effects which are dependent upon distance and direction. Important differences and similarities in the concept of spatial autocorrelation and the theory of regionalized variables will be pointed out and explained by means of examples. The use of these geostatistical methods in modelling spatial processes leads to the SAR (spatial auto-regressive) models and to the Kriging concept, respectively. Although SAR models are used in particular to represent spatial persistences as characteristic endogenous dependency structures, the Kriging method is more pragmatically orientated to the interpolation and extrapolation of spatial data. The suitability of such stochastic models in purely spatial forecasting and also in the estimation of areal means will be described by use of examples, and compared with conventional methods. </jats:p>",

There is difficulty in recognizing not only that health and social affairs are intimately related, but that the system must be dealt with as a whole of its interrelated problems are to be solved. Increasing costs for health and social programs are becoming of even greater concern, and cost containment (voluntary or regulatory) preoccupies both the payers and the recipients. Complicating the current situation is uncertainty of the role of financing and regulation on the part of the federal government and the states (the New Federalism), and the fragmentation and uncertainty of the private delivery sector and its third party reimbursement agencies. Questions are raised as to whether viable solutions can be obtained until all components (governmental and private) can work together in a partnership rather than an adversarial relationship in the development of an overall strategy with understandable objectives. Of basic importance is consideration of matters of organization, administration, and leadership at all levels so that whatever program may be developed or evolved can be successfully implemented. The subject is of such magnitude and is so complicated that it deserves a major coordinated effort of the federal government, the state governments, and the diverse private sector components to ensure a coordinated and systematic approach to any realistic solution. </jats:p>",
