In the case of public planning, the welfare criterion or planning objective is not likely to be the same as the objective function driving the behavior of the individual elements of the system. A rigorous definition of a theory of planning is provided through extensions to the linear-programming analysis of the decentralized firm in order to handle (1) the distinction between the planning objectives and behavioral objectives, and (2) the indirect determination of prices by a public agency through policies which modify existing prices sufficiently to achieve a prescribed allocation of resources. A set of three related mathematical programs is identified which yield respectively a target plan, a projection, and an optimal choice of policies. A combination of these programs defines the best solution in terms of the value of the target plan minus the cost of altering the system to achieve that target. </jats:p>",

Goal programming is used to find the spatial–temporal scheduling of new housing construction, and development of job opportunities, that minimizes the sum of the weighted deviations between predicted and desired population trajectories over all regions. Benefits and limitations of the proposed model are proffered, as well as an exposition of related work in the literature. </jats:p>",

The model is based on the well-developed structure first used by Lowry, but in the quest to make the model operational, significant improvements have been made to the use of locational constraints, the treatment of external zones, and calibration. The original model is first outlined, and then a number of algorithms designed to speed up the application of the constraints are tested, the best one reducing the overall model running time by 60%. External zones are considered in the context of constraints, and a much accelerated calibration technique based on a combination of Newton–Raphson and direct-search methods is introduced. The calibration of the model in Area 8 is described, and the problem of measuring and interpreting locational attraction is also addressed. Finally the implications of using the model in county structure planning are traced, in preparation for the application of the large-scale model which is under construction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Resource-planning methods for university and college management have received increasing attention by management scientists in recent years. One widely known approach yields cost-simulation models such as RRPM and CAMPUS. However, these models have two serious limitations in representing resource-management problems: (1) budget levels are outputs of the models, not inputs, and (2) faculty levels are a fixed function of enrollment. This paper proposes a goal-programming model that relieves these limitations and offers other features as well; in it the goals are faculty instruction loads, staff-to-faculty ratios, faculty distribution by rank, and teaching-assistant-to-faculty ratios. These specified goals are achieved as closely as possible, subject to constraints on the projected budget available in each year of the planning horizon and to faculty-flow constraints. The decision variables are the faculty, staff, and teaching-assistant levels in each of several academic units over the planning horizon. The model provides a vehicle for long-range budget planning and resource allocation. </jats:p>",

The demand for the product is treated as a stochastic process. Problem formulation and optimization use tools from continuous-time stochastic variational calculus and control theory.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There exists a need in less—as well as more—advanced economies for human resource development as an integral part of a planning program and a means of avoiding structural or sectoral unemployment. As a first approximation in planning a human capital structure for a given country, a set of ratios such as students per teacher, inhabitants per physician, nurse or lawyer, etc., may be considered a long-run plan objective. In this paper, economic as well as demographic and educational factors and parameters are used to construct a production function for human capital structure which is called the technical model. The technical model is subsequently used as a constraint in the determination and analysis of the least-cost condition of achieving alternative plans. </jats:p><jats:p> One of the theoretical results here is that such ratios become larger as the average percentage of student “dropouts” per year increase. The model shows that the marginal cost of improving the quality of human capital (by a requirement for a longer training period or by the establishment of stiffer educational standards) is an increasing function of such educational variables. Finally, the model gives an explicit algebraic expression for the qualitative-quantitative transformation-professional expertise vs. the number of personnel produced-existing in the production of human capital for equal or comparable costs. The model can be used for regional as well as global planning and in a mixed capitalist as well as a socialist economy. </jats:p>",

The process involve s both planners and publics in the following four planning activities: problem definition, formulation of alternatives, impact analysis and evaluation (or plan ranking). Evaluative factors are defied as the goals, concerns, constraints, etc. that affected publics and other decision makers consider in ranking alternative actions. These factors serve to drive the entire process and glue the four planning activities together. In contrast to other “models” of the planning process, the four activities are considered to be carried out simultaneously and continually from the beginning of the process. As the planning process proceeds, each activity is repeated a number of times at increasing levels of detail. Various aspects of the process are illustrated by means of an example involving water resources development in Carmel Valley, California.</jats:p>",

A number of methods have been proposed for the purposes of identifying key sectors in a national economy using input–output models. This research reports on attempts to identify key sectors at the regional level using the 1963 and 1967 Washington State input–output models at various levels of aggregation. The lack of consistency of identification of key sectors by the various methods suggests that these approaches have limited utility at the regional level. </jats:p>",
