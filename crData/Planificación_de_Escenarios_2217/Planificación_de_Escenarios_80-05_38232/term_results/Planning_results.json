Should the benefits package of the parent, a member of the mature and highly‐unionized steel industry, be extended to the printing industry where benefits are not traditionally as generous? A textile firm whose traditional business has been stable for years finds that its fabric processing division is growing very rapidly and holds a strong position in an expanded market created by the use of new synthetic fibers. Are the firm's traditional criteria for selecting, promoting, and compensating executives appropriate to the management of this growing sector? The management of a company that has grown rapidly for ten years decides that the firm has attained an optimum size and that future growth should be limited and highly selective. Do the personnel policies in recruitment, training, compensation, and management succession still fit a company that will now experience slower growth?</jats:p>",

Incentives have been given to encourage utilisation of the services (for example, the removal of price barriers to access) and service delivery (for example, the introduction of the GP fee for contraceptive service). This paper seeks to estimate the cost of FP service provision and to demonstrate a means of showing the effectiveness of these services. Empirical results presented relate to the Grampian Health Board Area for the financial year 1977/78. This Area is located in the North‐East of Scotland. The total population is approximately 450,000. Grampian is divided into three districts, North, West and South, the last containing the City of Aberdeen with a population of over 200,000. Outside of Aberdeen the area is rural with no other major centre of population. Consequently North and West Districts and those parts of South District outside of Aberdeen are fairly sparsely populated.</jats:p>",

The quite considerable effort involved in producing state‐certified midwives seems, on the surface at least, to be excessive given the number gainfully employed in that profession. The national situation with respect to trends in the birth rate is examined and a somewhat surprising seasonal effect identified. This material is then used to estimate the likely situation to be encountered at local level and in particular the effect at different levels of bed provision. In an attempt to translate these estimated births into workload figures recourse was made to regression analysis. Data from 417 maternity units relating both to outputs and inputs were secured, but the subsequent analysis proved abortive due to the high correlation which exists between the variables. Estimates were therefore derived from the work of other authors.</jats:p>",

The arithmetic for handling people moving from the single to the married state is identical with that for them moving from New York to Pennsylvania.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The demographer's approach to the study of the labor force includes the calculation of life tables for the active population. Although this tool is extensively used and many countries publish working-life tables, and although they rely on very restrictive assumptions, the technique for constructing such tables has not improved since its development about thirty years ago. This paper reviews the conventional method for the construction of working-life tables and proposes a multistate approach which does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as the unimodality of the labor-force participation curve. Instead of focusing on changes in stocks, the actual flows of people between active and inactive life are considered. The technique is compared with a similar procedure recently developed by Hoem and Fong. The increment–decrement table of working life serves as a basis for a multistate model for labor-force projection. The proposed model is compared with conventional approaches. The methods presented in this paper are illustrated using Danish data. </jats:p>",

The first principal part of the paper, section 2, presents a theoretical exposition of such tables, paralleling that of the ordinary life table, and discusses various issues raised by the conceptualization of multistate life-table functions. The second principal part, section 3, contrasts the two alternative approaches to the applied calculation of such tables. On the one hand, the movement approach, which views interstate transfers as events (such as deaths or births), requires data in the form of occurrence/exposure rates; on the other hand, the transition approach, which regards such transfers as the results of a change in an individual's state of presence between two points in time, uses data in the form of survivorship proportions. </jats:p>",

Examples of accounts in the educational sector, in the job market, and in a regional system are described. Proper estimation of multistate demographic accounts involves attention to data sources, much initial estimation of variables, construction of a model to estimate missing items, and use of the possible constraints on the accounts matrix. These steps in accounts estimation are illustrated for a set of accounts for British regions for 1970–1976. Data are assembled for a base period, 1970–1971. Alternative methods of constructing accounts are tested by running the estimation model in projective mode for 1971–1976. One method is selected and used to complete the set of accounts. </jats:p>",

The focus is on (1) the changes in the age-by-region population distribution and (2) the evolution of regional growth and component rates. </jats:p><jats:p> For the youngest age group, the fluctuations in regional population size are almost entirely determined by a small number of low-frequency and long-durability cyclical components. As age increases, the high-frequency and short-durability cyclical components tend to play a more important role. The half-lives of major cyclical components are related to the shapes of regional fertility schedules. The legacy of the postwar baby boom is nationwide, so that the population waves in different regions tend to have similar phases and periodicities. The slow and persistent spatial convergence is noncyclical, but one region overshoots and two others undershoot their respective long-run regional shares. Over a hundred years the convergence toward the long-run regional age profiles is practically completed, while the spatial convergence has gone only halfway. </jats:p><jats:p> The difference in sensitivity among regional birth, death, in-migration, and out-migration rates to moving population waves and changing slopes of regional age profiles depends on the characteristics of regional schedules of fertility, mortality, and interregional migration. The persistent interregional contrast in growth rates is mainly determined by the relative competitiveness in the interregional migration transaction. The fluctuations of regional growth rates are dominated by the cyclical pattern of regional birth rates in early stages and by the fluctuations of regional death rates in later stages. The interpretation of long-run (intrinsic) regional in-migration or net migration rates as indices of regional attractiveness or competitiveness can be more misleading than the interpretation of long-run regional death rates as indices of regional mortality. </jats:p>",

Boasting an impressive rate of economic growth that has been sustained for four decades, yet plagued with discouraging and mounting problems of surplus labor and maldistribution of income, Mexico is one of the prime cases that has sparked the discussion over the distinctions between “economic growth” and “economic development.” Furthermore, Mexico affords a classic test of the validity of some dependency writers’ claim that periphery countries’ subjugation to external control varies directly with the length and intensity of contact with center nations (Frank, 1972: 10). The sudden revelation of Mexico's potential as an energy supplier, the growing concern with the magnitude and consequences of illegal Mexican migration to the United States, and the increasing recognition of the uniqueness and importance of the Mexico-U.S. border economy add further appeal for economists, political scientists, and sociologists.</jats:p>",
