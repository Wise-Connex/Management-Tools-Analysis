But for some time now there has been an increasing appreciation of the role of transport and its far‐reaching effects on overall company planning — not only in relation to costs but also in its impact on sales and marketing. But planning an effective transport system cannot be viewed in isolation; it must be regarded as part of the overall total distribution concept. Transport is by no means a negligible aspect of the economy; 01 the gross domestic product, currently running at £65,000m., somewhere betweeen 3% and 5% of this figure is accounted for by transport.</jats:p>",

Recent events have discredited the impression, commonly held in the 1960s, that sources of energy could be turned on and off like a tap to correspond with short‐term fluctuations in their price. Over the years, the National Coal Board have repeatedly emphasised the hard geological fact that coalmining capacity, unless it is continuously worked, can so deteriorate that it might be lost for ever. Much the same kind of consideration applies to coalmining skills. They cannot be turned on and off like a tap either. They take time to acquire, and people are not going to acquire them unless they have some assurance that they are going to be able to use them.</jats:p>",

Approximately concurrently with these technological advances, the U.S. Navy had the need to project replacements for many of its conventionally propelled surface ships of World War II vintage. Characteristics of good fuel economy coupled with potentially viable reliability and maintenance characteristics conditioned the development of main and auxiliary gas turbine prime movers for ships. Ship design, therefore, was strongly influenced by previously unavailable power plant characteristics. New ships are building and others actively being designed to draw upon these technological advantages, and a broad base of support is being established to ensure the continued long range mobility of the U.S. Navy’s ships.</jats:p>",

We are all familiar with the distinction between factual and evaluative questions, and I do not doubt that there is this distinction; but the actual problems with which we are faced are always an amalgam of these two kinds of question. The various methods used by environmental planners are all attempts to separate out this amalgam, as we have to do if we are ever to understand the problems — let alone solve them. I wish in this lecture to give examples of, and appraise, two such methods. I shall draw from this appraisal not only theoretical lessons which may interest the moral philosopher, but also practical lessons which, I am sure, those who try to plan our environment ought to absorb. Though my examples come mostly from urban planning, because that is the kind of planning with whose problems (although only an amateur) I am most familiar, what I have to say will apply also to problems about the countryside. Whether we have to deal with the human nature of the man in the congested street, or the nature of the nature reserves or of the areas of outstanding natural beauty, the word ‘nature’ may bear slightly different senses, but the problem is still the same: to ascertain the facts about this nature, and then to think how we should conduct ourselves in order to make things better, or at any rate not worse, than they would otherwise be.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Part I of this paper, we developed an algorithm for finding planning horizons for the deterministic production smoothing problem when all demand was required to be met from regular production, under rather general assumptions for the production, production smoothing, and holding cost functions. Here, in Part II, we develop analogous planning horizons when the model is extended to include such factors as overtime, lost sales, simple subcontracting, undertime, and backlogging. Part II depends heavily on Part I. </jats:p><jats:p> To avoid unnecessary tedium, all cost functions will be assumed to be stationary in Part II. Overtime, undertime, holding, and backlogging will be assumed to be convex increasing, all other costs linear and proportional. However, it is not difficult to see that the techniques of Part I can be utilized directly to cover more general cost functions. Part II concludes with a discussion of the application of our general approach to actual data. </jats:p>",
