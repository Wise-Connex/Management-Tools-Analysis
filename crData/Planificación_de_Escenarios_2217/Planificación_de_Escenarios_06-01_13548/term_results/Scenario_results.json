      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent studies of the single-airport ground-holding problem use static or dynamic optimization to manage uncertainty about future airport capacities. Scenario trees of airport capacity profiles provide the basis for formulating multistage recourse problems. In this paper, methodologies are presented for generating scenario trees from empirical data, and the performance of scenario-based models is examined with the scenario trees. Most U.S. airports have capacity profiles that can be classified into some nominal scenarios, and for many airports, these scenarios can be naturally combined into scenario trees. The delay costs yielded from using dynamic optimization are consistently and considerably lower than from static optimization. The results illustrate the benefit of the wait-and-see strategy in a real-world setting and suggest the need for further research on implementing scenario-based dynamic strategies. </jats:p>",

The study suggests that the most important control on the release of radionuclides from the waste packages is the integrity of the waste encapsulation grout. Interactions between neighbouring packages are to be expected, but the degree to which homogeneous (well mixed) conditions develop may be limited in both time and space.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we are interested in the potentialities of this model enhanced from the problem-based learning context, such that people collaborating in the peculiar scenario of project development, are empowered to be more sensitive and reflective of their learning experiences. Our discussion describes a practical framework of course enactment taking into account the suggestions of the latest curriculum guidelines stipulated in the final draft of the “Computing Curriculum - Software Engineering” created by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery. Namely, software engineering education in the 21st century needs to move beyond the lecture format, and should consider the incorporation of a variety of teaching and learning approaches, one example of which includes the constructivist model of problem-based learning (PBL) considered as appropriate to supplement or even largely replace the lecture format in certain cases. In the paper, a pedagogical re-organization perspective is presented as a way to conduct teaching in the area of software engineering. In particular, the connotation of problem-based learning in the education of future software practitioners is explored from a teacher-researcher’s position, through the practice of action research. The paper concludes by emphasizing the contextualized learning scenarios involved in PBL, which have been observed to enable our students to experience the real-world practice of software development, and acquire valuable learning through teamwork that should remain with their future careers.</jats:p>"

Agriculture is the major source of employment in Sri Lanka while contributing to about 20% of GDP of the country.Besides its dependence on food production, food security depends either directly or indirectly on a wide range of factors; population growth and distribution, income changes due to socio-economic factors, urbanization and industrialization, agrotechnology employed, acceptance of local foods at the market, unsecured income of farmers, change of life styles due to the open economy, ecological and environmental problems related to food production, national planning and government policies with long term goals towards the prevention of looming famine, gender inequity in agricultural and food technological activities and food losses due to improper post harvest handling which in some instances represent up to 60%.The present paper analyses all these important factors and presents prospects for this problem, making recommendations for improving food security. In addition, Sri Lanka should develop policies that are compatible with its own environment. Great care should also be taken to set up an interactive co-ordination among the Agro-food sector institutions and entrepreneurs and to establish policies to address issues related to socio-economic sphere, nutrition and health. A collective effort of governmental and non-governmental organizations, farmer associations and other stakeholders is of primary importance in the implementation of these policies.</jats:p>"

In order to develop and validate system control software for managing AMSs, most laboratories have constructed an experimental test using actual manufacturing equipment. These experimental systems typically occupy a large amount of lab space and require considerable human expertise to operate. In this paper, a scenario-based development\nenvironment for the equipment design and implementation are described. The intended advantage of the proposed environment is that, the designer can make an experimental test in a computer and does not need the actual manufacturing equipment. The proposed environment can be used to design and\nimplement a real-world automated manufacturing cell controller at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). We start with a new methodology to model the operation sequences of the system’s equipment (i.e., machine) called scenario. Modeling methodology is the key to the application of scenarios to automated manufacturing systems. The scenarios methodology\nis able to clearly depict the communication signals for the equipment. And it also can be used to model the resource utilization features within a manufacturing system. Using scenario, we have developed an emulator for an automated manufacturing cell which faithfully replicates the operating characteristics of an ensemble of physical equipment that would typically comprise an AMS.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The integrated use of scenario planning and multi‐criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been advocated as a powerful combination for providing decision support in strategic decisions. Scenario planning helps decision makers in devising strategies and thinking about possible future scenarios; while MCDA can support an in‐depth performance evaluation of each strategy, as well as in the design of more robust and better options. One of the frameworks proposed recently, by Goodwin &amp; Wright, suggests the use of scenario planning with multi‐attribute value theory, a mathematically simple, yet extensively researched and widely employed multi‐criteria method. However, so far, such framework has been presented only using hypothetical problems. In this paper, we describe two case studies where this approach was used to support real‐world strategic decisions. We discuss the challenges and limitations we encountered in applying it and suggest some possible improvements that could be made to such framework.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Standard uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for radio base stations use lead acid batteries stacks as energy storage device; the fairly short life cycle of such systems, not more than 3 years, together with the presence of highly polluting components make it costly in terms of money and environmental aspects. From these considerations originate the idea to develop an alternative UPS system based on compressed air storage able to replace the battery stacks and to satisfy more restrictive environmental requirements. This work is developed within the European project PNEUMA (PNEumatic Uninterruptible Machine - LIFE 04 ENV/IT/00595) with the final aim to develop some UPS demonstrators for an on site experimentation. In this paper it is described the way followed to set up an air turboalternator with a maximum power of 10.0 kW. Starting from the selection of the turbine, we decided to extract it from an ICE turbocharger because its size and its low cost matches our requirements. First of all, an experimental survey has been realized to test two turbines of different size: expansion ratio, corrected mass flow and efficiency have been measured varying inlet pressure and temperature. This activity led us to select the smaller turbine to develop the first pilot demonstrator; the turbine has been coupled to an high speed alternator (max. 60’000 rpm) by means of an elastic coupling. Some shakedown testing have been performed to verify the mechanical resistance and to test the power conversion system and the control system.</jats:p>",

For Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), the estimated sodium release under a CDA of 100 MJ energy release is 350 kg. The ejected sodium reacts easily with air in RCB and causes temperature and pressure rise in the RCB. For estimating the severe thermal consequences in RCB, different modes of sodium fires like pool and spray fires were analyzed by using SOFIRE–II and NACOM sodium fire computer codes. Effects of important parameters like amount of sodium, area of pool, containment air volume and oxygen concentration have been investigated. A peak pressure rise of 7.32 kPa is predicted by SOFIRE II code for 350 kg sodium pool fire in 86,000 m3 RCB volume. Under sodium release as spray followed by unburnt sodium as pool fire mode analysis, the estimated pressure rise is 5.85 kPa in the RCB. In the mode of instantaneous combustion of sodium, the estimated peak pressure rise is 13 kPa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As with the distribution of any commodity, distribution of hydrogen depends on how the hydrogen is packaged, how far it must travel, and how much must be delivered. Few would argue that transporting a high-pressure gas is markedly different from transporting a cryogenic liquid—or even a liquid at standard temperature and pressure. Packaging affects not only density (weight/volume) but also the operation of potential delivery modes and onboard storage, a problem that has been called the grand challenge of the hydrogen economy. These three factors—packaging (which in turn affects shipment size and modal attributes), delivery distance, and demand—affect both the structure of potential delivery systems and their contribution to unit costs. This paper describes the hydrogen delivery scenario analysis model, a generalized model of hydrogen delivery that can be used to analyze the economic feasibility of various options for hydrogen distribution to markets of different sizes and types. Inputs may be user defined, or default values developed for the U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Analysis project may be used. This paper describes the model's structure and capabilities, presents initial results, and discusses ongoing enhancements. </jats:p>",
