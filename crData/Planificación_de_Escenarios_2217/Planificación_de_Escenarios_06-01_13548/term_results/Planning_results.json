The planning of a road is much more than simply a technical exercise. It incorporates political, economic, legal and ecological aspects and is increasingly influenced by European environmental legislation. As a result planning law is a highly complex subject in all the Member States of the European Union. For these reasons the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union has recently compiled a general report on national planning procedures in the EU. Particular emphasis was placed on the administrative and judicial process, the forms and evaluation of public involvement and the implementation of European environmental legislation such as the Habitats- and Birds-Directives' as well as the Directives on Ambient Air'. The report shows that the influence of Community law has led to a certain harmonisation in the decision-making process and increased the environmental awareness of the parties involved. Furthermore it provides an interesting insight in the different methods of acceleration and facilitation which have been tested by the Member States since the time-consuming nature of planning procedures is a major problem in all legal orders.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Driven by the need to increase productivity, quality, and access while meeting the challenges of competition, universities, especially state-assisted institutions, are seeking ways to do more with less governmental support. Information technology (IT) is perhaps the enabling tool that will bring transformative change (Oblinger &amp; Rush, 1997). The organizations that have had primary managerial responsibility for IT implementation on many campuses need to change and be restructured if the technology is to live up to its potential. This case study provides an overview of the process utilized in implementing a broad-based strategy to address the information technology needs of a large public university, the University of Memphis. It deals at length with the planning and creation of an IT governance structure and a strategic planning and management model. In this case, modern theories of organizational change and strategic planning were applied to the creation and improvement of the University’s IT structure.</jats:p>"

It includes an overview of the use of threat assessment in conservation planning by focusing on species-level and global-, regional- and local (site)-level priority setting. The synthesis also reviews two planning tools used in site conservation—conceptual models and The Nature Conservancy’s 5 “S” approach. The second part of the synthesis reviews the role of threat assessment in measuring management effectiveness with reference to monitoring approaches that fall into two broad categories: (1) the assessment of the status and impacts of threats, and (2) the measurement of ecological integrity of conservation targets. This section concludes with a comparison of threat monitoring methodologies focusing on two approaches: Threat Reduction Assessment and Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid progress in information technology (IT) has moved computing and the Internet to the mainstream. Today’s personal laptop computer has computational power and performance equal to 10 times that of the mainframe computer. Information technology has become essential to numerous fields, including city and regional planning engineering. Moreover, IT and computing are no longer exclusive to computer scientists/engineers. There are many new disciplines that have been initiated recently based on the cross fertilization of IT and traditional fields. Examples include geographical information systems (GIS), computer simulation, e-commerce, and e-business. The arrival of affordable and powerful computer systems over the past few decades has facilitated the growth of pioneering software applications for the storage, analysis, and display of geographic data and information. The majority of these belong to GIS (Batty et al., 1994; Burrough et al., 1980; Choi &amp; Usery, 2004; Clapp et al., 1997; GIS@Purdue, 2003; Golay et al., 2000; Goodchild et al., 1999; IFFD, 1998; Jankowski, 1995; Joerin et al., 2001; Kohsaka, 2001; Korte, 2001; McDonnell &amp; Kemp, 1995; Mohan, 2001; Ralston, 2004; Sadoun, 2003; Saleh &amp; Sadoun, 2004). GIS is used for a wide variety of tasks, including planning store locations, managing land use, planning and designing good transportation systems, and aiding law enforcement agencies. GIS systems are basically ubiquitous computerized mapping programs that help corporations, private groups, and governments to make decisions in an economical manner. A GIS program works by connecting information/data stored in a computer database system to points on a map. Information is displayed in layers, with each succeeding layer laid over the preceding ones. The resulting maps and diagrams can reveal trends or patterns that might be missed if the same information was presented in a traditional spreadsheet or plot. A GIS is a computer system capable of capturing, managing, integrating, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced information. GIS deals with spatial information that uses location within a coordinate system as its reference base (see Figure 1). It integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities distinguish GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events, predicting outcomes, and planning strategies (Batty et al., 1994; Burrough et al, 1980; Choi &amp; Usery, 2004; Clapp et al., 1997; GIS@Purdue, 2003; Golay et al., 2000; Goodchild et al., 1999; IFFD, 1998; Jankowski, 1995; Joerin et al., 2001; Kohsaka, 2001; Korte, 2001; McDonnell &amp; Kemp, 1995; Mohan, 2001; Ralston, 2004; Sadoun, 2003; Saleh &amp; Sadoun, 2004). </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Success today in the business world (whether as an employee, manager, executive, or self-employed businessperson) involves taking some risks. The systems that are changing the world today are very risky, but the payback is enormous (DeMarco &amp; Lister, 2003). One needs to know how to manage risk, however, including how to identify risk sources, quantify risk parameters, and develop plans to handle risk; these are the topics covered in this chapter. Risks are inevitable in projects (particularly IT projects), and if a PM does not practice sound risk management, that PM may constantly be in a crisis-management mode. The high failure rate of modern large IT projects, such as those involving EAI/ERP, CRM, and SCM, is largely due to senior management and project management’s failure to assess risks up front and to mitigate the causes of the greatest risks at the start of the project (Gibson, 2003). An adequate analysis of potential risks can significantly increase the likelihood of success for a project and can justify dollar amounts set aside for management reserves. “Risk management is increasingly seen as one of the main jobs of project managers” (Sommerville, 2003).</jats:p>"

It is our contention that efficient production planningis one of the three crucial and vital driving factors that enables the otherfunctional areas to be effective. Figure 11.1 displays the driving position of PPCin a causal relationship layout.Efficient PPC has a direct and beneficial influence on both customer satisfac-tion and capacity utilisation. The first leads to greater sales volume, and thesecond to lower costs, both of which have a major impact on profits.</jats:p>"

To use a transformational approach to create objects with Finite State Machines (FSMs), communicating by exchanging signals, adopters of MDA and xUML have to acquire expertise in new areas such as domain modeling, concurrency, non-determinism, precise modeling with FSM, programming in model-manipulation action languages, writing OCL constraints, and clear separation of application from architecture. The much more complex xUML object model presents system analysts with a longer and steeper learning curve. In this chapter, we critically evaluate the opportunities, capabilities, limitations, and challenges of MDA based on xUML. The purpose of our analysis is to aid organizations, software developers, and software product managers in their transition to this new development paradigm, and to assist them in understanding how MDA and xUML change the software design space and project planning.</jats:p>"

Product portfolio planning (PPP) is a critical decision faced by companies across industries and is very important in helping manufacturing companies keep their competitive advantage. PPP has been classified as a combinatorial optimization problem, in that each company strives for the optimality of its product offerings through various combinations of products and/or attribute levels. Towards this end, this chapter develops a heuristic genetic algorithm (HGA) for solving the PPP problem. The objective of this chapter is to develop a practical method that can find near optimal solutions and assist marketing managers in product portfolio decision-making.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As pressure increases for training to justify itself as an activity with a return on investment (ROI), it needs to align its activities with the strategic objectives of the organization. More importantly, it must position itself in the minds of the organization’s decision makers as a necessary component in the strategic-planning process. In most instances, training is seen as an on-call resource, basically given marching orders after the strategic direction is set. It might occupy a similar position in the process as the purchasing department—that is to say, none. After the strategic plan is set, orders for training are placed with the training function to be filled and delivered as ordered. This article looks at the issue of training, specifically distance training and education (DT&amp;E), as a factor in the business unit’s strategic-planning process. The training function’s historical place in the typical organization will be reviewed briefly, as well as a few of the unique dynamics introduced by the emergence of DT&amp;E. To provide adequate background, a discussion of the strategic-planning process will be presented. Included will be a review of factors contributing to effective strategic planning that moves an organization forward. Additionally, common pitfalls of strategic planning will be discussed. The discussion will then move to training’s role in strategic planning or, too often, the lack of training’s role. The article concludes with a specific look at how distance training and learning is being addressed in the strategic-planning process. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>Most people realize that the employment deal has changed: the days of lifetime employment, or even a clear trajectory up the corporate ladder, are long gone. Dozens of surveys merely quantify what we all know—that education, hard work, and loyalty are no longer enough to guarantee job security. People in mid-career today want to take greater control of their working lives for many reasons. But they are not sure of how to do that in a working world full of change, uncertainty, disappearing career paths, downsizings, and early retirement packages. InThe Mid-Career Success Guide, Sally Power draws from her research in management and career development to explain the sources and implications of these trends, and provide solutions to the challenges they present.</JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>The book introduces the Employability Plus model, an approach to career management that leaves behind the traditional job- or organization-centric perspectives by focusing on the individual's work, as a portfolio of skills that can be shaped to their interests and to their employers' needs and desires. Moreover, Power explores how individuals can make the time to develop new skills and knowledge, even when they are employed full-time, in order to expand the array of options available. Featuring real-life examples, interactive exercises, and an appendix of research tools and methods,The Mid-Career Success Guideoffers fresh strategies and tactics for overcoming job stress and uncertainty, and proactively managing your career in midlife and beyond. In addition, it will serve as an essential resource for managers, human resource and career counseling professionals, and professors and students of organizational behavior and workplace trends.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In response to U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) guidance, and acting at a regional level, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, Inc. (NJTPA), initiated the Development of Regional Safety Priorities study to identify transportation safety needs and solutions in the 13-county NJTPA region. The study was a proactive, multimodal effort to elevate safety considerations to a high priority at all levels of decision making. The project's goal was to develop specific, targeted metropolitan planning organization (MPO) actions to reduce the frequency and severity of crashes. The study incorporated principles of Safety Conscious Planning, a USDOT initiative. Safety Conscious Planning is a planning process model that considers multimodal, comprehensive safety issues at all phases of MPO processes. It includes data analysis, interdisciplinary professional perspectives, and public input. The NJTPA study had three elements: a data-driven, collaborative assessment of priority multimodal safety needs throughout the region; recommended applications of engineering, enforcement, and educational countermeasures; and development of project concepts for advancement through the MPO planning process. Active, meaningful interagency and public input was integral in all these steps. The Development of Regional Safety Priorities study does not represent a one-time effort, but is a first step toward improving how considerations of safety are integrated throughout development of transportation plans, programs, and projects. Since the study's conclusion in spring 2005, recommended improvements at three locations developed through this effort have been funded for construction, and several more are under consideration for funding in the near future. </jats:p>",

The present chapter deals with regulation in other areas. It examines the tortious liability of authorities involved in regulation in the fields of planning, the environment and banking, and of those authorities regulating professions such as law, accountancy and medicine. In each of these areas, regulatory authorities are empowered to oversee and control the activities of third parties. Planning authorities regulate those involved in land development to ensure that development occurs in a manner that is compatible with wider public interests.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decision making in planning should consider state-of-the-art techniques in order to minimize the risk and time involved. Proper planning in developing countries is crucial for their economical recovery and prosperity. Proper database systems, such as the ones based on GIS, are a must for developing countries so that they can catch up and build effective and interactive systems in order to modernize their infrastructures and to help improve the standard of living of their citizens. The huge and fast advancement in computing and information technology make it easy for the developing countries to build their database infrastructures. GIS-technology is one of the best and fastest tools to build such systems, manage resources, encourage businesses, and help to make efficient and cost-effective decisions. For the purpose of a better informed decision making in planning the improvement of the Bank of Jordan in the city of Amman, Jordan, we had to build a database system and a digital map for the city of Amman, the Bank of Jordan, its branches in Amman, and all other banks and their branches in Amman. We used the popular Geomedia software to allow an interactive time-saving data management; to offer the ability to perform different analysis, including statistical ones; and to provide graphical geospatial results on maps. By using Geomedia software, we built many layers needed for the planning processes and mainly for the region of Amman due to the lack of available digital data in the area. Some layers concern the project and relate to the bank, such as the geographic distribution of the Bank of Jordan branches and its ATMs; and others for the comparison, such as the geographic distribution of all other banks, their branches, and ATMs in Amman. This is to allow the decision makers to compare with all competitive banks in Amman. Besides the geographic location of all existing banks, important attribute data are provided for the Bank of Jordan in specific and all the other banks in general (Batty et al., 1994a, 1994b; Burrough et al., 1980; Doucette et al., 2000; Elmasri &amp; Navathe, 2004; Goodchild, 2003; Longley et al., 1999a, 1999b). </jats:p>"

This should be the first stage of any systems development project. The framework has been used widely within start-up companies and well-established companies both large and small; it has been deployed in the service and manufacturing sectors. It has been applied by practitioners and consultants to help improve e-business capability levels, and by academics for teaching and research purposes at graduate and undergraduate levels. This article will provide an account of the unique e-business planning and analysis framework (E-PAF) and demonstrate how it works via an abridged version of a case study (selected from hundreds that have been produced). This will include a brief account of the three techniques that are integrated to form the analysis framework: quality function deployment (QFD) (Akao, 1972), the balanced scorecard (BSC) (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992), and value chain analysis (VCA) (Porter, 1985). The case study extract is based on an online community and dating agency service identified as VirtualCom which has been produced through a consulting assignment with the founding directors of that company and has not been published previously. It has been chosen because it gives a concise, comprehensive example from an industry that is relatively easy to relate to. </jats:p>"

This chapter presents SMEs’ Web presence implementation patterns and unravels the reasons behind the lack of strategic planning when adopting Electronic Commerce Technologies (ECT). The chapter presents findings from semi-structured interviews from 11 SMEs in the Northwest of the UK. Findings reflect the difference in development and management practices of Web presence, between the more able Need Pull SMEs that identified the need to adopt ECT, and the less able Technology Push SMEs that were mostly influenced by change agent diffusion and awareness efforts. Over time, each group of SMEs reflect a different pattern in ECT implementation. This chapter depicts the issues that hinder SMEs, particularly in micro and small, in moving beyond Web site adoption.</jats:p>"

They do not simply replace existing techniques; they change the shape of the development environment. Development is a multi-dimensional landscape of organizational patterns such as software product lines, of meta-information such as build scripts and templates, and of technologies such as model-driven development. Traditional patterns of development management are not sufficient to effectively manage development in this emerging context. In this chapter we provide an overview of some existing and emerging elements, describe how they affect development, and present a management framework for planning software development.</jats:p>"

The firm’s IS staff are part of an EDP team that provides IS services to all parts of MT. However, the firm is soon to be restructured into nine separate business units. This case focuses on where the firm should place its IS staff following this restructuring.

It requires a complete redesign of itsproduction planning system, because:•There is no forecasting for MTO, it is driven by customers’ orders, so aforecasting system had to be designed and implemented.•An inventory management system for finished goods had to be developed.•Under MTS, it is vital that the planning system preserves continuity; theplans produced by each level should be detailed plans of the top level.Also, there must be feedback continuity: feedback of the top levels is anaggregation of bottom level feedback — for more detail see McNair andVangermeersch (1998).</jats:p>"

From a total of 560 questionnaires, 381 were usable: a response rate of 68.0 per cent.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Massachusetts, cranberry (<jats:italic>Vaccinium macrocarpon</jats:italic>) bogs were historically developed in existing wetlands and new plantings are now established in mineral soils that are converted into constructed wetlands. To streamline the interaction between cranberry farming and wetlands protection, the state has defined “normal agricultural practices” that are exempt from wetlands regulations under certain circumstances. As part of that process and to qualify for the exemption, farmers are required to have a conservation farm plan and demonstrate the use of best management practices (BMPs) on their farms. The University of Massachusetts Amherst Cranberry Experiment Station (UMass Cranberry Station) was engaged to bring together the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and cranberry industry representatives to define BMPs specific to cranberry farming practices. Initially, the documents were reviewed by scientists and regulators for soundness of science and rigor of environmental protection. A grower committee reviewed the proposed BMPs to determine if the BMPs could be implemented on real farms. The next stage of the project consisted of defining areas where more research was needed to formulate good BMPs. In particular, research projects were initiated to study nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition. This research has become the basis for nutrition BMPs, national cranberry nutrition guidelines, and standards used by NRCS for cranberry nutrient management plans. The cranberry BMP project has continued with a regular cycle of revision and additions based on grower-identified needs for horticultural and environmental guidance. This connection to the growers, along with the regulatory link, accounts for the widespread adoption of BMPs in the cranberry industry. Local NRCS estimates that 75% to 80% of Massachusetts cranberry growers have current conservation farm plans that include BMP implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Much has been written about e-business and how this concept will transform industries into virtual networks of customers and suppliers working together to create value-added processes (Fahey, Srivastava, Sharon, &amp; Smith, 2001). Typically, successful organisations will have embraced enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to integrate e-business processes within the organisation and to underpin the creation of integrated interorganisational systems. This frequently results in new business processes, organisational structures, human resource skill requirements, management roles, and knowledge management systems (Robey et al., 2002). To be successful in this new climate, however, organisations have to learn new approaches to strategy and planning for collaborative systems and to manage e-business enabled cycles of innovation (Wheeler, 2002; Zahra &amp; George, 2002). Few studies have explored the dynamics of e-business strategic planning and little information is available on how to implement new paradigms successfully and how to ensure more effective e-business performance as a result (Damanpour, 2001; Kallio, Saarinen, &amp; Tannila, 2002). This article reports on the findings from multiple case studies of e-business projects in ERP-enabled organisations. Each organisation was investigated in a three stage study over 4 years, using three theoretical models of e-business implementations to assess success. The key findings from each case study were captured into a staged model for e-business transformation and related to a dynamic planning model that can be applied across all stages of growth of the extended enterprise. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a new process planning method to achieve intended product quality. The design for the product quality is achieved by total designing and planning of production process considering both good factors and bad factors that affect product quality in the production process. The representation model of quality related production knowledge that is directly used in the computational design method is proposed. The discrete quality related behavior of product in process is modeled. Input information of the proposed design method consists following information: 1) a product structure; 2) feasible operations of the production process; 3) possible quality related causalities in the production process. The design method calculates the space of quality state automatically by this method. Final output information from this method is a good production process (good operations and good sequence) that achieves the intended quality state of final product. In order to develop this production process planning method for keeping the intended quality, this paper proposes a computational representation model of the quality related information in production process. Based on the production process model, a computational recommendation algorithm of production process that can achieve the intended product quality state is developed. The representation, sharing and reuse of production knowledge and know-how are realized based on the proposed production process model. A prototype system for planning a production process without failures of final product is implemented for the purpose of examination and validation for proposed method. A practical design example of a production process planning for one component of an auto-circuit breaker is demonstrated. The methodology proposed in this research addresses: (1) how the product quality in production process should be modeled; (2) how to design good operations and a good process in production that can achieve the intended product quality; and (3) how to apply the proposed method to a practical planning problem of an actual production process.</jats:p>",

Since the accounting system was a commercial off-the-shelf product, our focus was on the development of the job scheduling system. We explain the manual job scheduling process and how the automated system might be developed. The justification for adopting Microsoft’s Access, SQL server, Exchange, and Project as the development tools is presented. Microsoft Access was used just for the prototyping. Eventually, the job scheduling system will be implemented on the Project software with some rewriting of Visual Basic codes. To date, a prototype using Access had been developed and demonstrated.

Collaborative integration of multiple forms of knowledge is one approach used to develop meaningful solutions to complex problems. In this regard, spatial data and knowledge about the environment have been managed extensively with Web geographic information systems (Web GIS). However, past Web GIS research has focused mostly on using spatial tools to manage explicit (codified) knowledge. This has reduced the complementary contribution that tacit (experiential) knowledge can provide to environmental solutiodragns. In this study, Web GIS and knowledge management technologies are used to integrate multiple forms of spatial knowledge in support of collaborative community planning. The system design included a customized end-user interface for data entry, georeferencing tools for asynchronous collection of local data, and protocols for knowledge management dealing with species location, ecological habitats, and environmentally sensitive areas among others. The system enabled access, query, sharing, and updating of environmental knowledge using visual map-based tools. The utility of the integrated system design is discussed.</jats:p>"

According to Hulley and Dier (2005),  hope is the key to achieving successful and effective schools through  reculturing with professional learning communities as the vehicle for  change in the school improvement process. Wayne Hulley, president of  Canadian Effective Schools Incorporated and senior consultant for the  Franklin Covey Company, has 35 years of experience in North America  working in the area of school improvement. Co-author Linda Dier has  extensive knowledge having worked for 30 years in education systems in  Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Currently, she is senior consultant with  Canadian Effective Schools Inc. and administrator of the Canadian  Effective Schools League. Together, Hulley and Dier have written a text  for educators and administrators at the district, board, and school  levels, combining research theory with the practical knowledge gained in  their joint 70+ years’ experience in education to provide a  comprehensive planning process for school improvement. This text  presents a step-by- step process that notes the highs and lows or «  implementation dips » of the school improvement cycle. The authors have  utilized the learning community model of professional development as a  vehicle to facilitate, guide, direct, and sustain change towards  successful and effective schools.</jats:p>"

The promise of PGIS has been largely pinned on the assumption that maps as tools of communication are rich in informational content, and capable of fostering shared understanding and analytical thinking. Whether maps alone can indeed be the medium for supporting shared understanding and analytical thinking in participatory decision making is still an open question. Much of our knowledge in this area is still anecdotal, and there is a need for empirical work to supply the evidence. In an attempt to test the applicability of maps, decision models, and Internet-based communication tools for PGIS, software called spatial understanding and decision support system (SUDSS) was built using asynchronous spatiotemporal environment, and tested in a realistic setting representing public land-use planning debate. This chapter provides a description of the software and the experiment, followed by the discussion of its results and their significance for the future development of similar public participation spatial-decision support tools.</jats:p>"

More precisely, whether the technologies of the web (manifest in the graphical user interface (GUI)) are culturally neutral, allowing for transparent communication between different cultures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Utilising the widely cited cultural dimensions of culture – “uncertainty avoidance” and “power distance” – comparative content analysis for a sample of web sites from two industry sectors (banking and education) across three countries (Germany, Greece, and the United Kingdom) was undertaken.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results of the analysis revealed differences in aspects of GUI design between the three country web sites in line with associated cultural dimensions. It also revealed similarities between the three countries in GUI design in apparent contradiction of their associated cultural dimension. This early work suggests, therefore, that, whilst internet‐based technologies exist as a global medium in the sense of connecting individuals, those individuals may still be culturally bound. To truly escape the constraints of time and space, communicating effectively online across boundaries, some acknowledgement that culture does matter is necessary.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Further research, both in terms of the number of countries and industries, would be needed to confirm the generalisation that culture does indeed matter in terms of web site design (all be it in a qualified way) and, in addition, that the results were not unduly influenced by either the choice of countries or industries. Whilst other researchers should consider applying the methodology to other industries, such as sports, fashion, etc. in order to test further the results of this study, additional research should also look towards different methodologies. For example, analysing web sites utilising Hofstede's other dimensions, or even applying Trompenaars and Hampden‐Turner's dimensions seems desirable.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper shows that culture, at least partially, influences GUI design. The value in the suggested directions made in this paper lies in the possible creation of guidelines for the subsequent development of successful web sites. The work here adds to the limited body of work in this area against which future works may be contrasted.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Recognising the apparently obvious virtues of the internet and web in exchanging rich information with distant (international) markets, this work builds on the little work already undertaken in this direction and in doing so contributes to the wider debate in international marketing over standardisation versus adaptation. Specifically, this paper considers the influence of culture in an online context and researches the questions, “Does culture matter online?” and more specifically, “Are the multitude of graphical user‐interfaces of organisational web sites culturally neutral or are the graphical user‐interfaces culturally bound, intervening and influencing the ability to communicate across cultures?” The results are contrasted against predictions for the design of web sites derived from Hofstede's (1980, 2001) seminal works on the dimensions of culture.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Old Belgrade Fairground complex is the large area in the center of Belgrade that is completely isolated from other parts of Belgrade: it is one of the most devastated city areas, populated by poor inhabitants, often by those from the marginal groups, burdened with tragic history and it represents one of hardest problems for planners to solve. It is situated on the left bank of the Sava River between two bridges and downtown New Belgrade. Opposite to it, the Sava Amphitheatre slopes down the Belgrade Ridge towards the river. The complex was built in the thirties of the 20th century across the River Sava in the area that was an unpopulated swamp - Belgrade was situated on the right Sava bank. It was meant to be modern extension of oriental city, which could represent the western tendencies of the young state (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and its capital. Modern and monumental complex of exhibition and commercial pavilions was built, and started its life with national and international fairs and exhibitions. World War 2 changed its destiny: German occupation forces transformed the complex into the concentration camp, where thousands of people were tortured and killed. After the war, new republican government, both communist and antifascist, had double frustration regarding this space: it?s tragic (during the War) and \"capitalist\" (before the War) past, so complex that was absolutely ignored in the period of the postwar renewal, and the result is described at the beginning of this text. This paper discusses the possibility to conciliate historical roles of the complex, and to realize it?s potentials in the modern world. Facts of the complex?s history are presented in the first part of the paper. Further on, these facts are analyzed in the context of contemporary city development of Belgrade in particular but globally, too.. Finally, some guidelines for crossing the gap between this area and the rest of the city are presented in the third part of the paper.</jats:p>"

One function of this paper is to re‐kindle this area of research. More specifically, the empirical study reported in this paper draws on data from UK companies, which is novel in this stream of research. In a review of 29 relevant studies by Greenley (1994) the only study identified reporting UK data was that of Grinyer and Norburn (1975), the majority of the remaining studies reporting data from the USA. Greenley notes that while this represents a stream of research from a single business culture, the major issue is one of relevance to the practice of strategic planning in Europe and other countries. Although the principles of strategic planning should, of course, have universal application, there may be national differences in strategic planning, country dependent influences from business culture, and influences from different national trading conditions. The strategic management field can be criticized for not examining particular phenomena in non‐US contexts, with respect to the impact of FSP and organizational performance this study attempts to rectify this imbalance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Exit here refers specifically to the tool cutting edges moving out of the part at an edge while removing material. Only entrance burrs are allowed to occur in this condition, resulting in less serious edge defects. This study presents a two-stage geometric algorithm for avoiding tool exits in planar milling of 2D free form contours. The cutter positions causing the tool to exit the part are first detected; then a heuristic scheme is applied to generate new\ncutter locations with no tool exits. Experimental results show that edge quality is significantly improved. This work provides a feasible method for reducing edge defect in an automatic manner without the need of edge finishing, which is highly advantageous in meso-scale machining.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Here a preliminary hypothesis is used, viz., that the concept of \"postsocialist\" public interests is disputed in each and every aspect, implicating that a new theoretical and heuristic framework is needed for urban planning. This framework ought to be developed in a way to render it acceptable as a common denominator for the majority of urban actors, on the one hand, and to help balance individual (partial) and collective interests in the preparation and implementation of planning decisions at various planning levels, on the other. Under the current conditions of transition, there are very few elements that could in advance and with certainty be ascertained of public or general interest. The quality and societal relevance of planning decisions would basically depend on the quality of planning communication and interaction, also being relevant for the developing of a public interest. In the contribution, it is particularly emphasized that, following the collapse of the former (\"socialist\") public interests, the very legitimacy of planning is endangered as well. We direct attention to a number of new approaches, with a view to make use of their respective rational, productive, emancipatory and modernizing potential. Here, it is almost the last \"resort\" for one to insist on the publicity and public control in planning decision-making, especially in terms of the role of laymen - versus the more powerful and influential stakeholders - as the key direction in developing of new modes of planning. In this context, of crucial importance is to develop a new theoretical articulation of the concept of \"postsocialist\" public interests, as this concept is constituent for developing democratic planning during the transition period. The key aspect here pertains to balancing a large number of emerging and legitimate individual interest vis-?-vis public (collective, common, and similar) interests. This also applies to developing new institutional and organization arrangements and support that are needed, to direct the \"societal game\" of individual interests to collective public purposes. Particularly, effective arrangements of the kind are needed to prevent the \"game\" ends in destructive outcome, in the first place for the already well established public interests that will predictably keep such status.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main emphasis of this paper is on grasp planning for a two-fingered parallel jawed gripper (typically used in industries) utilizing visual feedback for improved grasping for a planar object. Appropriate placement of fingers on the object plays an important role in grasp stability. This task is relatively easier for a priori-known target. But when the model of the object is not known a priori, it becomes difficult to plan the grasp and the usability of manipulator becomes limited. The main difficulty is in deciding upon the grasp points in a random object at a random location. A general approach has been presented in this paper which is applicable to any planar object. The approach uses the 2D features extracted from the image such as centroid, dimensions and principal axes to compute the grasp points' coordinates and the location of grasp axis for stability. A specialized approach is also presented which deals with objects containing only straight edges. The specialized approach utilizes Hough transform and image features in conjunction to enhance the performance of the algorithm. The proposed method can handle abrupt changes in the contour of an object as the algorithm takes object corners into account. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and validate the resuls.</jats:p>",

While a few common law tortious grounds of action and certain statutory regimes may be applicable to particular cases of soil contamination, their application is arbitrary and piecemeal, depending, for example, on the type of operation originally causing the contamination, on the extent of understanding of the problem at that time, on the nature of its related adverse effects, or on plans for the future use or development of the contaminated site. One particular lacuna in the coverage of the relevant Irish law relates to the problem of historical soil contamination, for which the Irish authorities have felt unable to legislate on account of a constitutional prohibition on retrospective liability. This paper seeks to set out the possible application of existing Irish rules to the problem of historical soil contamination and to highlight the shortcomings inherent therein. It also outlines the non-legislative solutions employed by Irish lawyers in the face of such legal uncertainty. It then goes on to examine the likely impacts of recent key developments, including the 2004 decision of the European Court of Justice in the Van de Walle case and the entry into force of the 2004 Environmental Liability Directive.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Typical medical software used to display cardiac images can delineate both inner and outer structure but its images are virtual. Therefore, solid cardiac models made by RP technology provide a touchable reality to compensate\nfor this deficiency. In this research, RP technology is utilized to assist cardiac surgery planning. CT-scanned image data were first processed to obtain RP-acceptable STL file format, and then solid cardiac models were constructed by Objet QuadraTempo, a commercial RP system made in Israel. These models proved extremely helpful in cardiac surgery planning. In addition, several commercial\nRP systems are compared by their process capabilities for cardiac surgery planning application.</jats:p>"

The market forced the company to change its sales and production strategy from “make-to-order” to “make-to-stock.” The decision to change the strategy involved not only the company’s decision to invest much more money in accumulation and keeping stocks of finished goods, it required a complete redesign of its production planning system, which was an integral part of an ERP system that used SAP software. A team of IT specialists and production planning personnel was formed for designing computer support for the new production planning system business processes. There was no consensus in the design group. IT specialists were sure that existing SAP software could provide adequate computer support. The production planning staff had doubts that SAP modules are relevant to their business processes. They argued that poor fit between the business processes implicit in the software and the business processes of EA Cakes will result in failure. To resolve the problem, the management invited a consulting company. The consultants suggested quickly designing a rough prototype system. Analyzing this system would help the working group to reach a consensus. Apart from giving adequate computer support to the new production planning system, the SAP implementation had to solve several implementation problems identified by consultants. The question is: can a standard software system like SAP give adequate computer support to an individually designed business management system?</jats:p>"

However the growth of the industry brings with it an increase in emissions which impact on the environment. In particular, aviation has an impact on climate change through emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour and sulphate and soot particles at altitude. In September 2005, the European Commission adopted a Communication setting out its proposed approach for reducing the climate change impact of aviation. As well as recognising the importance of continuing existing policy measures, the Communication proposed the inclusion of the aviation sector in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This proposed approach has been endorsed by Member States in the Council and the Commission is now preparing a proposal for legislation. This article explains the legislative context in which the proposal to include aviation in the EU ETS will be made and some of the policy and legal issues facing Community legislators in designing the scheme.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

A two-layer structure of Supervisory Planning and Operation Planning is proposed in DPP to separate generic data from machine-specific ones. The supervisory planning is only performed once, in advance, at shop level, whereas the operation planning is carried out at runtime at machine level. This dynamic decision-making is facilitated by a set of resource-driven algorithms embedded in the function blocks. The internal structures of typical function blocks are also introduced in the paper. The DPP approach and algorithms are further verified through a case study before drawing conclusions. It is expected that the new approach can largely enhance the dynamism of fluctuating job shop operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A decision process in which rewards depend on history rather than merely on the current state is called a decision process with non-Markovian rewards (NMRDP). In decision-theoretic planning, where many desirable behaviours are more naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as properties of states, NMRDPs form a more natural model than the commonly adopted fully Markovian decision process (MDP) model. While the more tractable solution methods developed for MDPs do not directly apply in the presence of non-Markovian rewards, a number of solution methods for NMRDPs have been proposed in the literature. These all exploit a compact specification of the non-Markovian reward function in temporal logic, to automatically translate the NMRDP into an equivalent MDP which is solved using efficient MDP solution methods. This paper presents NMRDPP (Non-Markovian Reward Decision Process Planner), a software platform for the development and experimentation of methods for decision-theoretic planning with non-Markovian rewards. The current version of NMRDPP implements, under a single interface, a family of methods based on existing as well as new approaches which we describe in detail. These include dynamic programming, heuristic search, and structured methods. Using NMRDPP, we compare the methods and identify certain problem features that affect their performance. NMRDPP's treatment of non-Markovian rewards is inspired by the treatment of domain-specific search control knowledge in the TLPlan planner, which it incorporates as a special case. In the First International Probabilistic Planning Competition, NMRDPP was able to compete and perform well in both the domain-independent and hand-coded tracks, using search control knowledge in the latter. \n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\nThe analysis of economic disparities within the European Union strongly depends on the regional level considered. Whereas the economic gap between the member states has decreased over the last decades, regional disparities have rather deepened. The reason for these contradictory findings can be found in the increasing disparities within many of the member states: Especially in growing economies the gap between urban centres and rural peripheries tends to widen. The spatial concentration of research and development, high skilled labour, infrastructure and foreign investment in the capitals will therefore suppose-ably become a big challenge for the accession countries, which will have to face increasing international competition. Joining a common market of more than 450 million people means new opportunities, challenges and threats for economic development, which have to be faced by local, regional and national governments as well as by European institutions.&#x0D;\nEU-policies act in the dichotomy between the conflicting goals of economic growth and cohesion. Since they strongly influence regional conditions for production it is of great political interest whether a certain measure fosters economic efficiency by favouring the highly developed centres or rather enhances convergence by promoting lagging regions. The answer is, however, not trivial and needs closer examination: Measures encouraging regional cohesion on the European level can also increase disparities within a state or a region at the same time. This is the reason why the regional effects of EU-policies have to be analysed on different spatial levels.&#x0D;\nDealing with the spatial impacts of various European Policies (Regional Policy, Trans-European Networks, Common Agricultural Policy, Research and Technological Development Policy) there is some evidence that these policies try to compensate the effects of growing competition in the common market by concentrating their efforts on urban growth poles within the underdeveloped countries. Doing that, the European Union comes up to the two conflicting goals of growth and cohesion by promoting efficient economic development in the member states on the one hand and regional convergence on the European level on the other. This approach is of course mainly directed at European objectives and brings about new problems for the member states: According to the principle of subsidiarity the growing divergence within the member states is, however, not a policy task of the European Union but of the member states: Therefore national politics are still required to take on responsibility for these intranational problems by adopting their transport, regional and economic policies to the new challenge.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The effect of these policies was to establish pollution prevention and monitoring criteria as well as public registers for (potentially) polluted industrial sites. The industrial regime (Installations Classées pour la Protection de l'Environment, 'ICPE') has been a key instrument in the development of soil protection, not only in the context of prevention but also in terms of liability for soil contamination which, in the absence of specific legislation, has relied on other liability regimes. The last fifteen years has also seen a rash of often contradictory case law, in particular concerning the definitions of liable persons and remediation levels. However, these definitions, in particular concerning liable persons, appear to have been settled by recent case law.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

It is shown that these documents tend to move away from representations of agricultural activity towards representations of agricultural space where landscape and environmental functions are combined with the agricultural function. In these constructions, the policies adopted at the intercommunal scale are used to support and legitimise choices made by each commune, choices that go from die expression of a process of rurbanisation or peri-urbanisation, where agriculture is relegated to the slopes, to the maintenance of agriculture in those areas where its potential is high.</jats:p>"

SUNARP was created in 1994 to become the ruling entity of all public registry offices in Peru, which to that time had been working in an isolated fashion. The case describes the projects already completed, their respective success and their deployment across the organization’s bureaus across the nation. The Registry Information System (SIR, in Spanish) and the consequent online registry publicity service are worthy of noting. It takes account of the fact that many of these projects were originally initiated in the largest Registry Zone, the former Lima and Callao Registry Office. Moreover, the paper mentions the future challenges faced by SUNARP in its efforts to provide online registration services.</jats:p>"

In 1996, the Information Systems group convinced top management to pursue a big-bang ERP implementation of SAP R/3. To reduce project risk, risk management was practiced. First, only modules that matched the functionality of the then-existing systems were targeted, avoiding as much as possible software modifications and process reengineering. Second, a steering committee was set up to handle conflict resolution and set priorities throughout the project and top users were given responsibility with implementing modules within the irrespective functions. R/3 went into production on July 1, 1998, six months ahead of schedule and without exceeding the $4.95 million budget.</jats:p>"

We describe the 4D seismic acquisition and processing strategies that have been developed and proven elsewhere in the world, and customise those strategies for Australasian applications.We demonstrate how a multidisciplinary pursuit of real-time acquisition and processing Quality Control (QC) is an integral component of any 4D project. The acquisition and processing geophysicists must be able to understand all the factors contributing to the 4D seismic signal as they happen. Such an understanding can only arise through rigorous project QC and management using interactive visualisation technology. In turn, the production geologists and reservoir engineers will then receive 4D seismic products that can be robustly and confidently used for the construction of accurate reservoir models and the pursuit of reliable reservoir simulations and forecasts.</jats:p>"

The examination of the general part of the EU Sustainability Strategy shows that it lacks both a mission statement and a clear conceptual approach, thus making it difficult to achieve a steering effect. Those parts of the strategy that deal with climate protection show a strong sense of urgency and a great commitment to the EU objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the - manifold! - measures taken are still too weak. More determination and more effort is necessary to change patterns of thought and behaviour, and it seems that this is a direct consequence of neglecting the necessity of defining a mission statement and a conceptual approach.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The choice of outcome measures is central in dermatological healthcare planning. The concept of ill health and its relationship to dermatological outcome measures is described. Outcome measures used should provide information on these issues in order to gain insight into genuine needs and illness behavior in the population and to ensure quality of healthcare. Nevertheless, the dilemma of assigning priorities in healthcare planning remains; outcome measures in dermatology should be perceived as appropriate by patients as well as by caregivers and policy makers. It is important to stimulate research to develop and refine person-focused outcome measures. Their use is essential to assess dermatological health needs and to understand illness behavior. The information they can provide can enable provision and evaluation of healthcare quality and contribute to the challenge of making appropriate priority decisions in healthcare.</jats:p>"

Examination of this little-known report provides new insight into the evolution of Leopold’s thinking and the development of applied conservation science. The report emerged at a time when insights from scientific ecology were beginning to alter utilitarian and preservationist approaches to conservation and resource management in North America. In his report Leopold integrated ideas from several disciplines, producing a plan that emphasized the establishment of core and buffer zones in protected areas, reduction of overabundant native species, relaxation of predator control policies, and integration of research in the management of protected areas.</jats:p>",

First, future researchers might attempt to understand the conclusions about the knowledge sharing factors of this research through structured interviews in case studies of IS directors from ongoing or recently completed ISSP projects. Researchers might ask subjects why these factors are associated with the effectiveness of ISSP. Second, future researchers could consider more general factors that affecting knowledge sharing behaviour such as task coordination, rewards and political behaviour. Third, the subjects of this study are IS executives in Taiwan. Cultural differences may exist between Taiwan and other countries.

Numerous organizational mechanisms exist that can enhance knowledge sharing and transfer, including IT steering committee and strategic IS/IT team. Furthermore, organizations could apply both of group interaction mechanism and knowledge management mechanism to promote the formulation of organizational learning environment and fit the organizational context during IS/IT strategic planning.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The study shows a growing amount of empirical work that has been conducted examining the relationship between ISSP and organizational context. However, there has been little empirical research that investigates the relationship between knowledge sharing behaviour among stakeholders and the effectiveness of ISSP. The results of this study will be of interest to business managers or strategic planners who are initiating or conducting information systems strategic planning exercises, ant to researchers in the field of information systems management and planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The project involved information management in the maintenance wing of the company. After the event, analysis of the problem situation revealed the extent of the company’s IS/IT management difficulties. Many of these problems were directly attributable to privatization and the outsourcing arrangements imposed upon the new company. The lessons from the case cast serious doubts upon the long-term benefits of outsourcing key systems and are believed to represent a significant learning vehicle relating to IS/IT adoption and exploitation.</jats:p>"

As a result, there are still a large number of information technology (IT) organizations that have not yet implemented any object-oriented (OO) process. For them, the transition to a new work environment and the adoption and utilization of a software process implies a number of problems, commonly including necessary human and organizational resistance to the ensuing cultural change. This chapter provides IT organizations and professionals with insights into the most important key success factors that may promote the entire process of organizational change. We investigate the effect of various human factors on the adoption and diffusion of an object-oriented software development process. Some of the human factors include motivation, leadership, resistance to culture change, and willingness and readiness to change. In addition, this chapter explores the significant role of these factors in controlling the entire process of implementing an OO process in practice, emphasizing the significance of planning and managing these “soft” factors to achieve clear advantages and gain enviable results.</jats:p>"

Among the obstacles that hamper effective management and decision-making in urban development process are the absence of integration between the works of the professionals involve in such process and the unavailability of immediate and reliable data to form the basis for sound decision-making. Thus, this paper proposes that a city-wide spatial information system to be developed comprising two major elements: a common platform for integrating the works of the various built environment professionals and a city-wide built environment database. While the common platform will help to streamline the works of the professionals, the database will assists urban government in making sound and informed decision in relation to planning, management, maintenance, and monitoring of the urban built environment. This paper highlights the efforts of the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) in developing its spatial information system. The system is designed to provide information on the IIUM property that covers buildings, infrastructure, facilities, and space to decision makers and managers to help them in making sound decision and in implementing effective property management scheme.</jats:p>"

Among the obstacles that hamper effective management and decision-making in urban development process are the absence of integration between the works of the professionals involve in such process and the unavailability of immediate and reliable data to form the basis for sound decision-making. Thus, this paper proposes that a city-wide spatial information system to be developed comprising two major elements: a common platform for integrating the works of the various built environment professionals and a city-wide built environment database. While the common platform will help to streamline the works of the professionals, the database will assists urban government in making sound and informed decision in relation to planning, management, maintenance, and monitoring of the urban built environment. This paper highlights the efforts of the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) in developing its spatial information system. The system is designed to provide information on the IIUM property that covers buildings, infrastructure, facilities, and space to decision makers and managers to help them in making sound decision and in implementing effective property management scheme.</jats:p>"

Ensuring compliance with international environmental laws is equally a matter of increasing concern. In recent years there has been growing interest internationally as to whether satellite technologies could have the capabilities to provide new and valuable sources of environmental information to be used in compliance strategies. This paper explores the potential and significance of employing satellite monitoring data as a compliance tool in the context of important recent advancements in the technology. Whilst satellite technologies offer great promise for detecting and monitoring environmentally related activities, it is clear that they are not yet suitable for all types of compliance monitoring needs. The paper will draw upon some national and international experience to date, and assess both the constraints and the opportunities that may be provided by satellite technologies in addressing limitations in conventional environmental inspection and enforcement regimes.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Users interpret lods by translating them into standard statistical concepts such as p values, α levels and power. An alternative statistical paradigm, the Evidential Framework, in contrast, works directly with the LR. A key feature of this paradigm is that it decouples error probabilities from measures of evidence. We describe the philosophy behind and the operating characteristics of this paradigm – based on new, alternatively-defined error probabilities. We then apply this approach to linkage studies of a genetic trait for: I. fully informative gametes, II. double backcross sibling pairs, and III. nuclear families. We consider complete and incomplete penetrance for the disease model, as well as using an incorrect penetrance. We calculate the error probabilities (exactly for situations I and II, via simulation for III), over a range of recombination fractions, sample sizes, and linkage criteria. We show how to choose linkage criteria and plan linkage studies, such that the probabilities of being misled by the data (i.e. concluding either that there is strong evidence favouring linkage when there is no linkage, or that there is strong evidence against linkage when there is linkage) are low, and the probability of observing strong evidence in favour of the truth is high. We lay the groundwork for applying this paradigm in genetic studies and for understanding its implications for multiple tests.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ‘multiple testing problem’ currently bedevils the field of genetic epidemiology. Briefly stated, this problem arises with the performance of more than one statistical test and results in an increased probability of committing at least one Type I error. The accepted/conventional way of dealing with this problem is based on the classical Neyman-Pearson statistical paradigm and involves adjusting one’s error probabilities. This adjustment is, however, problematic because in the process of doing that, one is also adjusting one’s measure of evidence. Investigators have actually become wary of looking at their data, for fear of having to adjust the strength of the evidence they observed at a given locus on the genome every time they conduct an additional test. In a companion paper in this issue (Strug &amp;#38; Hodge I), we presented an alternative statistical paradigm, the ‘evidential paradigm’, to be used when planning and evaluating linkage studies. The evidential paradigm uses the lod score as the measure of evidence (as opposed to a p value), and provides new, alternatively defined error probabilities (alternative to Type I and Type II error rates). We showed how this paradigm separates or decouples the two concepts of &lt;i&gt;error probabilities&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;strength of the evidence.&lt;/i&gt; In the current paper we apply the evidential paradigm to the multiple testing problem – specifically, multiple testing in the context of linkage analysis. We advocate using the lod score as the sole measure of the strength of evidence; we then derive the corresponding probabilities of being misled by the data under different multiple testing scenarios. We distinguish two situations: performing multiple tests of a single hypothesis, vs. performing a single test of multiple hypotheses. For the first situation the probability of being misled remains small regardless of the number of times one tests the single hypothesis, as we show. For the second situation, we provide a rigorous argument outlining how replication samples themselves (analyzed in conjunction with the original sample) constitute appropriate adjustments for conducting multiple hypothesis tests on a data set.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This case describes evolution of a small software company through three major phases of its life cycle. During the first phase, the business was founded within a subsidiary of a large multinational information technology (IT) company. In the second phase, the business evolved as a spin-off from the initial organization through a MBO (management buy-out) into an independent software vendor. Finally, in the third phase, the business has established itself as a vertically-focused business unit within a publicly-quoted company operating in software and consulting businesses. These three phases are termed introduction, growth and maturity as defined by Cravens (1987, 376).1 The company described in this case, called TradeSys, Inc. (pseudonym), develops and sells software for trade unions and unemployment fund organizations. The business model of TradeSys, Inc. (later TradeSys) has evolved through a typical life cycle of product-oriented software companies in Finland. First, it was comprised of business information systems consultation and a proposition of systems solution to a few major customer organizations. This led to customer-initiated product development. Consequently, the deliverable of the very first project was developed as a solution to the needs of a single customer, which was later worked into a universal software product along with several customer projects. During all three major phases, the company had to rethink its business model and value propositions. At each stage, the ownership of the business has also changed. This case highlights the challenges of a business in the three major turning points in its life cycle and the major changes in the business model accordingly.</jats:p>"

Larger diameter tools that have higher material removal rates are used to clear large open spaces, smaller tools are used for clean up. The challenge lies in selecting that particular combination of tools that minimizes total cost. Previously, we developed algorithms based on network optimization to find the best tool sequence given a list of cutters, cutting parameters and pocket geometry. The formulation was based on certain assumptions that did not account for tool holder geometry. It also required the evaluation of all possible tool-pair combinations for a given tool set. This can get time consuming if the tool set is large. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm based method to select optimal tool sequences. The algorithm was implemented and bench marked against the graph algorithm. We have found that the GA based method is able to find a near optimal tool sequence without evaluating up to 30% of all possible tool-pairs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines optimal social linkage when each individual's repeated interaction with each of his neighbors creates spillovers. Each individual's discount factor is randomly determined. A planner chooses a local interaction network or <jats:italic>neighborhood design</jats:italic> before the discount factors are realized. Each individual then plays a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game with his neighbors. A <jats:italic>local trigger strategy equilibrium (LTSE)</jats:italic> describes an equilibrium in which each individual conditions his cooperation on the cooperation of at least one “acceptable” group of neighbors. Our main results demonstrate a basic trade‐off in the design problem between suboptimal punishment and social conflict. Potentially suboptimal punishment arises in designs with local interactions since in this case monitoring is imperfect. Owing to the heterogeneity of discount factors, however, greater social conflict may arise in more connected networks. When individuals' discount factors are known to the planner, the optimal design exhibits a cooperative “core” and an uncooperative “fringe.”“Uncooperative” (impatient) types are connected to cooperative ones who tolerate their free riding so that social conflict is kept to a minimum. By contrast, when the planner knows only the ex ante distribution over individual discount factors, then in some cases the optimal design partitions individuals into maximally connected <jats:italic>cliques</jats:italic> (e.g., cul‐de‐sacs), whereas in other cases incomplete graphs with small overlap (e.g., grids) are possible.</jats:p>",

In addition, it could be a powerful agent in affecting technology adoption within a technologically backward host country. By contrast, foreign direct investment has not been a significant source of information technology transfer into the Chinese banking system. Neither has it been an effective agent in affecting technology adoption in this system. The priority and concern of the Chinese government in protecting, and retaining control of, its domestic banks and financial market have kept foreign direct investment in the banking industry at a relatively modest level. The controlled industry, the long wait for full market competition, and the inadequate infrastructure and operating framework have inhibited the foreign banks from adopting highly sophisticated information technology for their restricted business operations and from being an effective conduit in technology transfer.</jats:p>"

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 621 consecutive women aged from 16 to 24 years was carried out over a 3-month period in 2004 at five Family Planning NSW centres. Urine samples were tested for C. trachomatis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Women with a positive result were reviewed and treated. Results: Of 925 eligible clients, 621 (67%) were recruited to the study. Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 35 of the 621 recruits (5.6%, 95% CI 3.8–7.4). The prevalence at the Hunter centre was significantly higher than the combined prevalence at the other four participating centres (9.7% compared with 3.9%; P = 0.008). Two characteristics were identified as independent predictors of infection in this study: ‘reporting a recent change of partner in the past three months’ (crude odds ratio (OR) 3.33, 95% CI 1.67–6.64) and ‘reporting three or more partners in the past year’ (crude OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.83–7.46). Reported condom use, a history of one or more sexually transmissible infections and current combined oral contraceptive pill use were not associated with infection in this study. Conclusions: The prevalence of C. trachomatis infection is sufficiently high to support targeted testing of 16–24-year-old women in the Family Planning NSW setting and informs the development of a national screening strategy.\n</jats:p>"

The connection between planning nervousness and the bullwhip was investigated in detail through a vendor‐managed inventory (VMI) model in the chain. Planning nervousness causes bullwhip, as the changes in demand were amplified in the used information sharing process in VMI. In product introduction phase, the phenomenon was emphasized.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>To stabilize and simplify planning the process should be differentiated according to product life‐cycle phases.

Yet despite crowded terminals and a severe shortage of rolling stock, railroads carried eight times more freight by weight than ships and barges, and canal tonnage had fallen by two-thirds since 1880. The railroads, according to President Theodore Roosevelt, were “no longer able to move crops and manufactures rapidly enough to secure the prompt transaction of the business of the Nation.…There appears to be but one complete remedy–the development of a complementary system of transportation by water.” Perishable foods and high-value factory goods would always travel by rail, Roosevelt acknowledged, but bulky cargo such as wheat, coal, timber, and iron could and should move by water. Improving the nation's waterways would increase the profits of railroads and manufacturers, provide capital for expansion, and reduce the cost of living. It would serve as a tonic to the entire economy.</jats:p>"

The existing legislation covers some aspects of chemical and biological soil protection, e.g. in the sewage sludge directive, the Water Framework Directive, the IPPC Directive, the Habitats Directive as well as in waste management law, but it remains fragmented and focuses on safeguarding the soils as side effects. Furthermore, the requirements for the prevention of soil compaction, erosion, sealing and other physical threats of the soil are hardly considered by EU law. A turning point was marked by the 6th Environmental Action Programme with the intention to develop a specific EU strategy for soil protection (which is due to be published soon). According to reflections de lege ferenda (which could have a stimulating effect in this process), principles and instruments of EU soil protection law could be developed as elements of a targeted policy. The combination of regulative and non-regulative instruments, particularly consisting of those of planning, of direct and indirect behaviour control, of company organisation and of private law, could lead to a more effective protection of the soils. A closer look at these possible EU instruments might be interesting for the development of legal regimes of soil protection at the national and international level as well. These general considerations should be evaluated with regard to the EU competences and the principle of subsidiarity.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

This case study provides a detailed account of an ill-fated initiative to centrally plan and procure, with the aim to homogenize requirements, an integrated applications suite for a number of British higher education institutions. It is argued that because systems are so deeply embedded in operations and organization and, as you cannot possibly foresee and therefore plan for environmental discontinuities, high-risk, ‘big-bang’ approaches to information systems planning and development must be avoided. In this context the case illustrates the level of complexity that unpredictable change can bring to an information technology project that aims to establish the ‘organizationally generic’ and the destabilizing effects it has on the network of the project’s stakeholders.</jats:p>"

This new policy is the “Industrial Cluster Plan”. The advocators of this plan consider it possible to set up a region artificially. A region cannot, however, be created in such a way, but is a historical construct. Accumulated social capital is important for the recognition of a region. The social capital is decisive for collaborative undertakings among entrepreneurs. This is exemplified by the case of the area along Chuo Freeway, where we can recognize several regions.</jats:p>"

Particularly, it focuses on their awareness of and attitudes to language policy in both South Africa and New Zealand, and how these influence their own and their family’s language practices. Narrative interviews with 28 participants living in towns and cities across New Zealand reveal that while living in South Africa they were generally aware of macro-level language policies in the country, and were able to articulate how these policies influenced language practices at work and within their families. The absence of an explicit national language policy in New Zealand means that these immigrants, on arrival in New Zealand, base their understanding of the linguistic context in the country on the language practices that they observe in their day-to-day lives. It is these observations which guide their decision-making with regard to their own and their family’s language practices.</jats:p>"

Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of necessary tools for the system level design and performance improvement, resulting in approaches to designing a single RMS. In this paper, a methodology for cost-effective reconfiguration planning for multi-module-multi-product RMS’s that best reflect the market demand changes is proposed. Formulated as an optimization procedure, reconfiguration planning is defined as the best reallocation of part families to production modules in an RMS and the best rebalancing of the whole system and each individual module to achieve minimum related cost and simultaneously satisfy the market demand. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is proposed to overcome the computational difficulties caused by the problem complexity. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with a case study.</jats:p>",

Particularly, it focuses on their awareness of and attitudes to language policy in both South Africa and New Zealand, and how these influence their own and their family’s language practices. Narrative interviews with 28 participants living in towns and cities across New Zealand reveal that while living in South Africa they were generally aware of macro-level language policies in the country, and were able to articulate how these policies influenced language practices at work and within their families. The absence of an explicit national language policy in New Zealand means that these immigrants, on arrival in New Zealand, base their understanding of the linguistic context in the country on the language practices that they observe in their day-to-day lives. It is these observations which guide their decision-making with regard to their own and their family’s language practices.</jats:p>",

Many more fear that the ongoing information technology explosion may eventually leave them behind. Due to entrenched mindsets and bureaucracy in higher education, fostering a technology cultural change requires paradigm shifts in all areas of administration, teaching, and research. A fundamental paradigm shift must happen in four areas before a technology cultural change can beset on a forward path. This chapter focuses on four essential components of a paradigm shift in technology and higher education at the University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC). This case describes how a paradigm shift model can help to promote a long-term technology cultural change in a higher education institution. The model consists of technology commitment, technology philosophy, investment priority, and development focus. It has been used at UMC to bring about a reengineering of the entire institution to support a ubiquitous laptop environment throughout the curriculum and campus. The model has helped UMC achieve an overwhelming success in utilizing laptop computing and other technology to enhance learning.</jats:p>"

A list of barriers and motivators to the successful use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in small business are examined, and a profile of Internet usage practices in Australian small businesses in general and SMTEs in particular is provided. One particular barrier that is not matched by a motivator is the lack of effective planning by small businesses. A number of planning models are examined, with one (Burgess, 2002) selected for comparison with the activities of SMTEs in selected parts of urban and rural Australia. Some 59 SMTEs were interviewed for the purpose of assessing their Web site development. In general, SMTEs generally performed a little better than we expected—but not all of them and even those that did had room for improvement. There were some variations between urban and rural SMTEs, but not as many as we expected. The main outcome of this investigation is that, although SMTEs performed slightly better than we would have expected in relation to the planning model, there is still a great deal of scope for those that have performed adequately to perform better and still a great number of SMTEs that do very little planning at all for their Web site implementations.</jats:p>"

It outlines salient features of policy on the use ofArticle 228 to enforce European Court of Justice judgments and touches on the relationship between complaint-handling and the pursuit of core implementation deficits, before presenting some general conclusions.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Former Federal Environmental Minister Jürgen Trittin stressed, that this rule provides a major incentive for the renewal of the German power plant fleet by the erection of highly efficient new facilities. These modernisation efforts could make a major contribution to climate protection efforts. It can thus be expected, that a similar rule will also be implemented in the recently discussed Allocation Act for the next allocation period 2008-2012. It is thus worth exploring the details for the application of this rule.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Predictive models for Stress Corrosion Crack growth were developed using laboratory test data from the mid 1970’s, and limited inspection data and excavation measurements from the early 1990’s. Extensive efforts continue to be made to develop strategies for a better management of the SCC problem. In this paper, a study of crack growth rates was conducted on the Williams 16-inch gas pipeline using data from two consecutive in-line crack detection tool runs and direct field measurements. Findings from this study provide a direct measurement of crack growth rates for ILI crack features with depths ranging from 12.5%wt to 40%wt. Future integrity of the pipeline was assessed. The integrity management strategies could be further refined using the calculated crack growth rate, field excavation data and fracture mechanics based API 579 FAD approach.</jats:p>",

In particular, a problem of combining multiple web services to satisfy a single task, known as web services composition problem, has received much attention recently, and various solutions have been proposed. Among many proposed solutions, however, it is not clear to use which one in what scenarios. In this paper, to this end, we present: (1) a taxonomy and decision guideline of available solution spaces; (2) an overview of syntactic and semantic matching approaches, and (3) a comparative illustration of three representative solutions from the perspective of e-service workflows.</jats:p>",

Such a system was developed for a large public transport company to provide African commuters with limited educational background with up-to-date information on schedules and ticket prices while also presenting general company information in a graphically attractive way. The challenges regarding liaison with passengers are highlighted and the use of a touch screen kiosk to supplement current liaison media is justified. System architecture is motivated and special services offered by the system are discussed. Several lessons were learned regarding the implementation of such a system in general, as well as in this environment specifically. An online survey indicated that the system fulfils its role of providing useful information in an accessible medium to commuters in a reasonable time.</jats:p>"

This offset path has been studied vastly due to the potential of its applications. The majority of contour-parallel path research is found in robotics, CNC machining, and metal deposition. Even though curve offsetting has been extensively studied, there is virtually no algorithm that can produce a complete connected deposition path and can fill arbitrary shape cross sections entirely without gaps. This gap problem is similar to the uncut-region problem in CNC pocket machining. There are only few investigations on this uncut-region or gap problem even though the problem has long been recognized. A new strategy to divide regions and to plan the spiral-like deposition paths without gap based on contour-parallel paths is discussed in this paper. To prove the correctness and the usefulness of the proposed method, simulations and experiments are also discussed.</jats:p>",

Renewable energy, however, represents an area where we believe that freer less-distorted trade and environmental protection have the potential to be mutually reinforcing. Historically, electrical energy itself has not been traded across borders, with some exceptions (Canada and the US and in the EU). However, with the de-monopolisation of electricity in an increasing number of jurisdictions, and the unbundling of functions such as generation, grid operation, transmission, and retailing as well as the development of financial instruments such as futures and options contracts for energy, the structure of the entire market is starting to change, complicating the analysis under WTO law. This article aims to raise questions and suggest areas where domestic and international policymakers may need to consider undertaking further analysis.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

At the heart of this transformation which took place between 1989 and 1992 is a system called DRIVES. The project was innovative in the technology platform it devised and in the CASE technology it used to build the application. The new system has paid for itself at the same time as transforming the Roads and Traffic Authority’s way of doing the business. In addition it has generated new strategic opportunities. The iterating sequence of steps, or looped path, by which the Roads and Traffic Authority achieved its organizational transformation is compared with the more traditional top-down path. The looped path helps prepare the organization for the information technology change, makes risk more manageable by reducing the dependence between steps in the path, and leads to strategic benefits after the organizational changes have been mastered. Thus, we say that the particular order in which change was undertaken led to the new organizational order.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>A new heuristic method to mitigate infeasibilities when a choice is  forced into a solution was developed to solve spatially constrained  forest planning problems. One unique aspect of the heuristic is the  introduction of unchosen decision choices into a solution regardless of  the resulting infeasibilities, which are then mitigated by selecting  next-best choices for those spatial units that are affected, but in a  radiating manner away from the initial choice. As subsequent changes are  made to correct the affected spatial units, more infeasibilities may  occur, and these are corrected as well in an outward manner from the  initial choice. A single iteration of the model may involve a number of  changes to the status of the decision variables, making this an n-opt  heuristic process. The second unique aspect of the search process is the  periodic reversion of the search to a saved (in computer memory) best  solution. Tests have shown that the reversion is needed to ensure better  solutions are located. This new heuristic produced solutions to spatial  problems that are of equal or comparable in quality to traditional  integer programming solutions, and solutions that are better than those  produced by two other basic heuristics. Three small hypothetical forest  examples illustrate the performance of the heuristic against standard  versions of threshold accepting and tabu search. In each of the three  examples, the variation in solutions generated from random starting  points is smaller with the new heuristic, and the difference in solution  values between the new heuristic and the other two heuristics is  significant (p&lt;0.05) when using an analysis of variance. However,  what remains to be seen is whether the new method can be applied  successfully to the broader range of operations research problems in  forestry and other fields.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Setup planning is a set of activities to arrange manufacturing features into an appropriate sequence for processing. As such, setup planning can significantly impact the product quality in terms of dimensional variation in the Key Product Characteristics (KPC’s). Current approaches in setup planning are experience-based and tend to be conservative by selecting unnecessarily precise machines and fixtures to ensure final product quality. This is especially true in multi-stage manufacturing processes because it has been difficult to predict the variation propagation and its impact on KPC quality. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to realize cost-effective, quality ensured setup planning for multi-stage manufacturing processes. Setup planning is formulated as an optimization problem based on quantitative evaluation with the Stream-of-Variation (SoV) models. The optimal setup plan minimizes the cost related to process precision and satisfies the quality specifications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through setup planning for a multi-stage machining process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past year, many of us have become involved in the development of strategic plans for the hospitals, health authorities and clinical practices in which we work in case an influenza pandemic occurs in the very near future.  Planning for this on the front lines is difficult, due in large part to the uncertainties involved. How will the pandemic evolve? Is the current H5N1 strain of bird flu going to be ′the′ one? How closely will the pandemic resemble that of 1918? Will it have the same transmission characteristics as the yearly endemic influenza strains or will it be so different that our routine infection prevention precautions for influenza will be ineffective? Will there be a useful vaccine that is widely available and safe? That the current death rate associated with H5N1 strain infections in humans is approximately 60% is quite frightening; an influenza pandemic with such a high death rate is almost incomprehensible. Therefore, it is a relief to hear that the upper estimates are at a much lower rate of approximately 5% in most suggested epidemiological models. Will the use of oseltamivir really work to prevent infection, illness, morbidity or death? If so, will there be sufficient supplies available in Canada? How are we supposed to make plans so that our medical system, which is already quite stressed, will be functional under the extreme conditions that are anticipated? One major difficulty is that we do not actually know how soon, if at all, the pandemic will occur. Specific, highly detailed plans made today may not be applicable in the future. As a result, most contingency plans are being made for a generic situation based on the general assumption that some percentage of the workforce will be absent from work for some specified period of time. In general, the plans tend to be impersonal because they concentrate on essential functions that need to be undertaken in an institution and assume that, with training, all personnel can cross‐cover these services to accommodate for those times when the employees who routinely perform those tasks are absent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of multi-agent capture and manipulation of an object has been an area of active interest for many researchers. This paper presents a novel approach using Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal contact points and the total number of agents (mobile robots) required to capture a stationary generic 2D polygonal object. After the goal points are determined the agents then reach their respective goals using a decentralized projective path planning algorithm. Form closure of the object is obtained using the concept of accessibility angle. The object boundary is first expanded and the robots reach the expanded object goal points and then converge on the actual object. This ensures that the agents reach the actual goal points at the same time and have the correct orientation. Frictionless point contact between the object and robots is assumed. The shape of the robot is considered a circle such that it can only apply force in outward radial direction from its center and along the normal to the object boundary at the contact point. Simulations results are presented that prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has suggested that soil protection has been taken for granted by policy and law makers and that soil quality has not been given the same priority as air or water quality. After many years of neglect, we have arrived at something of a crossroads in terms of soil protection policy. Various policy documents have emerged which seek to place soil protection on a higher level of importance. The simple aim of this article is to locate the UK's position on soil protection in the context of the wider framework which is emerging at a European level. The article concludes that whilst there has been a recognition for some years that an integrated soil protection policy is needed in the UK, the progress towards producing such a policy has been painfully slow, fragmented and unproductive partly as a result of a lack of basic information on soil and the incoherent nature of the administration of soil protection.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Better-managed companies have been looking for best-in-class planning practices to control their inventories and achieve superior results. Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) may be the next great thing in inventory and vendor management and a source of advantage for such companies. CPFR is a set of business processes that are established and empowered by a formal agreement to cooperate on strategy, tactics, and execution by resolution of exceptions. Retailers and suppliers are moving to improve their supply chain through this process. Gradually, they are recognizing the advantages of web-based cooperation to develop a single, more accurate demand forecast and devise a plan for delivering product to meet customer demand. The present article highlights the role of CPFR in supply chain management of an organization. </jats:p>",

Moreover, the accession of 10 new Member States has entailed an enlargement of the EU territory, requiring a deeper analysis of the new situation which has led to the emergence of 'sustainable territorial development' as the common element between the multilevel relationships set by the European Governance White Book of the European Commission and the provisions of the ESDP. In fact, with the preparation of this and other European soft law documents, the EU has found an effective type of instrument to deal with the territorial problems without requiring any competences in the area of spatial planning for its actions. In this way, a clearer means of achieving the emerging objective of sustainable territorial development has been developed.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Recently, the size of mobile manipulators has been decreased according to their given tasks. For such systems, the stability issue is very important. The robot system should be able to keep itself in an optimal situation. For reaching to this goal, one can use a redundant degree of freedom for the mobile manipulator such that this redundancy makes it possible to recover the system's stability by dynamic compensatory motion of manipulator when the system is unstable. In this paper, we present an algorithm which is fast enough to stabilize the mobile manipulator with the best stability criterion based on a neural network and genetic algorithm which cooperate together. For applying the optimal values as the algorithm outputs to the appropriate joints, a PD controller is used. The significance of this algorithm is provided for a spatial mobile manipulator with a predefined trajectory of the end-effector and the vehicle.</jats:p>",

The characterisation that was realised in 2005 showed that many problems have yet to be resolved, and that they can only be resolved at great expense. In view of this fact, it would be desirable to allow exemptions from specific water management objectives in special cases. The criteria such exemptions must meet are set forth in Sec. 25c-d of the Federal Water Act. The present report argues that these criteria should be interpreted in such a way as to ensure that exemptions are allowed in exceptional cases only, and in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the Water Framework Directive.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nAn electromagnetic induction (EM31) survey was carried out on a 700-ha property in the western basalt plains of Victoria. The apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) was interpreted in terms of the inferred salt content and, hence, the degree of leaching or recharge through the upper 5 m of the regolith. The focus of the survey was to determine the spatial variability of ECa across a landscape of low relief which included salt lakes. The area mapped is subject to regional groundwater discharge. All parts of the property exhibited hydrological ‘sinks’ and ‘trenches’ of relatively low ECa values, interpreted as areas of preferential recharge or leaching through the regolith. They ranged in size from 200 to 500 m in diameter and/or length and were not related to relief. This apparent hydrological ‘holeyness’ of the upper regolith suggests local recharge into the regional groundwater system. This finding has important implications for Whole Farm Planning and Environmental Management Strategies as local recharge can be reduced by manipulating ground cover and land-use practices. Both the mean and standard deviation of ECa values across the property provide a rational basis for planning land management practices. The location of hydrological ‘holes’ can be built in as significant layers in Whole Farm Plans to minimise water entering the water table and/or salt lakes.\n</jats:p>"

Recently, the software tool ULMDOS was developed to facilitate planar dosimetric calculations and to support traceability and documentation as a prerequisite for good clinical practice. Here, the extended version of ULMDOS for processing of tomographic data is presented. Methods: ULMDOS is developed in IDL 6.1 (Interactive Data Language) under Windows XP/2000. Serial tomographic data can be loaded in an ECAT7 or DICOM format, and presented as maximum intensity projection. The definition of volumes of interest is supported by various tools (e.g., freehand, isocontour, polygon), region growing, and cluster analysis. Residence times are calculated from fits of the time activity data to exponential functions. Results, discussion: Quantitative 3-dimensional data allow performing a more individualized dosimetry, as problems due to organ overlay, insufficient attenuation and scatter correction in the planar approach can be avoided. For traceability, documentation, retrospective examination and later processing all data can be saved in binary or ASCII format. Dosimetric calculations can be conducted within a single environment, thus it spares the time-consuming transfer of data between different software tools.</jats:p>"

To help fill this gap, the Awwa Research Foundation sponsored the study summarized in this article. The full study forms a “casebook” of comparative asset management options. Eleven utilities of diverse sizes, asset ages, availability of automated information, and engagement in asset management worked with the project team to test and evaluate three levels of asset management planning: basic, high‐end, and strategic. The study results showed that even a basic asset management option has considerable value for a water utility. More advanced and strategic options require significant additional investment, but 80% of the utilities that participated in this project found the benefits to outweigh the costs and plan to implement programs that emulate these options.</jats:p>",

This question is of particular importance for the State aid assessment of payments to producers of electricity from renewable energy sources. Such payments typically occur under so-called feed-in tariffs, which are a regulatory mechanism used in most Member States to promote the production of electricity from renewable energy sources. The author argues that there are compelling reasons for considering that Member States can introduce public service obligations with respect to the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, and that compensation payments granted are exempted from the notification obligation under Article 88(3) EC treaty, if the beneficiary undertaking receives not more then 30 million EUR per year as compensation, and if its turnover does not exceed 100 million EUR. Should these thresholds be exceeded, the compensation payments need to be notified to the Commission. The Commission will then assess them under the Community framework for public service compensations, which has been adopted in November 2005.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Forest core area is important for specific plant communities and wildlife species. Identifying spatial interdependencies of site-specific management decisions is an important step for recognizing core area production in forest management scheduling models. A forest-wide map layer of influence zones can be used to identify the interdependencies. Each influence zone is a potential area for producing core area. Each is unique in terms of the specific combination of management units that interact to influence core area production. A raster-based approach is presented for identifying influence zones and estimating their area. Tests considered the need for precision in terms of the size of the raster cells for accurately identifying influence zones and estimating their size. Tests, using a 100 m buffer width for defining core area, show that scheduling results were relatively insensitive to gains in precision from using raster cell widths less than 30 m. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Why does metropolitan reform have such a poor track record in the United States as compared with other industrialized countries? The most common answer is the exceptional localism of US culture, which has embedded itself over the years in institutions that foster political fragmentation and sprawl. This paper, inspired by recent developments in Europe, offers an alternative explanation in the divided sovereignty of the US federal system. Sovereignty, a highly debated concept at the global level, remains a very real political hurdle at the local level because it constitutes the primary field of struggle for any claims for local self-government. The significance of divided sovereignty is the potential recourse that a second sovereign can offer to metropolitan reformers. A reframing of the issue from a constitutional perspective reveals a sharp contrast in the political conditions for metropolitan reform between Europe and the USA today: as sovereignty has moved up in Europe, secured by treaties that have shifted whole realms of authority and right to the European Union, it has been moving down in the USA, pushed by a generation of Republican presidents and an activist Supreme Court. It also highlights a political fault line that has been largely missing from theoretical and policy debates over metropolitan reform in the USA: the conflict between the big cities and their direct sovereign, the subnational states. In this paper I reconsider the troubled history of metropolitan reform in the United States from this constitutional perspective, situating efforts to achieve metropolitan self-governance in the context of the shifting division of sovereignty in the US federal system over the past seventy years. </jats:p>",

As in many similar situations, this organization is relatively complex, and the situation is not entirely clear.

Their many degrees of freedom make them able to determine their configurations to reach the goal point while avoiding obstacles in the workspace. A computer program we named it <jats:italic>RoboKol</jats:italic> is introduced in this paper, which performs path planning for redundant manipulators and mobile robots using potential field based algorithms. It has been developed in C++ for Windows platforms. Through a friendly user interface, the user can interact with the program and can perform a variety of operations such as drawing obstacles and robots on the screen, obtaining two‐ and three‐dimensional images of the potential field and performing robot simulations. Although <jats:italic>RoboKol</jats:italic> has originally been developed for research purposes, it is a convenient tool to teach potential fields, path planning for redundant manipulators and mobile robots in engineering education.

The proposal responds to the high priority given by the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution to regulating PM2.5 in order to reduce the severe health risks associated with this component of particulate matter. One of the proposed changes is the adoption of an exposure reduction target for PM2.5, a new type of standard which, combined with a binding concentration cap, aims at delivering more substantial benefits in terms of population exposure, compared to the traditional approach. The directive also addresses certain difficulties that Member States are experiencing in implementing the existing directives. This concerns in particular the questions of where limit values apply and how to deal with natural sources of particulate matter when establishing compliance with limit values and the introduction of the possibility for extending, under strict conditions, the time frame for meeting limit values. This paper summarises the main elements of the existing directives, experience of its implementation in Member States and proposed changes. At the time of writing the paper, the proposal was under negotiation in Council and Parliament.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Perhaps most well known as the US Environmental Protection Agency's primary authority for responding to contaminated properties, CERCLA created one of the broadest liability schemes in the history of US civil law. Following the federal government's lead, most of the 50 US states enacted their own cleanup laws in the 1980's. The states then took the lead in amending those laws in the 1990's in response to the brownfields redevelopment movement. Both CERCLA and the state laws patterned after CERCLA focus on liability for owners, operators and others associated with contaminated sites, the process for investigating and cleaning up those sites, and the contribution or recovery of cleanup costs from liable parties. This article briefly summarizes the basic function of CERCLA and how the 2002 Brownfields Amendments to CERCLA changed federal cleanup law in the US.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In particular, the article highlights the problems the company’s IS function encountered in implementing its ad-hoc strategies and governance policies. It will be seen that the majority of these problems occurred because of the high levels of autonomy and budgetary independence of the IT-literate, engineering-oriented business ‘communities-of-practice’ that constituted Digital Devices. The case therefore provides rare insights into the reality of IS development and IT infrastructure deployment in organizations through its in-depth description of the positive and negative influences on these processes and their outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing increasing product complexity and pressure to reduce time to market, manufacturing process planning (MPP) engineers must be able to quickly access reliable information in order to make swift and correct decisions. Organizations therefore turn to information management tools, such as PDM (Product Data Management), MPM (Manufacturing Process Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), to support their product development processes. These various information management tools compete by offering similar features, while MPP engineers have to manipulate multiple tools to access the information they need. This paper aims to take a fresh look at a fundamental question: what are the specifications of an ideal information management tool that would help MPP engineers efficiently define manufacturing work instructions (process plan) from the product definition? This paper thus presents the approach and the results of a research work conducted within the process planning department of a manufacturing company operating in the aerospace sector. The study was conducted so as to direct the effort toward documenting the MPP process and the MPP engineer’s information needs. The approach that is presented primarily relies on a comprehensive documentation and modeling of the MPP development process. Two processes have been modeled, a reference process of the MWI (Manufacturing Work Instructions) development and a change management process impacting the MWI development. These process models offer a sound basis to conduct an analysis of the MPP engineers’ information needs. This analysis next leads to the specifications of a Dashboard solution aimed at MPP engineers.</jats:p>",

The paper mill had recently undergone deep structural changes after an investigation of by of the world’s leading management consulting companies. Our project is mainly concerned with support of energy management by means of computer technology. There were essentially three goals. The first one was to minimize energy consumption while keeping it at a constant level. The second goal was the exploration of a scientific hypothesis, namely that expert behavior cannot be adequately explained in terms of “information processing,” but is more adequately seen as “situated action.” The latter emphasizes the actual organizational and social circumstances. The objective of Situated Design — a particular project methodology that we have been developing in our group at the university over the last few years — is to support “situated action” by means of computer technology, rather than to formalize human expertise. Applying and refining this methodology is the third major goal of the project. In this paper we will discuss our experiences with Situated Design at Swiss Paper.</jats:p>"

It can, for example, set an overall environmental objective for which Member States are free to adopt any instrument necessary to reach this target. As a result, Member States can adopt measures which vary in their efficiency (such as costs to businesses), which could reflect national legal constraints, pre-existing practices, etc. In order to assess which instruments to use, Member States should undertake some form of impact assessment, analysing the costs and benefits of different options. However, such analyses are not yet widespread and can be limited in the methods they use, such as in their involvement of stakeholders and use of costs and benefits analyses. In order for efficient and effective national legislative implementation it is, therefore, necessary for Member States to improve these analytical processes at different stages in the policy/legal cycle.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

As the trade partners of the EU are pointing to their obligations under international trade law,4 the judgment tackles also a controversial issue of international trade law. The Court upheld the contested decision of the Commission which had rejected the notified Austrian rules.5 Apart from considerations on the GMO issue the ruling is also important as it sets out clear limits concerning the derogation from EU harmonisation measures generally. Both the Commission and the Court found that the conditions for derogation under Article 95(5) EC Treaty were not fulfilled. Even though the Commission and the Court under the current state of Community law6 did not have any other option than to reject the Upper Austrian draft Law, the reasoning behind this finding was in many respects not very convincing.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we address the emergence of the children's fashion market as part of a broader concern to explore the geographies of children's consumption. We argue that this market is significant in that it offers some theoretical purchase on new forms of commodification, on shifting sourcing and supply relations, and on the varied spatialities of retailing more broadly. We discuss the ways in which children's fashioned bodies act as a site through which they explore and express their self-identity. We focus specifically on the ways in which knowledge, branding, and temporality are shaping this emergent sector, and argue that the speeding up of the industry's ‘clocktimes’ and the spreading out of design impulses are generating particular sets of problems for the industry. We conclude with some reflections on the ways in which children's consumption might be more fully theorised as the combined product of familial relations, social network effects, individualisation, and market structures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Milling is a widely used manufacturing process with the main purpose of generating high precision mechanical components of shapes and sizes given by the numerical control programmed cutting tool trajectory. These mechanical components frequently needs the application of milling operations in order to satisfy the technical specifications that corresponds to their dimensional, geometrical and surface quality requirements. For that reason, the effects of different factors such as cutting tool dynamics, fixturing system design, workpiece material behaviour and applied cutting forces on the desired dimensional precision must be studied, as well as cutting tool and machine tool performance. In this work, the relation between machine tool inaccuracies and geometrical tolerances is analyzed, and a methodology is proposed for improving flatness in planing operations by the correction of imperfections detected in cutting tool displacement according to machine tool axis. These machine tool error correction methodology could be implemented in the current CAD/CAM/CAPP techniques as a means of increasing the milling process performance by identification and correction of CNC milling machine imperfections. The deviations in machine tool displacement during cutting process are identified by metrological analysis, and a modified trajectory for cutting tool is defined by direct numerical control (DNC) from systematic error compensation in machine tool.</jats:p>",

Participants included directors of care, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and resident attendants. The nursing homes ranged in size from 38 to 196 beds and were located throughout the province. In health and planning studies, ethnography conveys a coherent statement of peoples' local knowledge as culture-sharing groups (Muecke, 1994). The study derived information from the Nursing Home Act, reports, the literature, key informants, and direct observations of and interviews with participants. Leadership strengths defined the roles for categories of staff and supported the capacity of each category to identify their learning needs. In conclusion, nurses practising in nursing homes can and must take an active role in decision making for their learning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sequences of characters are used in many fields to record events or processes that characterize social processes. However, until recently, there have been very few methods available for the analysis of character-sequence data. Alignment algorithms measure similarities between pairs of sequences by inserting gaps into one or the other to create the best possible matching pattern. In this paper the reliability of alignments in the classification of sequential data is examined. Alignment methods were developed in computational biology, but are being considered for applications in other fields such as sociology, geography, and transportation planning. The ClustalG multiple alignment package is used to examine a set of synthetic sequences generated through the use of eight separate generation rules. Through the application of the software to sequential data with a known number of subgroups and known patterns in the sequences, some strategies for conducting the analysis can be compared and evaluated. The most effective strategy for analysing sequential data when the underlying processes that generate the event sequences are not known is to use low gap penalties that permit the maximum numbers of matches. </jats:p>",

For this reason citizens living on particularly polluted roads have been taking legal action to enforce the adoption of action plans and immediate measures to reduce road traffic. Most of the early decisions by the German Administrative Courts have dismissed any rights of citizens to enforce the adoption of action plans or independent measures. These decisions have not followed the requirements of Community law regarding access by individuals to the national courts as prescribed by the ECJ because they deprive claimants in Germany of locus standi, and thereby prevent individuals from enforcing the limit values for fine dust particles in Germany. If German citizens are not allowed the right to claim legal protection, infringement proceedings against Germany are necessary. It is evident that sanctions pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 1999/30/EG do not exist in Germany. The analysis shows that there is an evident a conflict between EC law and German administrative law as applied by the German courts.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The IMIA leadership deemed this is an excellent time to create a strategic alignment of IMIA’s goals and in turn to create a framework of the IMIA agenda for the future.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Methods:\n           The process began in early 2004, with a survey distributed to all IMIA members seeking members‘ views. The initial views were presented to the IMIA Board and General Assembly at Medinfo 2004 in San Francisco, USA. A Strategic Planning Task Force was established to take forward the development of a Strategic Plan. Through a combination of e-mail exchanges, face-to-face planning-discussion sessions in Geneva, Switzerland, and Washington DC, USA, and use of mediated conference calls, the IMIA Strategic Plan was evolved.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Results:\n           The framework model (also known as the IMIA rainbow umbrella) seeks to represent, in visual and descriptive terms, the numerous possibilities for connections and integration. Knowledge is the central core of IMIA. All of our strategies, interactions and efforts, emanate from this knowledge core. Using a concentric circle model, the next circle (from the central core) represents science. This is followed by the application layer circle, then the impact layer/circle and finally the outermost circle represents the people layer. Another dimensionality of the IMIA Strategic Plan is the need to represent various key sectors. There are six sectors superimposed on the five concentric circle layers of IMIA’s integration and connection to others. These sectors represent: health (our vision), research and science, behavioral responsibility, education, relationships and reach.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Conclusion:\n           We are still at a relatively early stage of planning.

In all cases, preoperative radiographs of affected limb and contralateral limb, intact extremity's CT views and anatomical atlases were used for preoperative frame planning. The frame is assembled preoperatively, rehearsed and then it is applied. Preoperative radiographs and clinical findings of affected limbs are beneficial for preoperative frame planning, whilst CT views are not as they do not provide any different vision of anatomical structures for all cases. Other colleagues' and our anatomical atlases, including cross-sectional views of limbs, are satisfactory for preoperative planning. In addition, functional and cosmetical results in all three cases were determined to be very good.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A systemwide analysis of the capacity of U.S. ports is needed to ensure that the United States can handle forecast volumes of trade. Long resisted by the port industry, such an analysis should be viewed from a capacity deficit rather than a capacity surplus perspective. Port capacity should be examined from different temporal perspectives—the short-term capability to respond to an interruption in the supply chain and the ultimate capacity to handle the nation's long-range trade forecast. This information is vital in understanding the elasticities in the port system to recover quickly from a natural disaster or terrorist event and to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to support long-term growth projections. Environmental and infrastructure constraints in the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, California, might prevent the nation's largest port complex from developing needed facilities in time to accommodate trade forecasts. This paper addresses the implications of port growth for the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and how decisions made to address cargo growth there can have national repercussions. Only through national port planning can the systemwide implications of locally based decisions be understood. </jats:p>",

The development of the Indices of Deprivation 2000 for England and comparable indices for Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, involved a fundamental reappraisal and reconceptualisation of small-area level multiple deprivation and its measurement. Multiple deprivation is articulated as an accumulation of discrete dimensions or ‘domains’ of deprivation. This paper presents the key principles that were taken into consideration when constructing these four indices and the more recent English Indices of Deprivation 2004, and provides an account of the statistical techniques that were used to operationalise them. </jats:p>",

The intention is to support its conservation within the context of the ongoing establishment of a system of protected areas. Data were manipulated and analysed using a geographical information system, univariate statistical analysis and logistic regression. The best model suggested that in Georgia plots were more likely to contain a cinereous vulture nest if the slope was &gt;30° and faced north, was situated in rugged terrain away from unprotected and populated areas, and was relatively dry. North-facing slopes were where suitable nest trees could be found, whereas ruggedness, protected areas and remoteness from populated areas made access to the nest trees by humans difficult. Low annual rainfall provided better soaring and breeding conditions. The model suggested that the breeding range of cinereous vulture in Georgia could expand if seasonal grazing, which is the primary source of disturbance, is properly managed. Because neither nesting places nor food availability appeared to be limiting, human disturbance and climate seem to best explain the current distribution of nesting cinereous vultures in Georgia, and probably elsewhere in the Caucasus.</jats:p>",

Compliance with environmental and sustainable development requirements can be improved by understand ing and applying the two main theoretical approaches: logic of consequences, and logic of appropriateness. Compliance can be improved more by combining the two approaches. Further work to disaggregate both the State and the firm, and to understand the role of biases, heuristics, and framing in actor's compliance calculations, remains to be done and promises important insights. Environment policy is one of the success stories of the European Union - thanks to European Union legislation we have made significant improvements such as cleaner air and safer drinking water.

In spite of similarities in the scale of operations and the general cultural contexts, the IT adoption processes and outcomes of the two organizations were significantly different. While one failed to implement IT in its crucial processes, the other responded effectively to changes in external conditions by developing and using IT applications for critical functions. The case illustrates how differences in organizational factors such as top management commitment, unions, middle management participation, capabilities of IS professionals and specific aspects of organization culture resulted in such differences. The case is interesting and significant because it is representative of experiences of many government-aided organizations in India, which have undertaken IT modernization as a response to external changes and government mandates. The findings can also be generalized across similar organizations in other developing countries.</jats:p>"

With a spatial crash information system, safety analysis is conducted of counties, cities, roadways, and hot spots. Particular attention is paid to crashes involving fatalities, injuries, speeding, red light running, teenagers, driving under the influence, pedestrians, bicyclists, trucks, and railroad trains. Much of the effort involves distributing information about safety to local governments and to the public at large. In collaboration with local governments and with the Texas Department of Transportation, engineering analysis is conducted of specific safety hot spots to recommend measures to mitigate crashes. Partnerships are created to widen the scope of safety efforts in the region. In addition, major crash hot spots have been identified and are included in the long-range transportation plan. Finally, a Regional Safety Council has been established to allow a policy forum for integrating the various safety efforts of transportation, medical, law enforcement, industry, nonprofit, and other organizations. An annual safety summit is being planned, as are safety training courses for local governments. </jats:p>",

The chosen methodology was the CORAS methodology (CORAS, 2000), which has been developed in a European research project carried out by 11 European companies and research institutes partly funded by the European Union. The risk analysis and assessment were carried out by the Norwegian research institute SINTEF in cooperation with NetCom. NetCom (www.netcom.no) is one of the main mobile phone network providers in Norway. Their ‘MinSide’ application offers their customers access to their personal account information via the Internet, enabling them to view and change the properties of their mobile phone subscription. ‘MinSide’ deals with a lot of sensitive customer information that needs to be secure, while at the same time being easily available to the customer in order for the service to remain usable and competitive. The goal of the analysis was to identify risks in relation to the use of the ‘MinSide’ application and, where possible, suggest treatments for these risks. This was achieved through two model-driven brainstorming sessions based on system documentation in the form of UML sequence diagrams and data flow diagrams.</jats:p>"

This paper is based on a quantitative survey among ZGC companies that captures the cooperation patterns of the firms. The survey was funded by the German Research Association (DFG). In the process of technological upgrading and innovation, companies in Beijing—as well as in other developing countries—make use of knowledge originating in foreign companies or in universities and public research organizations. The findings presented in this paper confirm that ZGC companies are linked to both sources of knowledge to the same extent. Cooperation with foreign companies helps ZGC companies to get new ideas and to enter the market with new products, whereas cooperation with universities is used mainly to design new products. Thus, the patterns of cooperation show that ZGC can absorb new knowledge from different sources. However, not all of the high-tech companies in ZGC are able to make use of international linkages in the innovation process, as about half of them do not have the necessary capabilities.</jats:p>",

The research demonstrates how PGIS can be an effective methodology for promoting community input into land use planning and for augmenting spatial decision-making for “smart growth.” The Cheat Lake PGIS is field-based and provides residents with an opportunity to discuss and map their priority land use issues and to identify land use hotspots in a way that is not typically possible in a general public meeting. This project also provides a useful example of the integration of academic PGIS research with an emerging county planning infrastructure and related set of regulations. This is achieved through multimedia representation of local knowledge with formal spatial information; for example, traditional GIS raster and vector data, community narratives, mental maps, GPS transect walks, geo-referenced photos, and sound. The Cheat Lake PGIS pilot project also offers important lessons for participatory land use planning.</jats:p>"

Scenario planning helps decision makers in devising strategies and thinking about possible future scenarios; while MCDA can support an in‐depth performance evaluation of each strategy, as well as in the design of more robust and better options. One of the frameworks proposed recently, by Goodwin &amp; Wright, suggests the use of scenario planning with multi‐attribute value theory, a mathematically simple, yet extensively researched and widely employed multi‐criteria method. However, so far, such framework has been presented only using hypothetical problems. In this paper, we describe two case studies where this approach was used to support real‐world strategic decisions. We discuss the challenges and limitations we encountered in applying it and suggest some possible improvements that could be made to such framework.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2005, Serbia enacted a new Family Act, which is also applied in Vojvodina Regarding family planning, the Family Act has introduced a reform of the provisions on parentage in cases of medically assisted conception. Regarding motherhood, the basic rule is that the mother is considered to be the woman that gave birth to the child, regardless of whether she is the genetic mother or whether the genetic material of another woman has been used. As for fatherhood, the basic rule is that the father is considered to be the husband or cohabiting partner of the mother, if he has given his written consent to artificial insemination. This rule applies both in cases of AIH (artificial insemination with husband/cohabiting partner sperm) and AID (artificial insemination with donor sperm). This paper deals with the issue of surrogate motherhood in European countries, as well. The regulation of the Family Act on parentage in cases of medically assisted conception presupposes the application of certain techniques of medical conception. These are the donation of the egg cell, embryo, AIH and AID. Furthermore, this regulation stipulates that subjects of medically assisted conception can be, besides spouses, heterosexual cohabiting partners. These issues, however, should be addressed by another law that would fully govern the area of medically assisted conception. Unfortunately, in contrast to the majority of European countries, such a law still does not exist in Serbia.</jats:p>"

We show how ‘new economy’ may be understood as a powerful discourse rationalising a range of policy and planning interventions. We focus in particular on ‘one-north’, a would-be technopole for biomedical, information technology, and media industries in the southwest of Singapore. We show how the planning of one-north has included the selection and reworking of residential areas as ‘little bohemias’ considered conducive for fostering new-economy cultures. Though it has been gaining prominence, specifically following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, one-north is contextualised in terms of broader new-economy interventions by the state in Singapore, which, in turn, have resonances for similar initiatives elsewhere. </jats:p>",

The uniformity of assessment procedures is a target that might be proved difficult to be attained by Member States with different planning procedures, cultures and environmental assessment traditions. The text that follows detects the transposition difficulties and opportunities by evaluating current SEA practice throughout the EU. The purpose is to provide an updated picture and suggest a generic guide for future initiatives aiming at successful implementation outcomes. This is especially relevant and hopefully helpful in view of the forthcoming Commission's first report on the application of the SEA Directive expected before 21 July 2006.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Soil is essential to our economic activities as it provides us with food, drinking water, biomass and raw materials - and all our human activities are somehow related to soil. But soil degradation is accelerating across the EU, with negative effects on human health, ecosystems and climate change - and on our economic prosperity and quality of life. To reverse this trend, the Commission's strategy will set a common EU framework for action to preserve, protect and restore soil, but leaving Member States flexibility to implement it in a way which fits local situations best. The Thematic Strategy on soil protection will comprise a Communication and a legislative proposal which might require Member States to tackle threats such as landslides, contamination, erosion, organic matter decline, compaction, salinisation and sealing wherever they occur, or threaten to occur, on their national territories. The Soils Strategy is number six of seven Thematic Strategies that the Commission is presenting, in accordance with the 6th Environmental Action Programme.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

This paper suggests a framework for the development of strategic decisions based on reader satisfaction measurements. The methodology is illustrated through a real‐world application, i.e. customer‐oriented strategy planning for the leading monthly IT magazine in Greece. This study implements the MUSA (Multicriteria Satisfaction Analysis) method to evaluate reader satisfaction, in order to support the editor in making decisions while planning his editorial strategy. Reader satisfaction was analysed based on a tree containing seven main criteria and 32 sub‐criteria. Readers proved to be very satisfied and non‐demanding, which results in narrower margins for efficient improvement suggestions. However, the evaluation of the MUSA results led to putting forward suggestions that could support the editor in making amendment decisions. Some of these suggestions were successfully implemented within the scope of a new strategy. This revealed the need for two separate editions, an IT magazine for pupils and students as well as an IT magazine focused on women. The decision maker received suggestions on what these new publications' features should be, deriving from the study's quantitative results. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Travel demand modeling today is undergoing a transition from the conventional four-step models to a new generation of advanced activity-based models. The new generation of travel models is characterized by such distinctive features as the use of tours instead of trips as the base unit of travel, the generation of travel in the framework of daily activity agendas of individuals, and the use of fully disaggregate microsimulation techniques instead of the aggregate zonal calculations. Although the theoretical advantages of activity-based models—in particular, behavioral realism and consistency across all travel dimensions—are well known, the practical advantages in the context of planning decisions have rarely been discussed and documented. Experiences to date are summarized for application of activity-based models for various planning purposes in metropolitan regions of New York City; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; San Francisco, California; and Montreal, Canada. The focus is on the practical planning questions and policies that were analyzed with these models and their relative strengths and advanced features compared with the four-step models. The planning questions and policies include congestion pricing schemes, high-occupancy-vehicle facilities, parking policy, testing impacts of demographic scenarios, and so on. It is shown that activity-based models are capable of treating these planning and policy issues at the level at which four-step models become inadequate. </jats:p>",

Australia's rural residents suffer poorer health status and health outcomes than do metropolitan residents; this, along with medical and health workforce shortages, makes this planning and monitoring especially relevant. In rural and remote regions people are geographically dispersed across diverse communities, often making it difficult to access and recruit consumers. This paper provides a framework to address the major issues associated with how best to canvass representative rural consumer views relating to health care services and quality assurance. The review provides a critical appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages of the main methodologies employed in rural health studies. Many of the problems associated with gaining representative rural consumer perspectives in relation to health can be overcome by planning the research process, adopting the appropriate survey tool and engaging potential participants.</jats:p>"

As a reaction public authorities are developing biodiversity reconciliation policies. Finland and Germany have both created reconciliation policies for the conflicts between nature conservation and fisheries including a package of measures like management of population, support of technical measures and various types of compensation payments. All these measures are affected by European policy and law, though no special reconciliation policy has been adopted at European level. This article explores the options European regulation offers and the restrictions it imposes on Member States. Based on experiences with German and Finnish biodiversity reconciliation policies, the interrelationship between European and national regulation is elaborated, leading to suggestions for better coordination of reconciliation policies between different governmental levels.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Safety-conscious planning is a new proactive approach to the prevention of crashes based on establishing inherently safe transportation networks through integrating consideration of safety into the transportation planning process. One of the major concerns in predicting crashes in transportation networks is the applicability and accuracy of crash prediction models. The paper presents two alternative formulations of the calibration problem consistent with the maximum likelihood approach. The proposed formulations can be viewed as a generalized version of the existing calibration procedure proposed in the past for individual crash prediction models. The formulations are useful for road networks and for any transportation mode, provided that the needed prediction models are available. The proposed calibration applied to individual elements of the test network yielded crash estimates that exhibited a considerable bias accumulation at the system level. The calibration task was redefined to focus on the prediction of the cumulative number of crashes in the user-defined subnetworks. The second method gave more acceptable results. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach, which may be helpful in developing a new class of tools for safety-conscious planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> More than 10 years ago, Oregon approved a new and sweeping process for considering transportation planning for local agencies and land use development. This process, coined the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR), was adopted into administrative rules of the state and provided local agencies with a means of considering short-range land use actions, long-range transportation plans, and changes to zoning that have been implemented by local agencies throughout the state. Recently TPR has been challenged over its process for addressing the relationship between the adequacy of transportation facilities and rezoning of land uses. The Jaqua case, taken to the State Court of Appeals, raised key issues as to the level of evaluation and planning process necessary in determining the adequacy of transportation facilities: a property owner challenged a city's transportation analysis in support of a land use rezoning action and claimed that analysis was not adequate because it did not look incrementally over time (similar to concurrency) but at the end planning horizon year (20 years in the future). The state has convened a blue-ribbon panel to assess the issues associated with the implementation of TPR and how transportation policy may need to be refined to address both the long-term planning goals and development implementation interests best. At stake is the level of transportation analysis necessary to address changes in land use from approved plans. The issues associated with updating Oregon's Transportation Planning Rule, including the stakeholder process, blue-ribbon panel, study findings, and implementation of one of the country's most unusual statewide transportation policies, are outlined. The land use and transportation issues are explored from multiple perspectives such as land development, local agency, public needs, and transportation analyst. </jats:p>",

Some are work‐related (“prepare annual report”); others are not (“plan family ski vacation”). Projects have duration (several days to several months) and a structure that includes basic tasks (“book plane tickets”) and subprojects (“decide on hotel”). This article describes exploratory research that looks at the kinds of projects people manage in their daily lives, the problems they encounter and the kinds of support people need to manage better. The personal project is advanced as a tractable unit of analysis for the study of personal information management (PIM). Over time, a personal project often involves several forms of information (paper and digital documents, email, web pages, handwritten notes, etc.) and several supporting applications. People face problems of information fragmentation that are more widely experienced in their practice of PIM. A <jats:italic>Project Planner</jats:italic>prototype explores an exciting possibility that an effective, integrative organization of project‐related information can emerge as a natural by‐product of efforts to plan and structure the project.</jats:p>",

Advocacy skills are now considered to be both a professional competency and an ethical responsibility. Given that many advocacy strategies involve written communication, it makes sense that the skills of writing and advocacy be developed concomitantly and within a writing-intensive class. The purposes of this article are twofold: (a) to describe the role of writing-intensive program planning methods courses in the development of written communication and advocacy skills in entry-level health educators and (b) to suggest strategies for planning, implementing, and assessing writing-intensive assignments and instructional activities designed to develop students’ written communication and advocacy skills. Multiple examples of writing assignments are presented that can be used in helping students in developing their critical thinking, writing, and advocacy skills. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the conditions of a very low birthrate present in Central Serbia and Vojvodina, promotion of the reproduction health of the adolescents, the population group whose reproductive behaviour determines the demographic trends in the future, has a great significance. Today, the young most frequently suffer from the diseases caused by their risky behaviour, so it is possible to use prevention to ensure decrease of their spreading. In the field of sexuality, risky behaviour and insufficiently responsible attitude to health often lead to unplanned pregnancies and abortions, as well as to contracting sexually transmitted infections. The paper presents the results of an in-depth research carried out in 2002 in Belgrade, dedicated to the sexual behaviour of the young and related to the knowledge, opinions and behaviour of the young relevant for family planning. The sample included 111 female adolescents 14 to 20 years of age, from Belgrade, who started their sexual activity at the age of 16 or earlier, and who came to The Counseling Centre for the Young of The Republic Centre for Family Planning of The Institute for Health Protection of Mother and Child of Serbia. The research showed that the girls respondents do not have enough knowledge in the field of sexuality, about contraception and sexually-transmitted infections, as well as that their behaviour in that sphere was not responsible enough. Moreover it also showed that there is a possibility to improve that knowledge, develop social skills and responsibility in behaviour. An important conclusion of the research is also the fact that love, family and children occupy a very high position in the value system of the respondents.</jats:p>"

Data from several urban neighborhoods in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) in the province of British Columbia, Canada, were used to present and test model-use guidelines in two road safety planning applications. In the first case study, an areawide traffic calming collision modification factor was estimated for GVRD urban areas, for “total” and “severe” collisions, to be in the range of –0.40 and –0.39, respectively. In the second case study, four neighborhood network structures were evaluated, and two test networks that appeared safer than conventional grid and cul-de-sac neighborhood street patterns were revealed, mostly because of the increased use of three-way intersections. Moreover, cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one. The results suggested that the models and model-use guidelines could complement and enhance traditional road safety improvement programs and could provide new and improved empirical tools for planners and engineers to do road safety planning. It is hoped that development of guidelines for macrolevel CPM use will facilitate improved decisions by community planners and engineers and, ultimately, neighborhood traffic safety for residents and other road users. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of gated communities of the upper-income and middle-income classes can be directly traced to the failure of governments to close the growing divide between rich and poor and to solve the accompanying wave of crime and fear of violence. It is also a result of an abandonment of faith in governments' capacities to deliver and maintain infrastructure and civic services. State failure has influenced people's decisions to encircle their living space, defend it, and to service their needs autonomously like citizens of the ancient walled cities. The trend toward social exclusion and spatial segregation is characteristic of these modern ministates, which poses planning, policy, and administrative questions for decisionmakers. In this paper I first set out to understand the emergence of gated communities as a global phenomenon, but particularly in the Latin American and Caribbean context. Secondly, I seek to examine the retreat of the upper and middle classes to gated communities in the poststructural adjustment years, using Trinidad as a case study. Finally, I put forward conclusions and policy prescriptions of relevance to cities in addressing the emerging issues. </jats:p>",

The decision has acknowledged the public's right to know and strengthened the principles of transparency and participation. On the grounds of a modern approach to risk policy and to genetically modified organisms (GMO), which the Court held to be enshrined in Article 25(4) of Directive 2001/18/EC, the Court has attributed the right to information priority over conflicting commercial interests. As far as risk data is concerned the Court stressed that European Law requires a maximum degree of transparency as an indispensable condition for the introduction of GM plants within Community territory. Furthermore, the decision recognised that in the field of genetic engineering law the right of companies to invoke operating or business secrets to justify exceptions to the right of access is narrowly circumscribed. Risk data, in general, will only be protected as 'confidential' on an exceptional basis. The party submitting the risk data has to prove that there is an imminent risk of specific and relevant harm to its commercial interests.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The survey is part of a project titled the National Transportation Planning Course Syllabus and Associated Case Studies, funded by the Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship program at the U.S. Department of Transportation. The primary objective of the survey was to determine what topics are currently being covered and their level of emphasis. The secondary objective was to identify topics for which educators would use case studies and references provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Instructors of transportation planning courses from 47 universities were chosen for the survey, and they returned 32 completed survey instruments. On the basis of the survey efforts, it was found that, first, the survey and the project that it serves can be useful in improving transportation planning instruction at U.S. universities; second, the survey and the project were welcomed by most universities and educators surveyed; third, the survey results can potentially be used for multiple purposes; fourth, not having a list of the institutions offering a transportation planning course(s) posed challenges for sample selection for the survey and validation of the survey results; and fifth, it is difficult to design a survey instrument for a discipline such as transportation planning, which is dynamic and ever changing. </jats:p>",

Results of observation of paving at four sites in Arizona and recommendations for preparation and use of ITCPs are also discussed. Accident details are taken from several investigations and from Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluations funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. During the study of four paving sites, a guide for preparing and administering ITCP was prepared. </jats:p>",

In spite of the growing importance of event tourism to many communities in Canada and the US, research examining the influence of current weather and\n climate on event planning, or event tourism more broadly, is very limited. Consequently, the potential implications of climate change for event planning and tourism has yet to be explored. This article presents the findings of the first known assessment of climate change on event tourism in\n North America. A case study of Canada's National Capital Region was used to better understand the current impact of weather and climate on three high-profile outdoor events planned by the National Capital Commission (NCC) (Winterlude, the Canadian Tulip Festival, and Canada Day celebrations),\n and to assess the potential impact of climate change on the NCC's long-term event planning. Climate change is projected to have a meaningful impact on the success of some special events by altering the ability of the NCC to maintain ice-based attractions (skating on the Rideau Canal Skateway),\n changing tulip phenology to cause a mismatch with current Festival dates, and increasing the need for heat emergency planning during Canada Day. Possible adaptation strategies to respond to the challenges of climate change are also discussed, as are some general implications for event management.</jats:p>",

The heuristic procedure may be used to assist in the cooperative operational planning of a physical goods network between shippers and logistics service provider, or to assist shippers in making logistics outsourcing decisions. The objective is to minimise the transportation and inventory holding costs. It is shown through a set of problem instances that this heuristic procedure provides better solutions than existing economic order quantity‐based approaches. Computational results are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

It was predicted that women with high and low body dissatisfaction were less likely to lose weight than women with moderate levels of body dissatisfaction. The study also sought to determine if the number of weight loss attempts, success at past weight loss and self-concept predicted percentage of weight loss in women at six months; and to test whether weight loss led to decreased body dissatisfaction and increased self-concept. Women attempting to lose weight (n = 209) were asked to complete a set of questionnaires at two time points. Results show that women with moderate scores on body dissatisfaction lost more weight than women with higher or lower scores, although this association disappeared when Body Mass Index (BMI) was controlled for in the analyses. Low BMI, success of previous weight loss and low personal self-concept predicted weight loss six months later. Women who lost weight reported lower body dissatisfaction and improved self-concept. It was concluded that, assessing for body dissatisfaction, BMI and weight loss history in the context of primary health settings, may aid in identifying women able to motivate themselves to successfully lose weight in a self-directed manner.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Statewide multimodal transportation planning may be centralized through a single office or decentralized through separate modal agencies (e.g., aviation, transit, highway, port, rail, and toll agencies). To determine the value of each approach, representatives from 41 states were surveyed by questionnaire or telephone about the usefulness of centralized versus decentralized planning. Each approach offers benefits. Centralization provides consistency of modal plans, better modal coordination (including detection of modal conflicts earlier in the process), an ability to examine the entire transportation system holistically, collective attention brought to smaller modes that otherwise might be overlooked, economies of scale for service delivery and employee development, and a greater likelihood that long-range planning will be performed rather than eliminated by more immediate tasks. Decentralization, however, provides greater ease in obtaining modal support for a long-range plan (since the planners and implementers are in the same functional unit), greater ease of tapping mode-specific expertise, and an ability to focus on the most critical mode. External factors that may override the importance of either approach are mode-specific funding requirements, the increasing relevance of metropolitan planning organizations, and the fact that modal location in the same office is not synonymous with coordination. A subset of the free responses to the survey indicated that centralized multimodal planning can be beneficial but only if four constraints are met: modal staff work collaboratively, the centralized unit has funding or other authority, necessary mode-specific planning is not eliminated, and there is a clear linkage between this unit and the agencies that perform mode-specific planning such that the latter can implement the recommendations of the former. </jats:p>",

The course is also intended to allow students to develop the minimal skill set required for manipulation of health care data available from national and international databases, and to use the Internet as a source of information in health care. The curriculum includes: Module 1 – basic computer skills, an introduction to networks as an infrastructure for management, the use of spreadsheets and databases for data processing and system modelling, retrieval of Internet-based health data and on-line bibliographic searches; Module 2 – health system financing and service quality management, using a university hospital as a case study; and Module 3 – a comparison of the Brazilian public health care system (SUS) with other national health systems resulting in a term paper formatted for journal submission and presented at a simulated conference at the end of the course.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Conclusion:\n           Progressive shift in emphasis from theory to practice in this course has resulted in better development of the skill set required for the students.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Results from a statewide survey on current public involvement practices of Florida's metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are described. Of Florida's 26 MPOs, 25 responded to the six-page electronic survey. Overall, the most commonly used techniques were newsletters and public meetings, followed closely by brochures, individual and small-group briefings, and newspaper advertisements in general circulation publications. Although public meetings and hearings were widely used, many MPOs identified them as their least-effective public involvement technique and emphasized the importance of “going to the public, rather than asking people to come to you.” Most respondents indicated that they would rate the public's response to their public involvement process as favorable or better, but nearly as many said that they would rate the public's response to their process as fair. Florida MPOs believed that the greatest challenges they face in the public involvement process include poor attendance at meetings (60%), lack of adequate resources (i.e., staff or funding) (56%), lack of public understanding of the transportation planning process (48%), and difficulty involving people in the early planning process (44%). Despite such challenges, MPOs responding to the survey acknowledged the benefits of an effective public involvement process, including improved relationships with affected citizens and interested parties (76%), improved public understanding of the transportation planning process (72%), improved public trust–credibility of the agency (60%), better projects–more effective transportation solutions (44%), and fewer adverse impacts on the community or the environment (44%). </jats:p>",

Accordingly, Directive 2006/32/EC aims at removing the barriers that prevent the efficient use of energy and creating a market for energy services. In this respect, it promotes energy efficiency mechanisms such as financing and informative instruments, public procurement requirements and voluntary agreements. This article argues that by creating a market for energy services, Directive 2006/32/EC adopts a free market environmentalism' approach, but fails to establish the conditions required to ensure the viability of such market. Nevertheless, the mechanisms it proposes are likely to contribute positively towards sustainable energy markets.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

One of the main topics of this branch of research based on the catchword 'European isation' is the question whether and to what extent these processes have led to the approximation of national legal and administrative structures in the course of time. However, we still lack comprehensive findings as to whether and under what conditions the effects of European integration lead to domestic administrative and legal changes. It this paper, we try to address this research gap. We analyse whether and to what extent the implementation of European policies leads to an approximation of legal and administrative structures in the Member States. This question will be thoroughly elaborated by using the example of the implementation of directives related to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in Germany and England.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

This study examined factors in the lives of older individuals that influenced their ability and willingness to participate in a health-related community-capacity-building project to help their frailer, older neighbours. Using cross-sectional survey methodology, 107 volunteers who lived in a high density seniors' apartment complex known for its high health service utilization were compared with a random sample of 74 non-volunteers from the same community. Factors associated with volunteer involvement included age, activity level, functional ability, life satisfaction and certain personality characteristics. The study suggests that, within a community, the “younger-old” may be able to support their frailer, older neighbours so that they can remain living in the community.</jats:p>"

Many times the need to increase access has led to seemingly insurmountable divisions between stakeholders representing widely divergent interests. The case evaluated here, the I-710 corridor in Los Angeles, addresses a unique situation: the transportation planning process was redirected midcourse in response to the public's negative reaction toward the first set of transportation alternatives. An adaptive public participation process more aligned to the complex political and social realities of the I-710 corridor was introduced to replace a more traditional process that had not achieved the needed consensus. Transportation planners initiated a new series of consensus-building efforts with the objective of generating strategies and alternatives that would be acceptable to the affected communities while meeting the purpose and need for mobility improvements in the corridor. The consensus subsequently reached through the more adaptive process helped to reprioritize and bring out latent problems in the study area. Previously, either these problems had not been identified or their importance had been underestimated. Through the process of clearly identifying the problems and potential solutions, participants were able to come to consensus on an alternative set of strategies. By helping to clarify the public debate, this process strengthened the overall transportation planning effort. </jats:p>",

The EU started legislating on the authorisation and use of GMOs in the early 1990s. Despite the early regulation of this complex field, agricultural applications of biotechnology continue to be very controversial. In order to address public concerns and strengthen its regulatory framework, the EU reviewed its legislation on GMOs between 1997 and 2003. The cornerstone of the regulatory framework is Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOS, whose provisions for placing on the market are the main focus of this article. The implementation of the Directive to date and the difficulties encountered will be briefly analysed.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Through a case-study approach, the discussion is centered on the multiple dualities of the local labor market determined by gender, place, migration, and the rural–urban divide. Although the empirical findings on gender differentiation in Chinese labor markets validate the conclusions of labor-market segmentation theory in general, they also point to the uniqueness of the segmentation processes of the Chinese labor market during the course of its economic transition since the reform. In this study we find that both place and space play an important role in configuring labor market segments, and the spatial construction of local labor markets is shaped greatly by the rural–urban social structure as defined by the household-registration system. </jats:p>",

By evacuating those populations in the network via an optimized sequence, the staged evacuation strategy can best use available roadway capacity, optimally distribute the total demand over the evacuation time horizon, and thus minimize the network congestion level. This study proposes a cell-based network model to capture critical characteristics associated with staged evacuation operations. The proposed model shows the ability to reflect incident impacts and arrival patterns of evacuees in computing the optimal starting time and routes for each evacuation zone. Preliminary numerical results have demonstrated the potential for applying the proposed staged evacuation model in real-world emergency management and planning. </jats:p>",

Freight planning metrics and benchmarks can help state agencies select and assess the impact of improvement projects with respect to freight mobility. Given the unique patterns of freight flow, freight metrics are most valuable when derived from freight-specific data. Extraction of timely freight-specific data to support freight planning efforts is not, however, always straightforward. Washington State, the primary focus of this study, has been developing potential methodologies for extracting and applying freight-specific data in benchmarking freight projects. The Freight Mobility Strategic Investment Board (FMSIB) of Washington State deployed intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies [Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and automated vehicle identification (AVI)] with the stated goal of collecting freight-specific data. An examination of the data collected for the FMSIB benchmarking test reveals that both sources of data—GPS and AVI—can support the freight planning process. This paper highlights results of the FMSIB study, the comparative accuracy of the two data sources, and the uses of each for planning purposes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How effective are public involvement programs in reaching a representative and sufficient sampling of public input for a planning study? While evaluations of public involvement programs are traditionally qualitative, this paper shows how geographic information systems (GIS) can provide an appropriate and productive means of quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of an agency's outreach program. This study used both mailing list and comment data from the Dulles Corridor Rapid Transit Project Environmental Impact Statement of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation to evaluate the agency's outreach program. The data were analyzed to determine the project's effectiveness in informing and receiving feedback from potential stakeholders. The analysis showed that 50% of the mailing list members lived within <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>/2 mi of the proposed project. “Inclusion rates” were calculated, with household participation rates in census block groups near the project ranging from 0 to 82%. The Tysons Corner segment of the project, where the proposed rail line would be closest to residences, on average had the highest inclusion rates, with 16.5% of households within <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>/2 mi of the proposed stations participating. Of the six block groups meeting the project's environmental justice thresholds, half had an inclusion rate below 5%. Analysis of commenters showed that those closest to the project were most likely to comment on the study and to express opposition to the project in their comments. This study reinforces many traditional stereotypes in public participation, but, more important, it demonstrates a method by which deficiencies in outreach efforts can be identified and measures taken to improve participation. By using the GIS-generated maps, agencies can readily identify geographic areas that may be affected by the project, yet have low participation rates, and use this information to develop additional outreach tools to target these populations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper complements the preceding one by Clarke et al, which looked at the long-term impact of retail restructuring on consumer choice at the local level. Whereas the previous paper was based on quantitative evidence from survey research, this paper draws on the qualitative phases of the same three-year study, and in it we aim to understand how the changing forms of retail provision are experienced at the neighbourhood and household level. The empirical material is drawn from focus groups, accompanied shopping trips, diaries, interviews, and kitchen visits with eight households in two contrasting neighbourhoods in the Portsmouth area. The data demonstrate that consumer choice involves judgments of taste, quality, and value as well as more ‘objective’ questions of convenience, price, and accessibility. These judgments are related to households' differential levels of cultural capital and involve ethical and moral considerations as well as more mundane considerations of practical utility. Our evidence suggests that many of the terms that are conventionally advanced as explanations of consumer choice (such as ‘convenience’, ‘value’, and ‘habit’) have very different meanings according to different household circumstances. To understand these meanings requires us to relate consumers' at-store behaviour to the domestic context in which their consumption choices are embedded. Bringing theories of practice to bear on the nature of consumer choice, our research demonstrates that consumer choice between stores can be understood in terms of accessibility and convenience, whereas choice within stores involves notions of value, price, and quality. We also demonstrate that choice between and within stores is strongly mediated by consumers' household contexts, reflecting the extent to which shopping practices are embedded within consumers' domestic routines and complex everyday lives. The paper concludes with a summary of the overall findings of the project, and with a discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century identifies seven planning factors that must be considered in the transportation planning process. One of these factors requires that states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) promote efficient system management and operation and establish a formal role for management and operations (M&amp;O) activities in the transportation planning process. In support of this requirement the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, the designated MPO for southeastern Virginia, has been aggressively involved in addressing transportation M&amp;O under the structure and auspices of regional transportation planning. Recognizing the need for intergovernmental cooperation and technical innovations to meet planning for M&amp;O activities and challenges, the Hampton Roads MPO formed the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Technical Committee in the early 1990s. In many ways the Hampton Roads region has long been on the leading edge of ITS planning efforts. The region pioneered development of an early deployment plan in 1995 and was also an early adopter of an ITS regional architecture. There is a strong partnership and collaboration among the region's ITS stakeholders. This paper focuses on planning efforts used in integrating ITS and M&amp;O activities into the mainstream of the regional transportation planning process in Hampton Roads. The paper describes key elements and the process undertaken by key players to ensure integration for achieving a safe and efficient transportation system in the Hampton Roads region. </jats:p>",

Ten employers who had sent their employees to vocational rehabilitation at a rehabilitation centre in the north of Sweden during 2000 and 2001 participated in the study. Qualitative interviews were performed and analysed by thematic content analysis. The employers' cooperation with clients could be improved by a focus on clients' needs and participation in the rehabilitation process. The employers cooperation with Social Insurance companies could be improved by, 1) early prevention and intervention, 2) knowledge of each other's roles, responsibilities and opportunities and 3) priority making. The employers' cooperation with rehabilitation professionals could be improved by, 1) early identification of rehabilitation needs and goals and early rehabilitation and, 2) increased focus on own responsibilities from each part in the process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last two decades fundamental changes have taken place in the global supply and local structure of provision of British food retailing. Consumer lifestyles have also changed markedly. Despite some important studies of local interactions between new retail developments and consumers, we argue in this paper that there is a critical need to gauge the cumulative effects of these changes on consumer behaviour over longer periods. In this, the first of two papers, we present the main findings of a study of the effects of long-term retail change on consumers at the local level. We provide in this paper an overview of the changing geography of retail provision and patterns of consumption at the local level. We contextualise the Portsmouth study area as a locality that typifies national changes in retail provision and consumer lifestyles; outline the main findings of two large-scale surveys of food shopping behaviour carried out in 1980 and 2002; and reveal the impacts of retail restructuring on consumer behaviour. We focus in particular on choice between stores at the local level and end by problematising our understanding of how consumers experience choice, emphasising the need for qualitative research. This issue is then dealt with in our complementary second paper, which explores choice within stores and how this relates to the broader spatial context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Travel speed is a key measure of effectiveness in evaluating urban arterials. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology of predicting speeds along urban streets requires complex calculations and input not typically available in long-range planning. The use of default values is therefore necessary. This paper demonstrates that a simple and practical method of estimating travel speed along urban arterial streets is possible. An equation derived from the HCM delay formula and calibrated with the results obtained from CORSIM, a microsimulation model, is proposed. The equation requires neither signal characteristics nor detailed traffic and geometry information about arterial intersections. The proposed model of travel speed along urban arterials uses only input available to planners. The model is evaluated with the results obtained from a field study in Lafayette, Indiana. Despite its limited scope of input and simple structure, the model properly replicates the trends found in the field. The model overestimates the actual speeds by 18%, and a simple adjustment factor removes the bias. </jats:p>",

These individuals often begin their service on metropolitan planning organization (MPO) governing boards with little or no background in transportation planning. What would it take to provide these “lay” governing board members with the knowledge they need to be effective decision makers in the transportation planning process? A study of MPO planning participants in Florida sought to answer this question. A combination of focus groups and survey research was used to develop a priority ranking of broad subject areas and a critical short list of key concepts for training MPO governing board members. While MPO structures and practices vary from state to state, MPO staff and other transportation professionals from across the country will find the research results described in this paper valuable when considering the probable training needs of their own MPO participants. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Complementary and alternative medicine is used by many cancer patients in most parts of the world, and its use is increasing.  The aim of the present study was to examine, over 5 years, the perceived quality of life/life satisfaction in two samples of women with breast cancer who were treated with anthroposophic care or conventional medical treatment only.  Data from admission, after 1 year and after 5 years are used for the comparisons.  On admission to the study the women in anthroposophic care perceived their quality of life to be lower than that of the women in the conventional treatment group, especially for emotional, cognitive and social functioning and overall quality of life.  Sixty women who actively chose treatment with anthroposophic medicine and 60 individually matched women treated with conventional medicine participated.  Quality of life was measured by the EORTC QLQ‐C30 and the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire.  Twenty‐six women within anthroposophic care and 31 women within conventional medicine survived the 5 years.  Effect size (ES) estimation favored the anthroposophic group in seven of the subscales mostly measuring emotional functioning.  The ES for four of the subscales favored the conventional treatment group, mostly concerning physical functioning.  After 5 years there were improvements in overall quality of life and in emotional and social functioning compared to admission for the women in anthroposophic care.  The improvements took place between admission and 1 year, but not further on.  Only minor improvements were found in the matching group.</jats:p>",
