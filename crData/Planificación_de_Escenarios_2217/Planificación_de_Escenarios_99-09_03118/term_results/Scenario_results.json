It examines strategic planning by nonprofits and how scenarios fit into the planning process. Scenario planning is shown to be a promising technique for anticipating the impact of technology and other environmental changes on professional practice. The experience of the American Health Information Management Association shows that scenarios are a useful way to communicate and gain member acceptance of the need for personal and professional change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eliciting and integrating requirements from large groups of diverse users remains a major challenge for the software engineering community. Scenarios are becoming recognized as valuable means of identifying actions taken by users when executing a business process and interacting with an information system, and therefore have great potential for addressing requirements elicitation problems. A review of the scenario literature indicates that, although there is widespread agreement on the usefulness of scenarios, there are many unanswered questions about how to elicit scenario definitions from individual users and user groups efficiently.This research examines how increasing the structure of scenario definitions affects scenario quality and the efficiency of scenario definition by individual users. During a laboratory experiment, subjects defined scenarios using a general-purpose GSS, GroupSystems Group Outliner, with one of three textual scenario formats that ranged from unstructured to very structured. Scenario quality and the efficiency of scenario definition by users were compared across the formats. Results highlighted the efficiency of the unstructured format but revealed that all formats produced incomplete scenario definitions. Recommendations are made for an iterative collaborative scenario process and a special-purpose GSS scenario tool that may overcome some of these problems.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, while much is known about how to construct classroom-based instructional materials to support learning, few methods, strategies, and tools exist to support the development of simulation for pedagogical purposes. This panel will describe a methodology that has demonstrated considerable potential for supporting practice and feedback in simulated environments. The panel will also examine limitations of the methodology and challenges for implementation of the methodology. </jats:p>",
