      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning is largely an urban field. While the issues facing megacities around the world have received a great deal of attention from plan ners, the converse of global urbanization— global rural decline—has occurred. The latter is also becoming the focus of significant schol arship. To explore the impacts of globalization on rural areas, we made a comparative assess ment of how rural planning is conceptualized and taught in the three nations with the larg est economies: Germany, Japan, and the U.S. We begin with a discussion of the meaning of rurality and a summary of the issues facing rural Germany, Japan, and the U.S. We then report on education for rural planning in the three countries. We conclude with a brief discussion of the challenges that globalization presents to rural planners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Political ecology is the inquiry into the politi cal causes and consequences of environmental change, with the goal of facilitating sustain able development through the reconstruction of social and political systems. In this intro ductory paper, I consider how political ecol ogy might become a productive area of in quiry for planning theorists. After surveying political ecology's topical and intellectual terrain, I link the field to theory through the consideration of several planning models and roles. I argue that Deweyan pragmatism, by method of social inquiry and communitarian politics, provides an appropriate philosophical basis for integrating political ecology into planning theory. </jats:p>",

The capabiliry-gen eration approach is shown to be both equi table and efficient. The spatial implications of capability-generation are developed, and the argument made that the delivery of equal access to capability-generating resources should be the primary goal of planning in developing nations. Finally, the implications of this normative approach for the practice of development planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

Indeed, can family planning programs affect fertility preferences? Longitudinal data from Bangladesh collected from 1982 to 1993 show that women's desired family sizes have declined dramatically. This study examines how the decline in desired family size is related to visits from family planning workers for three intervals: 1982–85, 1985–90, and 1990–93. By use of logistic‐regression analysis, the number of rounds during which women received visits from family planning workers is found to have no statistically significant effect on the probability that women altered their preference from wanting more children at the beginning of an interval to wanting no more at the end of the interval.</jats:p>",

In reality, contingency persists, and communi ties react in ways that defeat planning. Seeing problems and uncertainty, communities often retreat to a past they remember in idealized ways to find gratification they do not expect from the future. They choose nostalgia or fantasy rather than looking realistically at current conditions. Thus communities resist planning not out of ignorance, but out of knowledge. They know the past, its satisfac tions, and its centrality to their identity, and they want to maintain it against change. Hence planning depends on forgetting: forget ting a static image of the past in order to re member the past as a time of contingency and to see the past linked in time to the present and the future. </jats:p>",

I received a similar response when I showed it to other doctoral students. After more deliberation than it probably needed, I decided to go through the process of getting it in wider circulation. While it is not a scholarly research or education article that belongs the main text, this Comment is intended as an accessible starting point for thinking and talking about issues of writing, scholarly communication, and tenure practicalities. At least some doctoral students and new faculty seem to have a great need for such an article. It is in that spirit that I offer it.1 </jats:p>",

The soap opera was subsequently broadcast nationwide from 1995 to 1997. Data about the effects of the radio soap opera were gathered in five annual surveys of about 2,750 households in the comparison and the treatment areas and from a sample of new family planning adopters in 79 health clinics. The soap opera had strong behavioral effects on family planning adoption; it increased listeners' self‐efficacy regarding family planning adoption and influenced listeners to talk with their spouses and peers about contraception.</jats:p>",

Simple indicators of son preference in North Korea are constructed from its 1993 population census and a 1998 survey of child nutrition (conducted in the wake of the recent famine). These indicators include sex ratio at birth, sex ratios of infant and child mortality, and sex ratios of child malnutrition. North Koreans do not evince prenatal discrimination against daughters, a finding that may indicate a lack of prenatal sex‐testing technologies. Neither is evidence found of excess female mortality or malnutrition in the postnatal period, during which discrimination requires no special technology. The discrepancy in son preference across the Korean peninsula seems due largely to the socialist agenda pursued in the north following political partition after World War II. An important aspect of that agenda challenged the ancient Confucian ideology presumed to underlie son preference. Apparently, this challenge was more successful in North Korea than in other Asian societies instituting similar political changes, because son preference was not eliminated in China or in Vietnam.</jats:p>",

This decline can be seen in the context of major reforms enacted in 1975 whereby the school sex‐education curriculum was revised, contraceptive services were improved, and abortion was provided free and on demand. By means of microsimulation, the possible roles of contraception and induced abortion in causing teenage fertility to fall are examined. Before 1975, the decline appears to have been caused primarily by an increase in the number of induced abortions. After that date, however, an increase in the use of highly efficient methods of contraception led to a decline in the pregnancy rate in such a way that, even though the proportion of teenagers who sought abortion increased, the abortion rate declined. Parallels are drawn with the experience of other European countries, and contrasts with that of the United States, where no such developments have occurred, are noted.</jats:p>",

Al though both the economic costs and the ben efits of greenbelts have been studied, there have been no attempts to integrate the two. In this paper, I attempt to illummate the argu ment by measuring the aggregate net metro politan economic gain or loss (in both house hold utility and land value) of a marginal release of greenbelt land for development in Seoul, a city that has strong open-space pro tections and severe urbanization pressures. I present the calculation for four points in time to discover how the net benefit changes over the long run. The trend shows that Seoul's greenbelt achieved economic efficiency as the city grew, but lost economic efficiency once the congestion effect kicked in. I conclude that a fixed boundary for a greenbelt cannot be a net benefit forever, and thus the original greenbelt designation should be reexamined penodically. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This prospective study uses qualitative methods to examine the social and economic impact of family planningon women's lives in the district of Bamako, Mali. Fifty‐five first‐time users of contraceptives were interviewed in October 1996. Of particular interest is the high proportion (17/55) of those who had hidden their use of a birth‐control method from their husbands. Substantial collusion is found to have occurred between sisters‐in‐law in assisting each other to gain and hide methods of family planning and to keep their use secret from their spouses and older marital relatives. The main reason for discontinuation among the clandestine users was menstrual disruption, which they feared would make their husbands aware of their contraceptive use. By the end of the study, women were aware that their use of contraceptives had increased their mobility and available time, enabling them to enhance the quantity and efficiency of their work activities. Contraception, therefore, appears to be a valuable resource, permitting women to improve their economic and social status. In settings where clandestine use is prevalent, at least in the short term involving men in family planning programs may not always be beneficial, nor may considering the couple as the unit of intervention and analysis always be appropriate. In the long term, however, the underlying causes of men's objections to contraceptive use need to be addressed so as to facilitate communication and joint decisionmaking about family planning</jats:p>",

In Burkina Faso, type 1 (clitoridectomy) was the most prevalent (56 percent), whereas in Mali the more severe type 2 cut (excision) was the most prevalent (74 percent); 5 percent of both samples had undergone type 3 cutting (infibulation).

In our TSP+, both the “salesperson” (a robot with a tool) as well as the “cities” (another robot with a workpiece) move. Namely, in addition to the sequencing of tasks, further planning is required to choose where the “salesperson” should rendezvous with each “city”. The use of a genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen as the search engine for the solution of the multi-robot TSP+ optimization. As an example industrial application the optimization of the electronic-component placement process is addressed. In the most generalized component-placement system configuration, the placement robots meet the component delivery systems (CDSs) at optimal rendezvous locations for the pick-up of components and subsequently meet the printed circuit board (on the mobile XY-table) at optimal rendezvous locations for their placement. In addition to the solution of the component-placement sequencing problem and the rendezvous-point planning problem, the collision-avoidance issue is also addressed.</jats:p>",

Most proposed methodologies are based on graph theory and involve complex geometric and physical analyses. As a result, even for a simple structure, it is difficult to take all the criteria into account and to implement real world solutions. This paper uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to synthesize different criteria fo generating a stable assembl plan. Three matrices (Connection Matrix, Supporting Matrix, and Interference-Free Matrix) are generated from an input B-rep file to represent the CAD information of a given product. The stability of a given assembly plan and reorientation numbers are incorporated into the fitness function of the genetic assembly planner. The proposed planning algorithm has been successfull implemented. This paper also presents implemented planne performance as measured for two industry-standard structures.</jats:p>",

Although the larger project encompasses automation and integration of all aspects of machining feature recognition, tolerance charting, high level (macro) planning, and detailed (micro) planning, this paper focuses only on set-up and fixture planning. Only standard modular fixtures are considered (tooling plates, rest pads, pin locators, strap clamps, and vises). In set-up planning we consider not only similar tool approach directions and processes for feature grouping, but also spatial constraints in machines, tools and fixtures. The approach presented here for fixture planning combines elements of both geometric reasoning and feature-based approaches. Set-ups are automatically planned based on the volumes to be removed in each workpiece orientation and the instantaneous state of the stock is tracked at the different stages of the proposed plan. Also verification techniques use feature information to estimate possible collisions between fixtures and volumes to be removed. The fixture planning algorithm is based on both the 3-2-1 locating principle and Vise clamping methods. The overall system architecture is modular, allowing the possibility of selective use of the modules by other developers of CAPP systems. The process planning system exploits the capabilities of commercial toolkits for geometric modeling (ACIS) and NC toolpath generation (STRATA).</jats:p>",

It is an effort to take dimensional tolerances into computer-aided process planning (CAPP) for cylindrical parts through the usage of databases and knowledge bases. Geometric features with tolerancing specifications in a CAD system are first used to determine possible machining operations that can achieve the specified tolerances based on data from the machining feature database, the process precision grade database, and the precision grade database. Process plans are then generated based on rules and knowledge from process sequence knowledge base and the machining feature database. Possible process plans are further organized as a graph. Optimal process plan with least cost is then selected by searching through the graph. This is achieved based on machine set-up and operation costs that are derived from the machine tool resource database, the process parameter database, and the machine set-up and operation cost database. A CAPP software prototype supporting tolerance design on the AutoCAD platform is also demonstrated with examples to illustrate this approach.</jats:p>",

In 1996, the company embarked on a three‐phase programme directed at building relations with customers. As a prelude to the implementation, Flensted Catering A/S conducted focus groups and issued questionnaires to determine customer perceptions of how the company could meliorate its performance. Subsequently, the Danish firm established project teams, instituted customer‐focused staff training and sought to improve communications with customers. Following the implementation, the monitoring revealed that Flensted Catering A/S was rated as a better supplier by 43 per cent of its customers and that customer retention had risen to 94 per cent</jats:p>",

In many cases they may actually degrade performance. One way to increase the probability that a tool will meet users needs is to include frequent periodic usability assessments in the development process so feedback from users can be incorporated in new iterations of the software design. This paper describes an example of one such assessment applied to a Mediator, a feature extraction and process planning tool for assisting process planners to explore plan options more quickly and thoroughly. There exists a wide variety of usability assessment techniques which can mostly be divided into two broad categories: summative evaluations which provide in-depth assessments in the final stages of software development, and formative evaluations which tend to be smaller in scale and are used to provide guidance for “forming” subsequent software versions during the development cycle. In this work, we describe a formative usability assessment. The study indicated that Mediator was meeting its design goal of broadening the users exploration of manufacturing options, in some cases producing high quality manufacturing options which the expert users had not considered on their own. The study also provided formative redesign information gleaned which will help future versions of Mediator to better meet the actual needs of process planners.</jats:p>",

The project addresses the need for improved communication between design and process planning in the early product design stage. Since major manufacturing costs are committed during product specification and design, it is critical to successfully assess manufacturability and cost as early as possible in the design process. Documenting the DPPI foundation, this paper reviews industry needs for an integrated design and manufacturing environment for rapid product development. Additionally, this paper describes the project’s approach and the current status. Conceptual design and process planning prototype systems, that have been implemented, are also described. Finally, it describes the future direction for developing mechanisms to enable the integration of design and process planning, including information models and language interface specifications.</jats:p>",

Particularly, with our current development mode, programs from other researchers cannot be reused, each researcher has to redevelop a set of new feature-application code almost built-from-scratch to create features and/or produce process planning.... As a result, though we have developed countless features-application programs, the problem about integrating CAD and CAM application is still largely unsolved. From the viewpoint of the technology of components (that is a new, powerful software development technology), we seem to be wasting large amount of time to do a repetitive and ineffective work that is orders of magnitude greater than we should do.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>By solving several key obstacles that obstruct us from developing the small, reusable components in advanced CAD/CAM fields, the paper creatively introduces into advanced CAD/ CAM fields the brand new, powerful component technology that has never been explored in the fields. And the paper gives a concrete example (MFIC) in the machinable feature application fields to demonstrate how to apply the technology in a specific field. The framework in the paper is the first component framework for advanced CAD/CAM applications. Because the technology of components provides developers with more reusability, extensibility, reliability and compatibility, so it has been universally accepted as the future software development technology by the entire software world. We believe the component technology is the future software development technology in advanced CAD/CAM fields too, and the component framework will change the development mode of advanced CAD/CAM applications, just like the interchangeability completely changes the manufacturing mode in mechanical industry.</jats:p>",

The locations of points inspected for a NURBS surface are optimized to minimize the maximum deviation between the surface fitted to the data points and the designed surface. During optimization, the inspection process is simulated, a parametric NURBS surface is fitted to the data points and the maximum deviation between the fitted and designed surfaces is minimized. Algorithms for the application of the sampling methodologies were implemented using MATLAB software. Each sampling methodology is explained, and illustrated by an example. The performance of the different sampling methodologies are compared in terms of the maximum deviation obtained and the CPU time needed to accomplish the sampling task.</jats:p>",

For each operation, tool and parameter selections are based on minimizing machining time with the constraints of the specified roughness, tolerance, and machine tool safety. Geometry decompositions are based on the selected tools and the surface slope for the purpose of improving the cutting efficiency.

To accomplish this, user-defined input in the form of goal preferences and feature tolerances are used to control how the prototype will be built by way of process planning. The user inputs will be used to drive the creation of the process plan so that a prototype is produced, which reflects the intent of the operator. The process planning method is adapted from multi-objective optimization and utilizes empirical data, analytical models, and heuristics to quantitatively relate build process variables to goals of surface finish, accuracy, and build time. The objective is to render decision support by handling tradeoffs among conflicting goals quantitatively and give the user some degree of insight into what quality of prototype may ultimately be produced.

The selection of projects for funding is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and a number of competing objectives such as ecological protection, recreation and community relations. The purposes of this paper are to summarize the quantitative methods currently used in deciding which conservation projects to fund and to present a general methodology based on decision analysis that can be used for making conservation programme planning decisions. The methodology directly links the proposed contributions of projects to the objectives of the conservation agency, and it includes an explicit consideration of uncertainty and a conversion of ordinal scores into utilities. The methodology is a rational way of making decisions in conservation situations that are characterized by high degrees of uncertainty and subjective information. An application of decision analysis with staff from the New Zealand Department of Conservation is described. Some of the difficulties with using this methodology in practice are discussed in both the New Zealand and broader contexts. The conclusions are that conservation programme planning is currently based on managerial experience and relatively simple scoring procedures, but that a more rational approach based on decision analysis is possible, and additional research would reduce the amount of effort required to use decision analysis for conservation programme planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Improving strategic planning within the realm of information technology management is consistently identified by top corporate executives as a critical competitive issue. While relevant literature in the area is replete with descriptions of planning tools and methodologies, investigations that examine this activity from the perspective of process-based characteristics, or “profiles,” are still in the formative stages. Through multivariate analysis of data gathered from 253 organizations, the findings of this study suggest that five distinct profiles of strategic planning can be identified based on dimensions of comprehensiveness (extent of solution search), formalization (existence of rules and procedures), focus (extent of innovation versus integration), flow (top-down, bottom-up), participation (number and variety of planners), and consistency (frequency of planning). While each profile exhibits strength across particular measures of planning effectiveness, the profile associated with all measures of planning effectiveness seems to incorporate elements of rationality (high comprehensiveness, high formalization, control focus, top-down flow) and adaptation (high participation, high consistency). Postsurvey field study of selected firms suggests that the five approaches may represent distinct “schools” of thought that are reflective of deep-seated beliefs and attitudes about strategic planning. These schools (design, planning, positioning, learning, and political) are founded on very different assumptions and provide substantive interpretation for the empirical findings. </jats:p>",

If the contribution which the regional planning system wishes to make to this process is to ensure that greater weight is attached in future to the goals of ecological, social and economic sustainability, it will have to come up with strategies which meet the needs of these areas. In order to achieve this, it requires devices which it can draw on to structure the attributes of this hinterland and thus to render them communicable.

It is shown that the optimal static harvest level under certainty can be used as an upper bound for the entire dynamic harvest time path under uncertainty. The paper also develops an explicit upper bound for the entire harvest path under uncertain extinction time of the endangered species. It is demonstrated that an increase in the hazard rate of the endangered species will shift down the upper bound for the entire harvest path, whereas an increase in the growth rate of the commercial species will shift up the upper bound for the entire harvest path.</jats:p>",

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the double-deflation method to provide the correct answers are derived. The conditions are found to be stringent and unlikely to be met in empirical cases. The results for aggregation in the case of double deflation are shown to be dual to the traditional results for aggregation in the case of a quantity model, which have been extensively discussed in the literature. </jats:p>",

The analysis shows how cultural descriptions are both a resource and a constraint when they must orient a practical activity which must be publicly acknowledged for its cultural typicality. Discrepancies are highlighted between cultural descriptions and ordinary practices, but it is also shown how culture (or ‘cultural preferences’) gets produced, at a less explicit level, within discursive practices, through turn-taking filtering, sequential architecture and selection of differentiated addressees. The socializing import of the discursive situation for the younger participants is also discussed, with reference to the relevant conversational devices. </jats:p>",

There has been a strongly predominant and blaming set of explanations based on crime and grime, poor service delivery, and lack of control of informal trading during the 1990s. These explanations and especially the conception of the future have relied on American models of inner-city development. It is argued that policymakers have been blinded to local economic potentials that do not exist in American cities. The point is critical owing to the restructuring of the central city's economy. The central city is no longer the metropolitan CBD; it is losing most of its business and financial services and many manufacturing enterprises. It is, however, developing trading networks throughout sub-Saharan Africa and backward-linked small manufacturing opportunities. A new and different economy appears to be emerging. </jats:p>",

Conserving greenspace, then, requires traditional land-use planning and regulation, which provides local governments powerful tools and processes. Greenspace conservation can be hampered by a lack of intermunicipal cooperation, disregard for natural systems within the planning process, and concerns for the taking of private property rights. Because of a broadscale approach, an ecosystem-based approach to community forestry can support traditional land-use planning in conservation efforts across the many landscapes and through the people involved in community development. Use of an ecosystem approach has problems, however, including the building of cooperation and partnership between multiple jurisdictions and agencies. Furthermore, a lack of awareness and involvement by community foresters and arborists may impede the success of either traditional or ecosystem planning approaches in conserving greenspace.</jats:p>",

The resulting allocations also limit the chances of inconsistency when data are plotted on a probability plot. For SSALT, we consider test plans that not only optimize both stress levels and holding times, but also achieve a target acceleration factor that meets the test time constraint with the desirable fraction of failure. The results for both problems suggest that the statistically optimal way to increase acceleration factor in an ALT is to increase lower stress levels and; in the case of CSALT, to decrease their initial sample allocations; in the case of SSALT, to reduce their initial hold times. Both problems are formulated as constrained nonlinear programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The turbulence which characterized the 1980s created uncertainty as to the role and purpose of planning in liberal democracies. Instrumental rationality is no longer defensible as a guiding doctrine and major questions arise concerning the relationship of planning to the market economy and the political process. The realization that the problems confronting planners are not amenable to technocratic solutions has led to recognition of the political and therefore essentially ethical nature of the planning activity. However, whilst there is widespread recognition that fundamental ethical dilemmas underpin both planning practice and theory, little explicit consideration has been given to the nature of the normative frameworks available. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the ethical frames of reference implied in the most influential theories within planning and to evaluate their relevance to practice. The paper highlights the extent to which debate has been, and continues to be, dominated by procedural questions, the rejection of universalism in favour of relativity and subjectivity, and a focus on individual interests rather than more general concern with the common good. Reluctance to engage with debates of a more foundational nature concerning ends and values is questioned and planning theorists are urged to reconnect with the fundamental issue of planning’s contribution to the creation of desirable futures.</jats:p><jats:p>—</jats:p><jats:p>Les troubles et difficultés des années quatre‐vingt ont créé une incertitude quant au rôle et aux objectifs de la planification dans les démocracies libérales. La rationalité instrumentale comme doctrine dirigeante n’est plus défendable et des questions importantes se posent quant à la relation de la planification avec l’économie de marché et le processus politique. Les responsables de la planification ont puis conscience du fait que les problèmes qu’ils recontraient ne pouvaient pas être résolvé de manière technocratique – cela les a conduit à prendre en compte la dimension politique et donc fondamentalement éthique de la planification. Néanmoins, malgré la reconnaissance générale des dilemmes éthiques qui sont derrière la pratique et la théorie de la planification, la nature des structures normatives disponibles a rarement été puis en compte. Le but de cet article est de faire une revue critique des systèmes de référence implicites dans les théories de la planification les plus influentes et d’évaluer leur applicabilité pratique. L’article souligne à quel point le débat a été et reste dominé par des questions de procédure, par le rejet de l’universalisme en faveur de la relativité et de la subjectivité, et par une attention particulière donné aux intérêts individuels plutôt que par une préoccupation plus générale pour le bien commun. Le refus de considérer des problèmes plus fondamentaux concernant les fins et les valeurs est mis en cause. Les théoriciens de la planification doivent revenir à la question fondamentale de la contribution de la planification à la création d’un avenir meilleur.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study is to use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the sensitivity of implant planning methods to seed misplacement. A model of seed misplacement is first developed. It is based upon data gathered after a study on source migration performed on 30 patients treated with I‐125 transperineal implants. It consists of applying elementary transformations to every needle in a loading plan to produce a distorted implant mimicking the effect of migration. After being validated, the model has been used to tune the inverse planning system in use at our institution. The new planning system is now used clinically and actual results are compared with those predicted by simulations. Simulations were also used to compare our planning method with others. The new planning system increased the average postimplant dose–volume histogram DVH(160) from 82% to 93%, which is the value predicted by the simulations. This improvement is due to an increased dose margin providing coverage even in the presence of migration. At the same time, the dose to the urethra remained at 267 Gy because of a special protection feature included in the planning system. Some other implant planning methods are not as robust [average DVH(160) ranging from 76% to 85%] and deliver a higher dose to the urethra (close to 400 Gy). To conclude, a simple model of source migration can provide realistic feedback about sensitivity to migration of planning methods. It allowed a significant clinical improvement at our institution. The improved inverse planning system provided better coverage with fewer seeds (but equal total activity) than a manual method. Hence, a properly tuned inverse planning system has the potential to deliver the less sensitive plans. The model also helped demonstrate that planning methods are not equally robust to migration and that they should not be evaluated solely by the plans they produce, but also by their clinical (or simulated) results.</jats:p>",

First, by directly manipulating the level of ambiguity within a single tax scenario, this study confirms the result that tax professionals interpret ambiguity to the benefit of clients in compliance decision contexts. Second, this study provides initial evidence that decision context affects the way professionals interpret ambiguity. Specifically, the results suggest that tax professionals interpret ambiguity aggressively in compliance contexts, but relatively conservatively in planning decision contexts. Finally, this study provides evidence that tax professionals exploit precise tax rules to achieve client-preferred outcomes in planning decision contexts. These findings provide insights useful for understanding tax professionals' judgments and have potential tax policy implications.</jats:p>",

Needles are inserted through a template whose plane is oriented at a nominal angle of 26° away from the horizontal to facilitate needle penetration through the ischiorectal space. The CT gantry is tilted 26°, so that its plane is orthogonal to that of the template. The oblique geometry between the CT gantry and direction of couch translation must be considered during source position planning, implantation, and post‐treatment evaluation. This consideration is presented along with discussion of relevant quality assurance procedures and recommended tolerances. The mechanical and radiological tolerances of the CT scanner must be consistent with the high level of precision required in radiation therapy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I focus upon the increasing tendency of the Oxford colleges to treat their landed property as a commodity. I begin by arguing that the theory of action in context offers considerable potential for studying the nature of their landownership and the manner in which they have formulated and pursued their property interests. Following this, I examine the extent to which the colleges have shifted their capital out of landed property and into higher yielding sectors. This can be partly explained by the changing economic environment within which the colleges operated, especially the downturn in real returns from agriculture. However, their more business-like behaviour is also a product of the structural circumstances under which their ownership strategies have been formulated and pursued. This is examined by fusing the action-in-context approach with theoretical principles developed by the regulationist school. I show that opportunities to shift capital from low-yielding to high-yielding sectors arose as a result of the gradual loosening of restrictions which prevented the colleges from participating fully in capitalist economic relations. These changes were the outcome of a series of political—ideological struggles between the colleges and the central state over what kinds of institutions the colleges should become, their property rights and interests playing a key role in these disputes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The literature on the transition to postmodernism, postfordism and participatory planning stresses the value of the economic and planning process shifts that have occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This paper compares two periods of planning and urban development in Toronto: one running from 1959 to 1962, at the height of modernism, fordism and expert‐driven planning, and the other, from 1989 to 1992, set within the postmodern, postfordist and participatory planning era. In line with expectations arising from the literature, the study reveals stark distinctions between the two periods. It documents the breaking up of the modern consensus around the progress ideology into a postmodern constellation of values. As a result, the range of issues debated on the planning scene was much broader over the second period than over the first. Overall, however, results point to a mixture of continuity and change between the two periods and thus diverge from this literature’s strong emphasis on transition. Contrary to expectations, citizen mobilization was pervasive in both periods, although there were major differences in the nature of activism and in the issues that were raised. Over the first period most activism originated from ratepayer organizations dedicated to the protection of single‐family‐home neighbourhoods from encroachments, whereas the second period featured, along with such associations, advocacy groups championing environmental and social causes. The two periods are also distinguished by different planning implementation capacities. Whereas in the first period, planning had the means to implement its visions, this was no longer the case in the second period. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, planning was thus incapable of aligning urban development with its environmental and social ideals, which meant that, by default, planning practice over the second period proceeded pretty much according to land‐use and transportation principles evolved in the early postwar decades. In sum, distinctions between the two periods were far more evident in the discourse than in the implementation sphere.</jats:p><jats:p>—</jats:p><jats:p>Les recherches sur la transition vers le postmodernisme, le postfordisme et la planification participative soulignent la valeur des changements qui ont pris place à la fin des années soixante et au début des années soixante‐dix. Cet article compare deux périodes de planification et de dévelopment urbain à Toronto: une qui va de 1959 à 1962, durant l’apogée du modernisme, du fordisme et de la planification contrôlée par les experts, et l’autre, de 1989 à 1992, à l’époque du postmodernisme, du postfordisme et de la planification participative. En accord avec les prévisions émanant des recherches, cette étude révèle des distinctions nettes entre les deux périodes. Elle documente le morcellement du consensus moderne autour l’idéologie du progrès et le changement en faveur d’une constellation de valeurs postmodernes. Il s’ensuit que le champ de problèmes discutés en relation avec la planification était beaucoup plus étendu durant la seconde période que durant la première. Dans l’ensemble, cependant, les résultats indiquent un mélange de continuité et de changement entre les deux périodes et divergent donc de la forte emphase sur la transition que l’on trouve dans les recherches. Contairement aux prévisions, la mobilisation des citoyens était omniprésente à Toronto pendant les deux périodes, mais il y avait des différences importantes quant à la nature de l’activisme et dans les problèmes soulevés. Durant la première période, la plus grande part de l’activisme provenait des organisations de contribuables vouées à la protection des quartiers d’habitations contre les empiètements, alors que la seconde période comprenait, en plus de ces organisations, des groupes de soutien aux causes de l’environnement et aux causes sociales. Les deux périodes sont également distinctes en termes de mise en oeuvre. Alors que dans la première période les urbanistes avaient les moyens de mettre leurs idées à exécution, ce n’était plus le cas dans la seconde. Vers la fin des années quatre‐vingt et le début des années quatre‐vingt‐dix, la planification ne pouvait pas intégrer les développements urbains et ses idéaux sociaux et environnementaux. Par défaut, la pratique de la planification durant la seconde période a fonctionnée selon les principes d’utilisation des terrains et du transport développés dans les premières décennies de l’après‐guerre. En somme, les différences entre les deux périodes sont beaucoup plus visibles au niveau du discours qu’au niveau de l’application.</jats:p>",

It focuses on the transformation of the emergency planning response from dealing with the immediate crisis during the first week, to a stage of controlled recovery that still continues. The response to the devastation caused by the bomb was co‐ordinated by the city council, which developed a range of short‐ and long‐term initiatives, but the re‐opening of the city centre could not have happened so quickly had the council not worked in collaboration with other key organisations and agencies. Working partnerships were crucial to the immediate response and subsequent recovery, with such capacity for organisational learning built upon existing co‐operative arrangements within the city, which had developed over the previous decade.</jats:p>",

An example is provided in which the method is applied to a forest management area to illustrate its function. The forest management area covered 18 000 ha. Based on forest conditions at the time it was decided to establish reserve networks, maintain the area of old forest, and increase the area of broad-leaved forest, and also use these criteria as indicators of biodiversity. The method should meet some of the demands involved in the complex problem of integrating timber production and biodiversity objectives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Literature review</jats:bold>There is a paucity of information on the concise relationship between endodontics and orthodontics during treatment planning decisions. This relationship ranges from effects on the pulp from orthodontic treatment and the potential for resorption during tooth movement, to the clinical management of teeth requiring integrated endodontic and orthodontic treatment. This paper reviews the literature based on the definition of endodontics and the scope of endodontic practice as they relate to common orthodontic‐endodontic treatment planning challenges. Literature data bases were accessed with a focus on orthodontic tooth movement and its impact on the viability of the dental pulp; its impact on root resorption in teeth with vital pulps and teeth with previous root canal treatment; the ability to move orthodontically teeth that were endodontically treated versus nonendodontically treated; the role of previous tooth trauma; the ability to move teeth orthodontically that have been subjected to endodontic surgery; the role of orthodontic treatment in the provision for and prognosis of endodontic treatment; and, the integrated role of orthodontics and endodontics in treatment planning tooth retention.</jats:p><jats:p>Orthodontic tooth movement can cause degenerative and/or inflammatory responses in the dental pulp of teeth with completed apical formation. The impact of the tooth movement on the pulp is focused primarily on the neurovascular system, in which the release of specific neurotransmitters (neuropeptides) can influence both blood flow and cellular metabolism. The responses induced in these pulps may impact on the initiation and perpetuation of apical root remodelling or resorption during tooth movement. The incidence and severity of these changes may be influenced by previous or ongoing insults to the dental pulp, such as trauma or caries. Pulps in teeth with incomplete apical foramen, whilst not immune to adverse sequelae during tooth movement, have a reduced risk for these responses. Teeth with previous root canal treatment exhibit less propensity for apical root resorption during orthodontic tooth movement. Minimal resorptive/remodelling changes occur apically in teeth that are being moved orthodontically and that are well cleaned, shaped, and three‐dimensionally obturated. This outcome would depend on the absence of coronal leakage or other avenues for bacterial ingress.A traumatized tooth can be moved orthodontically with minimal risk of resorption, provided the pulp has not been severely compromised (infected or necrotic). If there is evidence of pulpal demise, appropriate endodontic management is necessary prior to orthodontic treatment. If a previously traumatized tooth exhibits resorption, there is a greater chance that orthodontic tooth movement will enhance the resorptive process. If a tooth has been severely traumatized (intrusive luxation/avulsion) there may be a greater incidence of resorption with tooth movement. This can occur with or without previous endodontic treatment. Very little is known about the ability to move successfully teeth that have undergone periradicular surgical procedures. Likewise, little is known about the potential risks or sequelae involved in moving teeth that have had previous surgical intervention. Especially absent is the long‐term prognosis of this type of treatment.</jats:p><jats:p>During orthodontic tooth movement, the provision of endodontic treatment may be influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to radiographic interpretation, accuracy of pulp testing, patientsigns and symptoms, tooth isolation, access to the root canal, working length determination, and apical position of the canal obturation. Adjunctive orthodontic root extrusion and root separation are essential clinical procedures that will enhance the integrated treatment planning process of tooth retention in endodontic‐orthodontic related cases.</jats:p>",

Since then, several extensions of the IDV have been suggested in the literature, including adjustments for labor-productivity differentials across sectors to generate an interindustry employment demand variable (IEDV). In this paper we revisit the IEDV variable, and offer extensions that transform it from a static to a dynamic form. We implement the range of these specifications for the San Diego labor market, and evaluate their estimation properties and forecasting performance in the context of simulation and projection analyses. The results suggest that problems of multicollinearity plague the conventional specification, and have obscured the assessment of the value of adjustments for industry productivities and the nature of productivity specification. Based on an alternative specification, we find that dynamic labor-productivity adjustments lead to lower simulation errors. These adjustments also result in significantly lower impact multipliers relative to those from the IDV model. </jats:p>",

A case study application of the tool, using the road network for the city of Geelong in Victoria, Australia, is described. The results of the case study indicate the potential utility of the tool for assessing the ES of an urban road network at a local level, identifying problem locations, and specifying the possible causes of those problems. In addition, it is found that the typical AHP expressed more powerful capability in differentiating links according to their composite ES characteristics than the fuzzy compositional AHP.</jats:p>",

Agile manufacturing makes use of modern information technology to form virtual enterprises, which agilely respond to the changing market demands. In recent years, Web related technology improves greatly the abilities to communicate and cooperate, The web technology enables the manufacturing resources, including information, facilities and so on, to be shared among geographically distributed partners. The significance of web technology to agile manufacturing is unquestionable. In this paper we develop a prototyping system to explore methodology of enhancing agility by use of Web based technology. A web-based micro-process planning system for turning has been developed. The engineers who are connected to the Internet at geographically distributed sites can use a standard browser to realize process parameter planning and optimization.</jats:p>",

In spite of these new directions, few programs have given consideration to the idea of interprofessional leadership and the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to support the changing roles and relationships that have come to define leadership practice (Browning, 1987; Cunningham, 1990; Corrigan, 1994; Lawson &amp; Hooper-Briar, 1997; Murphy, 1992; et al.). This article explores how one university has reshaped their doctoral leadership program in an effort to build interagency collaboration among professionals from public education, higher education, human services agencies, and health care organizations. A follow-up study of current students and graduates from the program provides insight into how these professionals have come to understand interprofessional leadership, the benefits and challenges for participating in an interprofessional doctoral program, and the extent to which the program has helped them to engage in interprofessional leadership in their own practices. </jats:p>",

Finapres recordings were made of 30 healthy, normal subjects (mean age 24 years) performing two tasks involving differing aspects of sustained attention and two tasks involving differing aspects of spatial working memory and planning. Measures of heart rate and blood pressure, heart rate and blood pressure variability, and their spectral derivatives revealed differing patterns of cardiovascular adjustment between the “attentional” and “planning” tasks. Each test raised blood pressure, but changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability were confined to the attentional tasks.

Thus when only the functionally critical forms have been determined from major functional requirements, synthesis of the configuration shape in a generic form would enable early assessment of manufacturing, processes. As a stepping stone toward the development of the configuration shape synthesis and process selection, case studies have been conducted using real world industrial parts. In this paper, we present the case studies using a planet carrier and a gear box housing, and discuss the issues in development of the shape synthesis and process selection method to support the design and process planning integration.</jats:p>",

This research surveyed a sample of British local planning authorities to discover how they \"assess the assessments\" and use the information supplied. The literature suggests that planners use the \"statutory consultation\" system to achieve many aspects of a review, and therefore, a sample of consultees was asked about their treatment of ESs. From the surveys, it is clear that planners do in fact place great reliance on the consultees to review, verify and summarise at least parts of ESs. However there is some mismatch between the expectations of consultee review on the part of planners against the objectives of the consultees themselves. This then throws into question how useful the information is in the actual decision making processes. The paper goes on to examine the alternatives available for reviews and proposes the development of an independent review body which can ensure that ESs are \"fit for purpose\". </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWithin the discussion on strategies to bring down unemployment, great hopes have been placed in the services sector. Many people have already come to see services as the powerhouse of economic growth in the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this thesis fails to take account of the mutual dependencies which exist between the secondary and tertiary sectors. Empirical analysis for the Münster region administrative district illustrates the importance of the role played by upstream relationships between these two sectors. Consequently, the successes of the services sector in terms of job-creation are dependent on the competitiveness of the region’s industries. Providing support for the services sector without at the same time taking measures to nurture the industrial base would thus appear to be a highly questionable strategy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Depending on the specific characteristics and requirements of the project, a range of tools can be used to characterize the surface and subsurface conditions. The results will be subject to specific limitations which will apply to a particular tool in terms of the depth investigated and the resolution of the measurements obtained as a result of the sensor capacity and background noise conditions. This paper presents a methodology that can be used to evaluate the relative merits of alternative sampling plans for a site and assist in identifying the optimal sampling plan taking into account the amount and type of prior information. This methodology allows new test results to be incorporated in real time as \"prior information\" as the site investigation proceeds. The methodology is implemented using a geographic information system (GIS) and a knowledge base system (KBS). Factors considered in the methodology include the effective measured area, the likely target characteristics, surface and subsurface noise conditions, and the level of confidence that exists about the possible source location as a result of prior studies at the site. The results of a sensitivity study are presented. An example is used to demonstrate the capability of the prototype system to assess different test configurations.Key Words: characterization, GIS, KBS, planning, quality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Jersey appears to be a successful offshore finance centre (OFC) with high levels of gross domestic product per capita. The OFC is the largest contributor to Jersey's tax revenue, and accounts for about 20% of local employment. Jersey has become a major OFC in a global industry and is a conduit for sizeable capital flows. However, an unparalleled crisis in 1996 generated international media interest. The crisis involved three separate but related issues: a US $26 million fraud; the fast-tracking of Limited Liability Partnership legislation through the island's parliament; and a political crisis resulting in the unprecedented expulsion of an outspoken Senator from the parliament. The anatomy of this crisis reveals several causes of concern for other OFC hosts, especially regulatory failure and the overlap of interests between the local political elite and those of international financial capital. We examine the changing international perceptions of ‘offshore’, question the need for bank secrecy, and consider Jersey's role as legitimiser for other OFCs. In addition, we discuss lessons for other OFC hosts, including the need for efficient regulation, the impacts of OFCs in small economies; and demonstrate that the costs of hosting an OFC are now significantly higher than was first realised. </jats:p>",

LETS have the potential to strengthen these milieux and thereby reinforce civil society within a locality, enhancing the benefits from a web of personal networks and extending them through weak links. LETS might also act as seed beds for new skills and practices which spill over into wider social and economic networks. Thus, by promoting networks which facilitate flows of information and innovation, and thereby building the capacity for responding to social change, LETS could contribute to community economic development. LETS form part of a cultural rather than technological innovation milieu. Our fieldwork in Stroud, Bristol, and environs suggests that, given the typical member's preference to remain distanced from the state, it is likely that a hands-off approach would be most successful in realising the potential of LETS. To tie such schemes to specific policy goals would ignore the symbolic meanings attached to membership of them. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Lifestyle planning (LP) for people with learning disabilities is largely supported by qualitative rather than quantitative research. LP is a time-consuming and potentially resource-intensive area of practice which is becoming more prevalent in the UK. We present the first systematic review of the qualitative evidence base for the use of LP in people with learning disabilities. Such evidence concerns the special characteristics of LP and its outcomes in descriptive rather than quantitative terms. Qualitative research is usually aimed at enhancing validity by grounding theory in data collected. Twenty-one studies passed eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review, but only ten provided any outcome data, the others being concerned with process only. A replicable search strategy was employed and the resulting original data sources were critically reviewed with respect to major concepts and categories in the areas of: planning process, choices and preferences, ethics and outcomes. Explicitly person-centred approaches such as essential lifestyle planning are contrasted with more service-led methods such as individual programme planning. There are major methodological limitations in much of the available literature and suggestions for future research to clarify matters are made. The current evidence base suggests that no form of LP has significantly better outcomes than any other form and that it is not clear if LP in general enhances outcomes. Ongoing use of person centred planning in particular is informed by ethical considerations and is evolving in its structure and function. </jats:p>",

This process had accelerated the globalization of manufacturing facilities. The motto “determine the most effective way of producing” has driven these efforts. The results are a change from a “production and operations management” philosophy, to a “supply chain management” philosophy. ERP systems are system software that integrates all the functions in an organization. The integration is provided across all functional frontiers of the organization. For example, different links in the supply chain may exist at different parts of the world, leading to differences in a wide range of attributes, e.g., culture, work hours, different governmental regulations, and different customer requirements for the same product. These differences necessitate the need for integration and ERP systems are prescribed to fill the need. ERP systems, as they are common to a wide range of industries, are sufficiently generic and understandably complex. Popular brand systems are “People Soft”, “Oracle”, “Bean” and “SAP”. While they promise considerable benefits to organizations that implement them, the process of implementation, in itself, is very complex, often lasting two to three years and costing more than 1$00 million. The human factors' concerns are many, and unfortunately may be, the main cause of the problems that have plagued the ERP systems. </jats:p>",

The results reveal the cognitive complexities faced by dispatchers and the cognitive and collaborative strategies developed in response to those demands, including strategies to support anticipation and planning, and proactive strategies to exploit windows of opportunity to satisfy the multiple demands on track use. In many cases these strategies depend on communication and cooperation among individuals distributed across time and space (i.e., multiple dispatchers, engineers, maintenance of way personnel). The ability to “listen in” on communications directed at others that have a bearing on achievement of your own goals and to recognize when information in your possession is of relevance to others, are important contributors to safe and efficient track use. The results reinforce findings from other domains (e.g., space shuttle mission control, air traffic control) regarding the role of a shared communication channel in supporting anticipation and contingency planning. Implication for the introduction of advanced “data-link” communication technologies, as well as for dispatcher training are discussed. </jats:p>",

Grain yields decreased 0.5 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>for nonfertilized millet and 1 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>for fertilized millet per meter along the slope when moving from the bottom to the top of the field. Soil water availability varied greatly, with individual neutron probe access tubes (36 tubes on an 8‐ha field) presenting a percent infiltration ranging from 15 to 182% of rainfall for individual rainstorms. Upslope had significantly lower percent infiltration (75%) than both midslope (90%) and downslope (84%). Between years, soil water and nutrients alternated in limiting crop growth, depending on rainfall distribution (annual rainfall ranging from 488–596 mm). However, in all three years toposequence related factors dominated yield variability and caused similar yield gradients along the slope.</jats:p>",
