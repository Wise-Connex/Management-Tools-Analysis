The problem is stated as the maximization of total profits of regional firms subject to constraints of ambient environmental quality and resource scarcity for production and abatement activities. The model assumes that environmental quality is stochastic by incorporating variable factors of dilution or assimilation in the constraint set. This model is expressed as a stochastic nonlinear programming problem, which by suitable mathematical transformations is reduced to a deterministic linear programming model. Solutions to the model show the economic impacts of uniform versus efficient treatment standards, time delays on waste control enforcement, and statistical properties of the dilution factors. </jats:p>",

The regional models are of the type where the criterion is maximum accessibility, and the model is constrained by population limits on each district. After a brief discussion of geometric programming, the relationship of total accessibility models to geometric programs is developed and a method of obtaining numerical solutions is presented. Several models are analyzed using the geometric programming approach, including a game theoretic model which is used to generate decentralized plans. </jats:p>",

What followed the recognition of the employment crisis, where did the economic turmoil leave us, and what was the result of the sobering reflection? As the accompanying Report will show.

Although people have been asked why they have made a certain choice, however, no attempts have been made to investigate the number of dimensions to residents' evaluations of suburbs, or the number of criteria on which they rate areas. The present study suggests that there might be five such dimensions, these being amalgams of a large number of terms which could be used to describe an area. The semantic differential technique has been used to test whether these five are relevant to a selection of residents of Christchurch, New Zealand; the analyses suggest that in fact there are probably three interrelated dimensions, and that these three are invariant with area of residence in the city. Although these dimensions of the criteria for evaluation are the same, however, the various suburbs were rated at different levels by groups living in different areas. Apparently both the social and the spatial distance between the respondent's home suburb and that which he is rating are influences on these variations. </jats:p>",

In contrast to previous discussions of the applicability of financial theory and mathematical programming methods in corporate planning, emphasis is placed on providing useful decision information within the practical limitations of theory, available computational capabilities, and established planning practices. The corporate model reflects the full range of financial decisions, including internal capital budgeting, acquisitions, divestments, debt creation/repayment, stock issue/repurchase, and dividend payout. Operating as an integral part of the corporate planning process, the mixed integer programming model selects optimal investment and financing programs over a multiperiod planning horizon. An on-line computational system permits extensive parametric analysis. The major features of the model, the supporting computational system, and implementation experience are presented. </jats:p>",

To increase the relevance of the theory to actual urban situations, this civic matter is assumed throughout to be a citizen population, though the theory would apply just as well if other illustrations, such as floor space or traffic flows, etc., were to be chosen instead. The population is assumed to attract itself in a way which tends to increase its density in high density regions and to decrease it in low density regions. This ‘clumping’ effect is offset by another inducement on the population to relocate itself in places where some ‘dissatisfaction potential’ is less. Again, for illustration, it is assumed throughout that the dissatisfaction has the form of a housing rental, that is, the price of the composite bundle of ‘housing’ commodities and utilities. </jats:p><jats:p> It is shown that the competition between the two civic forces of attraction and dispersal can lead to equilibrium distributions of the population in which the forces are everywhere in balance. The forms of these distributions depend greatly on the extent to which the housing rental is proportional to the local population density. Different degrees of this dependence are shown to give rise to many different forms of the equilibrium configurations available to a city. These are classified according to a regular scheme, and their properties explored and illustrated in detail. The manner in which one equilibrium configuration may grow into another, with or without any change in the total population in the city, leads to the idea of an ‘equilibrium growth’ in a city. Again their different possible types are examined in detail. </jats:p><jats:p> Finally, certain classes of the equilibrium configurations are shown to resemble closely the familiar negative exponential and gaussian distributions of population density. The resemblance can be so close as to make it extremely likely that many actual cities, that have been shown elsewhere to exhibit population density distributions of those forms, may in fact be exhibiting equilibrium distributions of the kind deduced in this study. </jats:p>",

It was developed by an interdisciplinary research team and is based on a hierarchical arrangement of environmental quality indicators, an arrangement that classifies the major areas of environmental concern into major categories, components, and ultimately into parameters and measurements of environmental quality. The EES provides for environmental impact evaluations in four major categories: ecology, environmental pollution, esthetics, and human interest. These four categories are further broken down into 18 components and finally into 78 parameters. The EES provides a means for measuring or estimating selected environmental impacts of large‐scale water resource development projects in commensurate units termed ‘environmental impact units’ (EIU). Results of using the EES include a total score in EIU ‘with’ and ‘without’ the proposed project; the difference between the two scores is one measure of environmental impact. Environmental impact scores developed in the EES are based on the magnitude of specific environmental impacts and their relative importance. Another major output from the EES is an indication of major adverse impacts called ‘red flags’, which are of concern of and by themselves. These flags indicate ‘fragile’ elements of the environment, which must be studied in more detail.</jats:p>",

The aggregate planning models that have been developed for goods-producing organizations are not appropriate for these types of service organizations. In this paper the process for staffing services is divided into three decision levels: (a) policy decisions, including the operating procedures for service centers and for the staff-control process itself; (b) staff planning, including hiring, discharge, training, and reallocation decisions; and (c) short-term scheduling of available staff within the constraints determined by the two previous levels. These three planning “levels” are used as decomposition stages in developing a general staffing model. The paper formulates the planning and scheduling stages as a stochastic programming problem, suggests an iterative solution procedure using random loss functions, and develops a noniterative solution procedure for a chance-constrained formulation that considers alternative operating procedures and service criteria, and permits including statistically dependent demands. The discussion includes an example application of the model and illustrations of its potential uses in the nurse-staffing process. </jats:p>",

The need for multidisciplinary input and strong interagency cooperation in planning for resource use is related to the logical and orderly completion of the planning steps. The paper briefly describes MOPE, emphasizing two important concepts: (1) the relationship of the study problems and objectives to national social objectives, and (2) the display of alternative solutions showing tradeoffs. Several important characteristics of a plan of study which implements MOPE are presented and discussed. A proposed MOPE analytical system is discussed in detail. The MOPE analytical system is divided into eight interdependent subsystems that describe data collection, use, analysis, and results. A linear program (L.P.) model is proposed to analyze the present and future demand relationships for natural resources. The model will also evaluate the interaction of agriculture, forestry, and recreation with the resource base of the basin, considering National Economic Development, Environmental Quality, and Regional Development.</jats:p>",
