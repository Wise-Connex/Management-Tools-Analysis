Unfor tunately, the debate rages with little empirical evidence on substantive is sues. This paper examines the rela tionship between state land use planning and inclusionary zoning in Oregon, and explores whether state planning fosters inclusionary zoning. The paper suggests that state plan ning in Oregon indeed fosters a lim ited form of inclusionary zoning. Be cause state planning occurs in a different political environment than local planning, the paper suggests, state land use planning differs sub stantively from local planning. Fur ther, to the extent that similar politi cal forces operate in other states, state land use planning offers the potential of overcoming a major obstacle to providing low-income housing. </jats:p>",

It traces the devel opment of, and systematically evalu ates a course introduced at the University of Michigan in early 1988 which focused on providing techni cal assistance to a neighborhood or ganization located in Detroit's inner city. In evaluating the course, gen eral issues raised in the literature on student workshops are addressed such as the conflict between produc ing an end product and analysis of policy alternatives, the relationship between theory and workshop courses, and the appropriate role of faculty members. In addition, the potentials, constraints, and possible improvements of a student work- shop focusing on inner city neigh- 4 borhood development issues are dis cussed, and an argument is made for including in the planning curriculum a course of this nature as a means of expanding students' understand ing of differing agendas. </jats:p>",

The United States' health care system, since it is almost entirely privatized, is therefore worthy of study. Doing so raises several questions. How is privatization being managed in the US? How could its management be improved? What management lessons must be kept in mind if it is to be used effectively? What potential pitfalls should European countries consider as they move toward greater privatization?</jats:p><jats:p>With operating costs, European countries must avoid the mistakes that have led to dramatic increases in annual health care costs in the US, simultaneous with reductions in access and quality. Doing so requires designing systems that promote hospital behavior consistent with a country's health objectives.</jats:p><jats:p>With capital costs, an approach must be designed that allows policy‐makers to work closely with both managers and physicians in order to make strategically sound choices about access and quality. Such an approach will require physicians to incorporate their clinical judgments into community standards of care, and to adopt a <jats:italic>regional</jats:italic> (rather than an institutional or personal) perspective in the determination of any incremental capital expenditures.</jats:p><jats:p>By making regulation proactive and strategic, rather than punitive, health policymakers in Western Europe can achieve the best privatization has to offer without feeling the sting of its unintended consequences. In so doing they can help to move their health systems toward achieving the multiple and illusive goals of access, quality and reasonable cost.</jats:p>",

Government health insurance, or national health insurance (NHI) may be analysed by using five criteria: who are the beneficiaries?; efficiency effects; the equity of financing; the level of administrative costs; and, political acceptability. In the last five years, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Nigeria have each considered proposals for NHI. However, each proposal shows design flaws, when analysed in the light of the five criteria above. This article first considers types of health insurance in Sub‐Saharan Africa, and why NHI, with cost recovery as an essential component, might be desirable. A following section present an outline of the NHI proposals in Ghana, Zimbabwe and Nigeria and points out the design flaws. A final section builds upon the theoretically‐good aspects of the three proposals, and considers some alternate approaches to NHI that these three countries and other countries in the Sub‐Sahara might want to consider.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The response of the offshore industry to the 1986 price collapse showed how flexible the industry can be when faced with unexpected challenges. In this case the challenge was met by following a \"lean and mean\", essentially short term view. This, coupled with a depressed market led to a marked increase in activity in the Dutch offshore sector reflected in an increased rate of development of hitherto marginal fields which are now coming on stream. The Paper takes a somewhat unusual view in questioning whether extrapolation of this approach is wise in the circumstances likely to prevail in the 1990's. Growing concern about the environment, redoubled efforts to improve safety offshore and, probably, a hardening in the prices for goods and services lead us to question whether extrapolation of the minimum facilities approach remains the most appropriate way to develop the smaller fields typical of the Dutch continental shelf.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper describes the present development concepts of minimum facilities platforms, mini-satellites and highly deviated wells as well as novel techniques and the advantages and disadvantages they bring with them. The role of the \"soft\" long term issues of manning philosophy, logistics and waste management, which play an increasingly significant role in selection of development plane, is also explored. It is shown that the planning of future developments requires an integrated exploration and development strategy and a willingness to formulate a long term view. The implications this has for the continued momentum of development are discussed.</jats:p>",

A combination of analysis of records, interviews and discussion with community groups was used.</jats:p><jats:p>Utilization in rural areas was affected drastically by the substantial increase of 1985. The effect on urban utilization was less extreme and less durable. The age composition of users changed. After the 1985 increase, proportionately more of the 15‐45 age group used the government services—this was particularly at the expense of the over‐45s. The population was obviously concerned with the cost of health care, but were even more concerned about the quality of care and receiving value‐for‐money. They were unwilling to pay if drug supplies were unreliable or staff behaved unpleasantly.</jats:p><jats:p>Some problems were encountered with implementing the policy of charges. Many facilities did not spend the revenue to which they were entitled—an interesting point, as the existence of the skill to spend money is often tacitly assumed!</jats:p><jats:p>Charges also had significant indirect resource consequences. Reduced utilization freed up staff time which should be used to provide other services, particularly preventive ones. This opportunity has not, as yet, been exploited.</jats:p><jats:p>Fee revenue can be dangerously attractive, particularly if it is administratively more accessible than general government allocations. There is a danger that revenue collection becomes a disproportionately important evaluative criterion in a system which is, after all, ultimately intended to improve health status.</jats:p>",

Economic considerations and increased environmental concerns have increased the number of directional wells drilled in recent years. Directional drilling techniques have also been applied to horizontal drilling with interest in this area increasing greatly over the last several years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the past, there have been two major methods utilized in planning the directional well. These methods are the use of buildup or composite buildup charts and the use of several directional well planning equations, each method depending on the particular wellbore geometry desired. The use of buildup charts is a tedious process that often yields inaccurate results since it requires using preplotted graphs that require interpretation and interpolation. The equation approach is often confusing to use due to the similarity of the various equations with the selection of the proper equation dependent on the desired wellbore geometry.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents the derivation of a single equation for planning the trajectory of any directional well and a similar equation for any horizontal well. Several examples are used to demonstrate the application of the equations to various wellbore geometries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The decision to treat oil and gas wells with acid is often based on the general belief that acid will dissolve any skin damage and/or part of the rock matrix. Often acid recipes are selected on the basis of experience in other areas, usually with a fair amount of subjective engineering judgement. As a result the success rate of acid treatments is sometimes rather disappointing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Proper evaluation of a formation's response to matrix acidising requires knowledge of the various parameters before the acid-response testing. Mineral composition and potential sources of formation damage, e.g. invaded barytes, can be identified by the application of sophisticated instrumental analysis techniques such as X-ray diffraction (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with automated mineral identification by complex image processing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Correlation of analytical results on core samples before and after treatment with acid with the acid response curves helps to explain the phenomena observed in the tests. Automated mineral identification based on EDX analysis and scanning electron micrographs of the relevant samples may provide additional information without which differences in the response of closely related samples might remain unexplained.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The application of these procedures in the design of acid treatments for a number of Dutch gas wells resulted in an improved acid treatment design and more successful stimulation treatments. A total of seven gas wells, producing from a reservoir with a rather unusual rock composition, were treated, resulting in a total production gain of some three million m3/day, more than twice that expected on the basis of previous stimulation experience.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper illustrates how a carefully planned acidising campaign can benefit from a thorough laboratory study and fruitful cooperation between research and operating company.</jats:p>",

To date (Dec. 1989), cumulative production has been 5.3 MMSTB (8.4 × 105 m3).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Excellent reservoir characteristics shown by the Escandalosa and Navay formations, which contain most of the oil in the La Victoria field, exhibit the following unusual oil properties: 35 °API (0.85 g/cm3 ) gravity, low bubble point pressure (285 psia) (1.97 MPa), low solution GOR (136 SCF/STB) (24.5 std m3/m3) and an average oil viscosity of 1 cp (1 × 10−3 Pa.s) at 227 °F (108 °C). These anomalous values make this field one of the most prolific discovered in Venezuela. The producing mechanism is an edge water drive from an extensive, fresh water aquifer.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The development of such a field must be planned properly to achieve a maximum efficiency in its exploitation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes the reservoir and its geology, the production history, and the reservoir simulation study used as an aid to development planning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results show that the La Victoria field can be developed with eighteen producers. The ultimate recovery by natural depletion, at the end of 20 years, is predicted to be 84.5 MMSTB (13.4 × 106 m3 ) (38.2% STOIP). With the proposed development plan it may be possible to maintain the oil potential production above 30,000 B/D (4,769 m3/D) during the 1990-1992 period.</jats:p>",

The data consist of transcribed weekly speech samples of a Dutch boy between 2;4 and 2;11. The period of observation captures the early phase of the transition from ‘pre-grammatical’ to grammatical language. The frequency of occurrence of dysfluencies (i.e. repetitions, revisions and incomplete phrases) shows a significant increase and a subsequent decline. Whereas in the first half of the observation period the dysfluencies are distributed relatively randomly over sentences, in the second half they tend to concentrate in function words and sentence-initial words. The decline of dysfluency rate is shown to be related to an abundant use of a few ‘syntactic frames’. It is argued that these results reflect the emergence of a component in the speech production apparatus which is specifically dedicated to serial-order planning.</jats:p>",

What time of day should I schedule observations? </jats:p><jats:p> To answer such questions it is necessary to have an objective measure of the precision attainable for position determination by GPS techniques. At present, the indicators of precision commonly available are based on notions of relative satellite geometry as borrowed from GPS navigation principles, and are only of limited use in GPS surveying. In particular, for short baselines, the reliable resolution of the carrier cycle ambiguities during the phase reduction stage is the key to precise relative GPS surveying. The authors have developed a number of precision indicators for GPS surveying which could be used to maximise the probability of resolving ambiguities. The computation of these proposed indicators will assist in satellite selection and estimating the appropriate observation session times and length for GPS surveying. The utility of these indicators has been supported by studies that have shown that not only is the internal precision of the coordinate results maximised, but the sensitivity to systematic errors is also to a large extent reduced. Strategies for the use of these indicators are suggested. </jats:p>",

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 84 occasions with a 73 per cent success rate for visualization of the main pancreatic duct. On-table pancreatography (OTP) was performed by one of five different techniques: retrograde, prograde or ambigrade ductography, cystography and ascending loopography after pancreaticojejunostomy. OTP provided important information about the main pancreatic duct when endoscopic visualization was unsuccessful (n = 23), incomplete (n = 77) or not performed (n = 33); there was a failure rate of 4 per cent. In 35 patients either the additional information or discrepancies between ERCP and OTP findings resulted in a change of operative plan (19 extra procedures, 16 altered procedures). Complete ductography was especially helpful in the 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis. OTP is technically simple, free from complications and invaluable for planning operative strategy.</jats:p>",

After reviewing the various tendencies towards centralization which can be observed and looking at some of the reforms which have occurred, the current district planning approach, known as the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy, is analysed in order to explore the roles played within it by local government. Policy documents and other official statements are discussed, as are the attitudes of political and administrative leaders. Whilst the new strategy is supposed to bring about greater decentralization, it has led to a continuing reduction of local government autonomy especially for the county councils. However, pessimistic conclusions can not be easily drawn. Local government is not likely to be abolished, the new approach may enable it to play a more effective planning role—even if a less autonomous one—and there are other forms of local participation (especially through community development) which partly compensate for the erosion of formal local government.</jats:p>",

Raymond Williams identified an ‘escalator’ on which literary representation continually looked back upon a past golden age of rural virtue, ensuring that the idea of a ‘true’ rural England has persisted into the twentieth century with extraordinary power Thus Howard Newby can write of the ‘stereotypes and myths which surround the popular image of the rural world’, while, at the same time, he claims this fallacious perception is ‘one of the major protecting illusions of our time’. This illusion has been reinforced by the nature of English society. Sir Lewis Narnier believed English society to be ‘amphibious’ in the eighteenth century, with no sharp divide between town and country among the interests of the ruling classes. By the end of the nineteenth century the countryside, under the influence of Romanticism and a changing class structure, had become the preserve of an upper-class society increasingly separated from industrialism and the great towns. Yet this upper class was cemented by the public schools and the universities to include not only landowners, but an array of occupations, including many intellectuals. Until the First World War, despite increasing mechanisation and specialisation in the countryside, the land presented a rural face largely unspoiled by the intrusion of industrial and urban uses. Land was held in large estates, farmed by tenants in a world of mostly irregular fields, lanes and hedgerows, with buildings that preserved vernacular styles.</jats:p>",

While previous models plan proofs in a step‐by‐step fashion, we observed that experts plan at a more abstract level: They focus on the key steps and skip the less important ones. DC models this abstract planning behavior by parsing geometry problem diagrams into perceptual chunks, called diagram configurations, which cue relevant schematic knowledge. We provide verbal protocol evidence that DC's schemas correspond with the step‐skipping inferences experts make in their initial planning. We compare DC with other models of geometry expertise and then, in the final section, we discuss more general implications of our research. DC's reasoning has important similarities with Larkin's (1988) display‐based reasoning approach and Johnson‐Laird's (1983) mental model approach. DC's perceptually based schemas are a step towards a unified explanation of (1) experts' superior problem‐solving effectiveness, (2) experts' superior problem‐state memory, and (3) experts' ability, in certain domains, to solve relatively simple problems by pure forward inferencing. We also argue that the particular and efficient knowledge organization of DC challenges current theories of skill acquisition as it presents an end‐state of learning that is difficult to explain within such theories. Finally, we discuss the implications of DC for geometry instruction.</jats:p>",

Evidence from a number of recent studies is used to present a comprehensive review of Zimbabwe's experience of local government decentralization during the first eight years of independence, 1980 to 1988. Section 2 presents a brief outline of some basic concepts on decentralization which have guided the discussion. Section 3 contains a short account of the local government system inherited from the colonial era. Section 4 outlines the major post‐independence reforms, that is: the 1980 District Councils Act; the 1984‐85 Prime Minister's Directive on Decentralization; the 1985 Provincial Councils and Administration Act; and the 1988 Rural District Councils Act. Section 5 presents an assessment of these reforms, paying particular attention to organizational, financial and planning issues. While some important improvements have been achieved in rural Communal Areas‐in particular the extension of services and increases in local revenues and popular participation‐the system of local government and administration remains a dual one. Other problems include the gap between the planning and budgeting processes, continued financial dependence of district councils on central government, and a lack of serious effort by central government to make use of provincial and district development plans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Modern coal-winning techniques require identification of panels of coal in which seam geometry irregularities are minimal. The locations and throws of faults in unworked ground can often be determined by the projection of faults recorded in earlier workings. Successful projection requires a knowledge of the systematic geometry of faults in respect of throw variation on the fault surface and of the shape and dip of the fault surface. A simple geometrical model of an ideal single normal fault is described in which the throw varies systematically from a maximum at the centre of the elliptical fault surface to zero at the tip-line, or edge, of the fault surface. A fault surface ellipticity of 2, with a horizontal major axis, and a dip of 70° are recommended as approximations when no other data are available. Successful lateral projection of faults within a seam, or vertical projection from higher or lower seams, depends on the amount and type of data available from earlier workings and also on the accuracy of recorded throw values which are sometimes less than the total throw.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Retrospective studies of vertical projection of faults using a Throw Profile Plot, at Royston colliery, Yorkshire, and of lateral projection of a fault at Markham colliery, Derbyshire, are described. Discontinuous fault traces are common and represent a systematic departure from the ideal single fault model. Discontinuous fault trace arrays can be treated as single faults if the throws on overlapping segments are summed. Examples of the summing of throws on overlapping fault trace segments are described from Nook colliery, Lancashire, and Cotgrave colliery, Nottinghamshire.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The new projection methods are intended to increase the probability of successfully delineating economically workable panels of coal before significant development costs are incurred.</jats:p>",

Although this phenomenon of tertiary sector hypertrophy has received much attention in the literature, the possibility of regional variation within the Third World has been relatively unexplored. It is argued that there are strong rationales for expecting a spatial variation in the sectoral partitioning of labor and in tertiary sector hypertrophy, and that the experiences of less developed countries cannot be generalized. Empirical analysis using 1980 data from 108 countries shows that countries in Africa exhibited the highest levels of tertiary hypertrophy at a given income level, followed by Asia and Latin America. Regional differences are apparent in the income level at which the maximum hypertrophy is observed. It is suggested that analyses of structural changes in development need to be sensitive to the spatial, temporal, and contextual milieux. </jats:p>",

The first phase uses a deterministic model to quickly obtain a near-optimal expansion plan. This model employs a step approximation to the time-dependent availabilities of the nondispatchable technologies, and a derating technique to represent forced outages of conventional units. Specialized algorithms that exploit the structure of this deterministic problem are developed. The second phase refines the resulting solution toward the probabilistic optimum. It employs accurate probabilistic production costing techniques to account for forced outages of conventional generators, and uses hour-by-hour simulation to represent the contributions of nondispatchable technologies. This second phase requires few additional iterations in our computational experience. The proposed approach suggests a modification for the existing state-of-the-art methodology electric generation expansion analysis system (EGEAS), particularly for situations in which the cumulant approximation used in EGEAS may be inadequate, and it suggests an improved technique for accelerating Bloom's Generalized Benders' Decomposition algorithm for the conventional equipment capacity expansion planning problem. </jats:p>",

In this paper their financial implications are assessed, drawing on the example of Bracknell. The financial costs and consequences of the new towns were initially very unclear, but the government took a long-term and fairly generous attitude towards investment because of the wider economic and social benefits that were anticipated. Expenditure controls tightened as the costs of development increased and the political and economic climate changed. Within the last decade government policy has been to sell off the publicly-owned assets created over the previous three decades. Bracknell ultimately achieved a reasonably favourable financial outcome. How and why this occurred are examined. Also, some of the effects of privatisation are explored and lessons are drawn for urban policy more generally. </jats:p>",

Thirty pilots flew three ILS approaches under different levels of workload. The data indicates that the increase in workload affected flight performance as well as the planning and scheduling of tasks with different levels of prioritization. This level of prioritization closely approximated the flight instructor's and the subjects' subjective ratings of the degree of importance of each task. It is also suggested that overconfidence in time estimation may depend on the task involved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Historical agricultural practices have severely undermined the recreational quality and ecological integrity of Midwestern streams, rivers, and reservoirs. Reestablishing riparian forest corridors would create wetland buffers partially protecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems from agricultural runoff. On the basis of an explicitly spatial market-failure model of land use in the riparian (floodplain) zone, contingent valuation survey methods are used to estimate the recreational and intrinsic benefits of improved ‘river quality’ in selected Iowa and Illinois river basins. It is found that willingness to pay for river quality is related to income and recreational participation, but not to other spatial or socioeconomic variables. Intrinsic values are found to be expressible as economic values similar to that of other public goods. Together with recreational values, they are larger on a per-acre basis, in many instances, than the production of agricultural commodities. This suggests that the purpose of programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program should be enlarged from their present focus on soil conservation to include water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and intrinsic values. </jats:p>",

Early onset of sexual activity (v age 15) was more prevalent among long delayers (47.9%) than among short delayers (21.1%). Longer delayers were more likely to come from the lowest socioeconomic groups. Short delayers and longer delayers were equally likely to have been motivated to attend the clinic because they feared they were pregnant. Reasons for choosing this clinic over others reflected the importance of confidentiality, comprehensiveness of services, and the specific adolescent orientation of care.</jats:p>",

The approach of dynamic path planning intro duced in Lumelsky and Stepanov (1987) and Lumelsky (1987) is based on the latter model and produces nonheuristic (provable) algorithms for simple robot arm manipulators operating in an environment with unknown obstacles of arbi trary shapes. The algorithms assume local on-line input information coming from the arm sensors. Unfortunately, the existing techniques require that each kinematic configuration be considered separately, which results in different algo rithms for different kinematics. In this paper, a unified meth odology is presented for designing dynamic path planning algorithms for two- and three-dimensional two-link arm manipulators. The approach is independent of the specifics of the kinematic configuration and imposes no constraints on the shape of the arm links or obstacles in the environment. The methodology exploits some important topological char acteristics of the configuration space. However, no explicit computation of obstacles in the configuration space ever takes place, which results in fast real-time algorithms. </jats:p>",

This theoretical approach to explaining the emergence of specific forms of the state is illustrated through an analysis of transformations in Canada's assisted housing programmes. It is argued that changing conditions of accumulation, consumption, and state development combined with political struggles over state intervention to shape these programmes in the postwar era. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Combining a model of susceptibility of black fly larvae to commercial formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis and a one-dimensional transport equation in a river, the quantity of larvicide that should be applied at a given site in order to achieve a given mortality downstream can be calculated. The obtained relation, a function of biological and hydrological parameters, allowed us to calculate the costs related to the treatment of a section of river. It is then possible to determine an optimal strategy of treatment which minimizes the quantity of an insecticide applied and the logistic movement between injection sites. Optimal solution is found with the aid of a well known algorithm developed in operations research theory to solve this combinatorial problem. An experimental treatment conducted in the Onchocerciasis Control Program in West Africa is analyzed as an example of the model's application to illustrate the savings of insecticide, time, and money using this approach. </jats:p>",
