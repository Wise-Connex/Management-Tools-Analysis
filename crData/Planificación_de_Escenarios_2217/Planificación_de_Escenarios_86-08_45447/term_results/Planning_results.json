First, it is intended to give an overview of the major issues involved in the diffusion of information to Less Developed Ccountries (LDCs), and a review of the types of organization that operate in the field, their accessibility and specializations. It is hoped that this presentation will encour age academics to become interested in the value and power of information as a thing in itself, and correspondingly to dedi cate greater efforts to making use of, and furthering the cause of, those information services which are appropriate and cost effective. </jats:p><jats:p> Second, the paper is an attempt to pull together the various aspects of the subject of 'information for LDCs', encouraging librarians and information specialists to consider issues other than those concerned mainly with technical access to facilities, (e.g. the political control of information, the 'privatization of information' and appropriate information systems for local populations, etc.). </jats:p><jats:p> Generally, recent literature (1978-84) is used throughout. This is partly in order to demonstrate the latest thinking on the subject, but also due to the relative sparseness of earlier material which is still relevant. </jats:p>",

They use concepts as defined in the FAO Framework on Land Evaluation (1976). Land evaluation is shown to concern not only the technical aspects of agricultural production but also the socioeconomic, political and other conditions under which production takes place in existing or projected land use systems. The QLE approach presented is part of a much wider analytical framework that supports the development of national food policies. The paper discusses the following factors as related to the new procedure: the production situation, the simulation procedure, regional analysis, and application of quantified land evaluation procedures.

We are not concerned with issues of detailed scheduling, but rather hope to develop a tactical planning tool for a job-shop operation. With the model, we are able to characterize the operational behavior of each work center in the job shop for a given control policy. The control rule sets the production rate at a work center as a fixed proportion of its queue level in each time period, and is consistent with the assignment of a planned lead time to each work center. For these control rules, the model gives the steady-state distribution of the production levels at each work center, as well as the distribution of queue lengths. We show how to use the model not only to evaluate a choice of the controls but also to find a good specification that results in acceptable shop behavior. An example for a factory that produces grinding machines illustrates the use of the model. </jats:p>",

An off-line optimal continuous path planning method is developed for on-line control at joint level. The specified end effector path is approximated by a set of location nodes selected on the desired path. The motion control of the robot is provided by cubic polynomial interpolation at joint level. The proposed approach to trajectory planning of kinematically redundant robots consists of obtaining an optimal set of nodes which guarantees minimum deviation from the desired Cartesian path. The redundant DOF of the robot is used as a constrained variable in the optimization search. The method is illustrated in an example.</jats:p>",

In this paper the authors both describe these changes and set out to explain them. It is argued that the state is currently embarked on a regional or federalist ‘reform initiative’. Reform is taken to mean an authoritarian restructuring of the state on a less overtly racist basis. At present, for example, Regional Services Councils or revised forms of metropolitan government are being instituted. For the restructuring to be ‘successful’, however, coincident changes in the distribution of economic activity are necessary. As a result there is a critical relationship between the political—economic intentions of the state and regional economic policy. </jats:p>",

However, there has been little attempt to measure explicitly the accuracy of simulation results in relation to the data used in their estimation. Within the context of programming estimation procedure, comparable measures of the ‘quantity’ of exogenous data and the accuracy of simulation are developed in this paper.

These costs are then compared with the future investment resource pool, and are found to be larger than the total pool. Alternative policy solutions to alleviate the problem are explored. Although some capital-saving strategies (such as major public works programs in rural areas and labor-intensive employment policies) would be helpful, it will be impossible to avoid a substantial rise in the proportion of the urban population without services from about one quarter to about one half of the total. The paper concludes with suggestions for refining the methodology in future studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The economy of the West Midlands Region of England is dominated by a small number of large manufacturing companies. The analysis of the economy in this paper focuses on the corporate strategies of the twenty-six largest manufacturing companies in the region. It is shown that there has been a transformation of the companies from producers of low value-added commodity-type products in the 1960s, is also shown to more diversified companies competing in higher value-added sectors. It also shows that these major companies have shifted their orientation from the old Empire markets towards Europe and North America. </jats:p><jats:p> The companies have reduced their production costs by rationalising their manufacturing processes, and in some cases by establishing manufacturing plants in other countries. However, the main motive for shifting production from the United Kingdom has been to produce closer to the final markets, rather than cost reduction. </jats:p><jats:p> The main method which companies have used to become more diversified has been acquisitions. Companies have bought all or parts of companies which were already established in the sectors into which they wanted to move. Since such companies were rarely located within the region, the regional impact of these changes has been largely negative: the plants which were engaged in the declining sectors have been in the West Midlands, whereas the growth sectors have been located elsewhere, either in other regions of the United Kingdom or abroad. </jats:p><jats:p> The conclusion is that the West Midlands manufacturing companies have responded to the changing world economic conditions and the recent recession in a positive way, but that their reactions have produced a permanent reduction in manufacturing employment in the region. Even a strong national recovery from recession will not produce a significant increase in local employment in these companies. </jats:p>",

In this paper the policies designed to increase the supply of housing for private renting are examined. The paper has four sections. The first is an examination of the private rented market in the context of Government policy, with emphasis on the way policies about private renting have not been related to the tax and subsidy policies in respect of other tenures. In the second the specific initiatives taken by the Government to stimulate investment are examined. The evidence about the impact which these initiatives have had is looked at in part 3. The fourth part is an examination of why the initiatives have had relatively little impact and it is concluded that it is because they are only marginal solutions to the fundamental economic difficulties faced both by landlords and by tenants. </jats:p>",
