      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to explain sudden urban growth, a global phenomenon of astonishing force that presents one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. The forces that shape urban growth are many and varied. Such forces produce an array of histories of urbanization ranging from continuity to various catastrophic shifts along the population trajectory. It is seen that the realized history of urbanization explicitly depends on the prevailing characteristics of individuals and of the existing technology. Hence, in principle, given a knowledge of these characteristics (and given some other information explained in the text), it would be possible to predict the path toward urbanization taken by simple worlds such as those considered here, Different outcomes would then be attributed to and explained by different behavioural and technological circumstances. </jats:p>",

Using a cross analysis of various classifications of educational planning activities and some basic theoretical assumptions about the inherent aspects of the educational process, a conceptual frame of reference has been developed here. This frame serves a multiple purpose. It enables a more systematic review, on the one hand, and forecasts some basic components for future theoretical and practical development, on the other hand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Spatial dynamics—the study of the spatiotemporal dimension of socioeconomic activities—is grounded on highly questionable premises. These are implicit or explicit philosophical theses regarding knowledge (empiricism) and society (methodological individualism). As a consequence of these premises—it is argued—the scientific knowledge of social phenomena becomes problematic if not impossible. </jats:p><jats:p> It is further demonstrated that the dominant paradigm in the social sciences (based on empiricism and individualism) is not the only possible one. A fairly comprehensive overview of an alternative is presented, which draws upon recent advances in Marxian theory. In this perspective, the constitution and transformation of spatial configurations cannot be understood in terms of observable spatial relations; as social forms, spatial patterns must be explained in terms of the dynamics of the underlying social structure. Accordingly, ‘spatial dynamics’ must be reconstructed as the dynamics of spatial forms: the study of the formation and transformation of spatial configurations as expressions of the expanded reproduction of the capitalist mode of production in capitalist social formations. </jats:p><jats:p> It is further argued—from the very nature of the capitalist process—that the transformation of spatial forms should be viewed as a process of evolution through instabilities and fluctuations. Accordingly, there is a sound theoretical motivation for experimenting with ‘dissipative structures’ and catastrophe theory. </jats:p><jats:p> The basic ideas of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and dissipative structures are presented via two simple mathematical models. The latter do not intend to formalize Marx's or Schumpeter's theory. Their only function in the discourse of this paper is to illustrate how the ideas of structural determination, crises, and qualitative change can be captured in rigorous mathematical terms. </jats:p>",

Sturcturally, it is composed of two major blocks; a demand module, and a production, cost and revenue module. The demand module, the heart of the model, is a set of simultaneous nonlinear econometric equations which forecast physical volume, approximately 35 categories of advertising lines and 10 categories of circulation. The second block is recursive and contains roughly 300 equations, some of which are stochastic behavioral equations. This block converts the volume forecasts into paging, newsprint consumption, newsprint distribution and manning requirements. These physical flows are then monetized, using price and wage forecasts, to produce estimates of revenue, fixed and variable costs, and operating profit. This paper summarizes the development of the model, with emphasis on the advertising and circulation model. It should be noted that the structure of the model is constantly evolving. Consequently, emphasis is placed on the conceptual underpinnings of the model not on a detailed presentation of the current structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an exploratory model of the population redistribution process in metropolitan areas. A set of ten differential equations developed from logistic growth theory describes the dispersal of population from an urban area into two encompassing concentric zones. These outward flows give rise to changes in the commuting flows by mode as well as changes in the modal mix of journey-to-work trips within the urban area. The model is calibrated for Greater London and the South-East Standard Region of England between 1961 and 1976, and various possible pricing scenarios are tested to examine the population trajectories up to 1991. The results illustrate the feasibility of dynamic process-descriptive models in urban analysis, but also suggest an integrated programme of research and model-building as part of this development. </jats:p>",

For a given level of final demand,\n      input-output analysis allows us to project the required level of gross\n      output to ensure consistency of plan. These projections are made on the\n      assumption that the existing production structure is optimal and it\n      implies that an increase in demand will be met through the expansion of\n      domestic output even when it can be satisfied through an increase in\n      imports. On the other hand, according to the semi-input-output method,\n      we do not have to increase the output of international sectors in order\n      to meet the increase in demand because the level and composition of\n      these activities should be determined by comparative- cost\n      considerations. These are the only national sectors in which output must\n      increase in order to avoid shortage. The semi-input -output method has\n      been such a useful and important contribution, yet, regrettably, its\n      influence on the planning models had been rather limited.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article takes a critical look at the British planning system and the way it operates today. It has the reputation of being the best in the world, but it is widely misunderstood and misused. The present British government is trying to make planning less effective and far-reaching in the name of the need for national economic revival. Some of the planners on the defensive argue that the need and potential for planning is as great as ever. But there is no cause for complacency as the system has not been working smoothly. A long-running debate about the desirable degree of control over minor development will be quietened when the government passes new legislation on the subject. But the basic issues remain unresolved. Public participation in planning has been fashionable, but many planners are now disappointed by it. In pursuing quantity rather than quality of response from the public, the efforts of planners to involve people in preparing plans have been misdirected. Public inquiries have become an important part of the planning system, but the public is being tricked into thinking that it has a real opportunity to influence decisions when in fact it does not. Gradual changes in the nature of public inquiries are making them widely misunderstood. </jats:p>",

Because of that influence, highway departments have been able to pursue the narrow objective of accommodating traffic despite congressional attempts to redirect transportation goals toward meeting the land-use needs of declining central cities and avoiding the adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts of highways. These adverse effects have included the isolation of central city transit-dependent minorities from suburban employment and the creation of an excessive dependence on gasoline. The inertia of this limited purpose highway program has been sustained by massive federal funding, a bureaucratically embedded and technologically intimidating planning methodology, and a system of federal plan and impact reviews whose major effect has been to expedite the approval and construction of highway projects. These deficient impact analyses and token reviews have deprived the public and elected officials of vital information about foreseeable adverse impacts and have unreasonably restricted their ability to judge highway proposals or make important decisions affecting decentralization. </jats:p>",
