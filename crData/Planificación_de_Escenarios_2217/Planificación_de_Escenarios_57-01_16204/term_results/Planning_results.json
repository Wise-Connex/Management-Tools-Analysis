This soil‐vegetation survey is a particularly remunerative source of much information on the physical factors that affect the business of ranching. Practical applications of this information are discussed herein; a review of specific cases illustrates the value of these surveys in range management planning and administration. These cases also demonstrate that soil‐vegetation surveys are a practical tool for both the rancher, and the range technician in public service or private enterprise. They are an extremely effective means of conveying information, and have a great potential for developing interest in, and an incentive for, better range management.</jats:p>",
