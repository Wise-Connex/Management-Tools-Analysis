      "abstract": "<jats:p> Conflict is immanent to planning, and perhaps particularly to practice within a pluralistic, multicultural society. Chantal Mouffe argues that there is a political need for an ‘agonistic pluralism’ as a democratic response to a context of diversity and conflict. Perhaps the key complex of problems in contemporary planning is how to work with ‘strife’. Proceeding from the perspective of a Danish urban regeneration project named ‘kvarterløft’, this article will discuss planning experiences with conflicts, empowerment, consensussteering, and governance that point to the need to make ‘strife’ – the ongoing dispute about words, meaning, discourses, visions or ‘the good life’ – central to planning processes. </jats:p>",

This article builds on Habermas’ conception that mediatization is a central impediment to the realization of democracy, while recognizing the locally particular resolution of democratic dilemmas represented by any planning system. Using Victoria, Australia as an example, the article seeks to demonstrate that Habermas’ project offers a means of critiquing existing planning systems. Rather than communicative planning remaining an unattainable ideal, the possibility is explored of Habermasian critique offering practical directions for enhancing the democracy of existing planning systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Case studies have recently played a prominent role in the study of ethical issues in planning. To clarify the role that cases can play, this article investigates how two other professional fields (law and medical ethics) have used cases to analyze practical ethics. The author argues that law and medicine use studies to develop “moral taxonomies”—classifications of important cases that help clarify the meaning and limits of ambiguous values, principles, and maxims. Three features characterize case ethics in law and medicine: (1) a focus on hard cases, in which key values or principles are ambiguous or in conflict; (2) use of analogical reasoning to analyze those cases, to determine which previously resolved cases they resemble and which they do not; and (3) identification of low-level principles that underwrite these judgments of similarity and difference and can help inform judgments about future cases. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Can you succinctly and clearly define what planning and many of its guiding principles —such as the public good, sustainability, or even market forces— actually mean? For many of us, this is difficult to accomplish. Lacan provides an explanation for this challenge based on his theorizing about human subjectivity— how we acquire the identifications that constitute ourselves as planners. The article will deploy Lacan’s explanatory power for understanding how the professional identities of planners and the central ideas constituting the planning discipline are interrelated. Particularly, Lacan’s theoretical model of the four discourses will be used to explore planning education and how aspiring planners acquire and internalize the discipline’s often-diffuse sets of traditions, beliefs, knowledges, and values. </jats:p>",

An international review of planning curricula indicated a widespread consensus with respect to key competencies required of planners. This understanding was used in the development of new teaching programs at three Sri Lankan universities. Complementing the technical core knowledge areas, strong emphases on problem structuring, critical and strategic thinking, and the understanding of the political and institutional contexts appear to be crucial to making the agenda of “planning for sustainable development” more than a fashionable cliché. In order for these core areas to have relevance in a developing country context, however, planning curricula need to achieve a balance between local priorities and a “global” perspective. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many critiques of consensus building have been uninformed about the nature of this practice or the theory on which it was built, though there is extensive literature on both. It is grounded in the theory and practice of interest-based negotiation and mediation. It is not grounded in Habermas’ concept of communicative rationality, though theorists have found useful illumination in his ideas. Claims are often made about pathologies of consensus building based on cases where the conditions for authentic dialogue recognized by both practitioners and theoreticians were not met. Documentation of cases shows that when these conditions are met, many desirable outcomes occur. The article examines the various critiques, including the claims that external power differentials are deterministic, that lowest common denominator solutions are the outcomes, that valuable tensions are lost in the process, and that agreements are fleeting at best. It shows how and why each of these is not borne out by experience. Consensus building is time consuming and requires skill and training. It is only appropriate in situations of uncertainty and controversy where all stakeholders have incentives to come to the table and mutual reciprocity in their interests.</jats:p>",

What is lacking, however, is a more nuanced understanding of what ideas or concepts people use to think about their roles in organizations, and how their very personalities have become tied into the creation of professionalism. This article looks at the dilemmas for public servants in a Norwegian municipality and shows how structural dilemmas may be internalized by individual employees. The emic concept of ‘loyalty’ is shown to symbolize attempts to individualize such dilemmas and render them subject to personality, rather than recognize them as conceptual problems. </jats:p>",

This literature review and synthesis is based on computerized searches of the scientific literature and review of conference presentations, publications of national and international organizations, and popular media. Condoms are about 90 percent effective for preventing HIV transmission, and their use has grown rapidly in many countries. Condoms have produced substantial benefit in countries like Thailand, where both transmission and condom promotion are concentrated in the area of commercial sex. The public health benefit of condom promotion in settings with widespread heterosexual transmission, however, remains unestablished. In countries like Uganda that have curbed generalized epidemics, reducing the number of individuals' sex partners appears to have been more important than promoting the use of condoms. Other countries continue to have high rates of HIV transmission despite high reported rates of condom use among the sexually active. The impact of condoms may be limited by inconsistent use, low use among those at highest risk, and negative interactions with other strategies. Recommendations include increased condom promotion for groups at high risk, more rigorous measurement of the impact of condom promotion, and more research on how best to integrate condom promotion with other prevention strategies.</jats:p>",

The prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases increased significantly in the 1990s, and UN AIDS currently identifies the Central Asian region as a high HIV‐growth zone. Structural, institutional, and attitudinal factors have contributed to the disconnection between reproductive and sexual health in Uzbekistan, even though family planning programs have been well established during the HIV pandemic. Integrating state statistics, Demographic and Health Survey data, and focus‐group‐discussion results, we highlight the ways in which a heavily centralized program focusing on reproductive health did little to better sexual health, especially among young adults. The example of Uzbekistan reveals pathways by which reproductive health efforts may continue to be compartmentalized, decreasing their potential contributions to sexual health, especially among young adults.</jats:p>",

The model draws on survey data for information on sexual activity, marriage and divorce, and on the biomedical literature for input parameters governing the transmission and spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We show that lifetime risk could be as high as 42 percent with no condom use and as low as 8 percent if everyone consistently uses condoms with nonmarital partners. Next, we examine the impact of more realistic, intermediate strategies of condom use, varying men's propensity to use a condom with nonmarital partners, varying the per‐coitus probability of condom use, varying probabilities of slippage or breakage, and finally, examining the effect of condom use in the presence of STD symptoms. We demonstrate profound effects of consistent condom use and of condom use prompted by symptomatic STDs.</jats:p>",

This study reassesses the level of unintended pregnancy in Vietnam and its correlates, drawing on retrospective calendar data gathered for the Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey II. Data from 13,540 “segments” of outcomes and contraceptive practice were analyzed. Based on the calendar data, 40 percent of pregnancies during the 1994‐97 period are estimated to have been unintended, a proportion 48 percent higher than the prevailing estimate calculated from the reported intendedness of live births. When concealment of pregnancies ending in induced abortions is taken into account, the unintended pregnancy rate in Vietnam is likely to approach levels found only in developing countries. Unintended pregnancy was found to be associated with age, early marriage, spousal age difference, number of living sons, past unintended pregnancy, geographic region, contraceptive use prior to pregnancy, and the family planning supply environment. The findings suggest that broadening the method mix at the community level, targeting high‐risk and underserved groups, and expanding postabortion counseling and services are likely to have a dramatic impact on the unintended pregnancy rate in Vietnam.</jats:p>",

It finds that both programs use government authority and subsidies to make large-scale private or quasi-private investment attractive in the name of ameliorating living conditions. Cautiously applying Logan and Molotch’s “growth coalition” concept to China, the authors assert that a “growth machine” has formed during China’s economic decentralization processes. Despite the similarities, America’s urban renewal was an ill-fated federal program in which the local government and downtown business interests cooperated to boost declining inner-cities that were competing with burgeoning suburbs. In contrast, China’s redevelopment has been propelled by emerging local elites using decentralized state power to pursue fast growth in rising real estate markets. Greater insights into urban redevelopment can be gleaned through this comparative analysis.</jats:p>",

In October 2001, a survey was sent to U.S. cities that (1) measures the extent to which actions are being taken relative to these policies and techniques and to local planning offices being involved in the taking of such actions and (2) identifies the principal impediments to the taking of action. Among the findings were that communities of all sizes and in all parts of the country are active in a wide range of policies and techniques, planning offices are playing an important leadership role with respect to the adoption of such policies and techniques, and impediments to such adoption are less related to politics and institutional capacity and more to motivation and knowledge. </jats:p>",

Besides of affordable good practice intents, there are two additional items making HSE management of such developments a challenging issue.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First is that during last years State regulation in the HSE issues demonstrates never yet seen severization of requirements, where some of them are much stronger that those in other countries. The second is that nowadays developments are participating by foreign companies, both as stakeholders and contractors. Newcomers entering Russian developments may become anxious about an evident gap between what they know as a common practice and what they are requested in this country.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper is mainly focused on emergency preparedness and oil spill response planning: (i) What is required by the State regulation and (ii) How the industry can comply with.</jats:p>",

Since then the marked migration losses of the new federal states (Länder) and the re-emergence of migrations from the cities to suburban areas have overlapped the continuous shifts of predominant migration linkages that also occur in the west. This article considers the question how internal migrations have developed more than a decade after the unification, which prominent patterns have emerged and in what way a transition from historic reversals towards a new normality has taken place.</jats:p>"

Yet, while there are no differences in market value shifts for the CEO change versus benchmark companies during the second and third years after CEO changes, asset reductions by new CEOs take place during their first and second years. The results suggest that executives looking for bargains on assets should target competitors with recent CEO changes, and new CEOs in their zeal to get clean slates should carefully liquidate “questionably productive” assets to prevent hostile takeovers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The following thought piece addresses the issue ‘what next’ by considering the effects of poststructural thought on the field. Specifically, I argue that poststructuralism has emerged in the field as a problem that a number of geographers have endeavoured to solve by devising new theoretical frameworks and innovative methodological principles, the purpose of which is to make social science ‘better’. In response I suggest that the problems posed by poststructuralism are fundamentally unanswerable and that they are meant to be recognised rather than resolved. While poststructuralism effectively reveals the limits of social science, it should not seduce us into thinking we can somehow do social science differently. This is because social science always involves doing some kind of metaphysics–that is, the practice of determining, delimiting, representing, and explaining how the world works. The goal of this paper is to discuss the relationship between metaphysics and deconstruction as an ontological condition that cannot be surmounted through study or thought. I conclude by suggesting that the goal of social science should not be to get around this relationship but rather to embrace it as a fundamental aspect of what we as geographers, social scientists, and human beings do. </jats:p>",

Based on the empirical findings, the data reveal that the majority of the respondent executives tend to follow a localized rather than a standardized advertising approach in marketing such services. Respondents also indicate that companies using such a localized advertising approach take cultural variables more seriously than do companies following a standardized approach. Here, however, respondents on either side of the standardized/localized debate concur. For example, there is virtual unanimity from respondents in terms of their perception that government regulations make it difficult to create and use universal campaigns, and that language diversity necessitates the use of local communication expertise in each market. Furthermore, and perhaps important in terms of the constant stress placed these days upon globalization, both groups seem unconvinced that advertisements can be universally understood, and that an advertising theme can be the same for all markets. Thus, this paper supports the notion that perceived differences in consumers' lifestyles do act as major obstacles to universal advertising campaigns.</jats:p>",

This article focuses on Romalia (a pseudonym used to protect the anonymity of the company), a large (£8 billion turnover) UK distribution service supplier. Between 1999 and 2002, Romalia implemented a key account management (KAM) strategy targeted at its top 50 UK corporate clients. A designated KAM unit was created, configured to a large extent as virtual KAM teams. This article offers empirical evidence of a large service supplier's relationship marketing strategy and the problems it encountered in its implementation. The purpose of this study will be to offer insights into Romalia's approach to B2B relationships and to locate the phenomenon in the extant literature. In particular, the literature on internal marketing and market orientation will be evaluated in the light of the evidence from this case study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research investigates the degree of emphasis put by the Australian manufacturing industry on marketing strategy, along with other organisational strategies such as research and development (R&amp;D), human resources, technology, operations at the functional level. The study found that the emphasis on marketing strategy had a third place after operations and R&amp;D strategy in the past few years. In terms of its effectiveness, marketing strategy has not been as effective as the operations strategy and the technology strategy. The research also investigates the relationship between marketing strategy and organisational performance. The results suggest that the increase in efforts for the development of new market segments/customers is found to be positively associated with the increase in sales growth in domestic and export markets. It is also found that market forecasting has a positive and significant relationship with the return on total assets while the development of new market segments/customers and market share analysis have a negative and significant relationship. The research extends further to investigate whether the emphasis on marketing strategy differs with contextual factors such as firm size, firm's generic strategy, type of market, firm's life cycle stage, etc. The findings suggest that relatively higher emphasis was placed on the marketing strategy by firms which are large, are involved in consumer goods industry, are involved in exports, have high domestic sales growth, and have adopted a differentiation strategy combined with a cost leadership strategy. In conducting this study, a mail survey was carried out to collect information from manufacturing firms across Australia, and 225 responses were received. This was followed by an on‐site interview of some of the senior managers of manufacturing firms in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fortified city of Valletta, founded in 1566 by the Knights of Malta, is one of the few Renaissance ideal cities to be built. Planned from the beginning and constructed on virgin ground, it follows a rigid gridiron scheme designed by the Italian architect Francesco Laparelli da Cortona (1521-1570) that is an exemplar of Neoplatonic planning principles of the age of humanism and constitutes a model of modern urban design. Although the founding and development of the city has been well investigated historically, the formal essence of its urban design has not yet been examined satisfactorily from an architectural perspective. While the executed plan has been interpreted until now as an imperfect materialization of one of the four known preparatory drawings by Laparelli, in this article I suggest the possibility that the town built is a further evolutionary step in a fully traceable design process based on a coherent system of trigonometric proportions. In addition to the physical evidence of the city's current digital terrain model, the method of design proposed here is largely supported not only by sixteenth-century architectural theory (as advanced by Albrecht Dürer, Sebastiano Serlio, and Pietro Cataneo) but also historically by a group of new Florentine towns founded in the late Middle Ages that exhibit the same compositional principles.</jats:p>",

This article examines the Forest Service's rationale for eliminating postdecisional appeals, provides an overview of accountability relationships, and explores the implications for democratic accountability if the proposed rule eliminating postdecisional appeals is adopted. Appeals have provided an important mechanism of accountability in forest planning. There are questions about whether the objection process will provide a comparable means of accountability. The change represents a shift away from traditional legal and hierarchical accountability relationships toward accountability based on public deliberation and scientific input in a collaborative planning process. The success of such a model depends on successfully institutionalizing collaborative planning throughout a large, decentralized organization.</jats:p>",

Important information must be presented clearly and cohesively to enable decision making under crisis conditions.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper describes a project in which an Emergency Response System (ERS) has been developed for the Uthmaniyah gas plant (UGP). The ERS is essentially made up of two applications: the SAFER Real‐Time application made by SAFER Systems of the United States and a customized Geographical Information System (GIS) application developed by the Saudi Aramco Information Technology group. The SAFER system provides the user with immediate plume graphics based on local topography, maps, real‐time weather, chemical release specifics, and gas sensors data. This information is fed to a scientific gas dispersion model to predict the movement and concentration of gas or liquid release. The GIS allows the effect of the plume on people and structures to be analyzed in detail. Combined together, the ERS provides a tool for modeling and monitoring an accidental release. It will improve emergency planning, decision making, and response within the UGPD.</jats:p><jats:p>The above information is shared with emergency responders such as the fire department, security, and medical personnel via the network. As a result, they would dispatch their resources via the safest route.

The aim of this paper is to help project managers to enhance their capability of dealing effectively with the formidable complexities inherent in this kind of project. For this purpose, we explore the potential of Organizational Cybernetics and Social Systems Theory in a relatively new area of application. We have developed a set of conceptual tools that are helpful in coping with dynamic complexity in change and development projects. These tools have in common an inherent logic deriving to a great extent from Stafford Beer's Viable System Model and the St Gall framework for systemic management. The application of the tools is illustrated by a state‐of‐the‐art case study from the realm of Technical Co‐operation – the revision of the Urban Master Plan for the City of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. However, the toolkit is in principle also applicable to any complex project of change or development.</jats:p>",

Demonstration projects also play an important role as an action area of the Federal Government. They provide the opportunity to develop and test innovative policy approaches of spatial planning in collaboration with local protagonists in the regions.

It discusses its encouraging results and consequences, and describes how it was the main motivation for the design of a second environment plan for the period (2002‐2005). The paper pays special attention to the curriculum greening experience of UPC: six years ago the university decided to start greening its entire range of courses, over a wide range of technical and scientific areas. The paper explains the most relevant projects, and attempts to evaluate their effectiveness in improving the environmental performance of the university.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The key concept of culture has recently been undergoing critical reassessment, and in some cases replacement, by cultural theorists in a number of fields. Some commentators have argued that the concept of culture is too elusive and all encompassing to be of use and that it can be politically dangerous. We will argue instead that the problem is not inherent in all concepts of culture, but in the specific political uses to which particular concepts of culture have been put. We think there is a need to rethink the concept of culture. In fact, cultural coherence in the face of heterogeneity and porous boundaries, complexity, and complicity across far-reaching networks are some of the most challenging and intriguing issues in cultural theory today. Thus we explore alternative conceptions of culture that might hold some promise for cultural geography. Our view is that no one conception holds the answer. Rather, cultural geographers need to develop a critically eclectic mix of culture theories and allow sufficient time for these to be empirically grounded. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we address the question of ‘what next after poststructuralism’ through a reassessment of area studies. In a narrative of our own involvement with place-oriented research and institutions, we examine the traditional position of area studies in geography and anthropology and its reevaluation by poststructuralist scholars in a number of disciplines. We argue that both prestructuralist and poststructuralist treatments of areas are oriented by a narrative of capitalist development; at the same time, we recognize that traditional area studies has a deep interest in noncapitalist economic practices and relations. It is therefore a resource for those of us who want to create a discourse of economic diversity as a contribution to a politics of economic innovation. The latter half of the paper presents an extended example of reading for economic difference drawn from fieldwork in the oil-palm sector in Papua New Guinea. We conclude with a ‘post-poststructuralist’ reflection on geographic field research. From our evolving perspective, the fieldwork practices that are the principal research methods of area studies constitute a relatively untheorized form of academic politics, creating differences in thought (and thus in the world) via new interpenetrations of concepts and ‘matter’. </jats:p>",

In this paper, and following the example of McHoul's consideration of the affinities between Foucault and Garfinkel, we explore these overlaps, paying particular attention to what Foucault, Garfinkel, Sacks, and others have to say about both ‘local rules' as opposed to ‘transcendent laws' and the prioritising of ‘surfaces’ over ‘depths’. In so doing a window is opened on the possibilities for an ‘ethnoarchaeological’ human geography inspired by both traditions, not as a definitive answer to the question ‘what next’ in the discipline but as another lens through which ongoing manoeuvres might be viewed. </jats:p>",

Many public administrators have integrated public participation into this planning process. This article examines the link between public participation and strategic planning. Sustainability requires local resources and strategies so public participation seems critical and essential. A case study approach explores links between local development activities and community strategic action plans laid several years earlier, and most importantly, determines the role of public participation in those connections. This paper attempts to answer a series of basic questions on the structure of strategic plans developed by communities. Do strategic plans facilitate community development? Does participatory strategic planning increase local development and sustainable activities in a community? </jats:p>",

Countries with a comparatively positive trend face others with a strong decline of the number of inhabitants. On the regional level fertility and mortality levels differ substantially as well. Using the examples of France and Italy, the paper examines the spatial patterns of the decline of birth rates during the second demographic transformation as well as the rise of life expectancy since the 1970...s. In both countries a regional convergence of the total fertility rate (TFR) can be observed with a simultaneous divergence of selected indicators of generative behaviour. In addition, a converging trend may be detected for life expectancy. However, regions with migration gains register values rather above the average compared to those with migration losses. In regions where the decline of the birth rate began early, the future will bring strong phenomena of over-ageing. Altogether demographic conditions in the regions will differ increasingly.</jats:p>"

In taking the case of a nascent ‘nonrepresentational geography’ some concerns are raised about the seeming ennui with representation as a research issue and as a practical and political resource. Far from insisting that ‘old’ intellectual fashions are better than new ones, we simply caution against travelling forward minus some important baggage. By way of seven theses, we finesse critical geography's engagement with representation and argue that any nonrepresentational ‘alternative’ should not be seen as jettisoning the substantial power of representational acts. </jats:p>",

The aim of this paper was to assess whether evidence of effectiveness for brief interventions for cessation and nicotine patches from studies conducted in other populations was likely to be transferable to Aboriginal people in the NT. This paper involved assessment of systematic reviews of evidence for the use of brief interventions for smoking cessation and the use of nicotine replacement therapy, when planning two such interventions for delivery to Aboriginal people. Emerging themes are discussed. There were many factors which were likely to mean that these brief advice on cessation and the use of nicotine patches were likely to be less effective when implemented in Aboriginal communities. The planned interventions were delivered in primary care, and were of low intensity. Few studies included in systematic reviews were set in the developing world or in minority populations. Many features of the context for delivery, such as the normality of the use of tobacco among Aboriginal people, the low socio‐economic status of this population and cultural issues, may have meant that these interventions were likely to be less effective when delivered in this setting. Further research is required to assess effectiveness of tobacco interventions in this population, as evidence from systematic reviews in other populations may not be directly transferable to Aboriginal people</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Five discussion groups (one with Latino older adults, two with African-American older adults, one with White older adults, and one with Chinese-American older adults) were conducted. Semi-structured guiding questions were used with all groups. The questions centered on three major areas: perceptions of older adults and HIV and AIDS, use of condoms for HIV and AIDS prevention, and HIV prevention programs for older adults. The group sessions were approximately 1 hour, were recorded on tape, and were transcribed. The sessions were conducted in the languages of the target population. Because the project was a needs assessment for program development, the number of participants in each cultural discussion group was small, and the nurse group leaders were not experienced in focus group methodology themes and generalizations cannot be made. However, specific findings from the group sessions and recommendations for HIV prevention are presented for further exploration.</jats:p>",

The argument is based in theories of rent, with specific attention to how the constructed scarcity of organic food creates rents that are competed away or appropriated. The author also discusses how organic regulations may manifest in monopoly ground rents, especially given the attention paid to land in organic certification. Insofar as these rents pass through to land values, they contribute to a broader pattern of land valuation that pushes farmers to grow the most valuable crops in the most productive ways—an imperative that is not necessarily conducive to organic farming as it is generally envisioned. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic &amp; Health Survey show that of the married female adolescents exposed to the risk of pregnancy and not using any family planning method, more than one-fourth had an unmet need for contraception. The demand for contraception at a young age, if catered to, can not only significantly reduce fertility and diminish the reproductive health burdens of mothers over their life span, it can also contribute to child health. Husband's approval, and desire for a large family were among the factors found to impede contraceptive use. Appropriate IEC strategies are needed to promote the value of the small family and dispel the religious misinterpretation of birth control, so as to enhance the adolescent's negotiating strength for asserting her reproductive rights. There is a need also to take cognisance of the considerable demand for spacing, which is believed to be neglected by the family planning programme. Another salient issue is that of the limited mobility of women outside the home which, in a traditional country like Bangladesh, makes it difficult for them to get planning information on their own initiative. Hence the need for a policy reorientation in favour of home-based services </jats:p>",

Since 2002, ChevronTexaco has compiled comprehensive annual emissions inventories of its worldwide operations and interests using the SANGEA™ system. At the same time, ChevronTexaco made a public commitment to integrate greenhouse gas emissions management into its business planning processes. This paper describes ChevronTexaco's process and tools for integrating greenhouse gas emissions management into the planning and review of new projects. The tools include a screening tool, to quickly and with minimal data estimate the potential impact of greenhouse gas emissions on a project's economics, and the more rigorous ChevronTexaco Projector, for detailed greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emission projections. The tools also include a mitigation options planning tool and a tool for evaluating the greenhouse gas implications of potential mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. Finally, a capital projects GHG evaluation flowchart provides guidance regarding when each tool should be applied, with the recommendations made appropriate according to the potential significance of greenhouse gas concerns for the specific project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The tools and flowchart are innovative applications in greenhouse gas emissions management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the author examines, through a case study of a hospital merger in Boston, MA, the ways in which a locally scaled union strategy can shape privatization. She first examines recent economic changes in the US hospital industry, which have resulted in a record number of mergers, closures, and conversions. A case study of the merger between a public hospital, Boston City Hospital, and a private hospital, Boston University Hospital, into the private, nonprofit, Boston Medical Center is presented to demonstrate the ways in which unions can participate in setting the terms of such mergers. The strategy of one labor union local in particular, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 285, is examined in regard to protecting both the provision of public healthcare and the conditions of employment during and after the process of privatization. By utilizing a local strategy and waging a highly public campaign, leaders of SEIU Local 285 were able to build coalitions with other labor unions and public healthcare advocates and played an instrumental role in setting the terms of the merger. As a result, the final merger agreement contained significant protection for quality public healthcare and labor practices favorable for workers. Unions that previously represented public sector workers now represent private sector workers, and wages for all employees moved upward as part of the agreement. In addition, the new private sector entity was charged with what had formerly been a public sector mission. In effect, although the public hospital was ultimately privatized, the private sector was restructured by local level, public sector union activism. </jats:p>",

Two planning objectives of the model are to maximise the operator's total passenger revenue and to minimise the passenger's total discomfort level. For a given set of travel demand, train capacity, and train stop‐schedules, the model is solved by fuzzy mathematical programming to generate a best‐compromise train seat allocation plan. The plan determines how many reserved and non‐reserved seats are to be allocated at each origin station for all subsequent destination stations on each train run operated within a specified operating period. An empirical study on the to‐be‐built Taiwan's high‐speed rail system is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The model can be used for any setting of travel demand and stop‐schedules with various train seating capacities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rural peripheral areas in East Germany are often perceived as difficult regional cases for revitalisation; however, the problems in these regions are relatively neglected in comparison to the population decline or the degradation of accommodation in urban areas. In the context of regional development the aspects of the extent and motivation of elderly migrants into these areas are also marginalized. Although the current debates on the demographical change encompass rural areas as well the re-interpretation of the post-productivist life phase of the elderly and their impact on those areas deserves more attention. The paper presents the results from an enquiry amongst elderly migrants into the rural areas of Brandenburg and assesses their “potential” for rural development. Finally, the results from the enquiry lead to the consideration of necessary changes and improvements for spatial planning specifically aimed at the needs of the elderly.</jats:p>"

Using investigations of the efficacy of problem‐based learning as background, the article represents an attempt to guide new researchers through the process of generating and refining scientific research questions, identifying appropriate outcome measures, and selecting or adapting the optimal research design for the questions to be addressed.

These forecasts are generally reported to executive and legislative leaders as point estimates, with no acknowledgment of their corresponding risk and uncertainty. The revenue semaphores proposed in this article outline procedures by which revenue uncertainty directly influences the planning process. The goal is not to make forecasts more accurate, but to make discussions of budget and revenue alternatives more comprehensive. Explicitly incorporating risk and uncertainty measures into the budgeting process increases the degree of real‐time budgeting and reduces some adverse effects of budget revisions after the fiscal year begins. The discussion occurs in the context of budget control, management, and policy making.</jats:p>",

The resulting grown obstacles are called the Configuration Space (Cspace) obstacles. The find-path problem is then transformed into that \nof finding a collision free path for a point robot among the Cspace obstacles. However, the research experiences obtained so far have shown that the calculation of the Cspace obstacles \nis very hard work when the following situations occur: 1. both the robot and obstacles are not polygons and 2. the robot is allowed to rotate. This situation is even worse when the robot and obstacles are three dimensional (3D) objects with various shapes. Obviously a direct path planning approach without the calculation of the Cspace obstacles is strongly needed. This paper presents such a new real-time robot path planning approach which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one in the robotic community. The fundamental ideas are the utilization of inequality and optimization technique. Simulation results have been presented to show its merits.</jats:p>",

Taking into account a variety of engineering strategies to reduce urban water consumption, this research discusses the use of a tool for developing a master plan for site‐specific implementation. The tool links the characteristics of urban areas (engineering, economic and social) with the applicability of particular water‐demand management strategies within a fuzzy logic framework, to provide spatially‐sensitive decision support ‐ both at a strategic and an application level. The initial results, under various user‐defined scenarios, are presented and discussed. It is argued that decision‐support tools are beneficial in assisting the water industry to move towards a more pro‐active approach to urban water management, similar to the approach which has already been adopted by the Telecommunication and Energy sector.</jats:p>",

Descriptive analysis and logistic regression are used to explore the data. Previous DHS surveys have used dress and language to classify ethnic groups. In this paper, an alternative approach based on self-identification is adopted. The results reveal significant differences in contraceptive behaviour among different ethnic groups within the same town and region. The results show that self-identified Ladino women who represented the minority of the population had contraceptive behaviour similar to their counterparts elsewhere in Latin America. The extremely low levels of contraceptive use among indigenous women from the <jats:italic>aldeas</jats:italic> suggest that the corresponding DHS figures in this region are probably overestimated.</jats:p>",

Use of computational models of judgment processes and outcomes causes knowledge to be available for use and analysis. We present a comprehensive and integrated computational model of the difficult and knowledge-intensive judgments needed for successful audit planning. The model concludes on a client's going-concern status, applicable levels of inherent, control, and planned detection risk, and appropriate levels of statement- and account-level materiality. Most importantly, the model validly identifies the cause of significant fluctuations given causal hypotheses. The context is the sales and collection cycle of a manufacturing client. The model consistently replicates causal hypothesis judgments generated by the modeled auditor who exhibits considerable judgment expertise, i.e., his judgments typically coincide with actual causes. Concerning judgment expertise, the model reveals numerous linkages among judgments, subtle interdependencies in cue importance across judgments, and new findings concerning cue diagnosticity.</jats:p>",

To support a successful implementation, efforts have been made to develop tools and methods for the integration of SEA into strategic transportation planning. These efforts concern, for example, the application of SEA in corridor development and long‐term transportation planning. The practical experiences of SEA in strategic transportation planning have been influenced by the ambiguity of the scope and structure of SEA. In this paper the process of implementing the SEA in Swedish transportation planning will be reviewed. The review relates to political ambitions and practice, and highlights the methodological development of SEA applications in the Swedish transport sector.

We have proposed an optimal viewpoint planning [9] for the purpose of model generation by merging images acquired from multiple viewpoints on a sphere that encircles object. This method uses a discretized approximate sphere which involves problems of sphere tessellation and of sphere representation. One must consider that the scanned surface of an object is projected onto a sphere, and that the computational cost increases directly with the number of images. However, there are no appropriate sphere representation methods available. This paper proposes a new representation method based on a 2D array, and develops a new viewpoint planning algorithm. The proposed system is verified by algorithmic analysis and experiments using a real modeling system. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Specifically, we investigate whether competitive bidding is associated with higher planned engagement effort and lower fees relative to noncompetitive bidding, and whether competitive bidding is associated with increased sensitivity of effort and fees to cost drivers and the components of service production. There is little available evidence regarding the effects of competitive versus noncompetitive bidding in the current market, and none that focuses on both quality and pricing effects associated with competitive bidding across a broad array of clients. We address these issues using data from a sample of one firm's evaluations of prospective clients, made during 1997‐98. During that period, about half of the firm's bids were competitive and half were noncompetitive, providing a unique opportunity to study how the bidding environment affects engagement planning and pricing. Our findings reveal that competitive bidding is associated with higher planned engagement effort and lower fees. In addition, we find that in competitive bidding situations there are stronger associations between cost drivers and planned engagement effort, and between the components of service production and fees.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This research study is the third in a series of surveys exploring the incidence of simultaneous media usage among a national sample of US consumers. The research is based on 12,322 respondents who were sampled via an online network. The findings show that simultaneous media usage, ie multiple exposures to various media forms at a single point in time for the same media consumer, occurs in and among a substantial portion of the US media population. The existence of simultaneous media exposures, created by multi‐tasking consumers, is a fact in today's media marketplace. The existence of simultaneous media exposures undermines most current media measurement systems as they are defined as isolated environments. Thus, the challenge of this paper is for media management to rethink how media evaluations should be rethought for the 21st century. Copyright © 2004 Henry Stewart Publications Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past twenty years the marketing of African fresh vegetables in the United Kingdom has become dominated by large retailers that have adopted competitive strategies based on quality, year-round supply, and product differentiation. This has led to a dramatic change in marketing channels, from wholesale markets to tightly knit supply chains. Global value chain analysis is used to explain why the various stages of production and marketing have become much more closely integrated and to consider the likely outcome of a further round of restructuring occurring at the present time. Although the current trends may lead to a changing role for importers, the tendency towards the concentration of production and processing in Africa in the hands of a few large firms is likely to continue. </jats:p>",

Researchers agree planning is a critical part of creating any new venture. Many researchers assess planning by whether a small firm has a written business plan. Unfortunately, efforts empirically to validate this relationship have been inconclusive. This article proposes that researchers should assess business plans both on the quality of the plan (and the planning process that produced it), and on the quality of the underlying business opportunity. Failure to account for both aspects of a business plan amounts to omitted variable bias, frustrating attempts to accurately estimate the true relationship.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author presents case studies that reveal persistent variation in the logistics operations of firms importing new automobiles to the USA from 1980 to 1999. He argues that, in addition to the recognized differences such as national origin, product mix, and production organization, the strategic organization of logistics itself constitutes a basis for persistent variation. Firms operating at a global scale face heightened uncertainties in matching supply and demand and hence have a heightened requirement for flexibility. This is theorized in this paper as the ability to collect and transmit information, both codified and tacit, within and across various spatial scales. However, these informational goals imply very different organizational structures that are in tension. In ideal-type terms, firm organizational structures vary in the degree to which they are localized—referring to the intra-regional collection of information through horizontal relationships between the firm and external actors—or globalized—referring to the interregional transmission of information between portions of the firm. Persistent variation is the most likely outcome as firms constantly seek to reorganize their logistics operations in historically contingent, experimental, and contested ways. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), it is important that the inverse planning process yields the most appropriate dose distribution for the patient and that the delivered dose then corresponds to the planned dose. This paper presents methods by which the inverse planning and delivery of segmental (step‐and‐shoot) IMRT can be verified, and gives results for a typical treatment planning system (Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> v6.2b, Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA). Inverse planning was assessed by observing the reduction in objective function as fields were successively added to three‐field prostate, esophagus, and thyroid plans. The ability of the treatment planning system to calculate dose for a segmented field was examined by creating a stepped field with five successively narrowing segments. The complete planning process was then investigated by using two orthogonal IMRT fields to create a homogeneous dose distribution in a cubic water phantom. Finally, a clinical situation was simulated by creating a five‐field segmental IMRT plan for a lung target in an anthropomorphic phantom. A conformal plan was also compared for context. Addition of fields to inverse plans generally resulted in a reduction of objective function, indicating consistency of inverse planning solutions. Planned dose for fields with stepped intensity agreed with ionization chamber measurements to within 5%. For orthogonal fields, planned dose distributions agreed well with dose measured using film and agreed with ionization chamber measurements to within 3%. For the anthropomorphic phantom, the standard deviation of difference between planned and measured dose was 4%. Although no consensus has yet been reached on what constitutes an acceptable IMRT plan, these results indicate that step‐and‐shoot IMRT can be planned and delivered using the system described with comparable accuracy to a standard conformal treatment.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.53.Dq, 87.53.Kn, 87.53.Mr, 87.53.Tf, 87.53.Xd</jats:p>",

Stem cell behavior is ultimately an expression of developmental principles, an alluring vestige from the more plastic and generative stages of organogenesis. In attempting to apply stem cell biology therapeutically, it is instructive always to bear in mind what role the stem cell plays in <jats:italic>development</jats:italic> and to what cues it was “designed” to respond in trying to understand the “logic” behind its behavior (both what investigators want to see and what investigators do not want to see). Furthermore, in transplantation paradigms, the interaction between engrafted NSCs and recipient host is a dynamic, complex, ongoing reciprocal interaction where both entities are constantly in flux. In this review, we propose a “roadmap” to the clinic, with a particular emphasis on flagging the “potholes” and “speed bumps” through which we must navigate. Despite the admonitions to be circumspect, we also suggest disease processes that may be within the grasp of proven stem cell properties and might be approachable in the relatively near future. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that applicator‐guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (AGIMRT) has the potential to deliver highly conformal dose distributions to cervical tumors, representing improvement over distributions obtained with intracavitary brachytherapy. A commercial three‐dimensional (3‐D) treatment planning system was used to create plans for ten cervical cancer patients treated at our institution. Dose distributions of conventionally designed high dose rate (HDR) plans were compared against those of AGIMRT. Tumor delineation was based on a previously published binary threshold technique, using image intensity on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. AGIMRT treatment schedules were designed using two fraction sizes: 6.5 Gy, to directly reproduce the HDR fractionation, and 1.8 Gy, to simulate traditional external beam fractionation. The average minimum tumor dose was significantly greater for the AGIMRT dose distributions than for the HDR distributions (64.2 Gy vs 33.6 Gy; <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp5678-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp5678:mp5678-math-0001\" /> The mean percent tumor volume at the prescription dose was higher for the AGIMRT plans (90.0% vs 58.2%; <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp5678-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp5678:mp5678-math-0002\" /> Using AGIMRT, the mean percent volume at the tolerance limit was decreased for the bladder (6.1% vs 16.6%; <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp5678-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp5678:mp5678-math-0003\" /> but increased for the rectum (4.1% vs 2.2%; <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp5678-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp5678:mp5678-math-0004\" /> Our study suggests that there may be conceptual and dosimetric advantages to replacing HDR with AGIMRT for patients with large‐volume cervical tumors.

Two key stakeholders in public policy making are economic experts that can predict the economic consequences of policy decisions, and elected policy-makers who are accountable to the citizens for the outcomes of these decisions. A two-step model combining a Decision Support System and a Delphi type approach is proposed. To test the methodology, the proposed approach was applied to revenue planning in a mid-sized city.</jats:p>",

Monthly averages of the longshore (meridional) wind component at four coastal stations of the Institute for Meteorology were computed and subject to linear regression analysis. Several comparisons were made among stations until a final regression model was reached. The resulting residuals were checked for the presence of red noise, and pairwise correlation coefficients were estimated for residuals of different stations. To complement this study, monthly sea‐surface temperature averages were computed for six regions off west Portugal and subject to a similar procedure. In both analyses, it was concluded that the Portuguese upwelling regime has weakened since the 1940s. The waning of the northerly, upwelling‐favourable winds was significant throughout the traditional upwelling season (April–September). Sea‐surface temperature showed a steady year‐round increase from 1941 onwards, in both offshore (+0.002°C/year) and coastal (+0.010°C/year) regions.
