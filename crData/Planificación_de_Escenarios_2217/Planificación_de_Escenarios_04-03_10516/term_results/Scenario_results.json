      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A method of computing scenario for knowledge including preferentially ordered hypotheses is proposed. Minimum conflict sets are found for competing hypothesis sets, and acceptable hypothesis sets are then found by applying preference relation to the minimum conflict sets; the disjunction of all elements of the acceptable hypothesis set thus obtained can be added to the fact set without contradiction. A fact set combined with all such disjunctions is considered a scenario, and is used for reasoning. Basically, the acceptability of hypothesis subsets for their minimal conflict sets is to be checked in order to obtain a scenario, which requires combinatorial calculations. A method is proposed to simplify such calculations; namely, acceptability is first checked for the single‐element hypothesis sets, and then set operations are employed to check the acceptability of an arbitrary hypothesis set. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The survey compares the care of nursing in the hospital scenario between the perspectives of beginners and veteran nurses, being its objectives: to identify the distinctive characteristics of this care for these professionals and to analyze the implications of these characteristics for the knowledge and practice of nurses who work in the hospital scenario. From the “Nightingalean’s” principles associated to the contemporary perspectives on the care in nursing, the study of the qualitative nature was subsidized by quantitative techniques for the treatment, classification and categorization of the individual information according to the method of content associations and as collective results it has emerged four dimensions of the caring, namely: professional, knowledge, affection and practice, which interrelate in the professional working of the study’s subjects. It is concluded that during the professional development of beginners and veteran nurses there are characteristics related to the care in nursing that are kept during the graduation and the professional practice. Other characteristics suffer a movement of transformation since the beginning of the professional work, configuring a process that is kept during the practice within the hospital scenario. Thus, the knowledge and the practice of these  (men and women) nurses presented a dynamic of accommodation that although preserves the “Nightingalean’s” principles of the profession, involves other characteristics that are determined by the institutions and are incorporated during the professional practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Field monitoring and scenario‐based modelling were used to assess exposure of small ditches in the UK to the herbicide sulfosulfuron following transport via field drains. A site in central England on a high pH, clay soil was treated with sulfosulfuron, and concentrations were monitored in the single drain outfall and in the receiving ditch 1 km downstream. Drainflow in the nine months following application totalled 283 mm. Pesticide lost in the first 12.5 mm of flow was 99% of the total loading to drains (0.5% of applied). Significant dilution was observed in the receiving ditch and quantifiable residues were only detected in one sample (0.06 µg litre<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The MACRO model was evaluated against the field data with minimal calibration. The parameterisation over‐estimated the importance of macropore flow at the site. As a consequence, the maximum concentration in drainflow (2.3 µg litre<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and the total loading to drains (0.76 g) were over‐estimated by factors of 2.4 and 5, respectively. MACRO was then used to simulate long‐term fate of the herbicide for each of 20 environmental scenarios. Resulting estimates for concentrations of sulfosulfuron in a receiving ditch were weighted according to the prevalence of each scenario to produce a probability distribution of daily exposure.
