Along the way we have played freely with the careers and life chances of individuals with and without their knowledge or consent. In view of this, there would hardly seem to be any ground for persisting in the belief that reasonable men abroad will continue to look to us for support in rationally pursuing their own political advancement. If there is any reason for believing that we have not morally written ourselves out of a share in these tasks, it rests primarily on the realism, forebearance, and enduring optimism of men abroad who care profoundly about the quality of future political life in their own nations. Having repeatedly experienced political regressions of their own, they may view our own present difficulties with some magnanimity and a differentiating sense of the complex internal forces that have produced them. The Americans to whom these remarks are addressed are thus Americans in the large sense of men of the Americas, and particularly those who continue to hold to the hope that research based social science knowledge can prove a major resource in the achievement of useful human purposes in this part of the world. However, because given present circumstances the action of U.S. social scientists may yet have the capacity to decisively transform and revitalize the prospects for such work rather than continue to disfigure and compromise them, much of this appeal is directed to Americans in this second more restricted sense.</jats:p>"
