The model performs all the arithmetic calculations involved performs all the arithmetic calculations involved in consolidating basic input data to furnish consolidated cash flow, earnings, earnings per share, capital requirements, debt and per share, capital requirements, debt and interest schedules as well as certain operating data for a six year period. It permits easy insertion of new variables, which may represent a proposed acquisition or simply an alternate method of operating, and quickly determines the net effect of the variables.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As one Husky executive put it, \"Planning is making things happen.\" And, around Husky this concept of planning has been taken very seriously since 1961 when the first formal written plan was prepared. It consisted of a dozen pages of charts and other data in summarized form. Today's plan contains over 60 tables, covering all major financial and operating aspects of each department as well as consolidated totals. The Planning and Economics Department, who is Planning and Economics Department, who is responsible for developing plans, is made up of a Manager, who has direct access to the President, one Planning Coordinator, who President, one Planning Coordinator, who assembles and formulates various data into the Long Range Plan model, and a Coordinator of Operations Research, who applies computer techniques to solve complex planning and economic problems. Because of planning and economic problems. Because of computer usage, the equivalent of one-half manpower unit is devoted to the mechanics of plan preparation at the corporate level. plan preparation at the corporate level. Planning in Husky consists of a budget year plus five years of the long range plan. This process consists of three major activities:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Top management defines the overallgoals and objectives of the company, including earnings and earnings pershare growth.</jats:p>",
