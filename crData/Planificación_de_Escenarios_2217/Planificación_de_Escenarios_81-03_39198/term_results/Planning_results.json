In general, such planning should consider all field development options rather than concentrate on certain phases while ignoring others that may be equally important.

This enables a wide range of strategies to be compared in an efficient and consistent manner.

The training will emphasize hands-on deployment of boom under various weather and sea conditions and in various natural environments. The training course will be based at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, will last for 3.5 days and will accommodate 12 to 15 students at each 3.5-day session.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Phase III, which will not be realized until contingency plans are printed and local personnel trained, involves the purchase of oil spill containment equipment for local use. Although a definite funding source has yet to be identified, legislation establishing a minimal per-barrel coastal oil transfer tax has been filed and will be considered by the state legislature in the near future.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Massachusetts Oil Spill Contingency Planning Program is currently being implemented in Dukes, Nantucket, and Barnstable Counties.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The 1970s have ushered in a new phase in approaches to language planning; the preference for a less provocative term such as <jats:italic>language policy</jats:italic> is indicative of this. There is now a decline in the use of terms such as <jats:italic>language planning</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>language engineering</jats:italic>: this is as it should be. For almost tow decades, <jats:italic>language planning</jats:italic> was presented as a cure-all for culturally and lingustically pluralistic societies in the developing Asian, African, and other non-Western countries. The term was overused, and its applications exaggerated. But this enthusiasm was not shared by all; serious practitioners were conscious of the limitations of the claims and the complexities of the task. This changed attitude has naturally contributed to a reassessment and re-evaluation of these earlier claims. There is now a much better understanding of the linguistic, political, sociological, and attitudinal constraints on <jats:italic>language policy</jats:italic> formation. The availability of greater cross-linguistic empirical data makes comparative observations more meaningful. As a consequence, the term <jats:italic>language planning</jats:italic> is now used with caution, with restricted generalization, and with an appreciation of the complexity of each situation. It has rightly been recognized that the task is more complex than linguists can handle within the traditionally conceived boundaries of their discipline, for example, in the work of the venerable Einar Haugen, or more recently, in the work of Charles Ferguson, Joshua Fishman, and others.</jats:p>",

The concept of a Nordic balance is central to security-political planning in the Nordic countries.

The Nordic balance conception, the author argues, may thus become illusory and even dangerous. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally environmental scanning for purposes of business planning was done in a compartementalized way in the sense that each influence was studied under the assumption that all other influences would remain constant. In a dynamic society where environmental change takes place at an accelerated pace, a total (integrated or holistic) approach to environmental scanning as the basis for business planning becomes necessary. This need will be demonstrated by way of examples in this paper in a twofold way. First, that the accelerated pace of change in the environmental influences is such that their implications for business planning can change even in the short run. Secondly, that the resultant cross impact of these changes invalidates the continuation of the trend-line approach as far as the result of the environmental influences on business planning is concerned.Tradisioneel was omgewingsverkenning as basis vir besigheidsbeplanning gekompartementaliseerd gedoen deurdat elke invloed bestudeer is onder die aanname dat alle ander invloede as konstantes beskou kan word. In 'n dinamiese gemeenskap waarin die pas van omgewingsveranderinge almeer versnel, is 'n totale (geintegreerde of holistiese) benadering in die verband essensieel as basis vir besigheidsbeplanning. Hierdie behoefte word op tweerlei wyse met behulp van voorbeelde in hierdie artikel geillustreer. Eerstens, dat die versnelde tempo van verandering in omgewingsinvloede sodanig is dat dit selfs oor die kort termyn veranderde implikasies vir besigheidsbeplanning kan he. Tweedens, dat die gevolglike kruisimpak tussen omgewingsinvloede in die proses van verandering se invloed op beplanning selde as 'n voortsetting van die historiese neigingslyn geneem kan word.</jats:p>"

My earliest memory of something being done was in 1959 when Professor (now Sir) Denis Hill, as a member of the Medical Research Council, wrote a report making the recommendation that the Council should set up research units, and the universities should establish more academic departments in medical schools. The reasons for these recommendations were fairly obvious. Unless established posts are available one cannot expect to recruit potential research workers to the field. The proposition accepted that even if the perfect head of department was not initially available, the next generation would have the right experience. Professor Hill's recommendations were, I think, very largely implemented. Between 1957 and 1962 the Medical Research Council set up five new units and one new research group. Only two of these units still exist but others have been established since. A number of university departments were also created.</jats:p>",

Our interest in such problems grew out of management issues confronting an injection molding manufacturer of plastic pipes and fittings for the building and chemical industries, but similar problems abound in the manufacture of many other cast, extruded, molded, pressed, or stamped products. We describe the development and successful application of a planning model and an associated computational approach for this class of problems. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program. Lagrangean relaxation is applied so as to exploit the availability of highly efficient techniques for minimum cost network flow problems and for single-item dynamic lot-sizing type problems. For the practical application at hand, provably good solutions are routinely being obtained in modest computing time to problems far beyond the capabilities of available mathematical programming systems. </jats:p>",

Samples of migration moves associated with separate housing submarkets, identified on the basis of tenure/dwelling type criteria, are tested for sectoral, directional, and distance biases. Mean movement distances are computed to measure distance bias, and sectoral and directional biases are assessed by two move-angle models: (1) a uniform vacancy model, and (2) a weighted vacancy model which controls for the effects of a vacancy surface on migration patterns. In general, the results suggest that support for Adams's propositions is limited to moves associated with submarkets either in the private or in the public housing sectors characterized by relatively high levels of tenure security. It is concluded that locational preferences usually assume a low priority in migration decisionmaking when households are only temporarily committed to their current dwellings. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem of validating a given unidimensional scale (that is, an ordering of a set of objects along a single dimension) is discussed in terms of a few simple properties of the data used to obtain the scale. Based on a set of asymmetric proximity values as raw data, a distinction between analyzing absolute-value information or sign information is presented that leads to a formal test of whether a given scale is being reliably represented. In short, a scale is generated from absolute-value information, but validated through sign information. A numerical example which deals with the perception of homicide rate over fifteen of the largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas is included as an illustration of the general methodological discussion. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The preparation and execution of transportation projects in Cairo involves the participa¬tion of several local and national agencies, each with its own perspectives on the problems and preferences among projects. Together this participation creates a \"slate\" of projects, a set of projects which by mutual agreement will be executed in the near future. This form of agreeing on project selection has significant strengths in that, for example, it produces a program which has the active support of all the agencies in the transportation sector. One the other hand, it means the detailed programming must be handled in a special way. In the absence of a central rationale for project selection, comparative evaluation between projects has a limited role, and implementation must always include several projects simultaneously to keep the interests of concerned agencies in balance. But one must remember: the slate is a plan, and for all its lack of scientific refinement, a robust, realistic plan.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">La préparation et l'exécution des projets de transport au Caire réunissent la participation de plusieurs services à l'échelon local et national, chacun avec ses propres perspectives sur les problèmes, et ses préférences parmi les projets. De cette participation collective résulte une liste d'accords mutuels, un ensemble de projets qui doivent être exécutés. Cette forme d'accord sur le choix des projets a une portée significative en ce que, par exemple, elle établit un programme qui joint le support actif des services principaux de secteur des transports. D'autre part, elle signifie que la programmation détaillée doit être effectuée de manière spécifique. En l'absence d'une rationalité centrale pour le choix des projets, l'évaluation comparative de ceux-ci a seulement un rôle limité et la mise en œuvre proprement dite doit toujours inclure plusieurs projets simultanément afin de conserver l'équilibre entre les intérêts des services concernés. Mais il faut rappeler que la liste d'accords mutuels constitue un plan qui, malgré son manque de raffinement scientifique, n'en est pas moins solide et réaliste.</jats:p>"

Inhomogeneity corrections are applied using the power law TAR method at low energies and the TAR ratio method at high energies. Beam data are generated on the central axis and at off‐axis locations coplanar with each CT scan, and isodose distributions are displayed on any transverse, coronal or sagittal plane.
