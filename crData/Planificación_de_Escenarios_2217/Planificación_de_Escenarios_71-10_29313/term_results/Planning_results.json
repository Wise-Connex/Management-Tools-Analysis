This Chilean medical journal is published in Spanish and is relatively inaccessible in Europe. In view of the interest and importance of the attitude of the male to family planning, especially perhaps of the South American male, it seemed desirable to bring Dr Hall's findings to the attention of a wider audience. The paper which follows is a revised version of the original English text from which the Spanish translation was prepared. I am much obliged to Dr Hall for her cooperation.</jats:p><jats:p>A survey of 584 men in Santiago and 217 men in an adjacent rural area showed that:</jats:p><jats:p>(1) Men were favourable to family planning, both in their own personal relationships and for other adults.

The family planning programme, therefore, could provide information to adolescents at a time when attitudes toward sex are developing.</jats:p><jats:p>(3) There was wide agreement that family planning education be discussed in schools ‘in accordance with the age of the children.’ There is thus an opportunity for the schools to help children develop a system of values within the framework of widely available effective contraception.</jats:p>",

A detailed geologic and engineering analysis of the reservoir which has played an important role in the development of storage is also presented. presented. The reservoir in this study is the Midland gas field which is located in Muhlenberg County, Ky. on the southeast flank of the Illinois basin. The field, discovered in Oct., 1962, was converted to a gas storage field on Jan. 1, 1970. It has the potential of being one of the largest gas storage reservoirs in the country and is ideally situated for effective market requirements. The field is approximately 10 miles long and 1-1/2 miles wide, and originally contained 123.6 Bcf of native gas. At the time it was converted to gas storage, 72 Bcf had been produced. The balance was retained for a storage cushion volume.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The Midland gas field produces from the Bethel sandstone of the Lower Chester section of Mississippian age.

This paper concerns the intermediate‐run problem. Crop growth is simulated with a simple crop growth model over a number of years on a large acreage supplied with water from a reservoir subject to stochastic inflows; the demand for water by the crop also being stochastic. Irrigation decision rules at each of a number of decision points in time are taken from the output of a simulation‐dynamic programing model used to solve the short‐run problem. The approach used allows for the abandonment for the rest of the season of portions of the area initially irrigated but does not allow for temporary abandonment, and reinstatement during the season, which is a limitation. The results show the best irrigated acreage to plant to be an approximately linear function of the reservoir contents at the beginning of the season. The function is found to be highly sensitive to changes in the profitability of the best dryland alternative enterprise. The cost of planting suboptimal acreages is found to be high.</jats:p>",

This paper describes a planning design, an outline of procedures that will prepare a criminal justice system to deter mine what actions to undertake and how to evaluate the impact of such actions. This design requires a very broad conception of the criminal justice system and a conception of impact far broader than such notions as crime rates or recidivism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT. Evaluation of lakes as they are related to groundwater flow systems is of special concern prior to efficient development and planning operations. Both naturally occurring and artificially created lakes are being developed rapidly as recreational and residential areas. Simultaneously, field verification of theoretical groundwater flow system behavior has progressed to the point where hydrogeologists trained to understand basic concepts of flow‐system analysis can begin to broaden their research and service base, and to work closer with planners, developers, and engineers. It is suggested that particular efforts be directed toward a greater evaluation of physical, chemical, and biological aspects of potentially developable lake sites to aid in selecting use patterns in accord with these factors. Many lake developments are not in harmony with the physical environment. The resulting misuse of resources is often expressed as accelerated eutrophication of lakes, or by quality degradation of shallow groundwater flow systems contiguous to them. Lakes can no longer be considered as separate entities. Methodology for investigating the interchange of surface and near‐surface water is adequate however, the application of known interchange relationships is inadequate.</jats:p><jats:p>.</jats:p>",
