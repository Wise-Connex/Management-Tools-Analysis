However, the market is as tough as it is large, for retailing is a mature business with moderate growth. Although the initial investment required to enter the market is relatively small, competition is stiff. There are over 300,000 stores selling GAF merchandise (General merchandise, Apparel, and Furniture/home furnishings) of which 49,000 outlets are general merchandise retailers. Competitive pricing is intense, and as a result, selling prices tend to rise more slowly than the rate of inflation. Since 1970 the prices of GAF merchandise have risen at a rate from half to three‐fourths the rate of increase of the Consumer Products Index (CPI). Costs, on the other hand, tend to rise in line with CPI, and most retailers borrow for the short term to finance their highly seasonal working capital needs. As a result, they are quite sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate.</jats:p>",

Concludes that retailing is an extremely complex subject – whereas a producer is concerned about the various quality dimensions of his own product, a retailer is obliged to take care of a multiplicity of products, each bearing its own characteristics.

The population distribution complicates the provision of material services and new methods of document delivery are constantly under review. The political complexities are such as to make effective networking voluntary, informal or non‐governmental. A complex cultural background affects library collections and services. Interlending in Canada is vital as individual library collections are not yet fully developed. There are no central lending collections as such and interlibrary lending is largely decentralized. Location tools and services have changed radically over the last decade with the advent of automation. The introduction of air and truck delivery systems has solved many document delivery problems and they are developing rapidly. Interlibrary loan policies are based on a code which, amongst other things, promotes access to information as being in the general interest. Charges for interlibrary loans were reluctantly introduced in 1975 and caused temporary chaos. The issue has raised the question of the need for a national lending centre and this in turn raises the problem of copyright. A nationwide study of interlending in Canada was undertaken and the report submitted at the end of 1982. Other studies are being carried out at the provincial level. Interlending in Canada is in a very dynamic period: technology is moving towards the interlinking of a wide variety of systems better suited to the Canadian situation. In future, library collections may become smaller, and users will borrow from a central clearing‐house, or full‐text database. New technology will affect the traditional role of the library which will then concentrate on more sophisticated help to the user.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strategic planning has become an indispensable tool for management, and while its effectiveness is widely assumed, its contribution is rarely quantified. In order to assess the value of strategic decision making in terms of its contribution to a firm’s sales, net income, and earnings, Leon Reinharth and his associates have prepared a case study of the 10‐step strategic planning process undertaken about seven years ago by a leading multinational insurance brokerage company. The firm is Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, Inc., a highly profitable organization both before and after implementation of its 1976 strategic plan. Readers can draw their own conclusions about the order of magnitude of the plan’s value by comparing the financial results of two five‐year periods in the firm’s history (see Table 3). The benchmark period, 1970 through 1974, was the pre‐plan era, and the years 1976 through 1980 are the ones Dr. Reinharth believes were most affected by the plan. There is some evidence that the firm’s strategic decision making capabilities gave it a definite competitive advantage. A 1979 Fortune survey found that among the five largest publicly held insurance borkerage firms in the United States, A&amp;A had the highest average return on equity from 1975 to 1977 and the highest average annual growth in dividends from 1973 to 1978. Dr. Reinharth’s case study outlines the problems that A&amp;A identified in 1976 and summarizes the management philosophy that guided the strategic responses of the plan. For a detailed version of this case history the reader is directed to The Practice of Planning, by the authors, and published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1981. The most recently reported financial results for A&amp;A are presented in the separate section, Alexander and Alexander in 1981.</jats:p>",

In the late 1970s, planning had begun again to provide an informational support to other policies for restructuring industry in the face of the world market. The paper ends with an evaluation of the Mitterrand government's aspirations for more dirigiste industrial planning.</jats:p>",

Rural newspapers are becoming increasingly aspatial and parochial in their news coverage and the flow of information between rural centres is changing from a complex system to a less complex system. The reasons for these trends are not entirely clear, but may relate to economic and technological changes within the newspaper publishing industry as well as to the fortunes of regional policy in Australia. </jats:p>",

The planning problem is decomposed into a set of subproblems, each representing the operation of a set of generating plants of fixed capacity in 1 year, and a master problem, representing optimal capacity investments over the entire planning horizon. The subproblems are solved using a procedure called probabilistic simulation, which calculates the expected cost of operating the generating system, the reliability level, and dual multipliers reflecting the value of small changes in the plant capacities. The master problem is a linear program which uses these dual multipliers to approximate the nonlinear cost and reliability functions. The solution to the capacity expansion problem is found by iteratively solving the master problem and the subproblems. </jats:p>",

In the present paper our interest is in the error that is introduced into a multiregional input-output model through aggregation of regions. As in the earlier paper, we investigate the question by means of both hypothetical and real data. In the present study, these are (1) randomly generated multiregional data incorporating varying degrees of regional linkage and (2) actual 1963 US multiregional data. To allow some comparison with the interregional experiments, the data for the random experiments in the present paper are derived from our original randomly generated interregional data. The same levels of spatial interconnectedness as in the interregional experiments are also used here, and the same measures of aggregation error are employed. As in the interregional case, we conclude that spatial aggregation in multiregional input-output models does not necessarily lead to unacceptable error. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Multi-stage planning processes arise in many situations in operations research and economics. The purpose of the planning process is to adapt to a future described by certain state variables x(k). This paper considers the problem of finding optimal forecasts for the state variables which explicitly take account of a cost tradeoff between costs associated to errors in predicting the values of the state variables and costs associated with changes in forecasts for a particular time k made at successive time periods k<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, k<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. That is, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of individual forecasts x̃(k ∣ k<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) for x(k) and the stability of successive forecasts x̃(k ∣ k<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and x̃(k ∣ k<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). This paper gives an exact solution in the case where the state variables x̃(k) are generated by a Gaussian linear system and the cost function is quadratic plus linear in the state variables and forecasts. In this case the optimal forecasts are matrix weighted linear combinations of Kalman filter estimates, with weights depending only on the loss function. In the special case that all costs associated with a change in forecasts occur in the period the change is made, these weights have a simple recursive form. This problem is a special case of a stochastic control problem we call the extended linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. </jats:p>",

By means of data drawn from a survey of eighty-three pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, the paper considers the technological sophistication both of firms and of plants according to their location as defined by settlement size, degree of urbanization, and their broader centre-periphery regional setting. Given the overall location of the UK pharmaceutical industry, it is shown that there is no significant technological bias in favour of firms or plants located in larger settlements, in more urbanized areas, or within more centrally located regions. In part this result was associated with the decentralized location of manufacturing units controlled by large technologically advanced corporate organizations. The survey data also revealed that on an intracorporate basis there was no evidence that more distant plants, in relation to their main innovation or headquarters location, tended to be less technologically sophisticated. </jats:p>",

Conventional neoclassical discrete-exchange models of the labor market are shown to be inadequate because of marked rigidities in the patterns of short-run adjustment. Money wages are very stable, being dominated by a long-run trend, and firms tend to adjust hours worked and only then employment in the short run. There are, however, significant interregional variations in these patterns within the same industry. Spectral analysis and tests for periodicities in the patterns of residuals derived from trend-line estimates of money wages confirm a supposition that urban Phillips curves do not exist. The evidence supports the implicit notion of contract theory that continuous employer-worker relationships exist over the business cycle. The question of how useful, in general, this theory might be is left open for the present. </jats:p>",

The index is based on the geomorphology of the area, coastal processes, and the amount of physical energy to which the coastline is subjected.

Each component of the 1‐year prevalence rates has been examined closely, and the results have indicated three main considerations: abolishing the large mental hospital does not abolish the long‐stay patients still living in it, and these people will remain a heavy load on the mental health care system for a long time; the new Act has halved admission rates, but the decline may be a positive result if in‐care and out‐care are sufficiently integrated; treated out‐patients tend to increase year by year, and they seem more and more to be “young men and middle‐aged women” suffering from minor psychiatric disorders.

In this paper, some extensions of this mechanism and some alternatives are presented; but most importantly the first steps are taken in relating these theoretical explorations to empirical data. We consider change in Nottingham from 1956 to 1979. </jats:p>",

Coordinating these three modules has been largely dependent on managerial judgment and experience. In this research, five different strategies for integrating these modules are empirically investigated. These strategies differ mainly in the extent to which the modules are coordinated. The impact of the shop, product, component and cost characteristics is measured by varying ten experimental factors. The research findings so obtained provide several guidelines on the effectiveness of each strategy in different environmental settings.</jats:p>",

While many arguments have been advanced for changing the balance of institutionalized and community‐based care in view of the ageing of Australia's population, the debate has generally lacked a methodological framework for rigorously comparing the alternatives under consideration. In this paper, some of the issues involved in a comparative cost analysis of various alternative forms of care for the aged are discussed, the results of an Adelaide‐based survey are summarized and possible implications for policy‐makers are suggested.</jats:p>",
