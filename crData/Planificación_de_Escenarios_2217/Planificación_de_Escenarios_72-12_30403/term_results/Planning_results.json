      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the crucial tests of the policy of public participation called for in the 1968 Planning Act is whether it can work in areas which do not demand a say in planning. There is a danger that these areas could be jostled even further away from resources and consideration as the more vocal areas which have always demanded attention take full advantage of their rights under the new system. The citizen’s statutory right to information and consultation means litde if he doubts that his involvement can have any impact on planning, and if the local authority feel they have nothing to gain from hearing his views.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Although the 1968 Act required that the public should be informed and consulted in some way, it also gave local authorities greater power. First, it left the evolution of the means of consultation to the local authority. Second, it made planning a staged process which could be used to render the public quite impotent. In place of the old detailed development plan only the skeletal structure plan is now subject to public enquiry and ministerial approval, but at this stage the plan is insufficiently detailed for potential objectors to know how their interests are affected.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In May 1970 I argued in this journal that cost effectiveness should dominate the planning of higher education in the seventies, and in November 1971 outlined steps for its rationalisation. The DES Statistics of Education Volume 5, Finance and Awards for 1970, puts in focus the stark situation of education costs for England and Wales. The total cost was £1,980 millions, an increase of £217 millions over the previous year. The 1971 Blue Book (CMND 4829) shows an overall educational expenditure of £2,953 millions for 1970–71 and highlights the share which higher education received. Over the ten year period 1960–1970 the largest increases were on tuition costs of teacher training, university grants and further education, in that order. In 1969–70 further and adult education received £246.3 millions, teacher training £53.8 millions and the universities £225.6 millions. The size of this sector of education has been projected in the DES Planning Paper No 2 which suggested that twice as many boys and girls will secure two or more ‘A’ levels in 1981 compared with 1968. The number in full‐time higher education in 1969–70 (Universities, Colleges of Education and Further Education) was estimated at 443 000 and projections suggested this will rise to 847 000 in 1981–82. Total costs of full‐time higher education at 1966–67 prices were estimated to rise to £957 millions. It is in the cold light of these essential statistics that developments in planning higher education for the next five years and how cost effectiveness can be implemented are now considered.</jats:p>",

This view is disputed here, not primarily on the grounds that increasing mobility is closely associated with increasing physical pollution, but on the grounds that, by increasing the scale of society, it is alienating. Some mobility growth rates are charted; the paradox that these growth rates are associated with a widening gulf in communications is examined. The growth in the scale and complexity of society's problems produces a growing dependence on esoteric techniques of control. The growth of the technology of control abets the growth of more complexity and yet more techniques for controlling it. The result is a progressive widening of the gulf that separates the controllers from the controlled. </jats:p>",

The latter are assumed to be coupled to the territorial densities of the individual species of civic matter through equations of state, for which the housing rental-population density relation in market equilibrium theory is a prototype. </jats:p><jats:p> The study is divided into four parts. The first part (presented here) approaches the problem from a formal axiomatic viewpoint, and the axioms and definitions are discussed in relation to the real urban situations from which they are abstracted. The notion of equilibrium configurations for a city is introduced, and the general equilibrium equations necessary for their existence are developed. Three particular illustrations of these equations are offered: that of a single species city, and of a two species city—both with an ideal (polytropic) state equation—and that of a single species city with an imperfect (van der Waals) state equation. These illustrations will be examined in detail in the subsequent three parts of this study. </jats:p>",

The paper develops residential environmental preference variables from questionnaire survey data. The preferences may be considered as relative tradeoffs among the residence's accessibility, characteristics of the house and lot (for example, lot size), the quality of the natural environment, and characteristics of the non-natural environment (for example, population density). At the same time, comparable measures are devised of the characteristics of the persons' present residences—their residential choice. </jats:p><jats:p> Principal results are that the preference and choice variables do seem useful; that preferences, thus defined, do express themselves to some extent through market choice; and that different persons do in fact prefer different residential characteristics. Preferences for different residential characteristics tend to be negatively associated, so that there are persons with strong preferences for the natural environment who are willing to sacrifice a large lot to live in a beautiful area. </jats:p>",

All suffer a common difficulty, however, since the analyst himself must formulate the physical design to be studied in each computer run. If the basin is large and offers a variety of development opportunities, the number of alternative system plans from which he must choose can be extremely large. This paper reports on an investigation of the use of analytical optimization models to ‘screen’ the set of possible plans and to select a small number worthy of simulation analysis. The Delaware River basin being used as an example, deterministic and stochastic optimizing models have been developed and applied to both static and dynamic (multiperiod) planning problems. The resulting designs have been analyzed by using a large‐scale digital simulation model of the basin so that the ability of the screening models to identify high‐valued alternatives can be evaluated. In this context the results indicate considerable promise for the combined use of optimization and simulation models.</jats:p>",

In expressing a preference, however, an individual relies on both his image of the place and his criteria for ‘desirability’. The study reported here used the semantic differential technique as a means of identifying these criteria and images. Young residents of Christchurch, New Zealand were the respondents; various towns in that country were the stimuli; each town was rated on thirty-eight separate scales. Mean ratings for each place on the scales suggested the probable existence of common criteria for ‘residential desirability’, but analyses of the dimensionality of their images suggested little stability. About their home town, the respondents were very precise and discriminating. For other places, there was possibly only a single-dimension underlying the ratings on all thirty-eight scales, though this seemed to compose several common sub dimensions, of which socio-economic quality, social and housing environments, physical structure, and climate occurred most frequently. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Housing space, social space, and community space are each defined simply and discussed with respect to two concepts: housing space is defined in terms of type and quality for individual housing units; social space is defined in terms of social status and stage in the life cycle for a family unit. Contrasting with these micro-scale definitions are the constructs of community space—family status and social status—which describe census units at the macro-social level. The congruence between housing space and social space for a sample of homes and the families residing within them in Kingston and Winnipeg, Canada, is then determined statistically with the use of multivariate multiple regression procedures. The varying degrees of incongruence for a number of social groups are then analysed subjectively under three defined housing constraints. Finally, the representativeness of the two samples is examined, and directions for further research are outlined. </jats:p>",
