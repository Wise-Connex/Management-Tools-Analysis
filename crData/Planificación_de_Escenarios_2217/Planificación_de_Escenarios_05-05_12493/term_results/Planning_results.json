      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Plat of the City of Zion, designed in 1833, was the brainchild of Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It embodied the Mormons’ desire to build a new kingdom for their people, distinct from mainstream American culture. The resulting pattern is a unique combination of local and foreign precedents. Salt Lake City, a paradigmatic example of this scheme, became the model for surrounding settlements, defining the urban pattern of a segment of the West. The later explosive growth of Utah’s capital, and its departure from the original model, transformed one of the pioneering urban experiences of the United States. The physical boundaries of this planning tradition, and the limited general understanding of its use, make it still a rather unique urban phenomenon. </jats:p>",

It shows that commercial uses, tied to different forms of transportation, dominated planning objectives, as distinct from recreational uses and attempts to expand public access. The most recent plans seek a better balance between private and public interests in future uses of Cleveland’s waterfront, but there is a lack of consensus among the competing interest groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Doses to rectum, bladder and Point‐A in patients who received intracavitary HDR brachytherapy treatment were calculated by both orthogonal radiographs reconstruction method and by image based reconstruction method and were compared. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Twenty‐five patients of carcinoma cervix who received intracavitary brachytherapy treatment by micro‐Selectron HDR unit were included in this study. For these patients, in Plato treatment planning system, reconstruction of sources, applicator, organs at risk and Point‐A were done using conventional orthogonal radiographs and by using 1 mm thick CT scan images. Bladder was identified on radiographs through a Foley's catheter inserted into it filled with 7 cc of radio‐opaque fluid and the rectum through a rectal marker. Doses were calculated at 5 points each on bladder and rectum, for the treatment dose of 7 Gy to Point‐A (right &amp; left). On CT images, these organs were delineated with the radiologists help and from dose‐volume‐histograms, doses to 1, 2 and 5 cc of these organs were calculated besides dose to Point‐A (right &amp; left). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The critical organ doses estimated by the CT method were consistently higher when compared to those by the radiographs method. When compared to the radiographic dose maximum for bladder, doses to 1, 2 and 5 cc of bladder were higher by 89%, 69.7% and 41.6% on an average respectively. For rectum, the corresponding values were 36.6%, 21.7% and 0.4%. However dose to Point‐A did not differ by more than 3% between the two methods. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The conventional orthogonal radiography based reconstruction method consistently underestimates the doses to critical organs while the doses to reference points are comparable in these two methods. Long‐term follow‐up in such patients can identify the threshold volumes for these critical organs beyond which complication rates are bound to rise.</jats:p>",

In the case-study municipality, a recently introduced web-GIS technology had little demonstrable success in attaining two of its stated goals: enabling increased public access to municipal geographic information and encouraging planners to produce their own maps. My research links these outcomes not only to the technologies themselves, but to organizational structure and human agency. Planners and planning theorists can gain additional insight into the impact of planning technologies through closer attention to the process through which planners come to use information technologies and the way this process both alters and is constrained by existing organizational constraints, including previously adopted technologies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on planning support systems (PSS) is characterized by a strong emphasis on the supply side, whereas little research has been undertaken on the successes and failures in the adoption of PSS within the planning community (demand side). What becomes clear from the existing research is that usage is not widespread. In this paper we aim to find the main bottlenecks blocking the widespread use of PSS in spatial planning. To achieve this, a global online survey was conducted in which almost 100 PSS experts participated and for which a theoretical framework from the field of business studies served as a basis. The results show that a multitude of factors cause the underutilization of PSS, their characteristics being human, organizational and institutional, as well as technical. In particular, the lack of awareness of and experience with PSS, alongside the relative lack of recognition of the value of PSS within the spatial planning community, tend to block widespread usage and adoption of PSS in planning practice. On this basis, we offer recommendations for the enhancement of PSS adoption, namely to disseminate more profoundly information and knowledge about the existence and benefits of PSS within the spatial planning community. Real-world example projects and in-depth research on potential benefits of PSS application in planning practice will be crucial in this. </jats:p>",

With current technology, the ability to assess rock and fluid properties is very limited. Utilization of an assortment of MWD, wireline, geochemical, and gas logging technologies is necessary when attempting to fully assess reservoir properties. All of these evaluation tools have significant limitations and proper well and evaluation program design and planning is critical. Success is often dependent on making several measurements and having contingency plans developed in the planning stage of the evaluation program. Actual HPHT well evaluation planning and execution examples, as well as, current tool limitations and future technology requirements are reviewed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>As we stand at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we face a national challenge in planning and designing learning environments that meet the needs of all learners. Throughout the country, elementary and high school districts are spending unprecedented amounts of money to renovate existing school facilities or build new ones. In 2001 alone roughly $27 billion worth of kindergarten through grade 12 construction projects were approved and funded, a trend that is likely to continue for several years. In 2000 public and private kindergarten through grade 12 school enrollment reached a record 53 million students. The Department of Education projects that 55 million children will enroll in 2020 and 60 million in 2030. By 2100 the pattern of steady growth is expected to result in a total of 94 million school-age children, an increase of 41 million students over the century. It is also projected that diversity will increase, with most of the growth among Hispanic children. They represented about 15% of the public school population in 2000; that proportion is expected to grow to 24% by 2020. This steady increase in the number and diversity of school children, all of whom need and deserve a quality education, suggests that the design of new school facilities and the modernization of old ones will be an ongoing process in communities across the United States. One important component of this challenge is the need to rethink how we plan learning environments to coincide with some new ways of thinking about education. It seems as if such a short time has passed since Howard Gardner introduced the theory of multiple intelligences at a time when other educational strategies, including project-based learning, cooperative learning, primary source learning, real world experiential learning, and their many variations, were enjoying a renaissance or were in the developmental stages. Many of these teaching and learning strategies have found their way into the mainstream as powerful tools that help to create more meaning-centered and personalized learning for students and educators alike. This new group of educational strategies is more diverse, more integrated, and, perhaps, more compelling than their more predictable predecessors.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1925, a Cleveland, Ohio, Jewish orphanage brought the first federal lawsuit involving zoning and religious discrimination. The case was Cleveland Jewish Orphan Home v. Village of University Heights. It is historically significant because it documents how federal courts treated a local government’s application of its zoning regulations for anti-Semitic purposes, the darker side of American land-use controls. This article describes the controversy over the proposed relocation of the home from the city of Cleveland to the village of University Heights, a then-small community of five hundred, and the Village’s decision to deny the necessary zoning approval. It follows the litigation through the federal district court, the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article chronicles the village’s continuing efforts to impede construction of the home by blocking the provision of a public school for the orphans after it had lost the federal case. It concludes with a commentary on the broader themes of the litigation, including its importance to planning law as an early recognition of the arbitrary and exclusionary dimensions of zoning, particularly as it affected the substantive due process rights of a religious-based social service organization. </jats:p>",

This work, Petty’s first, was one through which he sought to make his name in ascendant Puritan circles within and without the English universities. In it, he asserted the primacy of the Baconian view that it was ‘more profitable … to spend ten or twelve years in the study of Things … then in a rabble of words’. He made a number of suggestions as to how this might best be achieved. Of most pertinence here is his view that, rather than preoccupy themselves with the study of various languages, children should concentrate on matters ‘such as are in the order of Nature … and are attainable by the help of memory’. They should ‘observe and remember all sensible Objects and Actions’, and only then move on to the study of language. And Petty envisaged a language that would help, rather than help to reverse, this process: the students should ‘not onely be taught to Write according to our Common Way, but also to Write Swiftly [sc. in shorthand] and in Reall Characters’. This use of real characters—representing things or notions rather than words—would increase their knowledge, but ‘were the Reall and Common characters brought into practice’, then there would also be much less need ‘to learne Forraine Languages’, both within and without Petty’s proposed school, allowing time for the study of more valuable matters.</jats:p>",

Although it is the only commercially available product of this kind at present, the same technology can also be applied to other heavy feedstocks to facilitate their handling and transportation. In the early 1990s a number of emulsions of refinery residues were trialed, and since then several other emulsified fuels have been developed, albeit so far with limited application or commercial success. However, as technology and economics change it is likely that other emulsified fuels will be developed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The characteristics of any emulsified fuel and its formulation are developed to meet a number of criteria that take into account ease of production, handle ability, stability, economics and end-use together with environmental impact and spill behaviour. Consequently not all emulsified fuels will necessarily have the same characteristics or behave in the same way.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A key consideration is the surfactant package used to stabilise the emulsion. This will play a key role in determining the overall ecotoxicological impacts of the fuel and in dictating the dispersion / coalescence equilibrium for an emulsified fuel following a spill incident.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In extreme cases, differences in the surfactant package could make the difference between an emulsified fuel dispersing virtually entirely versus almost instantaneously coalescing. Given the extreme viscosity of the re-surfaced bitumen, this potential difference in fate and behaviour would have a considerable influence on potential impacts and, consequently, on the choice of appropriate spill response strategies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper explains how the surfactant package in an emulsified fuel should be fully considered, and its potential influence on response options taken into account, in the Contingency Planning process.</jats:p>",

Under these circumstances, planning – in a comprehensive sense to include shaping, steering and developing activities – is of central importance. Switzerland's planning concept comprises two different levels: global planning of larger areas serves to represent public interest and the level of the individual enterprise reflects the interests of the forest owners. We report the views of the head of the forestry planning unit of Canton Berne, as a public representative, and the head of forestry from the Oberallmeind corporation Canton Schwyz, as a representative of forest owners. The paper starts with a retrospective of forest history and investigates earlier reasons for forest planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concepts “City” and “Nature” are used as contrasts both in habitual language and in urban research discourses. At the same time there exist multifaceted conjunctions between these seemingly dichotomous categories: planning of municipal parks, research in urban ecology, and debates on urban sustainability are just some examples. While approaching the relationship of city and nature, urban research claims that temporarily valid understandings of nature are nothing given. Nature, especially in urban spaces, is hardly ever pristine and self-acting. Rather, the understanding and the use of “Nature” is strongly associated to societal preferences, to Zeitgeist, and to ever changing frameworks. The article at hand first illustrates and resumes these conjunctions, before it outlines the discussion on the “social construction of nature”. This evolving research approach aims to consider these aspects on a conceptual level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Graphplan algorithm for generating optimal make-span plans containing parallel sets of actions remains one of the most effective ways to generate such plans.  However, despite enhancements on a range of fronts, the approach is currently dominated in terms of speed, by state space planners that employ distance-based heuristics to quickly generate serial plans.  We report on a family of strategies that employ available memory to construct a search trace so as to learn from various aspects of Graphplan?s iterative search episodes in order to expedite search in subsequent episodes.  The planning approaches can be partitioned into two classes according to the type and extent of search experience captured in the trace.  The planners using the more aggressive tracing method are able to avoid much of Graphplan?s redundant search effort, while planners in the second class trade off this aspect in favor of a much higher degree of freedom than Graphplan in traversing the space of 'states' generated during regression search on the planning graph.  The tactic favored by the second approach, exploiting the search trace to transform the depth-first, IDA* nature of Graphplan?s search into an iterative state space view, is shown to be the more powerful.  We demonstrate that distance-based, state space heuristics can be adapted to informed traversal of the search trace used by the second class of planners and develop an augmentation targeted specifically at planning graph search.  Guided by such a heuristic, the step-optimal version of the planner in this class clearly dominates even a highly enhanced version of Graphplan.  By adopting beam search on the search trace we then show that virtually optimal parallel plans can be generated at speeds quite competitive with a modern heuristic state space planner.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most Medical Physicists working in radiotherapy departments see few pediatric patients. This is because, fortunately, children get cancer at a rate about 30 times smaller than adults. Children have not smoked, abused alcohol, or been exposed to environmental carcinogens for decades, and of course, have not fallen victim to the aging process. Children get very different cancers than adults. Breast or prostate cancers, typical in adults, are rarely seen in children but instead a variety of tumors occur in children that are rarely seen in adults; examples are germinomas, ependymomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, which require treatment of the child's brain or neuroblastoma, requiring treatment in the abdomen. The treatment of children with cancer using radiation therapy is one of the most challenging planning and delivery problems facing the physicist. This is because bones, brain, breast tissue, and other organs are more sensitive in children than in adults while the required tumor dose is frequently above 50 Gy. Because most therapy departments treat mostly adults, when the rare 8 year‐old patient comes to the department for treatment, the physicist may not understand the clinical issues of his disease which drive the planning and delivery decisions. There is a new set of dose constraints different from the adult patient, which, depending on the site of treatment, may require changing the routine beam arrangement for that site. Additionally, children are more prone than adults to developing secondary cancers after radiation. This fact has important implications for the choice of delivery techniques, especially when considering IMRT. For bilateral retinoblastoma, an irradiated child has a 50% chance of developing a second cancer by age 50. In this presentation, an overview of childhood cancers and their corresponding treatment techniques will be given. These can be some of the most complex treatments that are delivered in the radiation therapy department. These cancers include Leukemia treated with total body irradiation, medulloblastoma, treated with craniospinal irradiation plus a conformal boost to the posterior fossa, neuroblastoma, requiring focal abdominal irradiation to avoid kidney, liver, and vertebral body damage, retinoblastoma, requiring treatment to an eye while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues, and a variety of other tumors which occur anywhere in the body. Case studies will be presented showing the treatment technique and resulting dosimetry, highlighting the objectives for tumor coverage and organ‐at‐risk sparing. Practical issues that have to be faced when treating children will also be discussed such as daily sedation and immobilization. Finally, most children with cancer are treating within a clinical trial administered by the Children's Oncology Group. Examples of the protocol physics requirements will be discussed as well as the physicist's responsibility for providing data to the Quality Assurance Review Center. The presenter is Chief of Physics at one of only two radiotherapy departments in the country that treat exclusively children (Chidlrens Hospital Los Angeles).</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Sustainable models of the spinning process do not exist so far. Due to this, a new approach for the systematic design and optimization of the spinning process has been developed. In a first step of the planning sequence, a prediction of initial parameter settings is given by a case-based-reasoning approach. A first adaptation of the pre-selected parameters is then realized on a fuzzy-based model. In the next step, a model based optimization using statistical design of experiments is performed. For this, a new statistical approach has been developed being optimized regarding the requirements of the spinning process. In this paper, the methods used and the implementation of the approach in a process planning software are described. The approach is verified by the example of setting up a\nprocess to manufacture a cylindrical model workpiece.</jats:p>"

Against the background of demographic change, Regional Governance aims to initiate processes of self-organisation, i.e. to create the capacity to act autonomously at regional level, and to improve the self-organising capacity to both sub-regions and of a region in its entirety. In order to show how this capacity to act at regional level might be established, the following article takes the Braunschweig region as a case in point to illustrate the development of this type of „organising capacity”.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>IMRT treatment planning is fundamentally different from previous methods of computerized radiotherapy treatment planning, because (1) the user is asked to initially specify characteristics of the desired solution, and (2) the treatment plan is computer‐derived using multivariable optimization techniques. Hence, the method is sometimes called ‘inverse treatment planning.’ However, this process is typically hindered by the need to guess which parameters will lead to an acceptably good plan. Typically the ‘right parameters’ to lead to an acceptably good plan are unknowable and this fact leads to a series of iterations in which the human user refines the input data guesses given to the planning system. The difficulty is related to the common commercial use of linearly weighted sums of objective function terms. It is routine, therefore, for dose hot spots and cold spots to shift, even between different structures, in an uncontrolled manner. A related paradox of the typical planning process is that normal tissue weights in the objective function should be small (so as not to negatively impact target dose characteristics) but not too small (so that dose to the structure will be reduced). Finding this range, which may not exist to satisfaction, is a trial and error process. Another difficulty is that DVH‐outcome data collected using one type of treatment planning (say, 3‐D conformal) probably applies less well to dose distributions which minimize just those stated metrics (as done in IMRT treatment planning). Other sources of planning error include: the relationship between DVH dose target goals and their impact on outcome, doubts about which beams should be selected, and the impact of dose algorithm accuracy on optimized target coverage. This review course session will focus on advanced IMRT treatment planning topics, including: (1) the effect of dose calculation approximations on IMRT solution characteristics, (2) beam selection techniques, (3) methods to deal with uncontrolled tradeoffs between different dosimetric objectives (e.g., prostate DVH vs. rectal DVH), including <jats:italic>ad hoc</jats:italic> methods and emerging alternatives to standard optimization methods (such as prioritized optimization), (4) radiobiological input data (e.g., DVH constraints) relevant for prostate and head and neck planning, and (5) emerging planning techniques based on radiobiological outcomes models (e.g., EUD, TCP, and NTCP). <jats:italic>Ad hoc</jats:italic> methods to control tradeoffs in current systems include multi‐step approaches in which the target is optimized first, followed by adding the next most important normal tissue structure while holding the target DVH as a constraint, followed by adding other normal tissue structures, and so on. These issues will be discussed in the context of current commercial systems as well as emerging approaches.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Our strategy is to estimate the organ boundary on a CT image using that image's properties and the shape and pixel textures associated with the contour already computed on an adjacent section. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> CT image regions can be effectively segmented using information divergences, which expand or shrink a boundary to maximize the differences between the pixel‐sets inside and outside the boundary. Divergences produce non‐parametric, statistical inferences generating minimum average error contours, given the data. We constructed an objective function using divergence functions that 1) maximize the match of regions and edges in multiple images, and 2) constrain the flexible contour to minimize differences between the current image and the prior image's region pixel textures and contour shapes. The resulting contour is the result of literally all the information in both the current and prior images. The novel features of this project are the pixel texture constraint using minimum divergences, an objective function whose term weights may be varied to optimally contour regions in various anatomies in CT, including envelopes of organs that are unresolvable because of patient motion. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The information divergence objective function computes series of contours without user input, beginning from an initial section. The contours can describe discrete natomic organs, or regions containing the envelope of an organ in which some of the anatomy is distorted or obscured by patient motion. The computed contours adapt well to changes in size and shape. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Nonparametric information theoretic divergences don't require a model (e.g., Gaussian) to make effective estimates of anatomic boundaries in CT images. Their application to RT planning could greatly increase the efficiency of plan preparation.</jats:p>",

Unlike conventional forward planning, which highly depends on the geometric relationship between the tumor and the surrounding normal tissues, inverse planning critically depends on the specification of dose constraints to the target tumor and sensitive structures. For a particular inverse planning system, one has to have a good understanding of the inverse planning system and a good intuition about the relationship between the dose constraints and the resulting dose distributions. This review course session will focus on fundamental issues in IMRT treatment planning. We will try to answer the following questions: What are the basic components of commercial IMRT treatment planning systems, and how do they work? What is typical behavior of an IMRTP system? How can the user systematically search for a proper dose constraint for a specific disease site? How does the planner know when to quit trying to improve the plan? Lastly, to what extent and how can the typical problems with generated plans be ameliorated? Issues specific to head and neck and prostate IMRT treatment planning will be discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Shortly after the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed, the Region 10 Regional Response Team and three Area Committees (Environmental Protection Agency Inland Area Committee and US Coast Guard Coastal Portland and Puget Sound Area Committees) decided to combine contingency planning documents. The result was the publishing of the Northwest Area Contingency Plan (NWACP) which has also been signed by the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. In the late 1990's, these organizations were further combined to form a single planning and preparedness body, the Regional Response Team (RRT) 10/Northwest Area Committee (RRT10/NWAC).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In 2003, the RRT10/NWAC launched a new web site to provide all planning and preparedness information in the northwest (www.rrtlOnwac.com). The web site includes the Northwest Area Contingency Plan, 29 Geographic Response Plans, fact sheets, the RRT10/NWAC Strategic Plan, jurisdictional boundary maps, an Area exercise schedule, equipment availability lists, workgroup charters and action plans, meeting minutes, and the ability to submit comments and join a list serv.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As a companion to the public web site, a private password-protected extranet portal web site has also been established. This private web site has become an invaluable planning tool to bring the large number of organizations involved in the planning and preparedness process across three states together. It facilitates the rapid and efficient review and comment on documents and the tracking and responding to comments from stakeholders. It also provides a centralized location to post documents to be shared and allows members given access to the private site to interface directly with the public web site by “publishing” certain items from the private to the public web site without going through a Webmaster. The private site also provides a secure location to make sensitive information such as contact names and phone numbers and specific activation and communications plans available to responders but not the general public.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To simultaneously optimize the photon beam energy, orientations (gantry, table), wedge filters and beam weights in aperture‐based IMRT, a new inverse planning system has been developed. This system, <jats:italic>Ballista</jats:italic>, uses anatomy‐based MLC fields as aperture. It is an alternative for beamlet‐based IMRT. The aim of this study is to include the photon energy in the optimization process. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> <jats:italic>Ballista</jats:italic> uses a fast simulated annealing algorithm to select the optimal configuration of beams with respect to the objectives specified by the planner. To include the energy as a free parameter in the existing overall optimization system, this variable is interpreted by the algorithm as an angle and competes with gantry and table angles. That is, each eligible energy is assigned to a circular section of the space of all possible solutions. In addition to varying the energy of the individual beams, an option was added to the process which allows associating a combination of energies to various segments of a single field. The coverage margin overlap of the fields is naturally adapted as a function of the energy used. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The effectiveness of energy optimization has been tested on several sites. The lung cancer, which is an interesting example, has provided good results. The value of V<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> (29,6% vs. 35%) is reduced as well as the mean dose to the heart (14,5% vs. 21,5%). Also, a better tumor coverage (V95% = 97,8% vs. 96,6% and IH = 1,07 vs. 1,10) is obtained in the case of a non‐coplanar plan realized with this new approach in comparison with a standard plan (only one energy for the whole plan, 23MV). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The inclusion of energy gives the optimization process an additional advantage over standard planning, and better close the gap between the optimized approach and the clinical treatment methods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radiation therapy is an image‐guided procedure whose success depends strongly on the image modality used for treatment planning and the level of integration of the available imaging information. Advancement in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has provided an unprecedented means to produce highly conformable dose distribution while sparing sensitive structures, which calls for better imaging tools for tumor target definition and for the management of inter‐ and intra‐fractional organ motion. Clinically, MRI imaging is an important anatomical imaging modality and posses superior soft tissue contrast. It has played a pivotal role in radiation oncology practice and made significant impact in cancer diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and monitoring of therapeutic response. In the last decade, much progress has been made in high field MRI and in the development of new MRI contrast agents. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has also emerged as a powerful noninvasive tool for providing the type of metabolic and physiology information needed to identify biologically conformal dose distributions for biologically conformal radiation therapy (BCRT). This presentation will provide an overview of the fundamental principles of MRI and MRSI imaging and inform the audience with some of the new developments in the field and their practical implications to radiation therapy. Examples of these applications in a few disease sites will be presented. Finally, issues related to the quality assurance of MRI/MRSI and BCRT will also be addressed.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

A Tier 1 incident is typically referred to as an operational one occurring at or near a company's own facilities, as a consequence of its own activities. An individual company would typically provide resources to respond to this type of spill.

The “USS Cole” at Aden, Yemen on October 2000 and “MT Limburg” off the coast of Yemen on October 2002 were examples. Many regions of the world with high maritime traffic are considered hot spots for such terrorist and piracy activities. For instance, certain parts of the Malacca Strait are known for piracy and sea robberies. These activities may well lead to major oil spills. Vessels are considered “soft targets” for a terrorist attack. These incidents will generate high publicity and may create devastating environmental damage.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To describe and evaluate the dosimetric characteristics of a new method for directly optimizing dose distributions with MLC shaped apertures that fully exploit collimator rotation. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> In direct aperture optimization only the leaf positions and segment weights are used to optimize the three dimensional dose distribution. It has been previously shown that equivalent dose distributions may be generated that have significantly fewer MU and number of segments when compared to fluence based optimization methods. Here we introduce an expansion of direct aperture optimization that includes collimator rotation. Collimator rotation allows for the generation of high spatial resolution dose distributions that are more efficient and have less interleaf errors. IMRT plans for a prostate as well as a nasopharynx target were generated to evaluate the benefits of combining both techniques. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Dose volume analyses showed that conformal dose distributions may be generated with only 6 segments per beam and with an average 29% reduction in MU when compared to our fluence based leaf sequencing with collimator rotation. Collimator angle was found to be accurate and reproducible to within 0.5 degrees and was independent of gantry angle on our Varian cl21ex linac. The accuracy of the MLC fluence model was also validated using film based verification methods. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our results show that rotating aperture optimization is capable of producing high quality dose distributions with a small number of segments and significantly few monitor units than a fluence based IMRT technique. Also, quality assurance tests of collimator rotation IMRT delivery show that current MLC/collimator rotation control systems are capable of delivering the dose distributions accurately and reproducibly. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work was supported in part by Varian Medical Systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade there has been a technological revolution in radiation oncology. Enhanced use of imaging combined with computer‐controlled methods of dose delivery provides a capability of escalating tumor doses without increasing morbidity. A pivotal component of this modern technology is the computerized radiation treatment planning system (RTPS) which is used to develop optimal treatment techniques for individual patients. Modern RTPSs make increased use of patient images, possibly from various imaging modalities, enhanced 3‐D displays, more sophisticated dose calculation algorithms, more complex treatment plan evaluation tools, combined with the generation of images which can be used for treatment verification. In addition, the implementation of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has added a further complexity to the RTPS and this is combined with automated optimization software which is essential if IMRT is going to be used to its best advantage. In recent years, various national and international organizations have developed reports that have made recommendations regarding the commissioning and quality assurance (QA) of RTPSs. In 1998, AAPM TG53 published guidelines for users and vendors on QA for radiation therapy planning. In 2000, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) produced a report (IEC 62083) specifically on safety requirements for manufacturers of RTPSs. In 2004, both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) published reports on commissioning and QA of RTPSs. Furthermore, the IAEA is presently in the process of developing a protocol for the acceptance testing of RTPSs. In 2005, the Netherlands Commission of Radiation Dosimetry also produced a report on QA of RTPSs. All of these reports indicate that a thorough commissioning of a modern 3‐D RTPS has become a daunting task. This refresher course will look at some of these reports and review issues associated with the commissioning and quality assurance of a modern RTPS.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1. To demonstrate the importance of QA of RTPSs by reviewing significant treatment errors associated with their use.</jats:p><jats:p>2. To review the major functionality of a modern RTPS.</jats:p><jats:p>3.

A crucial feature of the treatment planning system was the capability to create dose‐based regions of interest (ROIs). The Siemens accelerator was chosen for its ability to deliver treatments using magna fields without field‐splitting. Patients were CT scanned and the data transferred to the planning system. Traditional mantle fields, including 50% transmission lung blocks, were drawn on the AP/PA digitally reconstructed radiographs. An initial plan with equally weighted AP/PA beams was set up with a homogeneous calculation to a point at mid separation. The 50% isodose curve of the resultant distribution was contoured and converted to a physical target volume. The isodose representing the involved lungs under the partial transmission blocks was also contoured and converted to a second ROI target. The lungs were manually outlined as critical structures. An IMRT plan with DVH‐based target objectives was performed and compared with a protocol‐based 3D conformal plan. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Creation of ROIs using dose contouring was determined to be straightforward and reliable. IMRT optimization using the ensuing ROIs was found to be reproducible and robust. For the case study presented, the 3D plan showed a 37.0% decrease in the ICRU defined conformity index for 100% of the prescribed target dose and an undesirable 63.5% increase in the volume of lung receiving 80% of the prescribed dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> IMRT mantle treatment planning can easily be performed in under an hour using commercially available equipment. Unlike the traditional approach with no defined target, this procedure allows for quantitative plan evaluation using both isodose distributions and dose volume histograms.</jats:p>",

It was previously shown that this technique has improved spatial resolution, increased flexibility in generating aperture shapes and decreased systematic error due to interleaf effects. Unfortunately these studies were limited to single fields. In this study we evaluate the ability of the rotating collimator technique to generate conformal dose distributions by comparing to conventional IMRT plans. Plans for a simple geometric phantom as well as a prostate and nasopharynx carcinoma recurrence were generated. One set of plans was generated with a conventional step‐and‐shoot delivery method (no MLC rotation) while a second set was generated with the collimator rotation segmentation method. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> 3D dose comparisons as well as DVH analyses show that target coverage is equivalent or better with collimator rotation. Healthy tissue sparing is improved with collimator rotation, although more so for the smaller, more complex, nasopharynx target. It is also shown that increasing radiation efficiency (decreasing monitor units) will increase healthy tissue sparing. A decrease in the number of monitor units is seen with collimator rotation for both clinical cases. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> By incorporating MLC rotation into IMRT planning it is possible to improve target conformity and healthy tissue sparing. These benefits are more significant for smaller targets of higher complexity. The number of monitor units will also decrease, providing less transmission and total body scatter dose. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work was supported in part by Varian Medical Systems.</jats:p>",

More precisely, we formulate a mixed‐integer program in which expected value of the unmet demand is minimized subject to capacity and budget constraints. This is a difficult two‐stage stochastic mixed‐integer program which cannot be solved to optimality in a reasonable amount of time. We instead propose a heuristic that can produce near‐optimal solutions.

The concept of effective volume is extended to the voxel domain for this purpose. For a dose‐volume structure, the objective function depends not only the dose, but also its volumetric status. When compared with conventional quadratic function, the effect of the new scheme is to modulate the penalty distribution by applying more penalties on those high‐dose voxels, and <jats:italic>vice versa.</jats:italic> The modulation is organ dependent and determined by the clinical outcome data. An iterative algorithm is used to optimize the system. The new formalism is applied to plan a head‐and‐neck case and a prostate case. The results are compared with that obtained using the quadratic objective function with DVH constraints. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The technique provides clinically sensible ranking of competing IMRT plans. For parotid glands, for example, it yields the same score when the glands are irradiated 15Gy to 67%, or 30Gy to 30%, or 45Gy to 24% of the volume since they lead to the same outcome. On the contrary, the quadratic function yields different rankings for the three scenarios. Comparison with conventional technique indicated that, for the same target coverage, critical structure sparing is substantially improved for both cases. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A new penalty scheme, in which the voxels are penalized differentially according to clinical outcome data, is proposed. The sub‐optimal performance of the current dose‐based inverse planning can be substantially improved by considering outcome data.</jats:p>",

We attempt to select an optimal value of the regularization parameter which improves the smoothness of beam intensity functions without deterioration of accuracy of fit in the IMRT optimization problem. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We apply to inverse treatment planning the L‐curve method which was developed to determine an optimal value of regularization parameter in the discrete ill‐posed problems. The method is based on finding the regularization parameter which minimizes the residual norm which is a measure of accuracy of fit and the solution norm which is a measure of smoothness of solution. The main idea of the L‐curve method is to plot the smoothing norm as a function of the residual norm for all values of the regularization parameter. Remarkably, this characteristic curve has an L‐shaped dependence. The optimal value of regularization parameter can be found at the “corner” of the L‐curve. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We apply the L‐curve criterion to the optimization problem of the prostate radiotherapy cancer treatment with intensity‐modulated beams. We show the distinctive L‐shaped dependence of the smoothing norm as a function of the residual norm. Of great practical importance is the vertical part of the L‐curve because the smoothing norm is decreasing and the residual norm remains approximately of the same value. The corner of the L‐curve is located using criteria of 1) maximum curvature and 2) minimum total of the residual and smoothing norm. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The L‐curve method can be an important graphical tool for selection of the regularization parameter in inverse treatment planning. The regularization parameter determined using the L‐curve provides the optimal trade‐off between the smoothness of beam intensity functions and the accuracy of fit.</jats:p>",

The literature in this field concentrates on pregnancy, menstruation and menopause, and the manner in which contraceptive use is discursively constructed is under‐explored. Furthermore, the literature on nurse–women consultations in family planning clinics is also limited, with the current literature concentrating on assessing clinical skills rather than discourse.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods. </jats:bold> Using a grounded theory methodology to explore how nurses educate women about contraception in family planning clinic, 49 consultations were audio‐taped in two large family planning clinics in the United Kingdom (UK).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings. </jats:bold> Open coding and subsequent axial coding resulted in the emergence of three elements of contraceptive education. One concerned reproductive anatomy, another reproductive physiology and a third education about contraceptive functioning. These three axial codes were formed into a core category: ‘body education/reproductive vulnerability’. Within the consultation, nurses linked the ‘vulnerable’ reproductive system with the requirement for contraceptive ‘protection’. This approach seems linked to ensuring women's future contraceptive use.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion. </jats:bold> The discourse employed by nurses differs from the body discourse aimed at menopause and menstruation. These areas of women's health were constructed as disintegrating, malfunctioning and failing, whereas reproductive vulnerability suggests a fully functioning, active system, in need of restraint. However, this discourse still constructs the female body as fundamentally weak and unstable, requiring contraception to protect it and prevent transgression.</jats:p>",

The balloon can be inflated anywhere between 4 to 35 cc in order to achieve good conformance with the surrounding brain tissue. The initial dose rate in cGy/hr is a function of the balloon size, depth of prescription from the balloon surface and net afterloaded activity in mCi. FDD's, normalized to the balloon surface, are available for determining doses at various depths from the balloon. Based on tables of initial dose rates we have derived the dose rate constant Λ in (cGy/hr.U) at 1 cm from the balloon center for various balloon sizes. We have also calculated a two‐dimensional table of the radial dose function g(r) for various balloon sizes and depths in tissue. These dosimetric parameters have then been entered into our brachytherapy planning system (ADAC Pinnacle), where the Gliasite balloon is modeled as a point source. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Our CT‐based three‐dimensional dose calculations yield doses to the surrounding normal brain tissue and critical structures. In addition to isodose generation, we also calculate DVH's for critical structures, target volume and normal brain tissue and are able to add doses from external beam or other brachytherapy procedures that a patient may have received. We have spot‐checked these isodose calculations using the Gliasite calculation tables. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> CT‐based isodose display is useful in assessing doses to neighboring critical structures and is also indicated when the balloon conformance to the surrounding tissue is not optimal.</jats:p>",

It consists of three components: image segmentation, parameter optimization, and isodose and dose‐volume histogram (DVH) display. The parameter optimization tool starts with a large number of user input feasible beam orientations and sequentially eliminates beams. Beam elimination is terminated when unacceptable deterioration of the critical structure DVH is encountered. The algorithm uses the novel strategy of forcing the sequential dose distributions to imitate, as best as possible, the dose distribution with all beam orientations. This not only ensures a clinically acceptable final dose distribution but also greatly speeds up the computation time by pre‐knowledge of the expected dose at every point in the patient body. This process is illustrated in a typical prostate cancer IMRT plan with prescription doses to prostate and seminal vesicles expanded by 1cm, and more stringent than usual constraints to rectum, bladder, and femoral heads. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For the case illustrated, the parameter optimization tool sequentially reduced the number of selected beams from a user input 36 to 7 beams. Reducing the number of selected beams below 7 resulted in abrupt deterioration of the critical structure DVHs. In the tested cases, the resulting dose distributions are clinically excellent owing to the novel strategy of imitating the dose distribution with all beams. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The clinical tool presented here serves an important purpose by promoting the extraction of the full benefit of IMRT by optimizing all involved parameters. It can interface with commercial treatment planning systems to enhance their functionality.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this work is to investigate an efficient and reliable method that employs fuzzy logic to optimize the beam weights for treatment plans that utilize the field‐in‐field treatment‐planning strategy. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Three tumor sites were considered, one in the breast, one in the brain, and one at the skull base. Four beam segments were used for the breast plan, and 8 segments were employed in the brain and skull‐base plans. The Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> treatment‐planning system was used to design the beam apertures in all cases. The dose per monitor unit (MU) delivered by each beam separately, calculated at a selection of points within the target volume using the Pinnacle 3 planning system, served as input to the optimization procedure. In the optimization process, relative cold‐ and hot‐spot volumes within the target were defined as fuzzy variables. Development of a fuzzy rule set to determine how to adjust the number of MU delivered through each segment was simplified by dividing the target volume into sub‐volumes associated with each beam segment. The change in the number of MU was a fuzzy variable, which was de‐fuzzified using the center‐of‐mass method. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The field‐in‐field plans developed using fuzzy logic were comparable to standard plans employing wedges developed by experienced dosimetrists. The fuzzy optimization was also fast, requiring only seconds to complete. For both the fuzzy‐optimized and standard plans, the relative cold‐spot volume within the target was between 0 and about 6%, and the hot‐spot volume was less than 1%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Fuzzy optimization theory can be successfully applied to optimize the beam weights for field‐in‐field treatment planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers have been arguing recently that the idea of what is ‘international’ in this field has been occupied by the hegemonic discourses of Anglo-American geography and journals. This paper takes this lively debate as an indicator of the global challenges facing higher education and research and provides an analysis of the changing conditions of knowledge production, characterised by internationalisation and competition. Knowledge production is governed to an increasing degree through practices based on market-like operations. The author argues that this may lead to the homogenisation of social science publication practices, which are known to be heterogeneous and context dependent. One indicator of this homogenisation is the demand for publishing in international journals that is arising in social sciences and humanities round the world. Both ‘international’ and ‘quality’ are increasingly being connected with the journals noted in the Institute of Scientific Information's (ISI) databases. Starting with an analysis of the changing conditions of knowledge production in general and in human geography in particular, the author scrutinises the spatial patterns of the international journal publishing spaces constituted by the ISI. The results show specific geographies: not only the manner in which the Anglo-American journals dominate the publishing space in science but also how the publishing spaces of the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities are very different. The publication space of social science journals is particularly limited to the English-speaking countries, and this is especially the case with human geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Obesity is a serious public health problem that has important social, economic and health consequences. The prevalence of obesity is rising rapidly throughout the world in both rich and poor countries, and it affects all sections of society. There are several important reasons for addressing the prevention of obesity, rather than its treatment or management. The prevention of weight gain (or the reversal of small gains) and the maintenance of a healthy weight are likely to be easier, less expensive and potentially more effective than the treatment of obesity after it has fully developed. A structured planning framework for the identification of potential interventions for the promotion of healthy weight and the prevention of weight gain is clearly required. However, detailed reviews of the scientific literature have revealed that the body of research is too small to provide firm guidance on consistently-effective interventions for adults or children. Ultimately, a broader approach to evidence of effectiveness needs to be adopted. The present paper proposes a structured planning approach that utilises the portfolio model and allows the selection of interventions to be based on the best available evidence, while not excluding untried but promising strategies.</jats:p>",

Two contrasting case studies are used, air pollution and childhood immunisation (specifically the MMR vaccination). The results confirm social networks and everyday experiences, and social normalisation of behaviour as important influences upon learning, responses to information, and the taking of personal action. People require information to support the freedom to make personal choices. However, the two cases illustrate that notions of collective responsibility are weaker, in the case of MMR overridden by personal responsibility, in the case of air pollution being transferred to other institutions. Conclusions are developed relating to information provision in an age promoting individualisation and retraction of government, specifically the need for explicit engagement with the benefits (personal and collective) of health protection measures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Inverse‐planning in radiation therapy is involved with multicriteria decision‐making problems as it aims to achieve multiple planning goals that are conflicting with each other in target(s) or surrounding healthy tissues. To facilitate an intuitive and explicit way of articulating planning goals, the concept of soft‐constraints has been implemented into our in‐house IMRT planning system using a Goal Programming (GP) technique. In addition, traditional linear GP has been extended to handle nonlinear goal functions so that the nonlinear metrics highly relevant to clinical protocols (such as DVH, EUD, TCP, and NTCP) can be directly utilized in the planning process. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> In order to achieve a high convergence speed of the optimization, a gradient‐based, nonlinear constraint search algorithm has been used in the implementation of nonlinear GP. The system is designed to handle multiple goals either by a weighted‐sum approach (<jats:italic>Archimedean GP</jats:italic>) or lexicographic ordering (<jats:italic>Preemptive GP</jats:italic>). For some planning criteria exhibiting poor numerical performance for gradient searches (e.g., min, max, DVH), surrogate models have been used in such a way that the general idea of soft‐constraint is consistently maintained. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For clinical IMRT cases, the nonlinear GP provides a fast and practical approach to articulate planning goals. Moreover, prioritization of planning goals based on their importance significantly simplifies the RT multicriteria problem representations. The Lagrangian Multiplier values obtained after each level of optimization facilitate informed decisions on goal tradeoffs between different priority levels. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The soft constraint concept has been implemented for clinically relevant nonlinear criteria in RT inverse planning. Due to the fast search convergence exhibited by the present system, the planning process can be interactive with the decision maker in setting or adjusting appropriate goal levels, leading to progressive tailoring of the individual plan results.

A centrally administered, forestry information system has been put into place in the region of Piedmont. The global planning of Lombardy and Piedmont is an excellent example of how agricultural planning can be integrated in forestry planning. In times when ecological systems are considered as a whole, sharp divisions between forestry and agricultural planning no longer make sense. The Italian planning concept, especially in peripheral regions, shows how the problems of a dynamic forest boundary and the requirements of nature and landscape protection can be solved more efficiently. With the implementation of the laws on forest conservation Italy is following new ways with a global management concept of forestry planning. The exploitation of Italy’s forests is naturally limited by national regulations on forest conservation and forest officials. Nonetheless, planning authorities in Lombardy and Venice have a certain amount of leeway to modify these regulations. This makes it possible to implement a flexible approach to forest conservation. The modifications has to be approved by the region, thus minimising the risk of abuse.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Collimator angle is a degree of freedom that has seldom been explored in IMRT inverse planning. This work investigates the impact of multi‐leaf collimator rotation (IMLCR) on a dosimetric scoring function and lays the groundwork for optimal collimator angle selection in IMRT planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The scoring function models the maximum deliverable dose at an arbitrary beam orientation and is calculated using a sampling method. To calculate the scoring function, the beam portal is divided into a grid of beamlets based on collimator movement constraints. The intensity of each beamlet is set at the maximum intensity that does not violate the tolerance of any structure intersected by that beamlet. The score is calculated from the fraction of the dose prescription deliverable by each beamlet. The IMLCR is measured as the increase in the scoring function over all collimator angles. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For large tumors (not fully coverable by the beam portal), the mean IMLCR is 22.2%. Collimator rotation enables more exposure of the tumor to the beam, and thus increases the irradiation of the tumor. For small tumors (fully coverable by the beam portal) with nearby critical structures, the mean IMLCR is 9.3%. Collimator rotation allows critical structures to be better isolated from tumor irradiation. When the tolerance of the nearby structures is high relative to the tumor's prescription, collimator rotation has little impact for small tumors. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The variation observed in the dosimetric scoring function indicates that collimator rotation can significantly raise the maximum deliverable dose at a given gantry angle. When the tumor is large and/or has nearby critical structures (tolerance &lt;=50% of the tumor's prescription), collimator rotation has the greatest impact and is worth considering. Collimator angle selection could play an important role in improving the quality of IMRT treatment plans.</jats:p>",

Yet certain poor rural localities exhibit high rates of in-migration and residential mobility, an underresearched phenomenon not easily explained by conventional migration theory. The authors explore factors associated with high rates of geographic mobility in impoverished rural localities in Illinois. With the aid of place data from the 2000 Census, the authors test a hypothesized model of geographic mobility within rural impoverished Illinois places. In addition to factors commonly found in the residential mobility literature, such as age distribution, employment security, and life stage, the model also tests the effects of various indicators of housing costs and housing supply on geographic mobility rates in poor and nonpoor places. The results indicate that, after controlling for age structure and household type, accessible housing in the form of rental housing is strongly associated with high mobility rates, though the overall fit of the models is better for nonpoor places. These findings raise questions regarding whether geographic mobility in impoverished places behaves according to long-standing theory, and have implications for policies for tackling rural development, housing, and poverty issues. </jats:p>",

The images were exported in DICOM format to a Pinnacle treatment planning system. Cesium tubes representing a typical tandem and ovoid loading of the applicator were entered into the planning system, and the dose distribution was calculated. The binary dose matrix was then converted to a CT‐like file by separating the dose values into individual planes, turning the floating point numbers into 12‐bit integers, and adding a header file. Those image files was exported to a Focal Sim viewing station, where the isodose distribution was merged with a phantom CT and contours representing different isosurfaces were drawn. Those contours were exported to the Tomotherapy planning station, were a trial nodal boost volume was drawn in. An IMRT plan was done for this volume, and the resultant Tomotherapy binary dose file was converted to a Pinnacle format in order to be integrated with the brachytherapy plan. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The megavoltage CT image accurately showed the source holders, tungsten shielding, and flange of the applicator. Exported doses distributions could be integrated with Tomotherapy IMRT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The Tomotherapy IMRT system will be useful to accurately image Fletcher‐Suit type applicators in actual patients in order to superimpose the dose distributions over the actual patient anatomy. IMRT delivered with Tomotherapy can easily be integrated with brachytherapy with the spread of DICOM dose export. Calculations which take the applicator shielding can be developed because the shielding position is clearly visible.</jats:p>",

BEAMnrc was applied to simulate 6MV and 15MV Siemens Primus accelerators. The acquired phase space information was input to a newly generated two‐source photon/electron beam model. Excellent congruence between Monte Carlo simulations and dose measurements was achieved for homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Using Monte Carlo as benchmark, the systematic and convergence error of a pencil beam and the superposition dose engine for five IMRT treatments of clinical lung and five head&amp;neck cases were ascertained. The pencil beam overestimated the prescribed PTV dose up to 16.7%, severe deficiencies were even detected in respect to the convergence error. For the head&amp;neck cases a significant overestimation of dose deposited at tumor‐air‐intersections was observed. The superposition algorithm mostly generates acceptable results apart from intricate lung cases, where the dose still was overestimated by up to 6%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Applying highly‐sophisticated dose engines as superposition or Monte Carlo yields reliable dose information for IMRT‐planning in target regions with intricate tissue inhomogeneities. Our studies showed, that in such regions superposition or Monte Carlo techniques have to be used for the optimization and the final dose calculation of intensity‐modulated treatment plans, since standard pencil beam algorithms both lead to inappropriate fluence levels during the optimization and wrongly calculate the dose.</jats:p>",

The internal ionization chamber diameter is related with the width of the penumbra. The purpose of this work is to model a photon beam for Intensity Modulation Radiotherapy (IMRT) using two chambers with different sizes and compare the modeling results with film measurements using standard dynamic IMRT patterns. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The TPS used was CadPlan/Helios. The treatment energy used was 6 MeV generated by a linear accelerator Clinac 21EX equipped with a 120‐leaf multileaf (MLC). The ionization chambers used were Wellhofer IC‐10 (0.14cc) with internal diameter of 6 mm and a PTW Pint Point 31014 (0.015cc) with an internal diameter of 2 mm. Five standards IMRT patterns were used for comparisson. Grid calculation size was 2.5×2.5 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 1.25×1.25 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. To match calculated to film‐measured isodoses, external MLC generated registration points were used. Measured isodoses were done using Kodak EDR2 film. Comparisson between calculated and measured isodoses were done by gamma evaluation (3mm/3% and 2mm/2%) using RIT113 software. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Measurements of dose profiles with Pint Point detector showed narrower penumbra (20%–80% penumbra width at 5 cm depth in water were 4.0 mm for the Pint Point chamber and 6.0 mm with the IC‐10). Detector noise and measuring time increased with Pint Point chamber. Single pencil beam kernels generated from profiles measurements at 5 depths were sharper with the Pint Point detector. Agreement between calculated and measured isodoses was better with the smaller detector in all the standard IMRT patterns, especially at the high dose gradient regions. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> For CadPlan/Helios TPS, beam modeling for IMRT improves using an ionization chamber with smaller internal diameter.</jats:p>",

Although much of the literature on the role of the environment in migration reflects a general awareness that environmental factors are but one of a suite of influences shaping migration decisionmaking, a framework within which to place social, economic, and environmental issues with regard to particular migration decisions is absent from this literature. Drawing upon recent contributions to the literature on migration, and political ecological concerns for access to and control over resources, in this paper I present a framework for placing such issues founded on a Foucauldian conceptualization of power. This framework treats environment, economy, and society as both products of and productive of social differentiation, instrumental modes of power, and resistance. These forms shape actors' understanding and negotiation of their social, economic, and environmental contexts, and therefore their migration decisionmaking. I illustrate the application of this framework through the example of three villages in Ghana's Central Region, where rural environmental and economic changes appear to have driven a complex pattern of out-migration over the past thirty-five years. This migration shows the ways in which environmental change becomes inseparable from local perceptions of economy and local politics through local manifestations of power. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Image‐guided radiation therapy has the potential to reduce the uncertainty in targeting the clinical target volume (CTV) for prostate cancer. This allows a reduction in the size of the planning target volume (PTV). Determination of an appropriate PTV is a non‐trivial task. Issues that need to be considered include the magnitude of the uncertainties, the shape of the dose distribution, and the desired treatment goal. This work examines the PTV requirements for image‐guided radiation therapy of prostate cancer. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The effect of geometric uncertainties is modeled to determine appropriate PTV margins. Random uncertainties are modeled as a convolution of the dose distribution, and systematic uncertainties as probability weighted shifts of the dose distribution. PTV margin requirements are examined as a function of the use of image‐guided positioning (no correction vs. on‐line correction), treatment technique (conformal vs. intensity modulated radiation therapy), and probability of achieving 95% minimum dose to the CTV (95% vs. 99%). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For a 95% probability of achieving the treatment goal, PTV margins of 6–7 mm are required if no correction is performed. The use of on‐line position correction reduces the required margin to 1–2 mm. Achieving the treatment goal with 99% probability requires &gt;10 mm margins with no corrections, while 2 mm margins are sufficient with on‐line corrections. The use of conformal vs. IMRT techniques has minimal impact on the required PTV. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results suggest image‐guided on‐line positioning correction allows substantial reduction of PTV margins. Achieving specific treatment goals with a very high level of confidence may be impossible without on‐line corrections. Since patient positioning and internal organ motion may no longer be the dominant sources of uncertainty when on‐line corrections are performed, these results should be interpreted cautiously until factors such as intrafraction motion are incorporated into the analysis.</jats:p>",

The present work was designed to examine the dosimetric impact of reducing the margins used to generate the planning target volume (PTV). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Eighteen patients treated for non‐small cell lung cancer were selected. Treatment plans were generated based on two sets of CTVs. One obtained while free‐breathing explicitly accounted for respiratory‐induced tumor motion, while the other acquired at end‐expiration or inspiration simulated treatment under breath‐hold. Margins used to generate the PTV were uniformly reduced in 2‐mm increments from the clinically used 7‐mm margins while escalating dose to the CTV. In the first part of the study, the dose to the CTV was escalated as long as normal tissue toxicity levels did not exceed that of the treatment plan actually used. In the second part, dose to the CTV was escalated until structures received the maximum dose‐volume constraints allowed in our clinic. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Preliminary results showed that reducing the margin used to expand the breath‐hold CTV from 7 to 3‐mm allowed an increase of slightly higher than 10% of the prescription dose to be delivered to the tumor without exceeding normal tissue toxicity levels. When explicitly accounting for respiratory motion, a 1‐mm margin was needed to observe statistically significant increases in dose to the CTV. By increasing the dose until critical structures received the maximum permissible dose, dose escalation of over 25% was observed using a 5‐mm margin to generate the CTV. Statistically significant increases in dose were only slightly higher using a 3‐mm uniform CTV expansion to generate the PTV. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> As a result of this study, we have observed that increased doses can be delivered to the tumor by reducing margins used to generate the PTV.</jats:p>",

Determining appropriate lung volume from 4D CT for treatment planning of lung cancer is the purpose of this work. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We obtained 4D CT scans of 10 patients using a GE LightSpeed RT scanner in combination with the Varian RPM respiratory gating system. For two of these patients, we have also obtained conventional 3D CT scans. The 4D CT scans were reconstructed into 10 breathing phases, as well as maximum, minimum, and average intensity projections. The lungs were then contoured for each phase and intensity projection, as well as for the 3D scans, and volumes for these contours were obtained. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We find that the average intensity projection (AveIP) is the most consistently close to the 3D CT volume, differing at most by about 3% of the total lung volume. The phase volume most closely approximated by the AveIP is the 20% phase (mid‐exhalation) or the 80% phase (mid‐inhalation), differing from the AveIP on average by 1.8±2.2% and −1.2±1.7%, respectively. The lung volume from the maximum intensity projection (MIP) is on average less than the AveIP volume by 11.4±2.3%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The lung volume from the 20% or 80% phases or the AveIP based on 4D CT should be used in the treatment planning for lung cancer.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> IMRT has been widely used in radiation therapy, since this technique shows potential for further improving the therapeutic ratio and reducing complications. On the other hand, it has been suggested that IMRT presents a potential impact on the induction of second malignancies, because it can result in a higher whole‐body dose due to leakage radiation. In the routine treatment planning process, complete information on the whole‐body dose‐volume histogram is not available due to the limited patient body volume imaged in the CT treatment planning process. In addition, for IMRT, larger volumes of normal tissues are being exposed to low doses, and the dosimetric uncertainties of a treatment planning system at these doses are relatively large. In this study, whole‐body dosimetry calculated from the Eclipse‐Helios planning system was verified using a whole‐body anthropomorphic phantom and MOSFET detectors, as well as polymer gels. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The “ATOM” whole‐body anthropomorphic phantom was CT‐ scanned into the Eclipse‐Helios system. An IMRT prostate plan was designed for the ATOM phantom. Each MOSFET detector was calibrated at various angles based on ion chamber dosimetry. The MOSFET detectors were precisely placed in relocatable dosimeter positions corresponding to various internal organs, allowing point‐dose measurements and comparison. BANG® polymer gel, prepared in a cylindrical container, was placed at the phantom head position to measure the 3D dose distribution. The DVH in the gel cylinder, analyzed with an optical CT scanner, was compared with that from the planning system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Preliminary results show that the agreement between the MOSFET measurements and the calculated results is within 5% for points within the target. At low‐dose regions (0.1–60%), discrepancies are larger but reasonable. DVH comparison between gels and the treatment planning will be presented. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Anthropomorphic phantom with MOSFET detectors and polymer gels can provide whole‐body dosimetry verification for IMRT.</jats:p>",

These sources were designed to eliminate the problems associated with loose seed type implants such as seed migration and embolization. However, majority of the commercially available prostate treatment planning systems are not capable to perform dose calculations with the elongated linear source types. In this project an intermediate solution for prostate treatment planning with elongated linear sources has been introduced using commercially available treatment planning systems. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Two new models have been introduced for calculating dose distribution around linear sources greater than 1.0 cm in length. Dose distributions around elongated linear source were obtained either by super position of 0.5 cm or 1.0 cm long source segments using line (LSS) or point (PSS) source approximation in treatment planning systems. These models have been validated by calculating dose distribution around RadioCoil™ sources using Prowess™ and VariSeed™ treatment planning systems and comparing the results with Monte Carlo Simulated data. Clinical application of these models for a multi source implant has been validated by treatment planning for a sample prostate patient. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Results of LSS and PSS models are found to be in good agreement with of Monte Carlo simulated data (within 4%) for the points within the active length of the source. Discrepancy is noted for the points out side the active length of the source and is under investigations. Moreover, ABS recommended parameters obtained with these models for a sample prostate patient are in good agreement to that of “seed” type implant using <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8301-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8301:mp8301-math-0001\" /> Model 200. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> These results show that the new models can easily be adapted for dose calculations with commercially available treatment planning systems for elongated linear sources.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of curriculum-based measurement (CBM), with and without diagnostic feedback, on general and special educators' instructional planning in reading. Participants were 19 second-grade teachers with their 309 students without disabilities and 16 resource teachers with their 127 first- through fifth-grade students with mild disabilities. Blocking on background (general vs. special education), teachers were assigned randomly to three conditions: control, CBM, or CBM with diagnostic feedback (CBM+D). CBM data were collected on students for 3 consecutive weeks. Then teachers attended a 2-hour workshop where they completed classwide and individual student instructional planning sheets in accordance with their experimental condition. For the individual plans, one high-, one average-, and one low-performing student was selected from each teacher's class. On the classwide plans, across backgrounds, teachers in the CBM+D condition targeted fewer objectives than control teachers. On individual plans, CBM+D resource teachers targeted appropriate skills for average- and low-achieving students more effectively than did CBM and control resource teachers, and CBM+D second-grade teachers targeted appropriate skills for average- and high-achieving target students more effectively than CBM second-grade teachers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> In gamma knife SRS, plugging pattern is often used to decrease dose to critical structure. Two algorithms have been developed and analyzed in this study. One is the stochastic plug selection based on simulated annealing algorithm; the other is the analytical approach based on greedy algorithm. Clinical cases were implemented to compare the efficiency of these two algorithms. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> With the gamma knife analytical model, the target volume and the critical structure contours were extracted from the Leksell Gamma knife Plan. We used the integral dose to the critical structure as the objective function. This objective function is calculated by adding each plug's dose contribution to the structure. For simulated annealing algorithm, the energy term is the objective function, by randomly selecting blocked pattern from a randomly generated plugging pattern pool. By controlling iteration number, simulated annealing algorithm produced an optimal blocked pattern with optimal energy term. The greedy search approach also produced the optimal objective function value based on the dose contribution order from different plugs. The values from the objective function and the DVH are compared to show the performance of these two algorithms. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A number of different objective function values are computed via simulated annealing algorithm. We found that the objective function value is generally smaller than the objective function value attained by greedy approach. And the DVH also shows that simulated annealing algorithm gives less effective result to satisfy the criteria to deliver smaller dose to critical structure. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The greedy approach produces an optimal blocked pattern in the first order with the objective function, and the solution is generally better than the simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, the simulated annealing algorithm demands long computational time and the more fluctuations in the final results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> The advent of image‐guided adaptive conformal radiotherapy demands the development of very efficient methods of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence map optimization (FMO). To enable adaptive image guidance with daily IMRT optimization the ability to generate high quality treatment plans “on‐the‐fly” to correct for changes in patient anatomy during the course of radiotherapy is needed. To this end, we have tested the feasibility of employing analytic convex nonlinear objective functions in a FMO model with simple nonnegative bounds on beamlet fluence. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The nonlinear FMO model is based on previously studied voxel‐based dose‐penalty functions that were approximated in linear and quadratic programming models. Well‐known gradient and quasi‐Newton algorithms were employed along with an Armijo line search that requires sufficient objective function decrease. A simple projected‐direction interior‐point method was used to enforce fluence non‐negativity. The algorithms were implemented in an in‐house treatment‐planning system. We tested the following methods: steepest‐descent, BFGS, symmetric‐rank‐1, and combinations thereof. The algorithms were applied to 10 head‐and‐neck cases. The numbers of beamlets were between 900 and 2,100 with a 3‐mm isotropic dose grid. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The tested methods were all found to be at least as fast as a commercial linear and quadratic programming solver (CPLEX, ILog, Inc.). While no single method was best for all cases, the steepest‐descent method typically converged the fastest. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Nonlinear optimization methods can efficiently solve the IMRT FMO problem in well under a minute with high quality for clinical cases. A simple steepest‐descent algorithm was highly successful when combined with methods to enforce simple bounds and to perform a robust line search. Quasi‐Newton methods have been successful in solving many large‐scale nonlinear programming problems, but provide little advantage for the IMRT FMO problem. In the future, we will test the algorithm's robustness with a larger population of cases.</jats:p>",

A full dosimetric analysis of the fields defined by each cutout was done for nominal electron energies between 6 and 20 MeV using a 3D water phantom and a pin‐point ion chamber. Properties studied included depth dose, in‐air inverse‐square fall‐off, and beam profiles. After appropriate benchmarking, these properties were further studied with Monte Carlo simulations using the BeamNRCMP code. From the physical data and simulations the following parameters were determined for each cutout/energy combination: R50, R90, widths of 90% and 95% isodose surfaces, effective SSD, and dose output factor. The parameters were then correlated with collimator size, giving a suite of equations accurately defining the dosimetric properties of these fields. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Rules of thumb regarding properties of electron fields are typically used in deciding the shape and nominal energy of electron fields. The cadre of formulas developed in this work more accurately predicts the dosimetric behavior of small electron fields where significant deviation from expected dosimetry can occur. We found a large difference in the 95% and 90% isodose widths as a function of field size and nominal beam energy. Moreover, the effective SSD was found to be a strong function of field size. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The formulation developed in this work accurately describes the clinical dosimetric properties of small electron fields.

Conventional tangents are placed on the patient's planning data and are used as a guide. Breast tissue, defined by clinical palpation and CT, is contoured as the CTV. The PTV is created by expanding the CTV 0.7 cm in the medial and posterior direction to account for setup error and breathing motion. The PTV and CTV are kept to within 0.5 cm of the skin surface, and 0.6 cm of the conventional beam edges to allow for penumbra and buildup. In the superior and inferior directions the PTV may be extended to cover traditional margins. Anteriorly, the IMRT field pattern is extended 1.5 cm from the PTV into air for setup error and breathing motion. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Twenty patient plans were reviewed comparing conventional and IMRT CTV doses. The plans used both 6 and 10 MV. Analysis showed comparable coverage (V95) to the CTV with a reduction in the volume receiving higher dose using IMRT. The average percent difference to V95 was 0.6%. With IMRT the average reduction to V105 was 19.5%, and there was an average reduction of 1.72 Gy to the hottest 1% of breast tissue. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The margins used in conventional breast treatment have been the standard of care for many years. Volumetric IMRT breast planning offers superior dosimetric results but defining the volumes can be a challenge. This technique allows the creation of the IMRT targets while preserving coverage of similar margins used in conventional treatment.

The heterogeneity of surveyed producer initiatives throws into question both the simple conceptual distinction drawn between the labels ‘conventional’ and ‘alternative’ and also what is meant by a ‘short’ food supply chain. The starting point of the specialist food chain is clearly not the point of production but rather a series of upstream supply links—as is found in conventional food chains. Likewise, ‘alternative’ producers are regularly obliged, or choose, to ‘dip in and out’ of different conventional nodes downstream of the business, such as abattoirs, processors, and wholesalers. In practice, delimitations between ‘alternative’ and ‘conventional’ food supply chains are often blurred and are better characterised as ‘hybrid spaces’. </jats:p>",

In order to improve the sparing of healthy tissue it was suggested that regions where both, tumor and an organ at risk can be located is irradiated with a lower dose than the dose prescribed to the tumor. This has to be compensated for by irradiating neighboring regions with a higher dose. The approach potentially allows for better sparing of healthy tissue but on the other hand, delivering inhomogeneous dose distributions per fraction is associated with higher risks. In order to make such a treatment planning approach robust and safe, one has to quantify and minimize the associated risks. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Practically, such an inverse planning approach can be realized when the optimization of the dose distribution is based on the expectation value of the dose. As a surrogate for the associated risks, we calculate the variance distribution by applying Bayesian inference. The variance term is added to the objective function and is hence minimized in the treatment planning process. Treatment planning is demonstrated for a prostate patient. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The inverse planning method yields three 3D distributions: a) the expectation value of the dose, b) its standard deviation in each point and c) a dose distribution that maps the dose delivered in a single fraction. The latter shows characteristic dose inhomogeneities within the CTV which are likely to be leveled out when the prostate is in different positions from day to day. However, this may not always be the case. The standard deviation quantifies the average uncertainty of the dose prediction. The dose delivered in a single fraction represents to some extent a worst case szenario. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Finally, the treatment planner has to find a reasonable tradeoff between potential benefit and risks.</jats:p>",

Our focus has mainly been on planning tool trajectories for industrial robot manipulators with applications such as welding and painting. However, the generalization from fixed points to limit cycles is also applicable when controlling automatic guided vehicles. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To introduce CT‐based treatment planning for brachytherapy of soft tissue sarcoma utilizing 3‐D graphics, and to examine resulting improvements in dosimetry and efficiency for complex cases. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> This procedure begins with a CT scan (Picker PQ 5000) following surgical catheter placement. CT data is transferred to the treatment planning workstation and imported into BrachyVision 6.5 (Varian) software. The catheters are defined as applicators utilizing the combination of 2‐D transverse, coronal, and sagittal CT views and 3‐D image reconstruction. This type of applicator definition creates automatic seed placement and spacing along the catheter. Ir‐192 seeds (Best Industries, Inc.) with TG‐43 data are used for dose calculation. Dosimetry is optimized using 3‐D dose visualization. This planning procedure has been performed and analyzed on seven LDR and two HDR clinical cases. Two LDR cases were planned with both the previous 2‐D method of orthogonal films and the new 3‐D CT‐based method. The two methods were compared on 3‐D versus 2‐D (volume versus planar), dosimetry optimization, and clinical feasibility. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> There are significant benefits of using CT‐based 3‐D planning for sarcoma brachytherapy. CT plane views allow accurate catheter definition and seed placement. 3‐D visualization permits an assessment of catheter distribution in more than one plane, and enhances dose optimization for tumor bed dose, hot/cold spots, and normal tissue doses. The process is no more time consuming, and gives more confidence in source placement, more choices in source activity, and improved displays of isodose distributions. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> 3‐D compatible planning software with CT imaging has allowed this clinic to improve visualization and dosimetry optimization while reducing uncertainty in seed positioning for complex cases of sarcoma brachytherapy. Use of CT additionally creates the potential of combining dose distributions from external beam treatment and brachytherapy to produce composite dose evaluation.</jats:p>",

This study evaluates the efficiency of the AMC method and addresses several issues on implementing it into the MCNP code for potential IMRT treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We compare the difference between an adjoint and a forward Monte Carlo calculations for computing time and dose. By exploring a tally feature (FT card) of MCNP, we then describe a source sampling scheme for multiple ROIs of the patient body in a single adjoint simulation. Two methods are used in this study to speedup the Monte Carlo simulations, which includes a mesh tally speedup and a variant reduction technique (VRT) using importance functions from the adjoint Monte Carlo calculations. <jats:bold>Results and Discussions:</jats:bold> The doses calculated by the forward and the adjoint MC are in a good agreement within statistical uncertainties. After normalized to the same statistical uncertainties, the computing time of the forward run is about 9 times of that of the adjoint run, which clearly demonstrates the computing efficiency of an adjoint simulation over a forward run. We also successfully implemented a source sampling scheme for different ROIs in only one simulation. This facilitates future implementation of an automatic AMC‐based radiation treatment planning system. The VRT reduces the forward MC calculation time by approximately 26.7% for the prostate case. The reduction for the urinary bladder and the rectum is 24.8% and 13.6%, respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The efficacy and efficiency of the AMC method in achieving optimized dose objective have been demonstrated. The potential for the AMC method to be useful in treatment planning of IMRT procedures is particularly attractive because the large number of beam parameters involved.</jats:p>",

Comparison studies were performed using a phantom and a prostate case. Four methods were compared; (1) beamlet optimization, (2) beamlet optimization incorporating smoothing in the cost function, (3) Basis function optimization (BFO) using a radial basis function grid (optimization variables are individual function weights), and (4) BFO using polynomials (optimization variables are term coefficients). Results were compared using dose and dose‐volume metrics, beam modulation, MU, and robustness to geometric deviations. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In the phantom, BFO plans were comparable to beamlet plans in terms of dose and dose‐volume metrics and superior in terms of using 75–90% fewer optimization variables, requiring 26% fewer MU, containing 38% less plan modulation, and demonstrating improved target coverage when subjected to geometric shifts. Beamlet‐based plans that incorporated smoothing met the clinical objectives, with a 16% reduction in MU compared to beamlets. In the prostate, method (3) resulted in a 24% MU reduction compared to method (1) and was less sensitive to geometric changes. Method (2) also produced favorable results in the prostate with a 19% reduction in MU. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> BFO plans were clinically comparable to beamlet plans and superior to beamlet plans with smoothing in terms of MU reduction and lessened geometric sensitivity. The use of basis function sets to represent and optimize IMRT intensity patterns is a promising method to reduce IMRT beam complexity and its implications.

The purpose in this work is to find out the accuracy of a common TPS system in lung dose calculation. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> So far lung dose measurements have been done only in slab geometry and for a single beam. In this work, we used a realistic lung phantom and delivered all fields of realistic IMRT plans. The phantom is supplied with cylindrical inserts, made of lung, bone, and tissue, which were used to load the dosimetry equipments. The dose to the phantom was calculated, for 10 IMRT treatment plans, with the Corvus system. Validation of the calculated dose was performed with LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) measurement, Ionization chamber measurement, and Monte Carlo simulation. For each treatment plan, the dose was verified at points located in lung, bone, and tissue. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The comparison of the collected data shows that the dose to the lung calculated with Corvus was overestimated by 10% relative to the Monte Carlo results, and by 7% relative to the chamber measurements. The TLDs dose results show better agreement to the Monte Carlo results than to the Corvus results. In bone the Monte Carlo agreed well with both TLDs and chamber measurements (within 3.5%) while Corvus dose was 6.5% different. The dose to the tissue shows good agreement (within 2%) between all the dosimetry tools. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The dose calculation accuracy in lung has been estimated for IMRT planning system. It indicates some better dose algorithms might be needed in order to have an accuracy of a few percent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> It has been noted that dosimetric difference due to tissue inhomogeneity is significant for a lung patient. If there is no tissue inhomogeneity correction (IC) made, the treatment plan could mislead treatment. Commercial radiation treatment planning (RTP) systems have the capability to include tissue IC. To utilize IC, each correction method should be reviewed and verified in advance. This study presents the commissioning of tissue IC in the Eclipse RTP system for three methods; Batho power law (Batho), Modified batho (Mo‐Batho), and Equivalent TAR (E‐TAR). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Treatment plans were mapped onto CT images of a lung phantom. Dose was calculated once without IC and three times with different correction methods each time. Doses were measured at three different locations, one inside of the lung in the phantom, one in the body in between lungs, and the last one in the bone. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The results demonstrate that the calculated without tissue IC could be significantly different from the measured dose in the treatment room. This difference varies depending on the extent to which each radiation field passes through inhomogeneous tissues. This study proves that the currently available correction methods reduce the error made due to tissue inhomogeneity. The calculated dose without IC was 5 – 10 % from the measured dose at the point inside of the lung or in between the lungs. The difference ranges 2 – 3 % using Batho, 1 – 3 % using Mo‐Batho, and 0 – 4% using E‐TAR. However, the calculated dose to the point inside of the bone was about 2 – 5 % different from the measured dose regardless of the use of IC. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This study overall favors the use of inhomogeneity correction for treatment plans. Among all correction methods in Eclipse, Modified batho is recommended based on this study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To develop and evaluate a fully automatic atlas‐based image segmentation method for radiotherapy treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A very important part of 3‐dimensional radiotherapy treatment planning is the contouring of normal regions of interests (ROIs). Currently, automatic image segmentation tools provided in treatment planning systems are usually based on edge detection and may not always be satisfactory. Atlas‐based image segmentation is a promising method that uses deformable image registration to register the target images with reference images containing previously contoured ROIs. Atlas‐based image segmentation utilizes all of the information in the images and has the potential to perform better than edge‐detection based algorithms, in which only the edge information is used. The performance of atlas‐based image segmentation relies on the deformable image registration algorithm. We implemented a fast variational deformable image registration algorithm. The algorithm was tested at three common radiotherapy sites: head/neck, chest and pelvis. Physicians manually contoured the ROIs in the reference CT images. The new, randomly selected target images were automatically contoured. The results were evaluated by the physicians. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The entire process was completed in less than 15 minutes using a single CPU computer. The ROI masks were transformed into the new images using the displacement maps from deformable image registration. Contours were regenerated from the ROI masks and imported into the Pinnacle™ treatment planning system. In all three clinical sites, the majority of generated ROI's required only minor further modifications. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Atlas‐based image segmentation is a powerful automatic contouring tool. Our algorithm provides excellent results in a majority of clinical cases. Implementation of atlas‐based image segmentation may reduce the time required by physicians to contour normal structure ROI's in treatment planning. Additionally, it opens up the possibility of standardizing ROI contours, such as the parotid, in head and neck IMRT.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To commission a commercial Monte Carlo (MC) simulation package, NXEGS (Numerix LLC), for photon beam dose calculations. We investigated within NXEGS the EGS4 compatibility mode, fast MC, and post processing (PostP). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We commissioned NXEGS and Pinnacle 6.2b with the same set of measured data. We compared its dose calculation accuracy and efficiency with the collapsed cone convolution algorithm in Pinnacle and the National Research Council EGS4. Dose distributions were compared in three phantoms: a water phantom to check the output and beam profiles; a water phantom with a lung slab to test the inhomogeneity correction; and a water phantom with 1‐ 3 cm diameter cylindrical air pockets to test the PostP algorithm. We also compared fast MC using PostP with Pinnacle for a three‐field lung treatment plan. Number of histories is chosen to give +/− 2% dose accuracy at the isocenter. All doses were converted to cGy per MU. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Fast MC improves computational speed by a factor of ∼10 from the EGS4 compatibility mode. PostP decreases number of histories required and hence the computation time by another factor of ∼10. PostP adds ∼1 minute per 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> dose voxels. Inside the lung slab, fast MC with PostP differed from Pinnacle by ∼0.03cGy/MU with a misalignment of ∼2mm whereas fast MC with PostP agreed within 0.03cGy/MU of EGS4. PostP did not preserve the dose perturbation from ⩾1cm air inhomogeneities. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Without PostP, the accuracy and computational time scaled with number of histories. When we specify ±2% accuracy in the target volume, the dose calculation time using fast MC with PostP is comparable to Pinnacle for a three‐field lung plan. NXEGS fast MC with PostP predicts the dose spread due to electron transport in lung with good accuracy‐to‐speed ratio and is suitable for routine treatment planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We examine commercial land markets in Krakow, Poland over a 10‐year period of transition from socialist management to a market economy. We explore the spatial and temporal evolution of land prices over this period. In particular, we are interested in identifying trends toward or away from centrality, and in discovering whether or not these trends acted on the city center alone or over a set of centers. The data set we employ is uniquely appropriate for this purpose as the densifying force of “highest‐and‐best” use—typically found in market‐oriented cities—was absent under four decades of socialist planning, leaving undeveloped land scattered throughout the city. Free of quality control issues associated with disentangling the value of land from properties in which land and structures are bundled, the data offer a clean assessment of land prices within an urban area. We employ a novel, iterative approach to identify pricing centers—“nodes” of similarly sized residuals—which we interpret as evidence of omitted spatial amenities. Using this approach, we find that the price gradient in Krakow evolved toward concentration, but concentration in several centers rather than in just one. We find that the exclusion of proximity to these centers leads to biased coefficients in the hedonic regressions; we also find that the majority of the apparent spatial autocorrelation in the aspatial regressions results from the omission of proximity to these centers.</jats:p>",

The authors present a conceptual framework and case study of the whole-life effects on business performance. The impacts of charging occur as a sequence of gradually interacting changes, rather than as a single set of impacts, and positive amenity effects brought about through revenue hypothecation occur incrementally, taking years to achieve full effect. In the case study, a Delphi panel of business leaders predicted the time-marching effects of workplace-parking levies and road-user charging over a 24-year period in Nottingham. The findings revealed that the temporal nature of hypothecation results in minor fluctuations in performance for some business sectors in the first few years, but that these tail off as benefits gradually overwhelm disbenefits resulting in modest increases in performance for most sectors in the medium to long term. Many local authorities are reluctant to implement charging interventions due to concerns about economic vitality; it is expected that the results will inform policy and future research in this area. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To define optimum beam orientations in IMRT by geometric analysis of the PTV and OARs using techniques of computer vision. The method is particularly applicable to situations when one or more OARs are adjacent to the PTV and where non‐coplanar beam orientations are employed, but can be used in cases requiring coplanar beams. The selected beam orientations are those that can most effectively yield desirable dose distributions in the PTV, sparing to a maximum extent adjacent OARs. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> For each voxel of a PTV‐OAR interface, Gaussian Invariant techniques are used to obtain the two orthogonal components of a vector that defines a tangent plane. A two‐dimensional histogram of the number of voxels having specific values of those two vector components is formed. Clusters or peaks in the histogram correspond to dominant plane orientations in the interface. Considering the anatomy of a patient whose PTV and OARs have been projected on the surface of a hemisphere, each histogram cluster gives rise to an arc on that surface. Any beam oriented from a point in that arc towards the isocenter is then a possible optimum beam. At the present stage of development, the planner selects one or more optimum orientations for each OAR by using beam's‐eye‐view (BEV) tools. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Initial application of the method to clinical cases yields optimizations that are consistent with current clinical practice, with the geometrically assisted definition of optimal beams taking a small fraction of the time usually needed for that task. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The work presented can be the basis of a nearly full automatic method of optimal beam orientation selection in which dominant arcs on the hemispheric surface are found by a self‐organizing network and the subsequent BEV analyses are carried out automatically by a rule based system.</jats:p>",

Earlier work has been reported on process planning for boring of components with monotonic internal geometry made from bar stock. This paper addresses the more general problem of process planning of parts with nonmonotonic internal geometry from arbitrary given the initial geometry, i.e., from a casting or from a semi-finished stock. With the algorithms developed, we are able to achieve full automation of all aspects of the process plan, including operations sequencing, parameter selection, numerical control (NC) code generation, etc. Thus, it becomes possible to go from design to NC code in a fully automated fashion. In the present work we focus on a tightly defined part family, which results in very simple but robust automation algorithms. This is in contrast to much of the reported work on automated process planning, which generally targets broad part families, leading to complex algorithms that fall short of complete design-to-NC automation.</jats:p>",

Data required by the planning system was collected using equipment and techniques consistent with current recommendations. A series of user defined intensity shapes, were used for initial testing of both energies by comparing calculated and film measured dose distributions. Five multifield clinical plans for each energy were compared to film in axial, coronal and sagittal planes, with an additional ionization chamber measurement at the intersection point of the three film planes. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> When a dual off axis segment is defined by Corvus, a common occurrence in IMRT plans, the segment boundaries may be delineated by up to five different penumbra forming hardware combinations, 1) curved end MLC alone, 2) curved end MLC with backup jaw, 3) backup jaw alone, 4) divergent MLC side face alone and 5) divergent main jaw alone. This implies that both sets of jaws, in addition to the MLCs, must be calibrated to a relative accuracy of 0.2mm. When penumbra 1 and 5 were used in the Corvus pencil beam model, optimum agreement was found between plan and measurements. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The physicist must be aware of leaf and jaw motion constraints that are unique to the Elekta Accelerator and how they are used in IMRT segment delineation by Corvus. When these factors are considered in hardware calibration and beam modeling, dose accuracy of 3% or 2mm is achievable over a range of stringent tests and clinical plans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nearly everyone agrees that traffic congestion and pollution could be reduced by better planning. The problem until now, however, is that planners have found it difficult to integrate conventional land-use and transport data into a single model, meaning planning policies tend to be formulated in isolation from traffic predictions and, more importantly, environmental impacts. This paper describes a new approach, in which a geographical information system is used to combine different data sources, including satellite imagery and modelling techniques, into a single and highly graphic planning, transport and environmental model. It then reports on two applications of the model—one theoretical and one practical—in eastern England. </jats:p>",

This roadmap is called the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG) and can be used to find a path between any two points in an unknown configuration space using only the sensor data. More importantly, the rod-HGVG serves as a basis for an algorithm to explore an unknown configuration space without explicitly constructing it. Once the rod-HGVG is constructed, the planner can use it to plan a path between any two configurations. One of the challenges in defining the roadmap revolves around a homotopy theory result, which asserts that there cannot be a one-dimensional deformation retract of a non-contractible space with dimension greater than two. Instead, we define an exact cellular decomposition on the free configuration space and a deformation retract in each cell (each cell is contractible). Next, we “connect” the deformation retracts of each of the cells using a roadmap of the workspace. We call this roadmap a piecewise retract because it comprises many deformation retracts. Exploiting the fact that the rod-HGVG is defined in terms of workspace distance measurements, we prescribe an incremental procedure to construct the rod-HGVG that uses the distance information that can be obtained from conventional range sensors. </jats:p>",

The first concern is the systematic difference between CT/MRI skin contours and optic surface. The surface image artifacts are removed at the surface reconstruction by setting a limit on jumps at the neighboring facets. The partial‐volume effect and table‐patient movement in CT/MR images are corrected through comparison of the skin contours with an instant surface image without motion and partial‐volume effect. The second concern is that the skin surface is not rigid and it changes with the facial expression such as opening and closing of the mouth. To capture the consistent surface images, we have added a function of continuous monitoring of facial movement. A template‐based image registration and automatic surface alignment using a modified ICP algorithm have characterized the surface shape and landmarks' information and organize them into a reliable representation of the patient head position, which has lead to improve efficiency and robustness in surface‐guided target localization and radiation dose delivery. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Accuracy and precision of &lt; 1 mm and efficacy of &lt; 1 minute have been obtained in phantom experiments and on patients in a clinical trial. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> By using this refixation system, one can directly transform the surface images into the planned treatment position, quickly visualize the anatomical information relative to the treatment machine, and accurately detect the target positioning error in all six degrees of freedom. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Authors are either consultant or employees of the camera company.</jats:p>",

The code was integrated within our in‐house inverse treatment planning system and compared with the TPS (CS) algorithm. Initial testing involved the computation of 6 MV beamlet depth doses for 1×1, 2×2 and 10×10 (100, 1 cm beamlets) in a water phantom. MC and CS calculations were then performed for an example lung treatment plan to examine dosimetric differences between these algorithms. MC statistical uncertainties were on average less than 2% (in the depth doses) for all beamlet calculations. Optimization of beamlet doses is carried out using simulated annealing with quadratic cost functions derived from our clinical protocols. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Beamlet depth doses calculated with MC and CS are in good absolute agreement for field sizes larger than 2×2 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Significant differences exist for 1×1 beamlets because CS is unable to accurately model lateral electron transport. For the example lung plan, much smaller differences were found. This is likely due to the fact that with larger field sizes (∼10×10 cm in the example), effects of lateral electron scattering are much less pronounced. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have implemented a fluence matrix method to perform MC‐based beamlet calculations for IMRT planning. Initial testing for an example lung plan and field sizes larger than 2×2, revealed good agreement between MC and CS. However, larger differences were found for 1×1 beamlets due to lateral electron transport issues. Testing is currently being performed for a variety of treatment plans, spanning a range of field sizes to thoroughly investigate dosimetric differences between MC and CS in IMRT planning.

The accuracy of the algorithms was determined by delivering the clinically relevant treatment plans to the Radiological Physics Center's anthropomorphic thorax phantom. The phantom contained radiochromic film in the three major planes and TLDs in the center of the tumor target. The film data were normalized to the TLD readings.

The phantom contained several small steel BB markers which were used as dose points. The MVCT images were transferred to a commercially available treatment planning system (CMS XiO 4.2, Computerized Medical Systems, St. Louis, MO). Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated from the MVCT data set, and doses (dose rates) were calculated at the phantom dose points using standard 2D, film‐based dosimetry methods. Doses were also calculated using a CT‐based, 3D dosimetry technique in which the brachytherapy source tips and ends were localized directly on MVCT images. Separate experiments were performed to verify the spatial accuracy of the MVCT image reconstruction in‐phantom. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In‐phantom localization accuracy was 0.6 ± 0.3 mm, slightly less than the size of an axial MVCT image pixel and less than half of the MVCT slice thickness. Point doses in‐phantom calculated by 2D and by 3D methods agreed within an average of 1.5%. The techniques developed for successful MVCT imaging in‐phantom can be used to calculate 3D dose distributions in a human patient undergoing a traditional (non‐CT compatible) Fletcher‐Suit implant. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> MVCT imaging allows CT‐based dosimetry planning without the use of special, “CT‐compatible” applicators.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Over the past few years Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is being used to supplement radiation treatment planning by assisting physicians in the determination of gross tumor volume. A number of studies have also been investigating the new possibilities that PET offers, such as guiding the delivery of a non‐uniform dose in the tumor volume. Defining the surface of the tumor is an essential step in these applications; hence we investigated the use of a 3D gradient based technique for tumor volume segmentation. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We applied the gradient based technique to FDG‐PET images obtained with a PET/CT scan of NEMA 2001 body phantom, with three spheres of different diameters whose FDG concentration was varied against an essentially constant surrounding activity. We measured the volume of the spheres gravimetrically, calculated them from the CT scan and we also estimated them from the PET images using three segmentation methods: 1) simple intensity thresholding on the raw PET data, 2) intensity thresholding on the background subtracted PET data and 3) a previously described 3D gradient based method. The obtained volumes were compared with the CT volumes. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The percentage error on volume estimation from the gradient based method varied from 15–38%. It had precision and accuracy similar to the background subtracted thresholding over the whole range of volumes and backgrounds, while it was less accurate than simple thresholding for low background activities, but worked better in regions of high background activity where the simple thresholding fails. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have successfully applied a gradient based volume segmentation technique to a set of phantom images. This method does not require any <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> information, only involves minimal user interaction and most importantly does not depend directly on image intensities. The results are promising, but further work is needed to validate its clinical use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> This research addresses the automatic‐planning of Gamma Knife radiosurgery using auto‐positioning system (APS). We previously reported a morphology‐guided automatic planning model via optimization of dose conformity and minimization of total number of shots with different collimator sizes. In this work, our goal is to develop an optimization model that is adaptive to APS by using shots with same collimator. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Our three‐step optimization strategy is: (1) configure the initial shot set using a combined process of skeletonization and bin‐covering, (2) optimize the relative weight (exposure time) of each shot to improve target coverage while minimizing normal tissue toxicity, and (3) fine‐tune the shot configuration by adjusting shot locations, and adding or deleting shots to further improve the balance between target coverage and normal tissue toxicity. In the weight optimization phase in step 2, an easy‐to‐solve linear fractional program explicitly models the dual objectives and takes into account of dose‐renormalization (i.e., maximum is always renormalized to 100%). The fine‐tuning step explicitly takes into account of shot overlapping, dose renormalization and target shape thus making the tracking of hot spots and estimating the effects of shot movement, addition and/or deletion possible. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We have implemented this optimization model on the Windows‐based platform and have tested it with seven previously treated clinical cases. The target volume ranges from 2.6 to 8.6 cc, while the number of shots used ranges from 13 to 39. Our computer model generates plans in 1‐2 minutes, with compatible quality of physician's plans normally created in 1–4 hours. The target coverage is greater than 95% and PITV ranges from 1.29 to 2.26. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Our computer model can be used for real‐time planning, or for generating an initial plan followed by interactive optimization/fine‐tuning, or for creating multiple plans with different trade‐off objectives.</jats:p>",

The plans were generated manually by an experienced dosimetrist backed up by a team. Essentially the RAPID strand™ seed‐loading pattern was used. Retrospectively the patients were re‐planned with a commercial 3‐D planning system (SPOT‐PRO™ 3.0) using the new inverse planning algorithm (IPSA).

Furthermore, to determine the sensitivity to the response model used for critical structures (maximum vs. mean dose). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> An EUD‐based multicriteria linear programming environment has been developed. In this work, we enforce a tumor minimum dose and compute solutions which efficiently tradeoff the tumor maximum dose and organ‐at‐risk (OAR) EUD (α⋅max dose+(1 − α) ⋅mean dose). Pareto surfaces resulting from different OAR α values are compared. The technique is applied to the RTOG horseshoe target and circular OAR geometry (varying the OAR's size and location), and to two clinical cases. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Mathematically, if the maximum and mean doses of a structure are correlated then the choice of α does not affect the shape of the Pareto frontier. We demonstrate that this correlation is stronger for smaller OARs (a single voxel has a large impact on the mean), and also for symmetrically located OARs, which have a large set of outer ring voxels near the maximum level, as opposed to asymmetrically located OARs where the maximum dose is more localized. As the dose requirements in the tumor get more strict, we see less variance with α, since the feasible solution space is smaller. We consistently see little to no difference between Pareto surfaces for α from 0.5 to 1. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> By characterizing the conditions under which the Pareto frontier is insensitive to α, we highlight situations where it may not be necessary to know the best value of α, i.e., the exact tissue organization between purely serial and purely parallel. In general we see smooth Pareto surfaces but in some cases there were kinks pointing to outstanding treatment plans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To develop an automated, dose‐based IMRT planning technique for tangential breast irradiation and to introduce a novel technique for efficient plan evaluation in three‐dimensions. Method and Materials: Patients were CT‐simulated using an isocentric SAD technique with the medial and lateral tangents designed to encompass the breast tissue. The CT data and the beam information were transferred to the treatment planning system (TPS). The dose was then calculated for standard open equally weighted split beams. The planar dose rate matrix for a beams‐eye‐view plane was calculated and exported to a PC. An in‐house program was developed to rescale this matrix and automatically create a series of dose‐based MLC segments. Creation of the MLC segments took less than a minute. The MLC segments were imported back into the TPS where utilities were used to determine the optimal segment weights. An efficient plan evaluation tool was developed that presented the dose distributions in only three or less cutplanes parallel to the plane formed by the posterior beam border. The mathematical formalism for determining the cutplane orientation will be demonstrated. The planning and evaluation tools were tested on three representative case studies and compared to wedged tangent plans. To ensure unbiased comparison all plans were normalized to identical ICRU Reference Points. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The entire planning process, from CT import to plan completion, took approximately 15 minutes. For all cases studied the IMRT plans demonstrated superior coverage and dose homogeneity as determined by both isodose coverage and the ICRU Conformity Index. Cutplanes through the lung, mid breast, and apex were found to be the most clinically useful. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The automated procedure is able to consistently produce optimized IMRT breast treatment plans within a few minutes. Isodose distributions in three cutplanes parallel to the posterior border are an effective tool for rapid plan evaluation.</jats:p>",

Our new dose shaping algorithm makes the dose of each voxel on the 3‐D dataset proportional to its probability of being inside the tumor over the respiratory cycle. The maximum dose is set to be the prescription dose multiplied by the ratio of the volume encompassed by the extreme positions of the tumor to the tumor volume. We also implemented two other popular approaches: (1) an optimal margin method in which the margin is generated based on the extreme positions of the tumor; and (2) a convolution method that performs 4‐D dose calculations using a modeled tumor motion probability density function. A simulated 4‐D CT dataset, which was generated by superimposing the patient's respiratory motion pattern onto one's 3‐D CT dataset, was used to evaluate the performance of these three approaches via DVH comparison for the inhale phase of the breathing. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Five‐field 6MV beams were used for all plans delivering a total dose of 63Gy in 35 fractions. Comparing to the IMRT plan with optimal margin, the convolution method reduced the mean dose to the ipsilateral lung by 5% while maintaining the same tumor coverage. Compared to the convolution method, our dose shaping method achieved the same lung sparing, but is much faster and has the extra ability to escalate tumor dose: 95% tumor received more than 72Gy. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Dose shaping method is able to spare the healthy lung tissue, and has the capacity to further facilitate dose escalation.</jats:p>",

Now these plans have been exported to phantoms and irradiated with the planned beams by each participating institution. Measurements have been made with an ion chamber at isocenter and film in a coronal plane 1 cm anterior to isocenter to determine the degree of agreement between the TPS dose and the measured dose. Also, the percentage of pixels exceeding a Gamma of 1.0 were tabulated for each system and site. A point system based on rank was applied to both Gamma values and absolute dose agreement for each system and site. The quality of the patient‐based treatment plans was also quantified by a point system based on the ability to meet the stated dose‐volume goals. The total points earned by the plans were correlated to the points earned by the QA results. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>. Both the mean and standard deviation of the differences between measured and calculated absolute dose were within 3%. There was no trend for the Gamma values by site and TPS.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> The incorporation of daily images into the radiotherapy process leads to Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART), in which the treatment is evaluated periodically and the plan is adaptively modified during the whole course of radiotherapy. Deformable registration between the planning image (usually KVCT) and the daily image is the key component of ART. The MVCT is one of the most informative yet convenient daily image modalities. In this presentation, we developed a fast technique for deformable registration between the KVCT image and the MVCT images. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The method is extended from the state‐of‐art deformable registration technique, which is fast and accurate for same modality registration. Considering the higher noise and lower contrast nature of MVCTs, special techniques such as “edge‐preserving smoothing” and “reference based histogram calibration” are applied before the deformable registration process. The whole process is around 2–3 minutes for typical MVCT size (256×256×64) when runs on a single processor PC. We retrospectively studied daily MVCTs from commercial TomoTherapy machines in different clinical centers. These data include 3 lung cases, 5 head‐neck cases, 3 prostate cases and 2 pelvis cases. Each case has one KVCT image and 30–40 MVCT images. We registered the MVCT images with their corresponding KVCT image. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The similarity measures and visual inspection of contour matches by physicians validate this technique. The applications of deformable registration in ART, including “accumulative dose calculation”, “automatic ROI re‐contouring” and “tumor growth/shrinkage monitoring” through the whole course of radiotherapy are studied. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Deformable registration between the KVCT and MVCT images is an essential step towards ART. Through the combination of conventional image processing techniques and the fast intensity based deformable registration, such task becomes feasible. Extensive tests based on the daily MVCT data from the TomoTherapy machines validate such technique. Several key components of ART are developed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: To evaluate BrainLab (BL) IMRT dose distributions for small intracranial lesions by comparing target dose coverage, homogeneity and conformity, and critical structures sparing, as well as agreement with measurements to a clinical Eclipse IMRT system. Method and Materials: Three clinical cases with varying volume lesions enclosing portions of organs at risk (OAR) were planned with BL and Eclipse IMRT modules for dynamic 120‐leaf MLC delivery on a Varian 21EX. Anatomical structures were contoured, and transferred to both systems to ensure a common starting point. Optimization was carried out using identical non‐coplanar beam orientations in combination with similarly specified dose goals and constraints. For two of the cases, highest priority was placed on PTV coverage, while the third required OAR sparing at the expense of PTV coverage. Plans were evaluated by dose‐volume histograms (maximum dose, conformity indices), and isodose lines (hot spots, 50% isodose volume irregularity). BL dose distributions were validated with chamber (absolute dose) and film (fluence) measurements, and Eclipse dose calculations for imported BL dynamic MLC files. Results: Ignoring the superior immobilization of the BL system for patient set‐up, BL and Eclipse IMRT modules provided clinically comparable target coverage and dose homogeneity, with differences in target dose conformity, critical structures sparing, and agreement with measurements. BL plans showed better dose homogeneity up to 5% for the smaller tumors, conformity up to 25% for the larger tumors, and consistently better critical structures sparing up to 11%. Absolute dose measurements were in closer agreement for the BL plans, while selected line profiles through the fluences revealed departures from experiment in the low dose penumbra region for BL plans and high dose/high gradient regions for Eclipse plans. Conclusion: BL and Eclipse IMRT modules generate effective treatment plans with differences requiring further investigation, including determination of their clinical significance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Tissue heterogeneity changes result in a build down/build up of the recoil electron fluence at heterogeneity interfaces. The use of stereotactic radiosurgery beams on small lung lesions can compromise the dose delivery to lesions ranging from 6 mm up through 30 mm in diameter, since the dimensions of the lesions are comparable to the range of the secondary electrons in lung and air. Dose perturbations are evaluated for a range of lesion diameters in lung equivalent phantom material. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Lesion diameters of 6.4, 12.5, 19.7, and 25.4 mm of unit density were inserted into lung equivalent material. The dose distributions were measured with film densitometry and calculated with the dose calculation engine of the ADAC Pinnacle system. The Pinnacle treatment planning system uses the adaptive convolution superposition algorithm, which rigorously reproduces x‐ray beam attenuation, and the electron fluence changes at tissue heterogeneity interfaces. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The physical density of the lung equivalent phantom material is 0.30 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in contrast to water and normal tissue at 1.0 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The spherical tumor phantoms were irradiated with beam margins of 0, 7, 10, and 25 mm. Dose volume histogram analysis was performed to develop a DVH surface map of the dose delivery to each lesion as a function of margin size. It was determined that a 7 mm margin for all lesion diameters delivers a minimum tumor dose of 94 % of the prescribed isocenter dose for all lesion diameters. The DVH analysis and film dosimetry were also compared with the dose calculations of the BrainSCAN planning system. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> These measurements and calculations confirm the clinical feasibility of stereotactic irradiations of lung lesions with minimal compromise of the tumor dose.

However, even when both systems are claimed to be compliant with a standard (e.g., DICOM‐RT), the system‐specific implementations may be incompatible . The purpose of this work is to develop and evaluate tools to seamlessly transfer plans designed on one commercial treatment planning system (TPS) to another TPS and vice versa. <jats:bold>Method and materials:</jats:bold> Pinnacle and Eclipse are the two TPS used in this study. From Pinnacle to Eclipse, a filter to make the Pinnacle DICOM‐RT plans conform to Eclipse implementation was developed. From Eclipse to Pinnacle, a tool to covert a DICOM‐RT plan file to Pinnacle Script file was developed. To evaluate these tools, ten prostate patients planned and treated using IMRT at our institution were used. The 10 IMRT plans were first transferred from Pinnacle to Eclipse, and the doses of the 10 plans were recalculated on Eclipse. New IMRT plans were designed on Eclipse also. The latter were transferred back to Pinnacle and doses were re‐calculated there. Also, optimal fluence distributions generated on Eclipse were transferred to Pinnacle, and the Pinnacle's leaf sequencer was used to generate new leaf sequences. To evaluate the differences between Pinnacle and Eclipse plans, dose and dose‐volume indices were used. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The dosimetric data for the plans transferred to Eclipse from Pinnacle do not differ significantly from the original plans, and vice versa. For plans of similar quality, the ones designed on Eclipse had 56% fewer segments than the plans designed on Pinnacle. The Pinnacle generated 23% more segments than the Eclipse using the same optimized fluence distributions imported from Eclipse. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> DICOM‐RT implementations are often not complete and, therefore, compatible among different commercial planning systems. Special tools are needed to make the plans interchangeable.</jats:p>",

Nine institutions representing twelve IMRT systems participated in this study. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> DICOM RT data sets for prostate, lung, and head and neck cases with target volumes and the organ at risks (OAR) already outlined were sent to each collaborative member. Beam arrangements, dose volume constraints and a maximum grid size were kept constant. For the case of prostate, lung and head and neck cases, 7, 5 and 9 equally placed field arrangements, were chosen for treatment planning using a 6 MV beam. Treatment plans were generated and optimized to meet the benchmark clinical endpoints. Each of the cases was calculated with and without inhomogeneity corrections. The calculated DVH's, phantom plans and measured data were collected and analyzed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Traditionally, utilizing modern treatment planning algorithms, there are significant differences in conformal 3D RTP, especially in head and neck and lung cases. Across all of the systems analyzed in this study, however, our data was quite the opposite. DVH analysis of PTV/CTV and critical organs show virtually identical data for homogeneity corrected vs. uncorrected iterations. The ratio of MU's across several IMRT TPS for corrected and uncorrected iterations for lung and head &amp; neck cases were within 5% of each other. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The overall conclusion from the data analysis reveals that although the target coverage, total MU's, treatment delivery times etc. may vary significantly from one IMRT TPS manufacturer to another, most systems are able to generate clinically acceptable optimal solutions for both homogeneity corrected and uncorrected calculations. More importantly, the variation in target/critical organ coverage for inhomogeneity corrected vs. uncorrected iterations is minimal and the clinical impact of these variations should also be consequently minimal.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the application of EMET using a few‐leaf electron collimator (FLEC) in head &amp; neck, sarcoma, and breast sites in comparison with three dimensional conventional radiation therapy (3D‐CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Treatment planning was performed for a parotid case, a sarcoma case, and a breast case. Three Monte Carlo calculated plans were compared for each case: 3D‐CRT, IMRT, and 3D‐CRT in conjunction with EMET (EMET‐CRT). For all patients, dose volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for organs of interest. For each plan, homogeneity and conformity indices of dose distributions, sparing index (SPIN50/10) that quantifies the conformity of the low isodose lines, and the whole‐body dose equivalent (WBDE) were analyzed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Adding EMET delivered with the FLEC to 3D‐CRT preserves target conformity and dose homogeneity and improves sparing of normal tissues. For the head &amp; neck case the mean dose to the contralateral parotid and brain decreased relative to IMRT by 43% to 84%, and by 57% to 71%, respectively. Improved normal tissue sparing is also quantified as an increase in sparing index of 47% and 30% for the head &amp; neck and the breast cases, respectively. The WBDE for EMET‐CRT was reduced by up to 72% when compared with IMRT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> EMET delivered with the FLEC could be a valuable addition to currently existing treatment techniques especially when applied to superficially located tumors that are inherently difficult to plan using IMRT. The addition of EMET systematically leads to a reduction in WBDE especially when compared with IMRT.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Radiotherapy for lung cancer requires a margin for internal movement of the tumor. Reduction of this margin and thus dose escalation may be possible by using a slow or a respiratory correlated CT (RC‐CT) during radiation treatment planning. In this study these two novel methods are compared to the use of a conventional free breathing CT (FB‐CT). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> On a modified Siemens Sensation 10 an FB‐CT and an RC‐CT scan were acquired in nine patients. The RC‐CT scan was used to measure tumor motion and to reconstruct a CT at 10 respiratory phases (10p‐CT). One of these was termed the mid‐ventilation CT (MV‐CT) and by averaging all CTs, a slow‐CT could be reconstructed. Four treatments were planned based on the FB‐CT (with conventional internal margin); the slow CT; the 10p‐CT, and the MV‐CT (with an internal margin of (motion amplitude)/4). Mean tumor dose was calculated for these four plans for a fixed mean lung dose of 15Gy. The possibility of coldspots (&lt;95%) was investigated by determining minimum tumor dose that occurred during respiration. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The mean tumor dose in the FB‐CT based plan was 74Gy, for the MV‐CT 100Gy, for the 10p‐CT 95Gy, and for the slow‐CT 101Gy (p=0.0001 for FB‐CT vs. other; p=0.12 for MV‐CT vs. 10p‐CT). Coldspots occurred occurred in the patient with the largest tumor motion (15mm amplitude) in the case of a plan based on a slow‐CT scan. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Since radiation treatment planning based on a slow‐CT can lead to underdosage in tumors moving with a large amplitude and the delineation of the 10p‐CT is rather cumbersome, we conclude that using an RC‐CT scan to reconstruct a mid‐ventilation CT and applying a margin of one quarter the tumor motion amplitude, is the most suitable method for radiation treatment planning in lung cancer patients.</jats:p>",
