The behavior of the system is defined as a set of events (event trace) with two basic relations: precedence and inclusion. The attributed event grammar (AEG) specifies possible event traces and provides a uniform approach for automatically generating, executing, and analyzing test cases. The environment model includes a description of hazardous states in which the system may arrive and makes it possible to gather statistics for system safety assessment. The approach is supported by a generator that creates test cases from the AEG models. We demonstrate the approach with case studies of prototypes for the safety-critical computer-assisted resuscitation algorithm (CARA) software for a casualty intravenous fluid infusion pump and the Paderborn Shuttle System.</jats:p>",

Three different families of considerably variable attractors—periodic, chaotic, and rest positions with subsequent chattering—are found. All of them are investigated, in detail, and the response scenario is determined by both bifurcation diagrams and behavior charts of single attractors, and overall maps. Attention is focused on local and global bifurcations that lead to the attractor-basin metamorphoses. Numerical results show the extreme richness of the dynamical response of the system, which is deemed to be of interest also in view of prospective mechanical applications.</jats:p>",

The 'Come Let's Play' approach has demonstrated that scenarios can fully define a system's behavior. In practice, however, the expected behavior defined by scenarios must be achieved in the context of existing components that cannot be changed. Therefore, the scenario-based approach must be reconciled with state-based models. In this paper, we present such an approach for the design of flexible production systems which employs scenarios not only for describing and synthesizing the required system functionality but also for recording observed behavior for analysis or 3D-visualization. We illustrate our approach using an existing material flow system which is a major part of a real production system.</jats:p>",

Geochronology and field geology evidence show that in SW Iberia both styles of mineralization were coeval with widespread metaluminous to peraluminous Variscan magmatism (350–330 Ma). We propose that mineralization was probably related to a hidden large layered mafic–ultramafic layered complex, recently inferred from geophysics, that was emplaced in a mid‐crustal decollement zone. Contamination of a primitive mantle‐derived magma with continental crust in the layered complex led to fractional crystallization accompanied by high‐<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>–low‐<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> metamorphism and the incorporation of volatiles into the melt. Hot hypersaline CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>–CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐bearing brines were subsequently released and focused along major thrusts and strike‐slip faults to produce the IOCG mineralization. Assimilation of continental crust also led to the formation of sulphide magmas that were tectonically injected high into the crust, leading to the formation of pipe‐like breccia‐hosted Ni–(Cu) ore bodies. All these processes took probably place as a consequence of oblique ridge– and/or continent–continent collision.</jats:p>",

Technol. 44, 569 (2003)] in 1998, demonstrates that advanced requirements beyond the standard H-mode for confinement [confinement enhancement factor H98(y,2)&amp;gt;1], stability (normalized beta βN∼3–3.5) and, at densities close to Greenwald density, exhaust can be simultaneously met and maintained stationary for several resistive diffusion times. The q profile is characterized by low central magnetic shear and axis safety factor q0&amp;gt;1 that is obtained by particular heating and current ramp-up scenarios and maintained via benign instabilities. Core transport is still governed by drift-wave turbulence with stiff temperature profiles, but density profiles are more strongly peaked and contribute to the increase in confinement. Neoclassical tearing modes remain small, enabling routine operation up to βN∼3 at international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) relevant collisionalities, for normalized Lamor radii down to four times the ITER value and for a broad range of q95=3.2–4.5. Using tailored heat deposition including central wave heating a compromise was found in density peaking for enhanced confinement and limiting the high-Z impurity concentrations even with a tungsten-coated first wall and divertor. As far as the ITER [ITER EDA Documentation Series No. 24, 2002] relevance of this regime is concerned, its compatibility with significant central electron heating, high edge densities, and type-II edge localized modes is of importance. The GLF23 turbulence model predicts still peaked density profiles and sufficient transport to avoid impurity accumulation. The fusion performance in terms of βNH98(y,2)∕q952 is nearly doubled compared with the ITER base-line scenario at low-q values, while at medium q’s bootstrap current fractions up to 50% and long inductive pulse lengths allow ITER “hybrid” operation.</jats:p>",
