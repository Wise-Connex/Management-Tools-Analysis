      "abstract": "<jats:p> The election of the 'New Labour' government in the UK in May 1997 heralded the start of a new opportunity and era for politics. A determination to modernise the institutions of Britain, associated with a commitment to foster social justice and community with concern for the market, has created a new ethos within government. Led by a Prime Minister viewed as embodying vision and change, the government has started to amend 18 years of Conservative policies structurally, constitutionally and sector ally. The British planning system has changed very little in format and style since its statutory inception in the 1940s, and one would think that this institutional process is an obvious candidate for modernisation. But New Labour possessed very few ideas to amend planning while in opposition, and the proposals announced over the past 24 months that impact on planning suggest continuation rather than radical overhaul. This paper charts the legacy for New Labour in the fields of planning and environmental policy left by the outgoing New Right Major government, and additionally attempts to identify the political ideological ethos and history of policy development behind possible changes to planning. It outlines the major policy amendments announced to date and offers a perspective on the trajectory of planning under a New Labour administration in the years ahead. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTowns and cities are places influx — and this applies equally to their population structure and social make-up. The last few decades have seen an accelerating change in age, household and income structures. Many of the challenges posed by this shift were anticipated by the Ministry for Building, Housing and Urban Development (now the Federal Ministry for Transport, Building and Housing). For example, the „Experimental Housing and Urban Development\" programme experimented with various models for responding to the ageing of the population and to the growing divergence of life-styles. In 1999 a programme was launched jointly by the federal government and the Länder with the title „Urban Quarters in need of special development — the Social City\" with the aim of addressing the growing social polarisation found within towns and cities. This article discusses the actual challenges encountered in implementing this „quarter-orientated” approach. The concept of a „social city” was intended to be driven by an overarching vision and the consent of the civic society, and not simply to be the outcome of a number of piecemeal departmental measures and sectoral policies. It is seen, after all, as a matter not of compensatory but of enabling policy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This method avoids the use of odometry which leads to the accumulation of errors resulting from the robot's \n\nposition computing. We proceed as follows: we create regions inside which the robot detects the same obstacle segments. A node graph represents all the regions and their links. Then a \n\nplanning algorithm is used to find a path which joins a start to a goal region. The final stage consists in applying a robust robot motion control as regards the uncertainties of the environment model. This approach contributes to a control system for indoor robots which is environment referenced. The sensors we deal with are first a continuous laser or ultrasonic scanning system, then a discrete ultrasonic belt whose limits of use we show.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate targeting is important in intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The positional uncertainties of structures with respect to the external beams arise in part from random organ motion and patient setup errors. While it is important to improve immobilization and reduce the influence of organ motion, the residual effects should be included in the IMRT plan design. Current inverse planning algorithms follow the conventional approach and include uncertainties by assuming population‐based margins to the target and sensitive structures. Margin around a structure represents a “hard boundary” and the fact that a structure has a spatial probability distribution has been completely ignored. With increasing understanding of spatial uncertainties of structures and the technical capability of fine‐tuning the dose distribution on an individual beamlet level in IMRT, it seems timely and important to fully utilize the information in the planning process. This will reduce the “effective” margins of the structures and facilitate dose escalation. Instead of specifying a “hard margin,” we describe an inverse planning algorithm which takes into consideration positional uncertainty in terms of spatial probability distribution. The algorithm was demonstrated by assuming that the random organ motion can be represented by a three‐dimensional Gaussian distribution function. Other probability distributions can be dealt with similarly. In particular, the commonly used “hard margin” is a special case of the current approach with a uniform probability distribution within a specified range. The algorithm was applied to plan treatment for a prostate case and a pancreatic case. The results were compared with those obtained by adding a margin to the clinical target volume. Better sparing of the sensitive structures were obtained in both cases using the proposed method for approximately the same target coverage.</jats:p>",

One indicator of this problem is the rise since the beginning of the 1990s — both in absolute terms and proportionately — in the number of young people leaving school without even minimal qualifications — i.e. the certificate of achievement awarded by secondary modern schools, the so-called Hauptschulabschluss. Young males are almost twice as likely to fall into this category as young females; in eastern Germany young Germans are more likely to leave school without qualifications than in the west of the country. The disparities among the various Länder cannot be accounted for satisfactorily solely by reference to per capita spending or class size. Within the three Länder subjected to closer examination, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, there are striking differences from county to county in the percentage of school-leavers who have failed to attain the Hauptschulabschluss. Among a number of different variables which may be assumed to have produced these regional disparities, one which appears to contribute to lowering the proportion of young people leaving school without qualifications is the range of educational opportunities available in a particular county. Counties which consistently record above-average rates for male school-leavers without qualifications are called upon to respond through appropriate educational policies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The future in which we will be operating is likely to be “Me &amp; Co.” in a future which will see us increasingly responsible for our work, career planning and development. Career planning is about getting clear about what you want in your life, your knowledge, skills, abilities and your values, aspirations, wants, needs, dreams, personal style. It involves  self‐analysis and self‐reflection, preferably with the involvement of someone else who can help you. Some people are strategists who are on a career path and very clear about what they want, others want a quick fix, others want a methodical step‐by‐step process, and others want to ponder their options. These preferences can be related to personal style. Some people have not yet caught up with the realities of the 1990s, let alone being prepared for the millennium.

The walking pattern is chosen from a small number of precomputed patterns that together cover a reasonably wide range of possible situations. The overall control strategy is based on the concept of Zero Moment Point.

This work suggests that sometimes offense planning is explicit, systematic, and analytical, while at other times it appears to be implicit and intuitive. The latter style of decision making has been called seemingly unimportant decisions. We attempt to provide an explanation of offenders' implicit decision making and suggest two social cognitive mechanisms capable of generating these types of decisions. We believe that implicit decision making in offenders has the appearance of automaticity, that is, decision making that is implicit, fast, relatively autonomous, frequently associated with a lack of control, effortless, and occurring without conscious awareness. Drawing from diverse theoretical sources, we hypothesize that these types of decisions are generated by underlying automatic goal dependent action plans. More specifically, we suggest that there are at least two types of automatic goal dependent plans evident in offenders' decision making: offense scripts and mental simulations. We draw implications for generating future hypotheses and provide suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith the advancing internationalisation of economic relations, high-value, business-orientated services are coming increasingly to represent the economic base for metropolitan regions. In an environment characterised by a division of labour and regional networks of complementary services, the metropolises, as centres performing global functions, exert impulses on the areas around them. At the same time, the integration of service networks within regional partnerships is coming to be a vital prerequisite for regions to compete successfully on the international stage. The dynamic growth of complementary services is currently leading to the emergence of new economic centres in metropolitan regions which are altering the traditional hierarchical relationships between metropolises and their hinterlands, hitherto defined in terms of dependency. A regional planning strategy should address the new types of interaction between functionally specialised locations and centres within the metropolitan regions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

However, all too often they do not have the resources required to develop a strategy which is thoroughly researched. In such cases marketing measures will almost inevitably fail to meet expectations. A possible remedy is provided by what is referred to as a „knowledge-based system”, which supports economic-development agencies at localauthority level in the search for the right strategy. In processing the information required, which tends in most cases to be either incomplete or „fuzzy”, a key role is played by methods associated with fuzzy logic. Preliminary tests in practice using a system programmed in this way are very promising.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author argues that radical geography needs a political revival. Of many avenues that might be followed, the areas of consumption and commodity chains are taken up for consideration. Revival involves a critique of certain trendy, theoretical approaches prevalent particularly in the study of the commodity—as with postmodern notions of the sign and image space, the new retail geography with its stress on identity, and actor-network theory diverting into nonhuman actants. Although not without potential, these approaches lack critical, political edge, especially in the sense of connecting consumption with production. Liberation at one end is divorced from exploitation at the other. Nets are noticed but not workers. As an alternative, a materialist–semiotic analysis is proposed using the concept of commodity chains. This analysis has greater potential for theorizing connections between consumers and producers in a way that stimulates political praxis as well. Nine strategies for political engagement are proposed, from deconstructing advertisements to direct actions such as boycotts, anticorporate campaigns, and guerilla shopping tactics. The intention is to involve radical geography in a new politics of consumption. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines some key terms in a cultural analysis of economic systems. During empirical research I have concluded that radical geography in the tradition of political economy must employ cultural terms such as symbol, imaginary, and rationality. These terms link the material, through experience and interpretation, to the mental—consciousness, intentionality, and rationality. I argue that culture understood as symbolic practice is compatible with historical materialism in the tradition of Gramsci, Thompson, and Williams. The paper applies cultural materialism to the explanation of economic rationalities and developmental logics by drawing on Weberian sociology. These ideas are exemplified by a brief account of the New England moral economy. The paper concludes by calling for a new type of critical inquiry called cultural economy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the border region where Germany, France, Luxembourg and Belgium meet the orientation towards Europe has a long tradition. Even before the term ‘the Europe of the regions’ was coined, institutions were established in this area to foster cross-border co-ordination in representing regional issues in a Europe which was already growing together. It is now a political objective to create a ‘new architecture’ for the partnerships at various levels. The geographical contours for this have yet to be determined, as has the appropriate administrative and decision-making structure. Alongside these issues, one question which arises is that of the status of this region, which sees itself as a major European border-region, vis-á-vis the metropolitan regions in the vicinity in north-western Europe. What problems and lessons does this situation hold for comprehensive regional planning? How can it contribute towards bringing together the various regional interests? How can a balanced development strategy be arrived at for the entire region against the background of the differences in the structures currently in place? This article shows the unique point of departure in this region which calls for customised solutions to be sought and adopted by the co-operating regional partners. ein Modellraum zu sein für eine die Grenzen aufhebende interregionale Kooperation unterhalb der nationalstaatlichen Ebene. Die beteiligten Staaten müssen sich aber einig sein, dies zu wollen. Die einzelnen Regionen würden sich dann untereinander schon verständigen, wie sie ihr kooperatives Netzwerk organisieren müssten. Ein „Interregionaler Rat der Exekutiven im Saar Lorlux-Raum” ist bereits angedancht.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The paper proposes an explanation for these contrasting responses that is based on the differential planning and completion times of these two categories of investment as well as inflexibilities in changing the planned pattern of investment spending once the project has begun. Empirical support for the explanation is established by contrasting the responses of U.S. residential and structures building project starts and work undertaken to a monetary policy shock. The paper then shows that a calibrated sticky-price monetary business cycle model with multistage investment projects is capable of generating responses to monetary policy that are broadly consistent with those observed empirically.</jats:p>"

Using this definition, and a study of the development of trade and economic policy in Australia, he argues that there is variety of forms of globalisation, a variety of internal reasons for the emergence of policies that enhance globalised forms of economy within countries, and therefore a variety of policy responses to it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The institutional structure and urban policy preferences of the Blair administration have now emerged from the British government's comprehensive spending review. In a series of recent publications, notably from the Department of Transport, Environment and the Regions (DETR) and the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) report Bringing Britain Together, the government places a welcome emphasis on the importance of working with communities and in community economic development. Unfortunately though, these initiatives contrast with a simultaneous commitment to fiscal restraint and work-based labour market policies, which seem to mark continuity. The extent to which the urban policy agenda and institutions are open to influence from community organisations promoting social justice claims that differ from those of government is therefore unclear. This paper uses Healey's 'collaborative planning' approach to explore the potential for the engagement of one such community organisation, Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS), to test the extent to which the new policy institutions are open to influence 'from below'. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Subsidiarity, the principle which says that action should be taken at the lowest effective level of governance, is a potentially powerful concept around which a debate about the optimal assignment of tasks across different administrative levels of the European Union (EU) could be constructed. Its sudden incorporation into mainstream European discourse in the early 1990s provided an unprecedented opportunity for such a debate to take place. However, for various reasons this opportunity was spurned and subsidiarity has since metamorphosed into a technical process of legislative reform dubbed ‘Better Law-Making’. By analysing recent experience in the water sector through the lens of ‘new’ institutional theory, the author reveals that, far from undermining the framework of EU environmental policy, instead, the reforms have led to the tightening of some existing standards, although less important issues are being devolved to national authorities. It is debatable whether the political outcomes of the reform process to date were fully expected or desired by those states that advocated greater subsidiarity in the first place. There is precious little evidence that European environmental governance has moved much ‘closer’ to European citizens as a result of subsidiarity. </jats:p>",

A challenge to the traditional conceptions of the appropriate place and scope of union activity comes from the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and its innovative leadership in the US-based Stop Sweatshops Campaign. Based on an analysis of the shifting locus of power in the garment industry, the union shifted its focus from the point of production to the place of consumption to pressure retailers who set prices within the industry. This strategy, which fulfills the prophecy of the consumptive turn earlier this century, applies a new geography and politics to labor struggles, and forces labor geographers to consider anew the relationship between consumption and production in our understanding of the changing economic landscape. </jats:p>",

Interestingly, this blueprint for the future development of the country was prepared by Canadian consultants, under the auspices of Inter‐American Development Bank funding, and thereby ostensibly represents the rolling back of the State in the context of physical development planning. The paper briefly examines the origins of town and country planning in Barbados and the wider Caribbean before critiquing the Third Plan produced in 1998. Emphasis is placed on salient issues such as operationalising sustainable development, the involvement of local stakeholders, the role of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) in the planning process, and the production of Community Plans. Throughout, it is shown that whilst the State appears to have been “rolled back”, government has retained its strong‐hold over the course of physical development planning, principally by “tactics” which have served to minimise the degree to which members of the public and non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) have been able to participate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Virtual Wedge (VW) is a Siemens treatment modality which generates wedge‐shaped dose distributions by moving a collimator jaw from closed to open at a constant speed while varying the dose rate in every 2 mm jaw position. In this work, the implementation and verification of VW in a radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP) system is presented. The VW implementation models the dose delivered by VW using the Siemens monitor units (MU) analytic formalism which determines the number of MU required to generate a wedge‐fluence profile at points across the VW beam. For any set of treatment parameters, the VW algorithm generates an “intensity map” that is used to model the modification of fluence emanating from the collimator. The intensity map is calculated as the ratio of MU delivered on an axis point, divided by the monitor units delivered on the central‐axis MU(0). The dose calculation is then performed using either the Clarkson or Convolution/Superposition algorithms. The VW implementation also models the operational constraints for the delivery of VW due to dose rate and jaw speed limits. Dose verifications with measured profiles were performed using both the Clarkson and Convolution/Superposition algorithms for three photon beams; Siemens Primus 6 and 23 MV, and Mevatron MD 15 MV. Agreement within 2% or 2 mm was found between calculated and measured doses, over a large set of test cases, for 15, 30, 45, and 60 degree symmetric and asymmetric VW fields, using the manufacturer's supplied <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9030-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9030:mp9030-math-0001\" /> and <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> values for each beam.</jats:p>",

For the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI, Darmstadt, a quality assurance program for the treatment planning system (TPS) has been developed. It covers the development and updating of software, data protection and safety, and the application of soft‐ and hardware. The tests also apply to the geometrical precision of imaging devices and the geometrical and dosimetrical verification of dose distributions in different phantoms. The quality assurance program addresses acceptance and constancy tests of the treatment planning program. Results of the acceptance tests served as a basis for its governmental approval. Two main results of the acceptance tests are representative for the overall performance of the system. (1) The geometrical uncertainty that could be achieved for the target point definition, setup accuracy, field contouring, and field alignment is typically 1.5 mm. The uncertainty for the setup verification using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR's) is limited to 2 mm. (2) The mean deviations between measured and planned dose values is 3% for standardized cases in a water phantom and up to 6% for more complicated treatment configurations.</jats:p>",

The first part of the work is devoted to the commissioning of BEAM for a 6 MV photon beam and to the optimization of the linac description to fit the experimental data. This step also involves a comparison with radiochromic film data on an inhomogeneous phantom built to simulate electronic nonequilibrium conditions. Commissioning the selected photon beams required a careful description of the treatment head and the fine tuning of physical parameters such as electron beam energy and radius. The second part shows the dose comparison for real patient's CT data sets: A mediastinal treatment and a breast treatment were simulated. Doses in terms of absolute values per monitor unit were calculated based on the BEAM simulation of the CT data sets. For comparisons of real‐patient cases, differences between the treatment planning system and BEAM ranged from 0 to 2.6% and were within ±2 standard deviations for the dose calculated at the prescription point. Dose‐volume histogram analysis indicated that there is no consistent difference between the Monte Carlo and the convolution calculations. On the basis of the results presented in this study, we can conclude that the CCC algorithm is capable of giving results absolutely comparable to those of a Monte Carlo calculation, as far as common 3D radiotherapy planning is concerned.</jats:p>",

The south Bronx was among the most heavily damaged areas. Here we analyze and compare the interrelationships between socioeconomic factors, housing, demographics, and two health outcomes (low-weight birth rate and homicide rate) in the southwest Bronx and in Upper Manhattan (Harlem, Washington Heights, Inwood), using standard statistical methods as well as the Ives amplification factor employed by ecologists. Upper Manhattan showed much stronger and less ‘resilient’ relationships between these factors than the southwest Bronx, that is, a system of tight ties which amplifies external perturbations. It indicates vulnerability to impacts such as economic decline, changes in municipal service provision, and ‘welfare reform’. We hypothesize that the looser, and more resilient, system of the southwest Bronx and the brittle system of Upper Manhattan arose from their different histories of catastrophic urban decay, a highly ‘path dependent’ evolutionary process affecting a social system, subjecting it to extreme selection pressures on the underlying social network structure. The difference has profound policy implications. </jats:p>",

The integration of cortical activation information into radiosurgical treatment planning may provide an alternative to prevent or minimize radiation damage to eloquent cortex. A novel approach of directly integrating the fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain map into treatment planning is proposed. Three brain tumor patients have been studied using this method with motor and/or visual paradigms. Brain activation was demonstrated in eloquent cortex at the precentral gyrus (motor area) and medial occipital lobe (visual area). The activation maps were transferred to a treatment planning workstation, (XKnife), and 3D (three‐dimensional) activation maps were generated and co‐registered to a 3D CT (computed tomography) anatomical data set, which provided the calibration localizer, for treatment planning. Radiosurgery was designed based on both functional and structural information by the medical team consisting of a radiation oncologist, a neurosurgeon and a physicist. The average maximum dose for the tumor was 2113 cGy. The average maximum dose for tissue surrounding the tumor was 1600 cGy. The average dose with fMRI information to the eloquent cortex was 163.4 cGy over three patients, while without fMRI information it was 240.5 cGy. The average percentage dose reduction over three patients is 32%. The results suggest that using this method can reduce the dose to the eloquent cortex. This approach provides the physician with additional information for treatment planning and may spare the patient unnecessary radiation exposure to adjacent eloquent cortices.</jats:p>",

This reduction makes it at the same time possible to decrease the demands of the situation and to increase the cognitive resources available to master it. Two main strategies to reduce the complexity are described: the strategies that narrow the spatiotemporal field and the ones that broaden this field. These strategies are linked to the expertise of the; operator and to the dynamic characteristics of the situation. Some implications in the design of computer supports are suggested. </jats:p>",

Increasing market demands concerning service has to be managed, often within reduced time space and decision latitude. This paper reports findings from studying scheduling in a Swedish sawmill with the twofold aim to describe and analyze scheduling work and to assess ergonomic work analysis as a method for this. The conclusions drawn were that sawmill scheduling work was complex and that the scheduler was exposed to a high degree of uncertainty. The scheduling in practice was performed by a group of people, relating to different parts of the entire business processes in the company. The scheduling tools, developed by the individual schedulers, were efficient and flexible complements to the MPC-system. Finally, ergonomic work analysis proved to be a useful method for analyzing scheduling work, although there may be difficulties in distinguishing between the prescribed work and work as it is actually carried out. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is becoming increasingly important to understand the social and economic circumstances under which schools operate. Benchmarking school performance targets, contextualising performance outcomes, and Ofsted inspections all rely upon measures of the socioeconomic status of school populations. These tend to utilise administrative data—such as the percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals—or census data for the ward or neighbourhood of wards in which a school is located. This last approach brings to bear the remarkable wealth of information contained within the census, but it suffers from the fact that schools seldom draw their pupils exclusively, or even predominately, from their immediate hinterlands. The authors discuss a method of estimating the socioeconomic characteristics of school populations which, using a program called NCP Profiler to link individual pupil postcodes with census data at the enumeration district level, is sensitive to the manner in which schools actually recruit students—an increasingly important consideration as the quasi-market in education leads to the effective dismantling of geographically defined school catchment areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reports the results of the first household survey ever conducted in Jordan Badia to include questions on knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) among 15–49 currently married women in Jordan Badia toward family planning. The Jordan Badia is the eastern part of Jordan populated by Bedouins who make up about 7 to 9 percent of the 4.8 million total population of Jordan. Using convenience sampling procedure, a total of 450 respondents, 50 from each of nine villages, were selected for participation. The mean age of the study population was 30.9 years and the women's age at marriage ranged from 13 to 35 years, with a mean age at first marriage of 16.8 years. More than 37 percent of the women were illiterate. Over 91 percent of the women know about family planning, but proportions of ever-users or currently-users of contraception are found to be 35.7 percent and 31.7 percent respectively. The social support network, including the husbands, mothers, and mothers-in-law, was explored. Husbands' support for family planning was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.001, Chi Square test, df = 2) than the support of both the mothers and mothers-in-law. In view of the limited data-based literature in the area of family planning, findings of this survey can assist in the formulation of culturally appropriate population policy and viable family planning programs for this Bedouin community. Based on the results of this KAP survey, appropriate recommendations aiming at increasing the demand for family planning services among women in Jordan Badia are provided. </jats:p>",

A second objective was to analyze the demands that were made on the production scheduling system from the production teams to be able to fulfill their work requirements. Conclusions drawn were that a change in production scheduling was necessary if the production teams were to fulfill the demands put on them and that production through the decentralization was empowered to demand such change.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The potential influence of changes in productivity is explored for each sector in each country on the intercountry Leontief-inverse of the European Union (EU) for two time periods, 1970 and 1980. The methodology employed is a weighted variant of the field of influence of column change; the empirical outcomes will be analyzed in three ways. First, the impact of comparable changes in productivity in every sector will be estimated in terms of its contribution to the aggregate value of the Leontief-inverse as well as on its spatial structure. From this estimation, propulsive sectors are identified as those sectors that produce the largest increase in the overall interdependence between all sectors in all EU-countries. Moreover, the propulsiveness of sectors will be spatially decomposed into four components: a ‘domestic’ effect, an ‘intercountry-spillover’, an ‘intercountry-return’, and a ‘rest of the EU’ effect on sectoral interdependence. Second, the analysis will examine how the columns of the intercountry Leontief inverse would change as a consequence of EU-wide changes in technology. This process will enable the identification of ‘reactive’ sectors, those sectors whose multipliers are most sensitive to EU-wide factor productivity increases. Third, the rows of the intercountry Leontief-inverse are considered in terms of their changes as a consequence of EU-wide changes in productivity. This approach identifies ‘dependent’ sectors, those sectors whose production level is most sensitive to overall changes in productivity within the EU. </jats:p>",

The MokSAF interface agent links an Artificial Intelligence (AI) route planning agent to a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through this agent, the user specifies a start and an end point, and describes the composition and characteristics of a military platoon. Two aided conditions and one non-aided condition were examined. In the first aided condition, a route-planning agent determines a minimum cost path between the specified end points. The user is allowed to define additional “intangible” constraints that describe situational or social information. In the second aided condition the same knowledge of the terrain is used to plot the best route within bounds specified by the user. In the control condition the user draws a route without help. The reported study found across the board advantages for agent-based aiding when routes were merged in a team-planning task. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In general terms, traditional strategic planning may be described as a mechanism for generating a set of targets and approaches for achieving the established purpose of an organization. For it to be effective, a strategic plan must serve as the basis for creating a set of well‐defined operations that align with the organizational goals and strategies. Because the task of generating an effective plan requires knowledge, time, patience, and persistence, not all organizations are prepared to devote the time and energy that is required to produce a meaningful plan. It is the intent of this paper to describe an approach to quality planning which was used to make major curricular changes in the first‐year engineering education program at Texas A&amp;M University. The planners' intention in this instance was to apply quality function deployment matrices, systems engineering concepts, quality management principles, and multi‐attribute utility analysis to the evaluation of curriculum alternatives in an effort to make the planning process less complex and more systematic.</jats:p>",

In particular, FOPA was designed to address difficulties in solving en route sequencing problems (combining multiple streams of traffic into a single stream heading for a destination). We compared the planning performance of 12 full performance level air traffic controllers using either the FOPA interface or normal flight progress strips. Planning performance was significantly better when using FOPA; subjective workload was also reduced. The results indicate that a key advantage of FOPA lies in its dynamic linkage between the flight organizer screen where aircraft tokens can be categorized into color-coded blocks and their matching spatial representation on the radar. </jats:p>",

However, some of the latter, such as schwannomas, had high SUVs so that biopsy or wide resection was selected as the first operation. Thus, some other quantitative analysis may be required for preoperative planning in cases of high-SUV neurogenic benign tumours. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the RNA message of a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, phosphohexose isomerase (PHI)/autocrine motility factor, was augmented in only high FDG-uptake lesions, suggesting that a high expression of the PHI message may be associated with accumulation of FDG in musculoskeletal tumours. </jats:p>",
