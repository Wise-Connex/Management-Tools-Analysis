      "abstract": "<jats:p> Resonant spin-flavor precession scenario with twisting solar magnetic fields has been confronted with the solar neutrino data from various ongoing experiments. In particular, the anticorrelation apparent in the Homestake solar neutrino data has been taken seriously to constrain the twisting profiles of the magnetic field in the convective zone of the Sun. The twisting profiles, thus derived, have been used to calculate the neutrino detection rates for the Homestake, Kamiokande (super-Kamiokande) and the gallium experiments. It is found that the presence of twisting reduces the degree of anticorrelation in all the solar neutrino experiments. However, the anticorrelation in the Homestake experiment is expected to be more pronounced. Moreover, the anticorrelation of solar neutrino flux emerging from the southern solar hemisphere is expected to be stronger than that for the neutrinos emerging from the northern solar hemisphere. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A general dynamical system approach to classical self-consistent scalar field cosmology is presented in the framework of spatially flat FLRW space–times, for arbitrary potentials and arbitrary non-minimal coupling. We show that these universes cannot undergo chaotic behaviors, thus suggesting a possible new role of inflation in cosmology. An unexpectedly involved topology of the phase-portrait of the cosmological dynamics is exhibited: Dynamically forbidden regions, playing a crucial dynamical role, appear. A new exact critical solution, a heteroclinic orbit, connects two de Sitter inflationary regimes. We suggest a novel intriguing semiclassical cosmogenesis scenario in which the quantized scalar field could tunnel through the classically forbidden region, from the Minkowski space–time towards the nearest classically allowed solution: The critical one. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the improvements in child safety products with better government regulations, children continue to be victims of defective or improperly used child nursery equipment. According to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an estimated 80,000 children under age five are treated every year in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries related to child nursery equipment. Among child nursery equipment, stroller-related accidents caused the most serious injuries to children along with baby walkers and child safety seats. As such, an in-depth accident investigation was needed to find ways to reduce the number of injuries and provide more stringent safety specifications in the design of the stroller. The objective of this study is to identify the accident mechanisms and patterns of stroller-related injuries for designing safer products. In this study, we proposed a Systematic Accident Scenario Analysis (SASA) method, which provides a formal and systematic scheme to devise accident scenarios while maintaining objectivity. </jats:p>",
