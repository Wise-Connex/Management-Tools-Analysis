The important distinction between the concept of packages per se and the particular models used therein is emphasised. Particular reference is made to the improved Urban Transportation Planning System (UTPS) package of the US Department of Transportation (1977). </jats:p>",

This has led to a conclusion that offshore projects are something special. They are not. The main object of this paper is to show that a successful control of both planning, progress and cost of a large offshore project can be obtained by simple and well known planning techniques.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>During the period 1973 and up till now Aker Group has built or completed 7 gravity structures + 2 jackets for the North Sea.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>These projects have all been in the range of 0,5 - 4 million man hours. Up till 1973 Aker Group was mainly a shipbuilding company. During our first projects (Beryl A and Brent B) we experienced that our projects (Beryl A and Brent B) we experienced that our existing planning technology was not suitable for offshore projects. This was mainly because our existing system was developed for products with a rather firm scope of work. Our new products for the oil industry, had to be constructed while they were developed and engineered.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>During the course of the projects we felt rather confused. Neither planning nor progress reporting were under control. The budgets followed the same trend.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Based on this experience, we had two choices:To develop or buy a new planning systemModify our existing system.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>We chose to do the latter.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes our system. It is based on the following main parameters:It shall be simple and logicalIt shall suit both planning, progress control and cost controlIt shall be possible to use, both computerized and manually.It shall be hierarchal.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The system (and also this paper) is very simple. \"Experts\" have tried to mystify the planning and control technique. But the basic philosophy planning and control technique. But the basic philosophy of planning is always the same. One describes one piece of work to be done, and tries to estimate the piece of work to be done, and tries to estimate the manhours in that connection. If you do that for all activities, you have a plan for the whole project. The planning technique only describes how you arrange these activities.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>THEORY AND BASIC CRITERIAS</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The planning procedures are developed for a project. For a contractor to the North Sea, this means to design, engineer and construct a structure, a plant or a platform. The project has a clear completion time (generally strict) and the total work is rather extensive from 300,000 to millions of manhours. The procedures shown here will be too complicated to involve in full, if a project is of small nature.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Aker uses EDP for many purposes. We have a complete EDP registration system for manhours.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This enables us to sort all manhours invested in a project into different kind of parameters. They can be project into different kind of parameters. They can be sorted pr. trade, pr. subcontractor, pr. area etc. We also have totally computerized systems for planning, based on a CPM technique. With correct activity definitions, this enable us to sort planned activities into the same criterias.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>For material take-off and material control we use a combined computerized and manual system. When ordering and controlling purchase deliveries, we use computer systems, for the actual take-off of material pr. work order, we mostly do it manually. To save time for sorting of data in a larger project, computerized systems are a great advantage.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Another basic criteria for a planning and control system is that the project manager has authority and communication line to all parties involved in a project. Anybody, who performs actions which have an input to the progress, must report to the same system.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 31</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Figure 1 shows its location in relation to other North Sea fields. The largest part of the field lies within the Norwegian Blocks 33/9 and 33/12 but a significant portion extends into United Kingdom Block 211/24.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The field was discovered in March 1974 by the Statoil-Mobil Group. operators for the Norwegian license 037. with their first wildcat Well 33/12-1. The discovery well encountered the Brent sand at 2382 m with an oil/water contact at 2584 m subsea. This contact has since been confirmed and is used as the field oil/water contact in the Brent sand. The well was located near the structural crest and produced oil which was undersaturated by approximately 1500 psi at the pressure datum depth of 2469 m. No gas cap was found and from the well location it was concluded that none existed in the reservoir. This has since been confirmed by other wells.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The confirmation well, 33/9-1, was drilled early in 1974. It encountered the Brent Formation with a full oil column and confirmed the productivity of the sand. The second major reservoir, the Statfjord, was discovered by the third well, 33/12-2, which found a partial Brent formation at 2458 m and the Statfjord Sand at approximately 2680 m with a full productive column. The Statfjord Sand oil/water contact was established at 2803 m subsea using the highest known water in Well 33/9-1 and lowest known oil in Well 33/12-2. As in the case of the Brent Reservoir, no gas cap was observed. The reservoir crude from the Well 33/12-2 tests was undersaturated by over 2700 psi at the datum depth of 2701 m and it was therefore concluded that the reservoir had no gas cap.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It was discovered in October 1970, when oil-bearing Palaeocene sandstones, (in what has subsequently been named the Forties Formation, Ref. 1) were encountered in an anticline at 2100m subsea. Four appraisal wells, drilled during 1971–1972, proved the existence of a major oilfield with an area of some 90 sq km and a first estimate STOOIP of 4600 million bbl.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Pre-development stratigraphical and structural knowledge of the field has already been published (Ref. 2 and 3). The Forties Formation can be split into two lithologically distinct sequences - an upper predominantly sandy sequence and a lower interbedded sandstone and shale sequence. These are now referred to as the Sandstone and Shale Members of the Forties Formation (Figure 2). The Sandstone Member contains most of the Forties oil.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A model of sand distribution was constructed from available appraisal well and seismic data (Figure 3). Three significantly different areas of sandstone development were identified within the Field. These were:Central and Northern area - Very good reservoir characteristics and potential aquifer support.Western area - Good reservoir development, but subject to more variability.Southern and southeastern - Very poor sand development.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The reservoir rock and fluid data were quite favourable to oil production although the reservoir crude was highly undersaturated.

This paper will describe the preliminary planning during the year up to project preliminary planning during the year up to project approval, a comprehensive effort which included:–Selecting the number and location of delineation wells.–Reserves estimates and productivity analysis.–Analysing development options, principally platform type, offtake method and use of subsea wells.–Preliminary design of platform and producing facilities.–Selecting design and project management contractors.–Estimating costs.–Planning and scheduling.–Economics, with emphasis on sensitivity and risk analysis.–Partner and government relationships.–Project management philosophy and organization, incorporating results of a study of earlier North Sea projects.–Obtaining project approval.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper provides a check-list of the many things that must be done and one set of methods used to analyse, justify, and prepare to execute a major North Sea development project. It should be useful for others contemplating a very large offshore development project either in the North Sea or elsewhere.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper presents preliminary results of the study at a stage approximately half-way through the scheduled project life.

Many of the early projects were launched in those euphoric times just before or after the 1973/74 oil embargo when oil prices were shooting up and security of crude supply had highest national priority. As a consequence of the haste with which priority. As a consequence of the haste with which these projects were undertaken and the period of rapid inflation in which they were built, most project schedules were extended a year or more and budgets overrun by factors of two to three.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In terms of their primary goals, the early projects were successful. Oil is flowing, balances of projects were successful. Oil is flowing, balances of payments have been improved and project economics are payments have been improved and project economics are attractive. But the well-publicised slippages and overruns left a legacy of management scepticism on initial estimates and schedules that have brought about a ouch more deliberate approach to the \"second generation\" projects.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This is a case history of the beginnings of the Murchison Project, one of the second-generation North Sea oil developments. It covers the period prior to actual project commencement, beginning with discovery in August, 1975 and ending with management approval to proceed with design and construction in September 1976.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 7</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

A hierarchic-distance metric is developed for New Zealand and this is used in an interaction model to predict the pattern of Auckland manufacturers' sales linkages, which are then compared with similar predictions generated from the same interaction model and a linear transportation model employing a cost-distance metric, and the results of all the models are compared with surveyed patterns of sales linkage. The use of the hierarchic metric is found to enhance the explanation of observed patterns of sales linkage, a finding which holds important implications for explanations of the location of economic activity in general. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Family allowances designed to promote maternal and child health and welfare could be self-defeating if they stimulated otherwise unwanted births, as often assumed. That assumption, with its public health and demographic implications, needs testing. An attempt to test it was made in Chile in 1969--1970 through interviews with 945 wives receiving an allowance and 690 non-recipients. Recipients practiced contraception significantly more than did non-recipients. This was not explained by wives' educational attainment or employment, the couples' earnings, or number of living children, but was associated with a 50 per cent greater utilization of professional prenatal care by recipients during the most recent pregnancy; women with such care (regardless of allowance status) were 75 per cent more likely than others to control their fertility. Prenatal care was probably sought more by recipients in part because an additional stipend was provided as soon as pregnancy was confirmed, usually at clinics with integrated family planning. Greater family income, attributable to the allowance, probably also contributed to the recipients' better prenatal attention and to contraceptive practice. Noteworthy, too, was the finding that with the number of living children controlled, contraceptive practice was significantly greater amoung couples who had never lost a child. </jats:p>",

It can lessen the learning curve for drilling in a particular area and assist in the training of inexperienced drilling personnel.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Over the past three years, 72 directional wells have been post-analyzed in detail. Sixteen of these have been in the North Sea. From this work, a simple technique has evolved to post-analyze a well in such a manner that the complex interactions of the key variables are understood. These include: weight-on-bit, rotary speed, penetration rate, hole inclination and direction, geology, bits, and bottom hole assemblies. Post-analysis can be used to assess whether the trajectory changes were man induced or caused by the geology. This type of post-analysis does not require the use of a computer program.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A computer program is necessary to analyze the complex behavior of the bottom hole assembly. A finite element algorithm was developed to do this. The program was designed to calculate the three-dimensional forces and displacements associated with any bottom hole assembly subjected to axial loading in a borehole. The borehole can either have a constant or variable inclination and direction. The program can be used to analyze bottom hole assemblies of wells that have been drilled (post-analysis) and/or help plan bottom hole assemblies in future wells.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Further applications of the post-analysis technique is the evaluation of a trajectory change using a bent sub with a mud motor or by jetting with the pumps. A new useful method of evaluating the ideal performance of a mud motor correction run is presented with examples.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A complete development of the post-analysis technique is presented. An interpretation of a typical directional well that has been post-analyzed is cited. Application of the computer program to evaluate some of the assemblies that were run in the example is covered. A new technique to analyze and plan deflection tool runs for any inclination angle is presented with examples.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In 1972, a research project to optimize directional wells was initiated which required detailed drilling information. The normal drilling data was available from drilling recorder charts, bit and mud records, and tour sheets. However, detailed information on bottom hole assembly (BHA) configurations, dimensions and where the assemblies were run was virtually non-existant or not usable. Detailed data of weight-on-bit and rotary speed was also scarce. Forms specially designed for directional wells were drafted and sent out to the field for completion. Response was good. Within two years, detailed drilling data on more than 50 wells had been accumulated. Data was obtained from the Gulf of Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, Canada, Michigan, the North Sea, Trinidad, Iran and Holland.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>By 1974, the effort to understand the mechanism of directional drilling had not significantly progressed. Between 1972 and 1974 an approach was taken to physically observe the directional drilling operation and learn by experience, like a directional driller. The outcome was that the observer became an excellent directional driller, but a full understanding of the total mechanism of the variable's interaction was not learned.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>One of the major difficulties in interpreting trajectory behavior was the lack of being able to accurately analyze the bottom hole assembly behavior. To alleviate this deficiency, a computer program was developed that would calculate the three-dimensional displacements and forces for any type of bottom hole assembly. To do this a finite element algorithm was used.1</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The first round of post-analysis using the new program was very disappointing. Results in most part did not agree and in some cases were completely out of phase. However, it was this work that led to recognition of the importance of hole curvature on the bottom hole assembly response.2</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Subjective labelling by the researcher assumes that his judgments correspond to those of the respondents and is unsatisfactory. Identification of the dimensions needs to be based upon information gathered from the respondents themselves and in terms of the manner by which they were originally construed. Such information can be derived from the use of the repertory-grid test, which, like multidimensional scaling, requires subjects to make judgments of similarity between objects. The repertory-grid test also provides verbal labels for the distinctions that are made. A principal-components analysis of the repertory-grid data provides a number of components which are shown to be equivalent to the dimensions derived from multidimensional scaling. The use of component scores that relate to the verbal labels allows the dimensions to be identified in terms of the evaluations and perceptions of the respondents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A model of the probability of moving which incorporates aspects of the independent-trials process, the stage in the life cycle, and the concept of cumulative inertia is formulated. The model is based on the interaction of two forces. On the one hand there is a certain resistance to moving (cumulative inertia) and on the other the household may be dissatisfied with certain attributes of the present dwelling and its surroundings (residential stress). The probability of moving is a function of the resultant of these two conflicting forces. The model is designed not only to predict who will move (those individuals with high residential stress relative to their resistance to moving), but also to predict how an individual's probability of moving is likely to change over time. Some simple and limited simulations suggest that the model will capture rather well the different kinds of mobility rates which are observed from empirical data sets. </jats:p>",

A conceptual basis is discussed which contrasts simple areal aggregates with genuine ‘objects of interest’. It is suggested that the daily urban system is the candidate which best meets these criteria for a meaningful areal unit for census-data presentation. </jats:p>",

This is chiefly because the number of neurosurgeons at present available is small in relation to the tasks. Many cases must therefore be in the care of general or orthopaedic surgeons, especially in country centres, and it is important that these surgeons should have some basic neurosurgical training. The Neurosurgical Society of Australasia wishes to formulate a programme to ensure that opportunities for such training are available throughout Australia. This programme should also embody a national plan for research into the treatment and prevention of neurological trauma.</jats:p>",
