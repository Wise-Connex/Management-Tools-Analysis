      "abstract": "<jats:p>As with post‐World War II economic policies, boom or bust are terms which can be applied to the birth rate. For those of us who are baby boomers, used to our place in the demographic spotlight as a focus for endless “what do young people want?” media features, the realization that marketing attention is switching to a new baby bust generation comes as something of a shock. After record births between 1946 and 1964, the rate decreased dramatically between the years 1965 and 1980. This new generation is entering the workforce <jats:italic>en masse</jats:italic> (albeit a smaller mass than in previous years) about now. Their new‐found spending power is having an impact in consumer markets causing marketers to ask the question “what do young people want?” and causing baby boomers everywhere to realize that, once again, a generation gap has opened up.</jats:p>",

The evolution of housing adjustment theory is divided into four stages: (1) the earlier models of rural-to-urban migration, (2) the models of intraurban mobility, (3) the models of the nonmoving adjustment decision, and (4) the more comprehensive models of housing adjustment that include both moving and nonmoving adjustment mechanisms within a single framework. The implications of these models for planningand policy arediscussed, along with suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The ancient Greeks could not afford inefficient and impractical cities. This one insight has guided my research ever since I attended the International Water Resources Association conference in Rome in 1986 and learned how concerned modern water engineers and policymakers are about careful utilization of water resources. We twentieth century Americans can afford waste, because we are both rich and spendthrift. But the ancients were living very close to the edge in an ecosystem that sustains human life only if it is carefully, respectfully managed. How successful they were in city site selection and in city building is evident from the fact that so many of their cities survived for such long times—Athens nearly 5000 years; the great capital Byzantium-Constantinople-Istanbul since the eighth century B.C., a lifespan of about 2800 years; and even obscure towns like Morgantina, Sicily, for 450 years. Given a hot and semiarid Mediterranean climate with rain only in the winter months, careful attention to water supply and distribution was essential for a Greek city. As long ago as the second millennium B.C., the Mycenaeans who lived in mainland Greece and the Minoans of Crete took great care of the water supply and drainage of their sites, using cisterns, wells, pipelines, rock-cut channels, and so on (Evans, 1964 reprint, vol. I, 103–05, 141–43, 333–36, 378–84, 389–98; Broneer,1939, 317–433; Mylonas 1966; Knaus, Heinrich, and Kalcyk, 1980). Because of the gap in the archaeological record, we cannot be sure whether any of their knowledge about water management survived the collapse of these civilizations and the 400 years or so of the “Dark Ages” that followed. Some ideas such as cisterns seem to be both so basic and so easy for a single family to execute, that it is likely their use persisted no matter how primitive conditions became. Others, such as the use of pressure pipes, seem to require a fairly sophisticated society and probably the existence of a group of architect-engineers to carry out the building process, and therefore we would not expect them to survive but to be independently re-invented when later Greek society reached technological sophistication.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Today when the rigors of an arid climate (Arabia) or other constraints on water resources press the limits of water supply, hydraulic engineers have to reconsider the nineteenth century answer of one quality of water for all uses. In places where population density far exceeds the supply of potable water—Hong Kong—or where the scanty spring water is not enough to support the massive tourist industry—Bermuda—(Deb, 1987, 222) there is no choice but to use subpotable or nonpotable water whenever feasible. Absolute scarcity of drinking-quality water is the strongest reason for water managers today to consider alternate procedures, but in some situations the quality not quantity of water is the issue. Heavy metals, long-lasting pesticides, or other carcinogens may require separation of the purest supply for drinking and cooking from the less pure supply for other uses, lest the water itself cause disease during a lifetime of use. Since potable water amounts to a small fraction of use in a modern city—6 percent or less (J. Thapa, personal communication)—alternative delivery systems for that small amount may be feasible, with the main systems delivering subpotable water for bathing, cleaning, watering lawns, and so on, and nonpotable water for industry or irrigation. It is easier to contemplate in theory these logical divisions than to make actual plans for altering the delivery system in metropolitan water districts. Political and economic realities restrict change in built-up areas unless the danger is severe, but in some new suburbs in Florida dual pipelines are laid for potable water inside the house and subpotable outside. Drinking bottled water is becoming more common. Many municipal water systems now supply partially purified (nonpotable) water to industry for cooling or other processes. Still, these new ideas have not been widely implemented to date. It is unexpected, then, to find that the ancient Greeks had just such a triple system of water supply and reuse. Each Greek city had both public fountains and springs supplying flowing water of the best quality, and private cisterns in houses and public buildings to supply still water of good quality, plus a drain system that led used water outside the city.</p>",

This paper outlines the required process for studying the feasibility of developing offshore petroleum fields.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A petroleum development project typically is divided into a number of major phases: exploration (including permit acquisition), field appraisal (primary and possibly secondary), feasibility study, project implementation (construction), and field production (operation and maintenance, management, and facilities upgrades, including secondary development phases). Different technical departments, each with specific aims, usually manage these phases (Fig. 1).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>While the development sequence is similar for all fields, there are notable differences between onshore and offshore projects. Most significantly, the engineering requirements and capital expenditure tend to be one or two orders of magnitude greater for offshore projects than onshore developments. Furthermore, offshore developments tend to have a much longer development schedule before they come on stream. Reserves and well productivity need to be substantially greater for offshore projects to cover the greater capital expenditure and operating cost, respectively.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This paper introduces a rational approach to computer-aided fixture planning (CAFP). A method of fixture classification and selection is introduced for planning of modular fixtures. The location of each fixture component is determined according to the common fixturing principles. We has developed a prototype CAFP system and linked to a commercial CAD system, namely CADAM. Modular fixture elements are automatically selected by the system, and the generated fixture layout can be displayed on-screen after assembly. For verification and optimization of a fixturing scheme, a fixture analysis module is also developed. An iteration method is used to solve the fixturing constraint equations and to determine the adequate clamping forces for holding the workpiece during machining processes.</jats:p>",

In PROCASE, both the mechanical part features and the machining operations are represented with a frame based scheme. PROCASE contains a retriever, a modifier, a simulator and a repairer. It distinguishes itself from traditional rule-based process planning systems by representing the process planning knowledge through previous process planning cases instead of production rules. It therefore can overcome some problems in the traditional rule-based expert systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>PROCASE currently resides in IRIS Indigo workstation. With a user friendly graphic environment, the generated process plans can be demonstrated vividly.

Although it is recognised that the self-reflexivity which this project introduces has undoubtedly opened up the possibilities for more culturally sensitive work, its rejection of any notion of hierarchy could be read as precluding the deployment of political projects beyond this opening. It is the authors' contention that this need not necessarily be the case, that the postmodern challenge can be met without having to discard a political standpoint. This move is important because the power structures inherent in colonial discourses largely remain in place. Instances are explored where conflicting representations can be brought into collision so that the naturalized assumptions of hegemonic representation can be challenged. This meeting of discourses can facilitate the undermining of certain cultural assumptions in the representative schema which have, until now, remained unquestioned. </jats:p>",

However, it is possible to intelligently group together collections of components which would be common to realistic work packages, and hence schedule on the basis of virtual components existing within an abstraction hierarchy.

In this paper, therefore, the author explores how lesbians perceive and experience everyday spaces. It is argued that lesbians can feel ‘out of place’ in environments such as the workplace or hotels, because these spaces are organised and appropriated by heterosexuals and so express and reproduce asymmetrical sociosexual relations. Consideration is also given to the way heterosexual hegemony is reproduced and expressed in space through antigay discrimination and violence. In the conclusion, the author explores the way in which fear of disclosure and antigay abuse inhibit the expression of lesbian and gay sexualities in everyday spaces and so feed the spatial supremacy of heterosexuality. </jats:p>",

Drawing on an outline of the various ways in which the city has been treated as a site embodying patriarchal principles, the author teases out the heterosexist and white cultural constructions that permeate our treatment of patriarchy, A call is made for explicit attention to be paid to constructions of sexuality and “race”. The contributions to these topics by lesbian feminists and black and African-American feminists are drawn into a framework for a reinvigorated conceptualization of patriarchy. Two aspects of empirical work carried out in Grand Rapids, MI, in 1989 are analyzed in relation to this framework, namely living arrangements among low-income Anglo-American and African-American women and the creation of a lesbian residential area. The paper concludes with an assessment of the extent to which our constructions of “race”, gender, and sexuality help us understand whether empirical changes in the social and spatial constitution of households are challenging the patriarchal structuring of urban social space. </jats:p>",

Modernisation theories have not been alone in attracting such criticism, Marxist development studies have also reached an impasse, and confidence in their supposed metanarratives has not been improved by the collapse of many socialist economies. In place of these modernist discourses we are now being presented with (amongst other things) a seemingly atheoretical populism—which triumphs a localist activism—and a cacophony of voices from the diverse traditions of postmodernism and postcolonialism. The project of ‘development’ is being rendered problematical in a way that it rarely was previously in the postcolonial period. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, I explore the impasse in Marxist development studies and welcome the impetus behind many of these new voices (including new voices from the periphery).

In this manner, I resist the nihilistic relativism which underpins some aspects of the new ‘antidevelopmentalism’.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is often assumed that the globalization of the world economy will drive societies and societal change in a broadly similar direction, leading to convergence in the process of urbanization. The observed diversity between places is the result of the engagement of the macroeconomic process with local social and political structures. Inner-city decline in many older metropolitan centers of the USA and the United Kingdom has occurred through economic restructuring and job loss, with smaller urban centers and amenity-rich areas benefiting concomitantly. Demographic processes have accentuated this decline: most notably suburbanization, counterurbanization, inner-city renewal programs, and urban resettlement to new towns. Since the early 1980s, however, selected inner cities have been the focus of reinvestment, and a return of population through so-called ‘gentrification’. In the United Kingdom, in particular, public policy has played an important role in the reinvigoration of inner cities. </jats:p><jats:p> The substantial literature on UK and US cities is reviewed insofar as it might shed light on convergent processes in Latin American inner cities. In fact, the evidence suggests little convergence. The demography is different, with relatively low levels of visible population decline; and the economy of the inner city remains vibrant, focusing upon services and small-scale artisan activities, with no corresponding decline in heavy industry. Although large-scale redevelopment projects in and around the downtown were common during the 1940s to the 1960s, the demise of authoritarian and dirigiste-type leaders, 1980s austerity, and a growing democratic base, have imposed severe limitations on the extent of large-scale urban redevelopment and reinvestment. Cultural and aesthetic influences also militate against a demand from the middle-income and upper-income groups to gentrify the inner city; nor is the ‘rent-gap’ sufficient to stimulate private-sector supply of new or refurbished homes a likely option in the city center. Policy prescriptions in Latin America should take account of this divergence and fundamental differences in kind, and should aim to develop existing opportunities and land uses for an incumbent working-class population, rather than seeking to attract new uses and better-off populations into the core. </jats:p>",

There has been a marked focus on the politics of local economic development, and there has also been an attempt to situate that politics with respect to processes of globalization. In particular, the globalization of the economy and correlative hypermobility of capital arc seen as exerting strong redistributive pressures on urban communities. This is the ‘new urban polities’. Evaluation of this thesis proceeds first by a critical interrogation of the related concepts of hypermobility of capital, and immobility of urban communities. This results in a respecification of the question as one of local dependence and the scale at which agents arc locally dependent. This, in turn, allows the new urban politics to be critically linked to arguments about the territorial organization of the state. From this standpoint it also appears that claims for a secular tendency towards the hypermobility of capital lack coherence. </jats:p>",

Although most production now takes place in Southeast Asia, the United States nevertheless still contains significant enclaves of athletic footwear production. Moreover, the cheapest shoes continue to be produced in the United States whereas more complex, expensive models tend to be manufactured in Asia. To understand this geography, we must move beyond the basic consideration of international labor-cost differentials. By means of two case studies, it is shown that domestic production involves very different labor processes from those of production based in other countries and, like many other sectors of the economy, domestic producers gain advantage by carrying smaller inventories through faster lead times. The best explanation, though, centers on the shoes themselves. Athletic shoes produced in the United States tend to have many fewer stitches in them than those manufactured elsewhere, which minimizes the most expensive component of the production process. Furthermore, tariffs on athletic shoes massively discriminate against imported shoes of a particular construction. </jats:p>",

Latin American research has been peripheralized and the flow of concepts and learning between Latin and Anglo America has been almost entirely from North to South. To explain why research by Latin Americans, and by Latin Americanists, has had relatively limited influence on recent geographic debates over theory and method, the authors employ contemporary discourse analysis. This method assists us in (1) deciphering how development geography presents Latin America, (2) in posing questions about the character and origins of the concepts that shape writing and, indeed, thinking, and (3) in identifying the perspective biases that must be confronted for interregional dialogue to occur. This critical commentary on Latin and Anglo-American research is highly relevant to reconstructed regional geography. It, too, is confronting issues such as the role of theory in contextually grounded research, and how to operationalize research that spans several geographical scales of analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, it has been argued that migration models in which ordinary least squares regression is used are inappropriate, because the dependent variable (number of migrants) is a count. Instead, a Poisson regression approach can be adopted. Goodness of fit can be evaluated by using a deviance (log-likelihood) or X<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic, whose significance can be compared with a χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom. In this paper, such an approach is used to model ward-level migration flows within the county of Hereford and Worcester. However, it is shown that for this exceedingly sparse data set the deviance figures attained are very low, suggesting that there may be a problem of underdispersion. This is in contrast to the overdispersion which has been identified as a common problem in Poisson models. The low deviance figures arise from the large number of zeros and small flows in the data matrix, which invalidate the usual χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> goodness-of-fit test. A simulation approach to the assessment of model goodness of fit is suggested, and the results from applying it to the Hereford and Worcester data set are described. </jats:p>",

To achieve such an empirical understanding, it is necessary to employ concepts and interpretations which themselves are social products and require close scrutiny. Considerable attention is therefore devoted to influences such as regional tension and perspective bias on interpretations of the cities by urban and housing experts. The principal sources of evidence are a household-level survey of shelter in Quito and Guayaquil, and a survey of housing professionals with regard to the interpretation of the shelter conditions and differences. Geographically based biases are prominent in the survey of housing experts, suggesting that research should examine these more carefully than in the past. The study concludes with a richer understanding of both the empirical reality of urban Ecuador and the frameworks and concepts used to interpret it. </jats:p>",

The patient-image coordinate transformation was found by retrospectively registering a digitizer-derived model of the patient's scalp with a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-derived model of the same surface. This procedure was performed with routine imaging data, eliminating the need to obtain special-purpose MR images with fiducial markers in place. After patient-image fusion was achieved, a hand-held digitizing stylus was moved over the scalp and tracked in real time on cross-sectional and 3-D brain images on the computer screen. This device was used for presurgical localization of lesions in 10 patients with meningeal and superficial brain tumors. The results suggest that the system is accurate enough (typical error range 3 to 8 mm) to enable the surgeon to reduce the craniotomy to one-half the size advisable with conventional qualitative presurgical planning.</jats:p>",

A retrospective study of 735 patients with follicular neoplasms treated at Royal North Shore Hospital was undertaken. Factors assessed included clinical features, such as age and sex of the patients and tumour size, as well as findings at frozen section examination. No significant difference in sex distribution was demonstrated when comparing follicular adenoma with follicular carcinoma. There was a significant difference with respect to patient age between the two groups, but the large overlap in the distribution made this difference of no clinical value. In addition, there was no significant difference in tumour size when comparing follicular adenoma with carcinoma.</jats:p><jats:p>On the other hand, review of frozen section results showed that 40% of patients with follicular carcinoma were positively identified by frozen section examination at initial surgery, with a false positive rate of less than 0.2%.
