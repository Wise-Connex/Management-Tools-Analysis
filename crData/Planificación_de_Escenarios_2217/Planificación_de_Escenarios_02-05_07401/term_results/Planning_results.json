      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores Frederick Bigger’s importance to the professionalization of American city planning and to the shaping of Pittsburgh’s urban landscape. Educated as an architect at the University of Pennsylvania and a classmate of Henry Wright’s, Bigger dedicated most of his life to establishing urban planning as a discipline in his birth-place, Pittsburgh. However, as a planning theorist as well as a practitioner, Bigger’s world embraced more than planning administration in the Steel City. He was a founding member of the Regional Planning Association of America who combined a keen knowledge of planning administration with a fervent belief in community planning to serve effectively as an official of the New Deal’s Greenbelt Town program and a consultant for the Federal Housing Program. Frederick Bigger’s life highlights the danger of too narrowly pigeonholing pre-World War II planners as moles or skylarks. </jats:p>",

Patterns of land use and the context of development are increasingly driven by natural resource-based amenity values. Planners face a new breed of economic, social, and environmental issues brought about by this rapid change in land use; driven, in large part, by demands for rural residential developments and recreationally-oriented land uses.

Although a considerable amount of research has been done to define impervious thresholds for water quality degradation, there are a number of flaws in the assumptions and methodologies used. Given refinement of the methodology, accurate and usable parameters for preventative watershed planning can be developed, which include impervious surface thresholds and a balance between pervious and impervious surfaces within a watershed. </jats:p>",

Although the three territories share a common history of linguistic oppression, different approaches with respect to language planning on the part of the respective autonomous governments have produced different patterns of sociolinguistic evolution. In this article, the specifics of the island of Mallorca and in particular the sociolinguistic situation of its capital city, Palma, are reviewed. Research on attitudes in the Balearic Islands has made use of direct questionnaires as a tool of analysis. This paper explores the differences between the answers to direct questionnaires and the responses to a matched-guise experiment by way of the traditional distinction between the parameters of status-instrumentality and solidarity-integrativeness. It also proposes that a combination of methods is needed to obtain a clearer picture of the problems still to overcome.</jats:p>",

Scholars have assessed how planning segregated neighborhoods in larger cities such as Chicago, New York, and Cleveland and more recently in southern cities, such as Atlanta, Richmond, and Memphis. In Orlando, Florida, a relatively small, agricultural, and tourist-based southern community, local officials marshaled an array of planning strategies to define and maintain racial boundaries while projecting an image of African American support for this system. The intent was to allay fear among tourists and potential residents that Orlando suffered from racial tension. Building on the work of Silver and Moeser, this study shows that Orlando developed a separate black city through planning for the spatial arrangement of cities on the basis of segregationist goals. </jats:p>",

However, these studies have tended not to articulate a clear conceptualization of empowerment. Thus, in this paper, I develop a multidimensional conceptual framework for assessing empowerment (and disempowerment), and employ it in examining the impacts of GIS use by community-based organizations engaged in urban planning and neighborhood revitalization. Drawing on a case study conducted with a Minneapolis, Minnesota, neighborhood organization, I show how this multidimensional framework fosters a more complete analysis of empowerment, and therefore, development of a more detailed explanation of the impacts of this new technology. </jats:p>",

The speed of this welcome change has been remarkable. However, it has left an assumption that everyone feels comfortable about sex, and that all young people have been armed with accurate knowledge by the time they become sexually active. That this is not the case is demonstrated by continuing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. So, although the love between two people is a very private and personal part of the pattern of their lives, when ignorance about sex and family planning intrude they may bring a lot of misery and worry. This is particularly true when couples know that their children may inherit a disorder like haemophilia.</jats:p>",

The concepts of supply chain management (SCM), and its extension demand chain management (DCM), have been at the center of much recent research. One of the reasons for this is that, over the last years, a significant number of information systems have emerged, which claim to support the concept. The paper argues that these systems mostly adopt a myopic view of planning, based on pure deterministic planning methods. It demonstrates that such an approach fails to coop with the considerable uncertainty of the planning information. The proposed robust planning paradigm is then introduced and its impact explained, using the well‐known example of the beer game. It holds the promise of reducing the number of re‐planning cycles, through a better characterization of the expected service level performance over a medium planning horizon. Finally, a case study will show the value of robust planning in a European chemical enterprise.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

These teams should serve all 20 000 people with severe and enduring mental health problems estimated to be hard to engage and in need of intensive support in the community (Department of Health 2000). This is an ambitious commitment and reflects the degree of centralized service planning in this country. By contrast, the North American experience has seen assertive outreach develop through a ‘franchising’ process (Bond 1991). Model assertive outreach programmes have been copied by other parts of the country over a relatively long time period. Using a particularly American metaphor, Bond suggests that service planners may be able to learn something from the fast food industry in its successful transmission of standards to new locations !</jats:p>",

La limitatezza delle radici scelte (poche migliaia rispetto alle 15.000 che compaiono nel più grande dizionario esperanto, il <jats:italic>Plena ilustrita vortaro</jats:italic>) non infirma affatto la validità dell’opera, che supera ampiamente ogni opera precedente dello stesso tipo; in particolare viene data non solo l’etimologia della parola esperanto in quanto scelta da Zamenhof da una data lingua, ma anche l’etimologia delle parole in lingue etniche da cui Zamenhof ha derivato i termini esperanto. Come esempio sono esaminate le radici <jats:italic>anonc-</jats:italic> e <jats:italic>ŝajn-.</jats:italic> Quasi ad ogni voce sono esposti i motivi, già noti o ricostruiti, che hanno indotto Zamenhof a fare quella scelta piuttosto che un’altra.

The orality of officials is text bound and texts on the environmental attain a firm position in the discourse of these officials, quite different from the orality of citizens. The characteristics of orality and literacy, from a communicative viewpoint, vary considerably. In literacy details and figures matter; in orality it is the intention of the speaker and the gist of the story that counts most. By bringing in a large amount of literacy in oral presentations, officials spoil the functions of orality, its effects on learning, its creative potential, the way how, via stories, many people can get involved or how trust is developed. Officials can conquer the orality of the people, they can cope with it in a strategic way or they can deal with it as a valuable asset in policy making. For this officials have to rethink the way they speak. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment</jats:p>",

Regions in eastern Germany are especially affected by this as the example of South-western Saxony will show. Main cause of this development is the constantly declining birth rate which effects are strengthened by a negative migration rate. Statistic prognoses for the year 2015 do now show an improving situation but rather forecast an intensification of population losses, although with regional differences. The tendentiously further declining number of population causes numerous and diverse effects that influence social life in general but also induce special consequences. Therefore, action-oriented strategies have to be developed and implemented to secure the number and structure of population. They include several fields of special measures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A path which maximizes the sum of three functions: (repulsion from obstacles, attraction towards the goal, and level attraction) is chosen. While the \nrepulsive and goal-attraction potentials depend on how close is the FFR from obstacles and goal, respectively, the level-attraction potential maintains a certain altitude at which the FFR should navigate. Two additional heuristics are proposed to overcome the local minima problem and to improve the efficiency of the search process. Simulation results of the proposed technique are presented.</jats:p>",

Language capacity is not a new topic to national defense, but this article looks at the link between government needs for language capacity and the availability of languages in formal education.

The deformation of compliant sheet metal parts during the handling process can significantly impact both part dimensional quality and production rate. Increasing production rate while maintaining part quality requires an optimal design of the part transfer trajectory. This paper describes a new methodology of time-optimal trajectory planning for compliant parts by discretizing the part transfer path into N segments that have equal horizontal distance and by approximating the trajectory as having piecewise constant acceleration that can only change its value at the end of each segment. The contribution of the methodology is that part deformation determined by transfer velocity and acceleration is considered as a nonlinear constraint, which is obtained from FEA simulation and model fitting. Part permanent deformation, trajectory smoothness, and static obstacle avoidance are also considered. The methodology is validated by simulations at different motion conditions and obstacle configurations. This paper addresses the lack of current design guidelines for material handing development and simultaneously provides a mathematical tool to significantly enhance the production efficiency in manufacturing of compliant sheet metal parts.</jats:p>",

Bounds on curvature and constraints on initial and final orientations are also addressed. By using the Keymeulen/Decuyper fluid method and adding friction forces in the Stokes' equations, the shortest paths or the minimum energy ones can be found, even on an uneven terrain. In addition, in order to satisfy the kinematics and dynamics constraints of a non-holonomic robot a local variation of the shear constraint is used to control the upper bound of the trajectory curvature. Adding small corridors at the departure and destination also satisfies initial and final orientation requirements.</jats:p>",

Full integration into the NHS is possible through the career structure which links family therapy with clinical psychology, adult and child psychotherapy, and provides a model for linking workforce planning with education.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n“Parametric governance” refers to a steering mode by which the steering body defines operationalized objectives but leaves it open to the implementing bodies how the goals may be achieved. Transferred to spatial planning that steering mode would require theLandesplanungnot to delineate areas with special purposes but just to indicate the objective, e.g.: The state stipulates regional planners to demarcate areas which are suitable and capable to host “x mega-watt of wind-energy”. The approach corresponds to newer governance patterns which grant the decentralized implementing agencies more room of manoeuvre to develop solutions which are better suited to the problems, more attuned to the given situation and more accepted by those concerned than the traditional top-down solutions. In particular, the approach is closely related to the mode of “contracting” within the system of new public management. The article tries to give an idea of the potentials of parametric governance for spatial planning and to derive knowledge from similar approaches in other policy areas or other fields of action as to what could improve the effectiveness of the approach and where to look for problems and obstacles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Due to the geologic complexity, intervention will become an integral part of the reservoir development plan in order to achieve target recovery factors. After first oil, as the development moves into day-today production operations, subsea well interventions will play a significant role in maximizing production rates to keep the facility at maximum capacity. However, increased interventions will also carry additional OPEX impact. A significant challenge for any deepwater development is to identify the types, frequencies, and cost impact of intervention requirements over the life of the field. Since the ramifications of these issues are so diverse, it is crucial that the team which addresses this issue during the define stage of the project be representative of the stakeholders involved. They must take a holistic, or \"Life of Field,\" approach to evaluating and modeling the anticipated intervention program, in order to achieve an optimum balance between CAPEX and OPEX considerations. Reservoir modeling, intervention modeling techniques, impact on well design, equipment selection, and drilling and intervention vessel strategy will be addressed, as each are related to and affected by the Life of Field approach.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Deepwater developments traditionally pit CAPEX vs. OPEX, and it generally comes down to a simple equation of greater than vs. less than. For example, what is the future benefit in reduced intervention cost from a large initial investment (such as from a TLP, Spar, or semisubmersible), as compared to a lower CAPEX solution (such as a subsea system) that has greater anticipated intervention and availability costs? Of course, other factors may also be considered on the basis of inherent strategy decisions or key infrastructure targets as part of the corporate business plan. However, in the end, the lower up-front CAPEX with a manageable OPEX risk condition typically wins the battle and is the implemented solution.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The increasing geologic complexity inherent in Gulf of Mexico (GOM) deepwater developments brings with it increasing risk that is not adequately factored by the prior traditional model. Rather, the method presented here seeks to achieve the optimized field solution in terms of lowest overall cost (CAPEX and OPEX), through a multi-disciplined evaluation of several competing drivers. This \"Life of Field\" approach to subsea well intervention planning will greatly impact overall life-cycle field economics.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>For example, consider the decisions made during the well construction and subsea systems design phase of project development.

The contemporary Montana gold mining industry belies accounts that economic regulation can be situated purely in concepts of structures and institutions. In the 1990s, the Montana gold mining industry was fundamentally transformed in the absence of concomitant changes in the economic structure of the industry or in the institutions of regulation. Indeed, the changes in the efficacy of the Montana gold mining economy can only be explicated by adding a discursive account of regulation. In particular, I link a regulationist account of reregulation with the post-structural sensibilities found in cultural economic geography. This analysis, which focuses on how nature is represented in the mine-permitting process, illustrates that how we perceive ‘environment’ in particular places and times can influence access to resources and their subsequent physical transformation. </jats:p>",

Consequently, the relative rarity of a species within the study area considered does not necessarily reflect its relative global rarity or its conservation relevance. We investigated the implications of species' rarity in complementary reserve selection across geopolitical boundaries based on data on the distribution of birds in southern Africa. Our results demonstrate that restricted‐range species have a disproportionate effect on the number and identity of the cells selected by complementarity. The most extreme situation occurs when species whose ranges occupy single cells impose the selection of those particular sites as irreplaceable cells. Not all restricted‐range species are equally important. Some are “apparent rarities” in the study area because they are vagrants, occur very marginally to their range, or have been introduced, and these are mainly irrelevant to conservation planning in a region. Filtering rare nontarget species from the data before reserve selection results in a significant increase in the efficiency of minimum complementary sets. It is particularly recommended for taxa with high mobility, in which vagrancy is more likely. Dividing the study area into geopolitical units has a profound effect on the sites selected by complementarity. It results in loss of overall efficiency, in a tendency for selection of sites at the periphery of the units, and in some species receiving more protection at the edge of their ranges than at the center. Geopolitical coordination in conservation planning may not only result in improved overall efficiency but also a better allocation of resources that improves the long‐term robustness of reserve networks.</jats:p>",

In this approach, each cooperating manipulator is controlled by an independent impedance controller. In addition, along selected degrees of freedom, force control is achieved through an external loop, to improve control of the object's internal loading. Extensive stability analysis is performed, based on a realistic model that includes robot impedance and object dynamics. Experiments are performed using two cooperating industrial robots holding an object through point contacts. Force and position control actions are suitably dispatched to achieve both internal loading control and object position control. Individual impedance parameters are specified according to the theoritical stability criterion. The performance of the system is demonstrated for transportation and contact tasks. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many governments have recently initiated a process of water sector mercantilización—the introduction of markets or market-simulating decisionmaking techniques, and the participation of private companies and private capital in water management. This paper presents a case study of the mercantilización of water resources in Spain. State-led development of water resources was a key element of Spain's modernisation drive in the mid-20th century, intended to redress not only the high degree of temporal and spatial variation in water availability, but also to underpin the agricultural colonisation of the country's arid interior. Water-resources development, pricing, and allocation remained, with few exceptions, the preserve of the state. In 1999 the government reformed the national Water Law, introducing both water markets and water banks; this in addition to earlier reforms enabling the participation of private companies and private capital in water-resources development. The case study, situating the evolution of water policy within an analysis of key macro political – economic trends (in particular, Spain's transition to democracy and EU-mandated economic convergence) and the country's contested hydropolitics, is employed as a means of elaborating a more general political ecological – economic understanding of the mercantilización of water. </jats:p>",

The developed multicriteria decision‐making procedure consists of generating alternatives, establishing criteria, assessment of criteria weights, and application of the compromise ranking method (VIKOR). The alternatives are the scenarios of sustainable hazard effects mitigation, generated in the form of comprehensive reconstruction plans, including the redevelopment of urban areas and infrastructures, multipurpose land use, and restrictions on building in hazardous areas. The plans have to be evaluated according to the criteria representing public safety, sustainability, social environment, natural environment, economy, culture, and politics. The multicriteria model can treat all relevant conflicting effects and impacts in their representative units. The evaluation of alternatives is implicated with imprecision (or uncertainty) of established criteria, and the fuzzy multicriteria model is developed to deal with “qualitative” (unquantifiable or linguistic) or incomplete information. The application of this model is illustrated with the post‐earthquake reconstruction problem in Central Taiwan, including the restoration concerning the safe and serviceable operation of “lifeline” systems, such as electricity, water, and transportation networks, immediately after a severe earthquake.</jats:p>",

A trajectory planning method to minimize vibration and/or executing time of a point-to-point motion is presented for FRMs based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Kinematics redundancy is integrated into the \npresented method as planning variables. Quadrinomial and quintic polynomial are used to describe the segments that connect the initial, intermediate, and final points in joint space. The trajectory planning of FRM is formulated as a problem of optimization with constraints. \nA planar FRM with three flexible links is used in simulation.

This change considerably increased the storage and power generation capacities of the dam. Yet, the sparse rainfall throughout the catchment in recent years has hampered full utilization of the dam’s storage and generation capacities and increased the need for tradeoffs between conflicting demands for water use.</jats:p>",

We have developed a fully implemented prototype based on the Unreal Tournament™ game engine, and carried experiments with a simple sitcom‐like scenario. We discuss the central role of artificial actors in interactive storytelling and how real‐time generation of their behaviour participates in the creation of a dynamic storyline. We follow previous work describing the behaviour of artificial actors through AI planning formalisms, and adapt it to the context of narrative representation. In this context, the narrative equivalent of a character's behaviour consists of its role. The set of possible roles for a given actor is represented as a hierarchical task network (HTN). The system uses HTN planning to dynamically generate the character roles, by interleaving planning and execution, which supports dynamic interaction between actors, as well as user intervention in the unfolding plot. Finally, we present several examples of short plots and situations generated by the system from the dynamic interaction of artificial actors. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors examine the impact of mobility on the labor-force status of two-earner households in the United States, in a longitudinal context. There has recently been a resurgence of interest within industry and academia in the impact of family migration on the labor-force status of women, and on dual-earner families in general. Much of the research in this field has documented the disruptive effects of migration on the labor-force status of women, particularly with respect to unemployment, under-employment, and interrupted careers. However, there is another body of research that has challenged the disruption assumption with findings that many women benefit from family migration. The conflicting results persist when the modeling procedures account for the selectivity of migrants. Missing from the literature is a comparison of the impact of mobility on the labor-force status of men as well as women at varying geographical scales. The authors have used a new methodology to extend previous work on the impact of family migration by directly comparing the labor-force status of dual-earner households who migrate long distances, with that of households who move within the same labor market, and with that of households who remain residentially stable. The authors have used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to show conclusively that, although there are disruptive effects, these are relatively short lived for most households. In addition, the results suggest that average changes mask very large variations in what happens to husbands and wives who relocate. This study emphasizes the dynamic nature of wives' labor-force participation relative to their husbands' immediately before and after a move, a finding that has not been established by other work on migration and labor-force participation. </jats:p>",

However, agro-industrial and postproductivist logics and dynamics have largely tended to marginalise its significance. In this paper we explore some of the conceptual parameters needed to develop the rural development dynamic. This is one which recentralises agriculture and farm-based activities and provides a basis for countering the growing crisis in rural and agricultural policymaking. In order to further embed the rural development dynamic, however, new alliances need to be attached to the struggles that are currently underway in rural areas. This will involve the state and social scientists playing a greater constructive role in developing the social infrastructure around which current exemplars of agrarian-based rural development can become more mainstream. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pre-production ship design, cost estimation and production planning are traditionally carried out in U.S. shipyards through a process of extensive design work, followed by contacting multiple vendors, and coupled with production planning. This process has long been recognized as time consuming and expensive. In an effort to save time and cost, a number of synthesis models have been developed. These models are collections of trends gleaned from similar vessels. The trends, when combined, provide an estimate for initial discussions with customers, but the estimate is not sufficiently accurate for contract negotiations. An alternative is for shipyards to offer stock designs on which contract design, costing, and production planning work have already been carried out. However, most customers demand designs tailored to their particular needs. The MARITECH ASE Project 21 Smart Product Model (SPM) provides a new paradigm to meet the needs of shipyards and their customers. The SPM is initiated with a parent ship for which design, cost and production data are well known. The parent is then modified to match the customer ship's specifications. The SPM incorporates the modifications by means of an integrated set of first principles programs (e.g., FastShip for hull design) and databases (e.g., of various makes and models of main propulsion engines). The SPM provides shipyards with the speed of the synthesis models, the accuracy of the stock ship approach, and substantially improves the shipyards' competitive position.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present a method for trajectory planning and control of planar robots with a passive rotational last joint. These underactuated mechanical systems, which are subject to nonholonomic second-order constraints, are shown to be fully linearized and input-output decoupled by means of a nonlinear dynamic feedback. This objective is achieved in a unified framework, both in the presence or absence of gravity. The linearizing output is the position of the center of percussion of the last link. Based on this result, one can plan smooth trajectories joining in finite time any initial and desired final state of the robot; in particular, transfers between inverted equilibria and swing-up maneuvers under gravity are easily obtained. We also address the problem of avoiding the singularity induced by the dynamic linearization procedure through a careful choice of output trajectories. A byproduct of the proposed method is the straightforward design of exponentially stable tracking controllers for the generated trajectories. Simulation results are reported for a 3R robot moving in a horizontal and vertical plane. Possible extensions of the approach and its relationships with the differential flatness technique are briefly discussed. </jats:p>",

We prove the flatness property for planar structures allowing to solve the motion planning problem by simple interpolation, without need to integrate the system differential equations and without quasi-static approximations. Though this property fails to be valid for general three-dimensional hand structures, similar results can be obtained for special structures thanks to the notion of Liouvillian systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents two object manipulation planning methods based on fitted stratified and semi-stratified approaches using finger relocations. The problem is discussed in the framework of a motion planning problem. The goal of the methods is to steer an object from an initial configuration to a final configuration while it is possible to reposition the fingertips on the surface in a predefined way. We assume there is no rolling and sliding but finger relocations are allowed. The first technique follows a pure stratified approach, however unlike the previously published method, the exact kinematic model of the manipulation system is matched with a virtual model masking the behavior of the original system. This provides a simpler model than the earlier stratified method by reducing the generally hard symbolic computation problem to a simple (almost pure numerical) one. The paper also introduces a semi-stratified manipulation planning based on the newly defined fitted system. This second method enhances the stratified motion planning with a definition of systematic finger relocation sequence. The proposed decomposition is based on the selection of suitable reference contact points. As the main benefit, the method enables a greater freedom in defining the desired fingertip trajectories. The methods are illustrated through an example of object reorientation. </jats:p>",

The dynamic constraints on the system are second-order nonholonomic constraints. We attempted to control those n coupled rigid bodies by the translational acceleration inputs at the first joint. If each rigid body is hinged at the center of percussion, it is possible to compose a positioning trajectory by connecting rotational and translational trajectory segments. Each rigid body can be rotated about its center of percussion one after another. When all of the rigid bodies are aligned on a straight line, they can be translated. The algorithm for positioning is presented. Simulations show that the coupled planar rigid bodies can reach the desired configuration by the constructed inputs. </jats:p>",

In a local modeling framework, however, the issue of how to detect and model spatial association by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) remains largely unresolved. In this paper we exploit a recent development that casts GWR as a model of locational heterogeneity, to formulate a general model of spatial effects that includes as special cases GWR with a spatially lagged objective variable and GWR with spatial error autocorrelation. The approach also permits the derivation of formal tests against several forms of model misspecification, including locational heterogeneity in global models, and spatial error autocorrelation in GWR models. Application of these results is exemplified with a case study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1990s the management of forests in British Columbia (Canada) and New South Wales (Australia) underwent many changes. For most of the decade the governments in both of these political jurisdictions were more socially and environmentally aware than their immediate predecessors. They were, however, far short of what many environmental and social activists desired. The New Democratic Party in British Columbia, led to government by Mike Harcourt, and the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales led by Bob Carr, may both be described as ‘centre-left/light-green’ in their political persuasions. This paper develops the regulation approach to explore the achievements, the potential and the limitations of these governments in the area of forest politics. It is argued that these governments implicitly adopted a progressive neopluralist approach to forest politics and attempted to manage environmental conflict by securing the agreement of many diverse interest groups. The experience of these two governments raises questions about the potential and limitations not just of the particular governments, but of a progressive neopluralist political strategy to achieve sustainable forest management. </jats:p>",

Central axis depth dose measurements and a series of profile scans at various depths were acquired in a water phantom using a Scanditronix type RK ion chamber. Source spatial distributions for the Monte Carlo calculations were reconstructed from in‐air ion chamber measurements carried out across the two‐dimensional beam profile at 100 cm downstream from the source. The in‐air spatial distributions were found to have full width at half maximum of 4.7 and 1.3 cm, at 100 cm from the source, for the 10 and 50 MeV beams, respectively. Energy spectra for the 10 and 50 MeV beams were determined by simulating the components of the microtron treatment head using the code MCNP4B. DPM calculations are on average within ±2% agreement with measurement for all depth dose and profile comparisons conducted in this study. The accuracy of the DPM code illustrated in this work suggests that DPM may be used as a valuable tool for electron beam dose calculations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In intramedullary nail (IMN) surgical operations, one of the main efforts for surgeons is to find the axes of two distal holes. Two distal holes on an IMN, which are inside the intramedullary canal of a patient's femur, can only be seen in a lateral X-ray view. For the standard surgical procedure, the localization of the distal hole axes is a trial-and-error process which results in a long surgical time and large dose of X-ray exposure. In this paper, an algorithm to derive the three-dimensional position and orientation of the distal hole axis was developed. The algorithm first derives the nail axis through two X-ray images. Then the distal hole axis is calculated through projecting back the hole boundary on the X-ray image from a lateral view to three-dimensional space. A least-squares method is used to determine the centres of the front hole and the back hole through iteration. The algorithm has been tested with real data and it was robust. </jats:p>",

ACP was addressed by social workers as part of the nursing home admission process, focused primarily on cardiopulmonary resuscitation preference, and reviewed only after the crisis of acute illness and hospitalization. Advance directive forms specifying preferences or limitations for life‐sustaining treatment contained inconsistent language and vague conditions for implementation. ACP review generally resulted in gradual limitation of life‐sustaining treatment. Transition points included nursing home admission, acute illness or hospitalization, and decline toward death. Relatively few nursing home residents received hospice services, with most hospice referrals and palliative care treatment delayed until the week before death. Most residents in this sample died without family present and with little documented evidence of pain or symptom management.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> Limiting discussion of advance care plans to cardiopulmonary resuscitation falsely dichotomized and oversimplified the choices about medical treatment and care at end‐of‐life, especially palliative care alternatives, for these older nursing home residents. Formal hospice services were underutilized, and palliative care efforts by nursing home staff were often inconsistent with accepted standards. These results reinforce the need for research and program initiatives in long‐term care to improve and facilitate individualized ACP and palliative care at end of life.</jats:p>",

Some inconsistencies remain, possibly due to variation in life periods for exposure assessment, confounding and undetected effect modification. In our cohort study, we address some of these questions by taking into account physical activity in different periods of life and by investigating effect modification by birth cohort and body mass index (BMI). Altogether 9,539 same‐sex twin women aged 42–70 years who answered a questionnaire about their work and leisure‐time physical exercise from ages 25 to 50 during 1967 and 1970 were included in our cohort. During follow‐up, 506 breast cancer cases occurred through 1997. We used multivariate Cox models to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We found no associations between physical activity and breast cancer overall. Women born between 1901 and 1917 (aged 51–70 at baseline) who reported regular leisure‐time activity had a borderline significant 40% lower risk compared with those who reported no activity (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4–1.0; test for trend, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.07). This association appeared to be confined to women with a low BMI after the age of 50 and to women with a high BMI during the premenopausal period. We found no evidence that work activity reduces risk for breast cancer. The importance of physical activity for breast cancer risk seems to depend on birth cohort. The association may be limited to normal‐weight postmenopausal women and overweight premenopausal women. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
