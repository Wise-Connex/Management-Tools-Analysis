Shortcomings in current research make it difficult to conclude how an organization may be affected. This paper presents an artifact evaluation of the functionality and perceived benefits of ERP systems. The evaluation is based on the Competing Values Model. The evaluation shows that ERP systems support effectiveness criteria (such as control and productivity), related to internal process and rational goal models. The evaluation also points out weaknesses in ERP systems and especially in areas related to human relations and open systems models. The result of the evaluation is used to discuss the impact of ERP systems on organizations and is presented as a series of hypotheses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have an organizational impact and are in most cases implemented to improve organizational effectiveness. Shortcomings in current research make it difficult to conclude how an organization may be affected. This paper presents an artifact evaluation of the functionality and perceived benefits of ERP systems. The evaluation is based on the competing values model. The evaluation shows that ERP systems support effectiveness criteria (such as control and productivity) related to internal process and rational goal models. The evaluation also points out weaknesses in ERP systems and especially in areas related to human relations and open systems models. The result of the evaluation is used to discuss the impact of ERP systems on organizations and is presented as a series of hypotheses.</jats:p>"

Heuristic  techniques are becoming popular for developing alternative forest plans  that include spatial constraints. Eight types of heuristic planning  techniques were applied to three increasingly difficult forest planning  problems where the objective function sought to maximize the amount of  land in certain types of wildlife habitat. The goal of this research was  to understand the relative challenges and opportunities each technique  presents when more complex difficult goals are desired. The eight  heuristic techniques were random search, simulated annealing, great  deluge, threshold accepting, tabu search with 1-opt moves, tabu search  with 1-opt and 2-opt moves, genetic algorithm, and a hybrid tabu search /  genetic algorithm search process. While our results should not be  viewed as universal truths, we determined that for the problems we  examined, there were three classes of techniques: very good (simulated  annealing, threshold accepting, great deluge, tabu search with 1-opt and  2-opt moves, and tabu search / genetic algorithm), adequate (tabu  search with 1-opt moves, genetic algorithm), and less than adequate  (random search). The relative advantages in terms of solution time and  complexity of programming code are discussed and should provide planners  and researchers a guide to help match the appropriate technique to  their planning problem. The hypothetical landscape model used to  evaluate the techniques can also be used by others to further compare  their techniques to the ones described here.</ja:p>"

He left us with important concepts that can inform thought and action in the 21st century. Most importantly his work brings together a critical understanding of society, nature, and economy and can therefore provide conceptual keys to placing that elusive concept ‚Äòecologically sustainable development‚Äô in the broad flow of social change. In this paper I sketch a Polanyian approach to environmental planning, foregrounding the concept of ‚Äòecosocialisation‚Äô. I move from a discussion of our present situation through an analysis of ecological modernisation and eco-Marxist theory, retrieving some insights and revealing some lacunae. A Polanyian analysis of questions of social change is then outlined. Its implications for environmental planning are explored. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Visioning became widely used in the planning process during the 1980s and 90s. In its simplest form it is the notion of creating images of the future to serve as goals or guides for planning decisions. For many people the idea of visioning became synonymous with or closely linked to public participation. While hundreds of communities have undertaken visioning, there has been little or no examination of the theoretical underpinnings of the practice. Practitioners of the technique, whether consultants or municipal planners, seem to have worked largely from a set of tacit assumptions about the usefulness of the practice. This study examines literature from various disciplines, refers to planning documents and reports on interviews and questionnaires in order to articulate the underlying assumptions or theory-like statements about visioning and then to measure those assertions against existing research. The resulting analysis shows that while there is a basis to support some of the assumptions about visioning there are also profound weaknesses in parts of the underlying theory. The paper is intended to help both advocates and critics of visioning, as well as those with a more general interest in planning, to better understand and assess visioning and other techniques that enter the professional lexicon. </jats:p>",

The analysis of the operational and financial data of hospital administrative structures has permitted the discovery of the characteristics of work carried out by the employees and the different strategies used by the managers. Firstly, hospital supply chains must be classified into two groups influenced by medical factors (short‚Äêterm and long‚Äêterm hospitals). Secondly, two different management approaches can be observed when the supply chain operations are analysed. The first approach assigns a larger budget priority to inventory control, packages reception and internal distribution. Thus, the purchasing services have relatively fewer resources. In the second approach, contract negotiation and product ordering processes are enforced by the deployment of, relatively, more personnel. In both cases, the central store service performs merchandise reception and distribution according to the strategies determined by the purchasing service.

Even though research in this area has increased in the last decade, the focus of much of that work has been on the content rather than the process of the manufacturing strategy. Consequently, this study attempts to understand the important elements of the strategic manufacturing planning process and its effectiveness. Borrowing from the extant literature in the fields of strategic management and information systems, we propose a research model that relates strategic manufacturing planning system design to planning system success. Using structured questionnaires, empirical data is collected from over 200 manufacturing executives to test the model hypotheses. Planning process in manufacturing was found to be a bottom‚Äêup approach from a corporate or business perspective, which differs from the top‚Äêdown planning process prevalent in strategic information systems planning process. Findings also indicate that greater planning system success in manufacturing is associated with a planning system that combines some ‚Äúrational‚Äù elements (formality, comprehensiveness, control focus, longer horizon) with others that lend adaptability (wider participation and more intense interaction). But the strategic manufacturing planning system is more than just a collection of independent planning characteristics. Instead, it can be viewed as a gestalt planning system whereby planning characteristics move together in affecting overall planning system success.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Capacity improvement has become central to strategies used to develop health systems in low‚Äêincome countries. Experience suggests that achieving better health outcomes requires both increased investment (i.e. financial resources) and adequate local capacity to use resources effectively. International donors and non‚Äêgovernmental agencies, as well as ministries of health, are therefore increasingly relying on capacity building to enhance overall performance in the health sector. Despite the growing interest in capacity improvement, there has been little consensus among practitioners and academics on definitions of ‚Äòcapacity building‚Äô and how to evaluate it. This paper aims to review current knowledge and experiences from ongoing efforts to monitor and evaluate capacity building interventions in the health sector in developing countries. It draws on a wide range of sources to develop (1) a definition of capacity building and (2) a conceptual framework for mapping capacity and measuring the effects of capacity building interventions. Mapping is the initial step in the design of capacity building interventions and provides a framework for monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness. Capacity mapping is useful to planners because it makes explicit the assumptions underlying the relationship between capacity and health system performance and provides a framework for testing those assumptions.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The socialist bloc of post‚Äêwar Europe was obliged to follow the Soviet example with a hierarchical, centrally controlled health care system based on polyclinics and other facilities providing extensive specialist services at the first level of contact. All the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have now expressed their wish to totally change their health care systems. Changes in these countries include: the introduction of market economy mechanisms in health care, an increased focus on population health needs in guiding health care systems, and the possibility of introducing a more general type of care at primary level. Patient expectations of access, choice and convenience are factors in shaping new models of health care delivery. Appropriate timing is the key determinant of the success of reforms. In Estonia the beginning of the 1990s was the time when several interest groups in society supported changes in the health care system. The first step after regaining independence was the reintroduction of a Bismarck‚Äêtype insurance system. In the late 1990s the primary care reforms have changed the initial plans and elements of a National Health Service were introduced, especially general practitioners' lists, capitation payment and gate‚Äêkeeping principles. The family medicine reform in Estonia has two main objectives: introduction of general practice as a specialty into Estonian health care and changing the remuneration system of primary care doctors. The specific tasks are: to provide practising primary care doctors with opportunities for retraining to gain the specialty status of a general practitioner, to create a list system for the population to register with a primary care doctor, to introduce a partial gate‚Äêkeeping system and to give the status of the independent contractor to primary care doctors.

The article espouses a five-phase transformation process: ‚Ä¢ Developing the Knowledge Future State Vision, Knowledge Strategy and Value Propositions ‚Ä¢ Developing the Knowledge Architecture and Determining its Content ‚Ä¢ Developing the Knowledge Infrastructure, Service Model and Network Support Mechanisms ‚Ä¢ Developing a Knowledge Culture Transformation Program ‚Ä¢ Leveraging Knowledge into Innovation The author identifies possible strategies, leading practices, and pitfalls to avoid in each phase. He also explores the challenges involved in identifying and measuring intellectual capital, encouraging new knowledge creation, capturing human knowledge in structural form, and enabling virtual workgroup collaboration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>Promoted as a means for rectifying the problems of a region in extreme need, the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission (AACC) only exposed and exacerbated the underlying antagonisms between Britain and the United States over the economic and political structure of the post-war world. This study places the AACC, formed in 1942, within the context of the Anglo-American wartime special relationship, and examines the political, economic, and security motives at the heart of this unique and little-known collaboration. It exposes the determination of the United States to use exigencies of war to impose its post-war plans upon Britain, and the tenacity of the British to defend even the smallest and least regarded of its possessions regardless of local and international opposition.</JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>The AACC was a battleground of conflicting British and American visions of a new West Indies, and it would thus serve as a rehearsal for key debates that would emerge at the end of the war. For the United States, the AACC was a vehicle for promoting America's broad postwar ambitions in the West Indies; for Britain, it was simply part of the price that had to be paid for American assistance in the war effort. Debates within the AACC over the future of West Indian sugar, the regulation of tariffs and trade, constitutional reform and the expansion of civil aviation mirrored wider British and American differences.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper derives from a parent study titled, Co-operative ERP Lifecycle Knowledge Management (Gable et al., 1998). The central goal of that study is to rationalise knowledge management activities of the three key players involved in ERP lifecycle support; namely the client, the vendor and the implementation partner or consultant. The consultant can play varied roles in a greater or lesser capacity across client ERP installations. It is posited in the parent study that the consultant‚Äôs role (and the roles of all key players) should be driven by a carefully considered ERP lifecycle-wide knowledge sourcing strategy for the client. Understanding the ERP knowledge marketplace and related dynamics is of clear value to the development of such strategy. In this paper we tentatively explore the concepts of ‚Äúknowledge-sourcing‚Äù and ‚Äúknowledge strategy friction.‚Äù We further describe a preliminary attempt to instantiate these concepts through an exploratory, descriptive case study of the ‚ÄúSAP services ecosystem.‚Äù A broader, related objective of the parent study is to test the power of a ‚Äúknowledge sourcing world-view‚Äù and the integrative potential and explanatory power of such a perspective, with particular emphasis on ERP marketplace dynamics.</jats:p>"

Some problems in implementing ERP system are documented, but the real challenge comes from the Internet and E-business. ERP is an enterprise wide system whose purpose is to achieve internal efficiency, while E-business cuts across different enterprises and extends the individual value chain into an Internet based, dynamic process aimed at maximizing external efficiency. To survive the E-business challenge, the arguably single, and also the best, solution for ERP systems is to integrate with E-business applications, which we call ERP II. By properly resolving the issues of integration via newly emerged technologies, and embracing the extended function of mobile-commerce, ERP II will continue to flourish in the next century.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, nearly all business processes are collaborative in the sense that multiple human agents or actors interact with one another for achieving one or more process goals. As a result, one can claim that one major factor in successful implementation of the ERP systems is development of appropriate conceptual models of the ERP process from various perspectives. In this chapter the writer, being a member of the CSCW (computer supported cooperative work) research community, introduces a conceptual model for ERP which has an emphasis on the collaborative nature of ERP process that explicitly addresses the ‚Äúawareness‚Äù and ‚Äúknowledge-sharing‚Äù issues within the ERP process. This conceptual model demonstrates collaboration requirements of the actors behind individual business processes as well as the relationships among these business processes. This chapter is intended to introduce to the ERP community a relevant piece of work in conceptual modelling from the perspective of CSCW with the aim of attracting research collaborators for further investigation in these fields.</jats:p>"

In working with colleagues inside and outside the Council, it became clear that information on adolescents, and the way data are organized, were limiting the ability to understand the diversity of their experiences or to develop programs to address that diversity. In the absence of data, many adolescent policies were implicitly based on the premise that the lives of adolescents in developing countries were like those of adolescents in Western countries. In fact, significant numbers of young people in the West do not fit this description, and even larger groups within the developing countries. The Council created tables to more clearly describe the diversity of the adolescent experience by drawing on Haiti Demographic and Health Survey data. The tables, presented in this report, are intended to be used as a basis for developing programs.</jats:p>"

A sample drawn from Asian American adult respondents to the 1992, 1993, and 1994 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) in the USA formed the data set. The results showed Asian Americans as not being homogeneous. There were distinctly different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics between six Asian American ethnic groups that affect health insurance coverage and health service utilization. The study method is useful for constructing health policy and services to address the general public need without adversely affecting smaller minority groups. Secondary analysis of well‚Äêconstructed national data sets such as the specific Asian ethnic groups in NHIS, offers a rich method for predicting the differential impact of specific health policies on various ethnic groups.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The irrational use of drugs is a major problem of present day medical practice and its consequences include the development of resistance to antibiotics, ineffective treatment, adverse effects and an economic burden on the patient and society. A study from Attock District of Pakistan assessed this problem in the formal allopathic health sector and compared prescribing practices of health care providers in the public and private sector. WHO recommended drug use indicators were used to study prescription practices.</jats:p><jats:p>Prescriptions were collected from 60 public and 48 private health facilities. The mean (¬±‚ÄâSE) number of drugs per prescription was 4.1‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.06 for private and 2.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.04 for public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). General practitioners (GPs) who represent the private sector prescribed at least one antibiotic in 62% of prescriptions compared with 54% for public sector providers. Over 48% of GP prescriptions had at least one injectable drug compared with 22.0% by public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Thirteen percent of GP prescriptions had two or more injections. More than 11% of GP prescriptions had an intravenous infusion compared with 1% for public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001). GPs prescribed three or more oral drugs in 70% of prescriptions compared with 44% for public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001).</jats:p><jats:p>Prescription practices were analysed for four health problems, acute respiratory infection (ARI), childhood diarrhoea (CD), fever in children and fever in adults. For these disorders, both groups prescribed antibiotics generously, however, GPs prescribed them more frequently in ARI, CD and fever in children (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.01). GPs prescribed steroids more frequently, however, it was significantly higher in ARI cases (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001). For all the four health problems studied, GPs prescribed injections more frequently than public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001). In CD cases GPs prescribed oral rehydration salt (ORS) less frequently (33.3%) than public providers (57.7%). GPs prescribed intravenous infusion in 12.3% cases of fever in adults compared with none by public providers (‚Äâ<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001).</jats:p><jats:p>A combination of non‚Äêregulatory and regulatory interventions, directed at providers as well as consumers, would need to be implemented to improve prescription practices of health care providers. Regulation alone would be ineffective unless it is supported by a well‚Äêestablished institutional mechanism which ensures effective implementation. The Federal Ministry of Health and the Provincial Departments of Health have to play a critical role in this respect, while the role of the Pakistan Medical Association in self‚Äêregulation of prescription practices can not be overemphasized. Improper prescription practices will not improve without consumer targeted interventions that educate and empower communities regarding the hazards of inappropriate drug use.

In 1996, the Information Systems group convinced top management to pursue a big-bang ERP implementation of SAP R/3. To reduce project risk, risk management was practiced. First, only modules that matched the functionality of the then-existing systems were targeted, avoiding as much as possible software modifications and process reengineering. Second, a steering committee was set up to handle conflict resolution and set priorities throughout the project and top users were given responsibility with implementing modules within their respective functions. R/3 went into production on July 1, 1998, six months ahead of schedule and without exceeding the $4.95 million budget.</jats:p>"

A knowledge-based approach is used to determine the initial conditions that will yield a certain desired state of the dynamic system. The search space is limited by using a set of rules because reasoning about dynamic systems is basically searching an infinite space. In this study, first-order logic is used for knowledge representation and reasoning. The methodology is applied to playing a pool game. The dynamics of the motion of the balls are complicated and significant expertise is required to know how to strike the balls. Simulated results presented show how the rules help in finding the appropriate strategies for playing the game.</jats:p>",

At that time, those advocating greater attention to adolescent issues were concerned about adolescent fertility‚Äîparticularly outside of marriage‚Äîand adolescent ‚Äúrisk-taking‚Äù behavior. As an international scientific organization with its mandate centered around the needs of developing countries, the Council sought a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of the problems confronting adolescents in the developing world. In working with colleagues inside and outside the Council, it became clear that information on adolescents, and the way data are organized, were limiting the ability to understand the diversity of their experiences or to develop programs to address that diversity. In the absence of data, many adolescent policies were implicitly based on the premise that the lives of adolescents in developing countries were like those of adolescents in Western countries. In fact, significant numbers of young people in the West do not fit this description, and even larger groups within the developing countries. The Council created tables to more clearly describe the diversity of the adolescent experience by drawing on Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey data. The tables, presented in this report, are intended to be used as a basis for developing programs.</jats:p>"

First, two anti-swing control laws, one for hoisting up and the other for hoisting down, are proposed based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Then a new path-planning strategy is proposed based on the concept of minimum-time control and the proposed anti-swing control laws. The proposed path planning is free from the usual constraints of small load swing, slow hoisting speed, and small hoisting distance. The effectiveness of the proposed path planning is shown by computer simulation with high hoisting speed and hoisting ratio.</jats:p>",

The primary focus of this paper is on the architecture of the new process planning approach, using function blocks as controller language. The secondary focus is on the other supporting technologies such as machining feature-based design and agent-based decision-making. The methodology proposed for distributed process planning is based on a design-for-machining concept that can seamlessly integrate feature-based design and agent-based planning into function block-based CNC control. Different from traditional methods, the proposed approach has a two-layer structure ‚Äì supervisory planning and operation planning. The supervisory planning is performed in advance at shop floor level, followed by the operation planning accomplished at run-time at machine level by open CNC controllers. Through decentralization, the distributed process planning shows promise of improving system performance within today‚Äôs continually changing shop floor environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To determine the value of IT once it has been put into place and used, it is important to understand the context of the application of IT. Basically, the role of IT is to enable strategic change and improve business performance in several dimensions. IT enables the rapid delivery of top-quality, increasingly customized products and services, it supports organizations in meeting high standards in customer care, and it provides the means to compress design and development times in order to be the first to market. IT helps to launch new products more frequently, to explore and enter new markets faster, and to seek new distribution channels. All of these dimensions can give companies a powerful competitive edge, and IT is increasingly woven into them. IT does not stand on its own but contributes to realizing business objectives in today‚Äôs competitive, often global environment. To determine the value of IT once it has been put into place and used, it is important to first understand the context of the application of IT since it does not stand on its own but rather contributes to realizing business objectives. The first part of this chapter provides a review of the evolution of the role and application of IT, leading to its role in today‚Äôs information-based organization. Secondly, it is obvious that the best value from IT is gained if the ‚Äúright‚Äù investment decisions for IT are made. To make the right decisions about IT in the context of business objectives, organizations need to carry out some form of IT planning. Planning-for-success is therefore the second main subject of this chapter. The evolution of IT planning practices is briefly described, leading to the most important attributes of contemporary, effective IT planning approaches. Finally, the chapter links the distinct roles of IT with the planning and valuation approaches for IT investments in relation to their business purpose.</jats:p>"

The selection, implementation, use and continuous change and evolution of enterprise systems (ES) require a great amount of knowledge and experience. Empirical studies show that the management of knowledge is one of the main cost drivers of Enterprise Systems projects. Consequently, organizations have realized the need to better leverage their knowledge management for Enterprise Systems. This chapter proposes a framework for structuring knowledge for Enterprise Systems. This three-dimensional framework is derived from meta-case studies and comprehensive literature analysis. It consists of dimensions for the ES life cycle, the Knowledge Management life cycle and the types of knowledge. Preliminary empirical insights show that especially the lack of soft knowledge is a critical success factor that leads to significant consulting costs in ES projects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relationship between land use and travel behaviour has attracted research interest in England over the last fifteen years, principally in connection with possible links between urban form and sustainability. Since the mid 1990s this work has been overtaken somewhat by Government policy initiatives. This is something of a mixed blessing. Official attention has shifted to the implementation of what is now an established line of policy. In academic circles, by contrast, there is increasing interest in mobility more generally as a phenomenon of contemporary society. In this context the pattern of land use remains an important influence, if only because of the physical legacy presented by the established pattern of development. However, the evolution in travel behaviour is, as ever, conditioned by broader social and economic trends (Gillespie et al 1998). This paper provides an overview of English experience in this field in three main sections: research, policy and implementation. To place these in context they are preceded by a section titled 'background' which highlights for an international audience some of the distinctive features of the English scene, in terms of geography, cultural attitudes to development and travel, and institutional arrangements for land use and transport planning. These require very careful consideration before any attempt is made to draw inferences for policy-making in other countries.</jats:p>"

Structured interviews were used to collect data in two stages. The first group of organisations was drawn from Australia and the results from this stage used to refine the data collection instrument. The second group consisted of relatively mature ERP based organisations from a range of industries around the world. The findings were analysed according to an established research framework from Business Process Change. This showed that while facilitators in aspects of e-business change management such as cultural readiness, knowledge and learning capabilities and relationship building were recognised by organisations, the extent to which they were incorporated as part of the implementation varied greatly. This suggests a rich field for future research study regarding the success of e-ERP projects.</jats:p>"

This has prolonged the production lead time and time to market. This paper describes a procedure to automatically derive all the feasible assembly sequences for automobile body assembly. This procedure is based on a mathematical model of the automobile body, obtained through the definitions of the connection matrix and contracted matrix. These two matrices represent the precedence constraint knowledge among components and subassemblies. The possible subassemblies are automatically detected by satisfying some mathematical conditions applicable to these matrices. For each subassembly and the whole product, all the possible assembly sequences are generated by rearranging the initial connection sub-matrix and the contracted matrix. The procedure can solve the ‚Äòcombinatorial explosion‚Äô problem efficiently by hierarchical subassembly detection.</jats:p>",

Theorists have described such activities as a ‚Äúmythmaking‚Äù process. A case study of an implementation at a large nonprofit organization is presented to demonstrate how myth-making served to construct an ERP system as an ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù system and at the same time served to elaborate existing organizational values. The myth functioned as a vehicle of consensual organizational reality, serving to align the acquisition of an ERP system with the organizational values, thereby garnering widespread support for a complex, expensive and relatively unknown technology.</jats:p>"

Aperiod of time within a day during which the individuals of both sexes, different age and profession are intellectually the most optimally efficient, was determined in the paper. The chronotype of a given person was taken into account for that purpose. The research was carried out using a questionnaire. The questioned individuals were divided into four groups: 120 students at the University of Novi Sad, 50 professors at the University of Novi Sad, 50 railway workers and 50 female civil servants employed in administration. The obtained results show the following: the highest percentages of students belong to the morning chronotype. They sleep more than professors do and the optimal time convenient for mental and heavy physical work is from 11 AM to 1 PM. This data should be taken into account while planning student tests. The University professors, both male and female, belong to the morning chronotype. The female professors sleep more than male professors, but are psychologically and physically optimally productive at the same time as the male professors, from 8 AM till 10 AM. In the group of railway workers, the most common are individuals of indifferent chronotype. The highest percentage of women employed in administration belong to the morning chronotype and for their optimal psychological activity they choose the period of time between 8 and 10 AM, as well as the railway workers. According to the opinion of most people that have been questioned, among all of the abovementioned groups, the optimal five-hour working period should begin at 8.30 AM.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>",

A Simulated Annealing Algorithm was used to optimize the objective function. As an additional advantage, inherited from the proposed methodology, the planning automation is achieved. Planning automation overcomes the traditional way based on trial error exercise, where an engineer using an anchoring application, decides how much of work wire and anchoring line must be paid out from both the floating system and the supply boat and additionally which horizontal force must be applied to the line trying settle the anchor on a previously defined target in the ocean floor. Some cases, from anchor deployment of some MODUs operating in deep-water oil fields in Brazil, are shown demonstrating some potentialities of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Growing government support has been evident during the past decade for macro-level workforce planning to ensure that future populations have access to appropriate health care services. Population ageing is impacting on workforce requirements and on workforce supply within Australia and internationally. Changes in financing and the organisation of health services are impacting on the availability of training and on the quality of working life. The age and gender profile and career expectations of young Australians are changing. These factors are all adding to the importance and complexity of workforce planning. This paper draws on data from various sources to describe Australia's hospital workforce, to explore supply-side workforce trends and to discuss some contemporary issues of concern to policy makers and workforce planners. The paper finds that in recent years there has been a 3 per cent decline in the number of full time equivalent staff in public hospitals, while the number in the private hospital workforce has increased by 28 per cent. The paper concludes that, nationally, there are serious limitations in the data available to describe and monitor the hospital workforce and that there is a need to remedy this situation.</jats:p>"

The chapter employs frequent use of quotes from the sources selected to assist the reader to understand the context and to verify the analysis. The findings are that the main reasons for adopting ERP are the modernization of systems, greater usability and flexibility, integration of data and systems, business process reengineering, an increase in the degree of electronic data interchange including the provision of Web-based interfaces to application systems, reduced maintenance and risk avoidance.</jats:p>"

At the national level its spatial part consisted of the national spatial plan, the defining concept for settlement management and growth, public service delivery, use of space and landscape transformation, protection of the environment, and guidelines for conflict management. Today, this form of planning is substituted by the national strategies and programs of each sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a systematic methodology to optimize the module instance configuration of an evolving product family (PF). The proposed methodology seeks to maximize the total profit of a PF for a given planning horizon by taking into account the interdependencies of modules at both the product level and the PF level. The module configuration optimization problem can be viewed as a stage-wise sequential decision process. Dynamic programming (DP) is suitable for modeling such problems. The DP-based methodology proposed in this paper breaks up the PF module instance configuration optimization problem into smaller DP optimization problems involving module groups based on the independence assumption of profit change due to the module replacement strategies. The aggregation concepts of independent module groups and module clusters are used to decrease the state space in the DP model. A module group is defined as a group of interacting modules linked by the replacement dependence relationships in a PF. A module cluster is defined as the modules within a module group that are strictly inter-dependent on each other in replacement actions. A DP model is established for each of the module groups to optimize the PF through individually optimizing the module configuration of the individual module groups. In the DP model, the time points with equal intervals during the planning horizon are considered as stages; the decision of module configuration strategies is defined as the control variable; the feasible combinations for the modules within one module group are selected as the states at each stage; and profit change (benchmarked with respect to profit without any module replacements) is treated as the contribution function that needs to be maximized. In the deterministic model, the expected change in profits and expected time of module instance availability are assumed to be deterministic. In the stochastic model, the profit change and the time of module instance availability are treated as uncertain events. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the total profit change distributions subjected to the uncertainties of data and module instance availabilities. We use an illustrative PF example to demonstrate how the suggested models can be used to optimize the PF architecture.</jats:p>",

For companies faced with incompatible information systems and inconsistent operating practices, ERP has been a dream come true. ERP presents companies with the opportunity to standardize and automate business processes throughout the organizations, thus increasing productivity and reducing cycle time. Although ERP systems have delivered value, it is becoming clear that the ERP model, which wraps organizational processes into one end-to-end application, may no longer be sufficient for today‚Äôs fast-moving, extended enterprises. With the rapid growth of the Internet, the business environment has changed dramatically. The world has become a global marketplace. According to Gartner Group, the worldwide business-to-business (B2B) market is forecasted to grow from 145 billion in 1999 to 7.29 trillion in 2004 (King, 2000).</jats:p>"

The model incorporates ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúhard‚Äù capacity constraints (soft constraints can be relaxed at a cost while hard constraints cannot be relaxed) and demand uncertainty. The firm receives additional demand information within the plan-ning horizon. The solution to the planning problem depends crucially on what is known about demand at the time of the capacity decision as well as the pricing decision. Historical acquisition costs of capacity are relevant for pricing whenever the same information is available for capacity planning and pricing. However, when the firm re-ceives additional demand information before making the pricing decision, only marginal cost is relevant for pricing. Different types of capacity constraints, i.e., soft vs. hard, affect how much capacity the firm obtains, but not how the firm sets prices.</jats:p>",

This article is an exploratory study that sets out to identify other costs related to ERP systems during their life-cycle. Through the different phases of the life-cycle we define and categorize the various costs. The costs were classified as tanglible and intangible. We also describe a case study where the costs related to the three initial phases of the life-cycle were analyzed: acquistion, implementation, and usage and maintenance. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and we pose some research questions for further work.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Various recent policy documents stress the need for the integration of sector policies. Several studies have recently been carried out looking at various aspects of policy integration, especially with respect to the integration of transport, land use planning and environment policy. Although literature in this area of research is growing, it is still however quite limited and rather sectoral. Most of the research is mainly technical and mainly focuses on policy options, instruments or assessment methods, rather than on decision-making processes and/or implementation issues. Little attention has been given to organisational and/or institutional aspects of policy integration and how this relates to theories from organisational, policy or political sciences. This paper provides an overview of theoretical frameworks for analysing policy integration and reviews policy documents and recent major research projects with links to policy integration (particularly within Europe). The paper aims to give a historical perspective on policy integration, summarise recent research, identify key ressearch gaps, consider the transferability of research results and identify promising new areas for future research. The paper is divided into four sections. The first section provides a historical overview of changes and trends in policy perspectives, focusing on the European level. The second section contains a review of literature (from both policy documents and theoretical literature) concerning policy integration. The third section summarises recent research projects (mainly funded by the European Commission) relevant to the integration of transport, land use planning and environment policy. This section also considers the issue of policy transfer. The final section contains conclusions and a number of recommendations for future research in this area.</jats:p>"

Main contributions of IT to organizations are increased efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness. Non-profit organizations can also benefit as much as for-profit organizations from IT. Education Organizations (EOs) for example, would benefit in terms of effective management of assets, improved communication channels, management of education system changes and systematic dissemination of academic materials. This paper proposes an IT Strategic Planning (ITSP) framework for EOs in order to plan and manage IT-related resources. The framework comprises of five phases namely Strategic Direction, Analysis, Strategy, Implementation and Evaluation. End result of this process would be the ITSP Manual, a detailed documentation of the organization‚Äôs strategic direction, its environment and specific action plans to achieve business targets. This manual can be used in policy and decision-making activities.</jats:p>"

This paper describes an application of this technique to mooring chain. In many cases, the technique is based on probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth in the structural components, and updating of the failure probability on the basis of inspections. The extension of this basis from a single component to very many components is necessary to tackle series systems, such as mooring chain, where a fatigue fracture can arise in any chain link. The theoretical basis for the analysis is described, including details of the model for stochastic dependency between the chain links. Results are shown that compare failure probabilities for a single chain link and a chain segment. The effects of various levels of inspection coverage are illustrated. An example of a cost optimal inspection plan is developed for mooring chain on an FPSO in the northern North Sea.</jats:p>",

Starting from Muratori's experience as a talented architect, deeply rooted in the Roman interpretation of Italian rationalism, the authors describe the growth of Muratori's interest in history as a means of recovering a sense of continuity in architectural practice. Adopting a theoretical approach grounded in architecture and urban design, he started working on a critical framework which could explain the creation and transformation of urban form over the centuries. He had many followers. The resurgence of interest in Muratori's work in the 1990s is described.</jats:p>"

The main idea of this paper is to challenge the history and evolution of Yugoslav planning system, legislature administration and education; planning techniques and the planning implementation. All these and other constitutive and important elements of a viable and flexible planning need to be considerably improved, since the arrival of a new political authorities and powers. The discussion should also enhance our knowledge about trans-national approaches and different planning ideas, concepts and practices applicable in the current Yugoslav planning environment. This could lead to a new planning based on global thinking and an interconnected world, flavoured with locally sustainable planning solutions that could bring the Yugoslav planning machinery on the board of the new century. At the same time, this approach would reflect how the Yugoslav planning community could improve its \"own values\" whilst looking forward to creating a modern and efficient planning mechanism.</jats:p>"

This article discusses the transformation processes taking place in dockland and riverside zones within the context of the current discourse on urban-development policy; it also describes the renaissance and the transformation in the image of such zones. The author outlines the experience of the changes of use which these areas have undergone, the reasons that led to such sites becoming derelict, and the regeneration process; he also summarises the current state of academic analysis of the subject. Proceeding from a broad-based explanatory approach, the article sets out five phases of the transformation process affecting the relations between city and dockland, concluding with a brief restatement of the importance, the opportunities, problems and risks posed by the redevelopment of dockland and riverside areas. ¬†</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a general agreement in the literature that social, technological, political, cultural, and economic factors encourage a greater number of businesses to globalize their operations and markets. To operate in more than one market or country involves complexity on a larger scale than to operate locally. The complexity is combined with increasing risks, a faster pace of change, and the difficulties of managing an organization in more than one country. Information and communication technologies (ICT) act not only as an imperative to globalize but also as a potential tool to help global managers to plan, and yet there is no conclusive study that these technologies are adequately providing assistance. Indeed, existing studies suggest that there is much room for improvement. At the same time, there is no coherent and well-tested theory to explain or predict the use of information and communication technologies for global planning. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents a causal model that groups predictor variables of the use of ICT in global planning under organizational, ICT, personal, and infrastructural factors. It also reports on a pilot study in which one hundred questionnaires were distributed to multinational companies in the United Kingdom (UK) and in South Africa (SA) to collect information to examine the role of ICT in global planning using the model. The result suggested among others that the Internet forms the most popular platform for building global planning tools. Factors most important to managers include the provision of timely information, provision of report and presentation facilities, and support for group working and alternative (highly summarized and detailed) views of information. On the other hand, managers appear not to be very satisfied with the provision of technology for global planning, partly because it does not adequately provide for creativity needed in global planning. Recommendations are made based on the findings, and areas for further research to enhance the validity of the model are highlighted.</jats:p>"

The planning and consulting period lasted through the time period of 1997 and 1998. The outsourcing and implementation tasks are expected to continue through 2000. In this chapter, we present the framework and model of the data warehouses developed by the committee during the planning and consulting stage. Our focus is on the data design and module design for a multi-dimensional database system. The data design aims to provide an integral model for the internal and external data sources. A core view of the multi-dimensional database is developed. The module design attempts to give an analytic model of the field, division, project, and agent performance along the dimension hierarchies. Actual versus budget and actual versus forecast analysis along with the time series analysis and ad hoc analysis are supported in the systems.</jats:p>"

Starting from an initial point on the path, it is required to traverse a path trajectory without halting the motion (typically due to switch from one inverse solution to another). The problem focuses on determining a starting configuration at the initial point on the path. The problem is formulated in terms of a constraint function and characterized by a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of index 2. These DAEs are solved numerically by Runge-Kutta (RK) methods while a best starting configuration is chosen using a cost-function driven optimization method. The formulation is demonstrated through a planar 3 degree of freedom robot manipulator.</jats:p>",

This chapter adopts the view that ERP systems are technological, organizational, and cognitive in nature. Along those dimensions, ERP systems can be distinguished from other IS, while also identifying similarities. Future research may concern the proposed characteristics of those dimensions and may also relate to their interactions and interrelations. Questions for investigation are presented throughout the paper. Further research promises to extend academic understanding of ERP systems, as a specific domain of IS. As a result, business practice can be supported to actually realize benefits with their ERP systems.</jats:p>"

Knowledge workers using computing and communication technologies produce intangible goods and services. They represent the primary leverage through which organizations maximize the value offered to their customers. Leveraging the intellectual assets of knowledge workers should be the primary focus of planning processes where customer service systems are designed along with accompanying IT solutions. Knowledge work will require new forms of management and, implicitly, a new strategy for human resource management (Collins, 1998). Consequently, human resource management is increasingly trying to reinvent itself around the emerging concepts of knowledge work and core competencies (Lawler, 2000).</jats:p>"

This application, Schedule Graph (SG) System, was designed to automate the sales schedule process that had previously been a paper and pencil process. The system was designed and implemented in a matter of months to reduce cost and deliver an application that was long overdue. The project had been proposed for years, but funding issues had routinely delayed initiation. The sales development organization worked on the design and development for this application for approximately six months. The application was released with numerous software, hardware and network problems. The effects on the customer community, the information systems department and other stakeholders were sharp and far reaching. This case study investigates the lessons learned with this application and the implications for theory and practice. It can be instrumental to information systems managers, academicians and students to learn from the success and pitfalls of other organizations related to information systems development and management.</jats:p>"

This robot is able to \n\nnavigate in a structured environment, with obstacles modeled as polygons, \n\nthus constituting a model based system. The path planning methodology \n\nbegins with the conditioning of the polygonal environment by offsetting \n\neach polygon in order to avoid the possibility of collision \n\nwith the mobile. Next, the modified polygonal environment is used \n\nto compute a preliminary shortest path (PA) between the two \n\nextreme positions of the trajectory in the plane (<jats:italic>x, y</jats:italic>). This \n\npreliminary path (PA) does not yet consider the restrictions on \n\nthe curvature and is formed only by straight line segments. \n\nA smoothing process follows in order to obtain a path \n\n(PS) that satisfies curvature restrictions which consist basically of joining \n\nthe straight line segments by circular arcs of minimum radius \n\n<jats:italic>R</jats:italic> (filleting). Finally, the initial and final orientation of the \n\nvehicle are accounted for. This is done using a technique \n\nwe have called the Star Algorithm, because of the geometric \n\nshape of the resulting maneuvers. A final complete path (PC) \n\nis thus obtained.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A motion-planning algorithm for control of an axis of miniature spacecraft using microactuators is presented in this paper. The axis determines the orientation of the spacecraft except for its spin about the axis. This work is motivated by a novel attitude control technique for miniature spacecraft using pseudo-wheels proposed in our prior work. A pseudo-wheel achieves net orientation changes using a sequence of fully reversed partial rotations by utilizing the non-commutative property of finite rigid body rotations. Finding the sequence for a desired change in orientation constitutes the inverse kinematics problem. Our prior work presented an approximate method for this problem for which the existence of the solution is not proved. In this paper, we simplify the problem by considering only the orientation of an axis attached to the spacecraft ignoring the spin about it. For this simplified problem, an accurate algorithm is presented using a technique called pair-wise rotation method, and the existence of the solution is proved. Several numerical experiments have been carried out to validate the new motion-planning algorithm. An axis-control has much practical utility for spacecraft in applications such as pointing solar panels or a camera.</jats:p>",

The problem of developing inference strategies for automated process planning in machining is one such area of successful application of AI based approaches. Given the high complexity of the process planning expertise, development of inference techniques for automated process planning is a big challenge to researchers. The traditional inference methods based on variant and generative approaches using decision trees and decision tables suffer from a number of shortcomings, which have prompted researchers to seek alternative approaches and turn to AI for developing intelligent inference techniques. In this article, we have reviewed, categorized and summarized the research on applications of AI for developing inference methods for automated process planning systems. We have described our ongoing research work on developing an intelligent inference strategy based on artificial neural networks for implementing machining process selection for rotationally symmetric parts.</jats:p>",

The present system at the company is analyzed for the three components viz. supply chain design, supply chain planning and supply chain operations. The characterization of the present system is based on high-implied demand uncertainties, high forecast errors, provisions for mixed order matching, seasonality of demands, end of month peak characterization and the irregular flow of information. The initial analysis is based on a simple queuing model that incorporates the theory of constraints to evaluate the criticality of the information flow in the system. This model is then extended to incorporate other parameters required in the strategic alignment of the system with the corporate objectives. The current initiatives in the company are then developed further into a strategic plan that incorporates considerations of new product launches, decreasing product life cycles, fragmentation of supply chain ownership, globalization and other difficulties in execution.</jats:p>",

However the researchers found some major omissions in those recommendations as far as infrastructure was concerned. In some developing countries, it is impossible to install PCs because there is no electricity. Similarly network connections and access to the Internet without telephone service would be impossible. A comparison is made between the recommendations and the realities of the environment in Haiti. Future implementations could benefit from the findings of the authors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this chapter we focus on the early stage of evaluating and selecting an ERP system prior to implementation. Only a part of decision making for ERP systems can be handled by a definite or accepted procedure such as standard investment calculations. There are many other intangible decision-making criteria needing to be judged and evaluated by the decision makers. There is no agreed-upon and formal procedure for this important task (Hecht 1997; Laudon &amp; Laudon, 1998). Therefore it seems necessary to investigate decision-making practices to increase the understanding of this complex and important task. We also focus on the decision-making situation faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is of particular importance because SMEs are more and more experiencing the need for integration, especially for interorganizational integration, and expecting ERP software to fulfill these needs. The availability of relatively inexpensive hardware is fostering this situation (Gable &amp; Stewart, 1999). In general, decision making in SMEs features much greater constraints on the ability to gather information in order to reduce uncertainty about their investment (Cobham, 2000). Considering ERP software decisions with its complex and far-reaching implications, poor decision making by SMEs can result in disastrous situations.</jats:p>"

The first step to all modernization projects should involve strategic planning, to ensure that the overall long and short-term goals of the plant are met.

Process planning to integrate the two different processes is a key issue. In this paper, an algorithm of adaptive slicing for five-axis Laser Aided Manufacturing Process (LAMP) is summarized which can generate uniform- or non-uniform slices. In order to avoid interruption in the deposition process for one slice, a skeleton-based offset deposition tool-path method is used to generate continuous moving paths. A method to build a non uniform (thickness) layer which utilizes two processes is presented and an overall algorithm for integration is described. The newly developed algorithm implemented in the process planning helps the hybrid system build part more efficiently.</jats:p>",

Next to bottlenecks in terms of infrastructure, human capital and industrial structure, the county Luechow-Dannenberg suffers from a marked social and political segmentation of the local community, which is rooted in the ongoing dispute about the nuclear waste facilities in the village of Gorleben. This paper analyses social capital in the region and network structures between the decision makers. The study reveals that the local actor network is clearly segmented into opposing groups and it proves difficult for the regional community to reach consensus about measures for regional development. As a result regional decision making processes and economic development are decisively obstructed. ¬†</jats:p>"

Edwards and Bann are introducing ERP software that appeals to the market segment of the SMEs. Introduction of the ERP systems for SMEs includes compact packages, flexible pricing policies, new implementation methodologies, and more specialized functionalities. The strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) framework of the ERP software offered by the aforementioned vendors for the SMEs requires in-depth analysis based on real field data. The aim of this study is to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of ERP systems offered by the five leading vendors for the SMEs in Australia. Multiple case study design approach is used here for collecting the primary data from the ERP vendors. A SWOT framework is developed to study the functionality of the ERP systems offered by these vendors. This framework may guide the managers of SMEs in selecting and implementing ERP systems for their organizations.</jats:p>"

Three extended wave propagation methods, the neighboring search, the depth-first search, and the extensile neighboring search, are investigated. The proposed extensile neighboring method not only can provide a reliable solution to successfully search a path, but also can autonomously reduce the manipulation steps effectively by the developed recursive algorithm.</jats:p>",

Active support (AS) is also an approach designed to improve the quality of life of people with severe disabilities by enabling them to participate as fully as possible in daily activities. PCP and some of the components of AS are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. While PCP can generate ideas, AS can help implement them, and used together PCP and AS can provide a way to facilitate user participation and improve users' quality of life. This paper uses a case history to illustrate this potential, and describes how a particular form of PCP, essential lifestyle planning (ELP), was used in conjunction with some of the planning and programming components of AS.</jats:p>",

They are heterogeneous in that they are recognized as having different levels and/or types of expertise. Research of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems must carefully examine expert opinion and determine when using HEO is appropriate and when it should be stratified. In addition, where possible, previous research needs to supplement or be compared to the HEO to determine similarities and differences with other groups.</jats:p>",

To address these concerns Alimentos Peru launched several projects, one of which involved the implementation of an ERP system. The case explains the criteria used to evaluate and select the system, as well as the main issues and problems that arose during the implementation process. More specifically, the case focuses upon a set of implementation factors, such as top management support, user participation, and project management.

This strategy integrates the feed drive dynamics with the minimum-time trajectory planing to achieve the desired feed rate at the appropriate tool position along specified tool path. It optimizes the use of the feed drive capabilities and provides good tracking of the cutting geometry variations. The feed scheduling is applied to maintain near-constant cutting force magnitude. An integrated geometric and mechanistic force model is used to estimate the in-cut geometry and the cutting force. A methodology based on time series modeling and analysis is proposed to identify the low frequency feed drive dynamics. The resulting model is applied as an acceleration/deceleration processor (Acc/Dec) to relate the actual feed rate to the commanded feed rate specified in the G-Code file. The effectiveness of the OFSS is analyzed using ball end milling operations. Its performance in terms of productivity and machining safety is assessed based on comparison with other feed scheduling techniques where the trajectory planing does not consider the feed drive dynamics.</jats:p>",

Further, interviewees identified a number of common implementation problems (e.g., improperly trained personnel and inadequate process reengineering efforts) that result in heightened risks. Interviewees also reported that ongoing risks differ across applications and across vendor packages.

We investigate here quasi-symmetry per se, in contrast to geographical tradition, which has been more focused on the exogenous socioeconomic and spatial conditions. In particular, the ‚Äòsize ‚Äì utility ‚Äì accessibility‚Äô parameterization of migration counts turn out to rely exclusively upon the quasi-symmetry of flows. Various facets of quasi-symmetry are presented and put in correspondence with Markov chains theory, Bradley ‚Äì Terry ‚Äì Luce decision theory, the Weidlich ‚Äì Haag model, and alternative classical statistical models (marginal homogeneity, symmetry, independence). Existing as well as presumably new estimation and model selection procedures (maximum likelihood, minimum discrimination information, maximum entropy, generalized power divergence, least squares and logarithmic least squares) are discussed in a way which unifies different traditions in gravity modelling. </jats:p>",

The survey found that the number of planning authorities allowing public speaking appeared to have doubled in the last few years. At the same time, over one third of all planning authorities still did not allow public speaking, and had no intention of introducing it. Moreover, of those that did allow it, only one in five permitted the full range of interests recommended by the Nolan Committee on standards of conduct in local government. We argue that there is a need for planning authorities to exchange experiences on speaking rights in order to inform ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô, and conclude that there may well be tensions between the drive to improve efficiency in local government decision making and the demands for more openness and accountability. </jats:p>",

Each request \nis a <jats:italic>fetch-and-send</jats:italic> service task associated with \ntwo request-locations, namely, a source and a destination. The \nproposed framework is developed using propositional linear time \ntemporal logic of Manna and Pnueli. The novelty lies in the \nuse of the formal language for both the specification and \ntheorem-proving analysis of precedence constraints among the \nlocation visits that are inherent in route sequences. In the \nframework, legal route sequences‚Äîeach of which visits \nevery request location once and only once in the precedence \norder of fetch-and-send associated with every such request‚Äîis \nformalized and justified, forming a basis upon which the link \nbetween a basic precedence constraint and the corresponding \ncanonical forbidden-state formula is formally established. Over \na given base route plan, a simple procedure to generate a feasible \nsubplan based on a specification of the forbidden-state canonical \nform is also given. An example demonstrates how temporal logic \nanalysis and the proposed procedure can be applied to select \na final (feasible) subplan based on additional precedence constraints.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of planning a safe trajectory for a free-flying robot to approach an uncontrolled spinning satellite is addressed. First, a heuristic plan is presented for a simple planar case, which constructs a collision-free path within realistic system constraints. Second, a general numerical optimization technique for planning a safe spatial trajectory is presented. In it, the approach path is parameterized and a cost function based on performance metrics is minimized in order to find the optimal path. The results are analyzed, and it is shown that optimization techniques can be used to produce a far safer approach trajectory than the heuristic method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes analytics and experiments on a novel 4-wheel vehicle. The vehicle has back wheel drive and steering in addition to wheels that can expand and change radius. The motivation for this design is to attain added navigation capability by expanding the wheels according to the requirements of the terrain. In this paper, we discuss the motion of the vehicle on a flat floor. The steering angle is kept at zero so that the vehicle has a planar motion. The contact point of the wheel with the ground is assumed to be directly underneath the center of the wheel and has no slip. The rolling constraints are nonholonomic, i.e., are non-integrable. The rate constraints are written in an input-affine drift-less control system. The structure of this drift-less control system allows to determine the differentially flat outputs of the system. Motion planning of the vehicle between two configurations is achieved through planning of these differentially flat outputs. These trajectories are then used to determine a feedback controller. A dynamic simulation is performed using MATLAB. The motions are currently being implemented on the physical hardware using a dSPACE control system.</jats:p>",

Several regional associations currently have taxon advisory groups (TAGs) in place whose primary role is to develop taxon‚Äêspecific collection plans. During their planning process, TAGs review all known taxa of interest and evaluate them based on relevant criteria. TAGs also evaluate the total amount of captive space available to determine the number of priority taxa that can be maintained. In addition, some TAGs heighten their impact on conservation by producing an action plan of select conservation and research projects to be supported by participating institutions. Although current guidelines for regional collection plan (RCP) development are extremely useful for some TAGs, such as those for most mammalian taxa, they do not address the needs of other more speciose TAGs, such as those for fish, invertebrates, and amphibians. These TAGs, characterized by their numerous taxa and more flexible space requirements, still need to develop plans for the species they manage. We recommend that highly speciose TAGs make development of an action plan their highest priority and use it to direct the RCP process. This will limit the number of taxa they need to consider, while ensuring that their RCPs are directly relevant to conservation. Once their action plans have been developed, speciose TAGs can then determine which species are most important to zoological collections and at what level they should be managed. This strategy represents a departure from the current processes used to develop RCPs for many mammalian and avian species and, as such, has not yet been addressed. An action plan‚Äêdriven approach will result in more practical and relevant planning for speciose TAGs. Zoo Biol 21:313‚Äì320, 2002. ¬© 2002 Wiley‚ÄêLiss, Inc.</jats:p>",

The potential of robots to undertake such tasks lies on their ability to intelligently and efficiently locate and interact with objects in their environment. This paper describes a novel method to plan paths for mobile robots in a partially known environment observed by an overhead camera. The environment consists of dynamic obstacles and targets. A new methodology, Extrapolated Artificial Potential Field is proposed for real time robot path planning. The proposed Extrapolated Artificial Potential Field is capable of navigating robots situated among moving obstacles and target. An algorithm for probabilistic collision detection is introduced. The paper summarizes this approach, and discusses the results of path planning experiments using an Amigobot. The result shows that our method is effective.</jats:p>",

However, principles of relevant costing imply that product prices should be independent of how a firm allocates fixed manufacturing cost to products. Recent research tries to resolve this conflict between theory and practice by expanding the scope of the problem; pricing is only one part of the larger problem of determining which products to keep and which products to drop, how much capacity to install, and how to allocate available capacity among the products. An emerging view is that we must jointly consider the capacity-planning and product-pricing problems to clarify the role of full costing in these decisions. In this article we provide a critical overview of the results from this research, highlight how a combination of analytic and numerical methods have contributed to our understanding, and suggest directions for future research.</jats:p>",

The public water supply to this resource zone is derived from a complex mix of surface and ground water sources, and supplies nearly 3 million people. The most significant aquifer in the East Midlands is the Nottinghamshire Sherwood Sandstone which supplies approximately one quarter of the deployable output for the resource zone (some 200 Ml d\n            <jats:sup>‚àí1</jats:sup>\n            ). This aquifer is over-licensed and historically abstraction has exceeded the long-term average recharge. Severn Trent Water has agreed reductions in groundwater licences from this aquifer; however more reductions are targeted by the Environment Agency following its recent reassessment of resources and the introduction of the ‚Äòenvironmental fraction‚Äô. In order to meet the existing resource shortfall and the continuing pressure to reduce abstraction licences, Severn Trent Water propose to support its new surface water abstraction on the River Trent by developing groundwater resources beneath the City of Birmingham. Significant further work is required by water industry regulators and Severn Trent to resolve the projected long-term supply deficit.\n          </jats:p>",

The interpretation of the data can be supported by 3-dimensional visualization techniques. The further analysis requires often the attributation of the particular functional or anatomical entities. To attribute these interactively we developed two different visualization strategies. In the first one the shape of the structures is modelled with OpenGL achieving very fast response times, most notably during the navigation. The second strategy, the direct rendering of the volume, benefits from the accurate reproduction of the vascular structures. Although the rendering needs much more time, the strategy provides similar response times for the attributation. Thus, the strategies complement one another.</jats:p>"

After some general theoretical considerations, the demand-side effects of the university are estimated by means of a regional multiplier analysis. The most important supply-side effects are analysed through a survey of firms. This shows that the university is noticed by only two thirds of regional enterprises, and that courses of study, activities in research and development and in further education, and also other potentials for co-operation, are scarcely recognised by the firms. The NUAS thus has a serious image problem.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n¬†&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Planning technology includes utilizing linear diagrams with a direct usage of input data from a plant‚Äôs database. A model has been developed to determine the critical path and also, to define steps for the most economical shortening of the entire plan. Several plan variations are developed (according to specified goals) and the management determines the optimal variation. After selecting a plan, it is possible to control and create work orders for individual tasks in certain activities. Task completion percentage, activity cost, and the total cost of the plan are also provided.</jats:p>",

The approach uses techniques developed in geometric morphometrics, a relatively new discipline centered on mapping change in bone and other morphologies through evolutionary time across taxa. Warps analysis is introduced and its terms and protocols explained. An example of warps analysis as applied to geographic data is presented. The example focuses on the AIDS epidemic in two boroughs of New York City. Female adult AIDS incidence and percentage newborns exposed to HIV, by zip code for the years 1991 ‚Äì 98, are used to generate annual configurations within an ecological parameter space. A warps analysis of those configurations indicates a clear shift in the relative positions of Manhattan zip codes during the 1990s. The analysis shows the relative positions of two subareas comprised of Harlem and Lower Manhattan zip codes were displaced in contrary directions in the parameter space with the introduction of antiretroviral combination therapies (HAART). In contrast, a warps analysis of the Bronx's AIDS parameter space shows few definable zip code groupings or temporal trends before or with HAART. The promises and problems in applying warps analysis to geographic data are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1999 PEMEX Gas (PGPB) has adopted a risk management scheme as common practice to support maintenance programming in a pipeline network of more than 11,000 kilometres. The risk management approach has been extensively used in the 14 working sites that comprise the pipeline division. Taking into account that over the past four years the pipeline incident rate has been significantly reduced and has thus lessened the consequence of failure cost in terms of reduced service interruption, property damage and safety, PGPB decided to re-evaluate and upgrade its risk management programme by enhancing the risk assessment tool to better reflect increased awareness and experience with the evaluation of the pipeline network risks. Decisions to implement risk‚Äìreduction activities derived from the results of the risk assessment phase are addressed in terms of ‚ÄúDollars of Risk‚Äù by a quantitative risk model. Development of Tolerable Risk Criteria (Ref. 2) indicated the amount of risk that PGPB is willing to maintain in its pipeline facilities. This paper shows a case study of a risk management application, describing the benefits of having a methodology available to support maintenance planning and investment in pipeline systems.</jats:p>",

The list is by no means exhaustive and we welcome thoughts and comments on other criteria and other areas.

I read charter reform in the context of an emergent literature on politics in global cities. That literature emphasizes the rising importance in global city politics of new social movements among marginalized populations. It argues that the new movements are increasingly playing a central role in global city politics. In the struggle over charter reform in Los Angeles, however, such movements were conspicuously absent. This finding does not invalidate the literature on new movements in global city politics, but it does point to the need for more detailed research into just what role such movements will play in global city politics. In particular, the case suggests that both formal political structures and electoral politics remain significant features of global city politics. If the new social movements are to have a lasting and transforming impact on global city politics, part of their project will have to engage such formal politics. In this paper I demonstrate the need for more research that investigates how and why new social movements engage the local state and electoral politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation are heavily implicated in the decline of biodiversity throughout the world. Numerous conservation programmes have emerged in the attempt to deal with these primary threats but they are often isolated and disparate, foregoing opportunities for integrated, cumulative approaches and benefits. This paper describes an approach that, through the integration of species' modelled distributions, and the application of landscape ecology principles, systematically considers the spatial requirements of priority forest fauna as surrogates for biodiversity across the landscape. With the aid of innovative Geographic Information System analysis tools, key habitats and corridors for priority faunal assemblages are delineated across north-east New South Wales. The mapped outputs from this study provide spatially complete, data-driven, systematically derived conservation frameworks for the region. The frameworks provide an explicit basis for regional protected area networks and a landscape context for regional conservation planning. As predicted high conservation value habitats, the mapped key habitats and corridors are also focus areas for the protection, enhancement and restoration of native vegetation. The Geographic Information System-referenced key habitats and corridors conservation frameworks have been adopted for conservation planning in north-east New South Wales, including \"off-reserve\" planning (e.g., government and community-based programmes at regional, catchment and local levels), and \"on-reserve\" planning (e.g., national park and nature reserve management planning). The approach is applicable to other regions, wherever Geographic Information System-based spatial mapping, describing habitat quality for fauna species, can be collated. </jats:p>"

Joint selection is based on inspection records, fatigue and reliability analysis. Fatigue analysis is used to identify fatigue sensitive tubular joints, thus reliability analysis and inspection records are used to assess the joint selection. The objective is to reduce the number of inspected joints whilst maintaining the platform risk level within acceptable limits. A relation between the reliability index Œ≤, a weighted average stress range value and tubular joint geometrical expressions is presented for the selection of joints for inspection. Experience obtained from inspection records is considered for an assessment of the joints selected for inspection. Cost reduction is determined from a comparison of this approach with inspection programmes applied in the past.</jats:p>",

The healthy tissue and some organs, called critical organs which are quite intolerable for radiation, are always irradiated, too. Therefore, the careful treatment plan has to be constructed to ensure high and homogeneous dose in the tumor, but on the other hand to spare the normal tissue and critical organs possibly well. </jats:p><jats:p> In the radiation therapy treatment planning one tries to optimize the dose distribution in the way that the above aim is satisfied. The dose distributions can be generated with different techniques. The most recent of them is the so-called multileaf collimator (MLC) delivery technique. Calculation of the dose distribution demands some dose calculation model. The paper gives a model and theoretical basis of planning applying the Boltzmann-transport equation in dose calculation and MLC delivery technique. The existence of solutions and the optimal treatment planning are considered. A preliminary artificial computer simulation is included. </jats:p>",

Competency gap analysis helps to develop required competency in line with the organisational mission, vision and strategic objectives. HRP provides strategic basis for taking HR decisions, anticipating change. Of-late HRP has become an important enterprise-wide strategic function not only to achieve goals and objectives but also to sustain present level in organisations. Globally, skill shortages, competency gap, redundancies, downsizing, rightsizing are the major issues in today's organisations. </jats:p><jats:p> The biggest problem for manpower or human resource redundancy lies with inadequate Human Resource Planning (HRP). To achieve any goal, manpower requirement needs to be assessed, located and harnessed. HRP is not mere assessment of number of men required. An organisation also has to categorise men as per their knowledge and skills and so also to ensure their balanced allocation. </jats:p><jats:p> This study discusses the contemporary HRP process, without, however, discarding the importance of traditional processes altogether. Traditional processes, by and large follow logical sequence to study the job and then translate the job information into manpower requirement. Here, however, we have discussed the importance of application of some selected quantitative manpower planning models and then suggested their consideration for reducing the risk of inaccurate manpower planning. While doing so, some theoretical discussions with illustrations have been made deliberately to avoid any possible gap in understanding the models. </jats:p>",

We focus on the interaction between an asymmetrically informed SNGA, national governments, and polluting firms in DCs. Two scenarios are compared. In the first, the DC government and the SNGA negotiate a ceiling on pollution abatement and then the SNGA offers an incentive-compatible and collusion-proof IEA to the two DC parties. In the second, the DC government manipulates its monitoring device and the SNGA takes this into account when designing the IEA. Our principal conclusions are as follows. First, the contractually specified levels of pollution abatement and the pattern of the weighted marginal costs of abatement differ depending on the form of the DC government's representation. Second, for the most part, the SNGA is able to extract the informational rents from the government and the firm. Third, as compared with contracting with monitoring device manipulation, the SNGA will prefer contracting with a ceiling constraint. Fourth, the pollution ceiling and the budget constraints limit the magnitude of the monetary transfers that the SNGA can offer and the extent of pollution abatement that the SNGA can require. Finally, by explicitly modeling the effects of sovereignty, that is, by disallowing the possibility of monitoring and enforcement and by allowing the possibility of collusion, we show that the SNGA's lack of monitoring and enforcement powers do not preclude it from designing effective collusion-proof IEAs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper deals with mathematical human resource planning; more specifically, it suggests a new model for a manpower‚Äêplanning system. In general, we study a <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>‚Äêclassed hierarchical system where the workforce demand at each time period is satisfied through internal mobility and recruitment. The motivation for this work is based on various European Union incentives, which promote regional or local government assistance programs that could be exploited by firms not only for hiring and training newcomers, but also to improve the skills and knowledge of their existing personnel. In this respect, in our augmented mobility model we establish a new ‚Äòtraining/standby‚Äô class, which serves as a manpower inventory position for potential recruits. This class, which may very well be internal or external to the system, is incorporated into the framework of a non‚Äêhomogeneous Markov chain model. Furthermore, cost objectives are employed using the goal‚Äêprogramming approach, under different operating assumptions, in order to minimize the operational cost in the presence of system's constraints and regulations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The logging sector in Oregon is characterized by extensive subcontracting between wood-commodity manufacturing firms and independent logging contractors. Why is this so? Considerable recent scholarship has examined the dynamics of flexible production systems, including regional contractor networks, as prominent aspects of late capitalism. Although useful, existing accounts of flexibility are inadequate to explain why logging in particular would be subject to contract production relations. A second literature emphasizes the ‚Äòdifference‚Äô of nature-centered sectors, particularly industrial agriculture. I argue that a similar logic applies to logging. That is, natural sources to unpredictable variation and extensive, inconstant geographies restrict the predictability and calculability of production, and the imposition of labor monitoring and discipline. Contracts are a strategy for firms to displace resulting risks and costs onto contractors, while at the same time inducing expert-based rationalization of production. Repeat contracting provides a means of capturing expert knowledge among reliable contractors with knowledge of the parent firm's lands and mills. This is a particularly appealing strategy for vertically and horizontally integrated firms with complex operational portfolios. However, though contracting is one flexibility strategy, Weyerhaeuser's Competitive Logging Program featuring restructured wage relations provides an alternative path to more flexible production, one that further illuminates some of the problems of nature-based production. </jats:p>",

An analytical model is proposed for an idealized operating environment with the objective of determining the optimal slack time that should be allocated to a flexroute segment. The optimization objective is defined to minimize total operator and user cost, which enables a systematic examination of complex interactions among the system parameters. An equation is derived for the relationship between the number of feasible deviations and various system parameters such as slack time, zone size, and dwell time. Subsequent analysis shows that the analytical model is elaborate enough to provide substantial insights into various issues that may arise in designing a flex-route service. A simulation analysis is conducted to validate some of the conclusions drawn from the analytical model and to further analyze the implications of stochastic variation in passenger demand. </jats:p>",

Transcripts were analysed using different analytical procedures, including pattern identification, clustering of conceptual groupings, identification of relationships between variables, constant comparisons, and theoretical memos. Older parents' reluctance to engage in the planning of future living options was found to be multi-factorial and linked to the macro- and micro-systems within which these families were embedded.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes the foundations and algorithms of a new probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planner that is: single-query ‚Äîinstead of pre-computing a roadmap covering the entire free space, it uses the two input query configurations to explore as little space as possible; bi-directional ‚Äîit explores the robot's free space by building a roadmap made of two trees rooted at the query configurations; and lazy in checking collisions ‚Äîit delays collision tests along the edges of the roadmap until they are absolutely needed. Several observations motivated this strategy: (1) PRM planners spend a large fraction of their time testing connections for collision; (2) most connections in a roadmap are not on the final path; (3) the collision test for a connection is most expensive when there is no collision; and (4) any short connection between two collision-free configurations has high prior probability of being collision-free. The strengths of single-query and bi-directional sampling techniques and those of delayed collision checking reinforce each other. Experimental results show that this combination reduces planning time by a large factor, making it possible to efficiently handle difficult planning problems, such as problems involving multiple robots in geometrically complex environments. This paper specifically describes the application of the planner to multi-robot planning and compares results obtained when the planner uses a centralized planning approach (PRM planning is then performed in the joint configuration space of the robots) and when it uses a decoupled approach (the PRM planner is invoked several times, first to compute a path of each robot independent of the others, and then to coordinate those paths). On a simulated six-robot welding station combining 36 degrees of freedom, centralized planning has proven to be a much more effective approach than decoupled planning. </jats:p>",

During the past four years PGPB has significantly reduced their pipeline incident rate and have thus lessened their costs in terms of reduced business interruption, environmental and property damages, and safety to the public and PGPB employees. On the same basis, PGPB has increased their pipeline informational databases as they relate to operations, maintenance, construction, and design for their pipeline systems. This approach provides a quantitative means to balance the cost to preserve the pipeline assets against the added value measured in terms of pipeline risk reduction measured in terms of cost of risk. Furthermore, provides information that can be use to make value-based maintenance or operating decisions to promote continued long-term safe operation in a setting that evaluates risk reduction in terms of business interruption, environmental and property damage, and public and employee safety.</jats:p>",

The model aims to reduce uncertainty in the design process and with it the risk of rework. The view is taken that planning is concerned with choosing between alternative actions and action sequences, but not with resource allocation. The planning model is based on an explicit representation of the state of the design process, the definition of the design capabilities as a pool of tasks, and on the generation and selection of plans by evaluating their reliability. Classical decision theory is used for evaluating the plans: a state-action net is built and analyzed as a Markov decision process. The model produces plans based on qualified task dependencies. These plans can be used as a basis for manual and automated scheduling. In an example industrial case study, a reduction of over 30% in the expected rework was predicted.</jats:p>",

A structured face-to-face interview protocol was used to gather information about (a) primary purposes for short-term and long-term planning, (b) sources of information the teachers used in their planning, (c) contextual factors influencing planning, and (d) differences in planning for children with disabilities. Descriptive analysis procedures were employed to analyze the data. The teachers engaged in several different levels of both long- and short-term planning. The calendar, the classroom environment, the schedule, and classroom activities appeared to be the primary foci of the teachers' planning decisions across all levels. The teachers primarily used personal files, curriculum books, and other teaching personnel as planning resources for their classrooms. Few differences were reported in the planning process or resources used when planning for children with disabilities. Practice issues emerging from this investigation included individualization, ownership, and cohesive and connected planning systems. </jats:p>",

In this work, a cost-effective and practical solution to the 5-axis sculptured part machining ‚Äì 3-1/2-1/2-axis CNC machining scheme ‚Äì is discussed. An automatic and optimal tool path planning system for 3-1/2-1/2-axis CNC machining is introduced. The system uses fuzzy pattern recognition method and Voronoi diagram to subdivide a complex sculptured surface into an optimal number of uniform surface patches, finds the optimal cutter/part orientation for each surface patch, and plans 3-axis CNC tool paths for them. This type of machining is carried out by rotating the part to the cutter/part orientations discretely and sequentially using a tilt-rotary table attached to the 3-axis CNC machine. Under each orientation, the corresponding surface patch is machined using the 3-axis CNC tool paths. This tool path planning system can automatically generate efficient tool paths for sculptured parts and make the 3-1/2-1/2-axis CNC machining scheme as an applicable alternative of 5-axis CNC machining method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I speak to debates amongst geographers and media scholars about the communities that television constructs in both ‚Äòreal‚Äô and ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô spaces. My point of departure is Morley's work on global television audiences, which, in focusing on the fears of white suburban viewers and the social exclusions they enact, neglects the images and narratives of television itself. The focus is a new North American television genre that addresses fears of urban crime, the ‚Äòreality cop show‚Äô. In examining the genre's codes and practices and the ‚Äòreality‚Äô it creates, I try to specify the representational work which this kind of television performs. Analysis turns to a 1999 episode of Fox TV's America's Most Wanted that featured the mysterious disappearances of thirty-one women, all of whom were/are identified with the sex trade in Vancouver, Canada. As a morality tale of sex crimes and sexual dangers in the city, targeted at white North American suburban viewers, central details of the case were missing, including the fact that most of the disappeared were/are native women. The imposition of a Jack-the-Ripper ‚Äúmedia template‚Äù displaced local and highly politicized explanations related to prostitution laws, community policing practices, and dangerous urban spaces. </jats:p>",

This system allows each department to independently conduct follow-up surveys as needed. The results of the first round of surveys conducted in 1995 show lower malnutrition rates in typical food-deficient departments and high levels of malnutrition in several food-surplus areas. Further analyses underscore the importance of variables related to child-care practices and of care-enabling factors such as household food security, health environment, and caregivers‚Äô time and education. These findings challenge the traditional thinking among a majority of Haitian policy makers who look at the malnutrition problem solely from the perspective of local food production. </jats:p>",

It would be useful to know the overall, or ‚Äòtotal‚Äô antioxidant capacity of foods, to establish the contribution of AA to this, and to assess how this information may translate into dietary intakes to meet the new US daily reference intake for AA. In this study, the total antioxidant capacity, as the ferric reducing‚Äìantioxidant power (FRAP) value, and AA content of thirty-four types of fruits and vegetables were measured using a modified version of the FRAP assay, known as FRASC. This measures AA (reduced form only) simultaneously with the FRAP value. Results covered a wide range: 880‚Äì15 940 Œºmol/kg fresh wet weight and &lt;20‚Äì540 mg/kg fresh wet weight respectively, for FRAP and AA, which comprised &lt;1‚Äì73 % and &lt;1‚Äì59 % total antioxidant capacity of fruits and vegetables respectively. We estimate that 100 mg AA is contained in one orange, a few strawberries, one kiwi fruit, 1‚Äì2 slices of pineapple, several florets of raw cauliflower or a handful of uncooked spinach leaves. Apples, bananas, pears and plums, the most commonly consumed fruits in the UK, contain very little AA. Results indicate also that the antioxidant capacity of vegetables decreases rapidly and significantly after fragmentation. Results of this, and future studies, using FRASC as a biomonitoring tool will be useful in food production, preparation, preservation, and aid dietary choices to increase antioxidant and AA intake. Furthermore, FRASC will facilitate bioavailability studies of antioxidants from different foods of known antioxidant capacity and AA content.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment planning is a critical aspect of clinical education in the dental school curriculum. It is surprising, therefore, that so little attention has been given to this subject in the dental literature. The importance of treatment planning is reinforced in the standards and the tests that clearly present methods and necessity for treatment planning. However, there is minimal evidence about how these treatment planning courses have been evaluated, how they were incorporated into the curriculum, or how they have been integrated into treatment planning in the academic clinical setting. The purpose of this study was to survey and profile current treatment planning processes in U.S. dental schools. A questionnaire consisting of twenty‚Äênine items relating to treatment plan preparation, process, and outcomes was mailed to fifty‚Äêfour U.S. dental schools. The primary topics included patient assignments, treatment planning, plan sequencing, plan presentation, informed consent, and plan modifications. Forty‚Äêseven of the fifty‚Äêfour U.S. dental schools (87 percent) completed and returned the surveys. Profiling the treatment planning process in dental schools reveals many similarities. Typically, the schools screen patients prior to assignment to students and expect the student diagnostician to complete the planning process as well as comprehensive care. The patient's welfare is the primary determinant of the content of the plan in 92 percent of U.S. dental schools. Secondly, though current accreditation standards are concentrated on competencies, the treatment plans are influenced by quantitative requirements. Third, the plan is usually completed during the second patient visit after screening. Fourth, the approaches vary among the schools when a multidisciplinary or complex treatment plan is appropriate. Some depend on a panel of experts, whereas others do not have interactive planning with specialists. A significant number of schools decentralize treatment planning and delegate part of the plan to disciplines or group practice leaders. Fifth, the treatment plans and treatment risks are presented in accordance with the intent of the accreditation guidelines; however, fewer than half the schools explain the risk of procedures to patients at the time of plan presentation. Finally, plans change frequently, but the modifications are generally considered to be minor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many existing methods for transit assignment and path finding do not support schedule coordination in network search or optimization processes. Other methods do not provide adequate performance that meets the demands for Internet trip-planning applications. Two schedule-based path-finding algorithms (forward search and backward search) are presented for the transit network, in which schedule coordination is an inherent feature. The forward-search algorithm finds the optimal path from an origin to a destination with a planned departure time, and the backward-search algorithm finds the optimal path for an expected arrival time at the destination. In addition, a non-schedule-based minimal-transfer-path algorithm for the transit network is also developed, which is capable of accommodating more path optimization criteria for sophisticated path finding. Facilitated by a uniquely designed network structure based on a geographic information system and an objectoriented data model, these algorithms demonstrated good performance in path finding on a dynamic transit network. These algorithms have been implemented in an Internet transit trip-planning system in the city of Waukesha, Wisconsin. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The practice of transportation planning at the regional level has evolved substantially over the past several decades. Once defined as largely a technical exercise, in which the calculation of required roadway capacity was the preeminent activity, transportation planning now encompasses a wide range of sometimes conflicting problems and demands, from growing levels of congestion and worsening air quality to neighborhood preservation and social equity concerns. But are the curricula in the planning and engineering programs that educate and train transportation professionals adequately preparing them for these new challenges? The objective of the study summarized was to compare the kinds of knowledge and skills important to transportation professionals today with the kinds of knowledge and skills that planning and engineering programs provide their students in order to highlight areas for improvement and suggest ways to enhance the education of transportation professionals. The research involved several components: a literature review of transportation education and planning education, an analysis of planning requirements in federal transportation authorization legislation, construction and analysis of a database of course offerings in the area of transportation planning provided by planning programs and selected transportation engineering programs, a survey of transportation planning professionals, and interviews with selected transportation planning educators and professionals. Some of the key findings from those efforts are summarized, and several important issues are suggested that transportation educators should address to improve the quality of education for transportation planning professionals. </jats:p>",

The model was created based on observation and interviews ranging from top executives to design team members from all major disciplines at a large automobile company. By mapping an approach to part differentiation based on part complexity and lifestyle (i.e., value) impact onto the decision making model, those decisions most critical to different aspects of the product are identified and more heavily emphasized. Many companies tend to drive the entire process based on cost and technology objectives as a means to maximize profit, rather than by understanding the true impact of customer response to the product as well. In bringing Design strategy decisions into the earliest phases, companies set a strategy that fulfills customer expectations while reducing conflict, delays, added costs, and improving quality. The model helps companies recognize how to structure decisions and allocate resources to appropriately balance costs and customer‚Äôs emotional response.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Efficiency is essential to Internet transit trip-planning systems. High-quality data models of transit networks hold the key to efficiency of data querying and network analysis. Because of the schedule control and dynamic nature of the transit network, highway-based generic network models cannot be directly implemented by transit systems. In the process of developing an Internet transit trip-planning system, an object-oriented geographic information system data model, which handles the dynamic nature of transit systems, was developed. In this data model, the entire transit network and its components are modeled as space‚Äìtime entities (objects) that have start times, end times, and spans of lifetime. A time map object controls the creation and destruction of these objects. Therefore, in the process of network search, only active components of the system (i.e., with transit services available) are built into the network topology. This has greatly reduced data redundancy and enhanced network search efficiency. The data model showed good performance when it was implemented in an online trip-planning service for Waukesha Metro Transit, Wisconsin. </jats:p>",

The website, www.njchoices.com, was launched in April 2000 as a cornerstone of the public involvement program for the current plan update. This initiative allowed NJDOT to explore the use of Internet technology for dialogue concerning long-range investment priorities. In addition, NJDOT gained a better understanding of the technical and administrative requirements of maintaining an interactive site. Along with information on the planning process and statewide transportation issues, the website included mechanisms through which users could voice their concerns. Innovative features included a transportation budget game, an interactive demographic map, and an animated tutorial on the sources of traffic growth. These features received more use than an online survey on transportation priorities or a virtual suggestion box for user comments. Between April 2000 and July 2001, the website recorded 9,209 user sessions, reaching a broader audience than traditional outreach methods for statewide planning. Usage was shown to be strongly associated with publicity for the site. Other findings concern ways to integrate web-based and traditional outreach methods, the importance of user testing of site content, and the need to establish an organizational framework for institutionalization of the website. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the present work, the interaction of calcium‚Äêphosphate with DPPC (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) model membranes has been studied in the presence and absence of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> by using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Calcium and phosphorus are the most abundant elements in the body. They combine in the form of calcium phosphate salt, called hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite is the major structural component of the bone. Calcium phosphate assists with the digestion and absorption of food and is vitally important for the building of sturdy bone and body structures and a robust constitution. Phosphorus is extracted from foods and its use is controlled by vitamin D and calcium. FTIR spectral analysis results suggested that, calcium‚Äìphosphate complex, which is the major component of the bones, decreases the phase transition temperature to lower values, causes a loss in cooperativity of the acyl chains, decreases the order of the membrane in both phases and decreases the dynamics of the membrane in the liquid crystalline phase, increases the flexibility of the chains in the center of the bilayer in both phases, and increases the mobility of the head group of DPPC in the gel phase. The effect of calcium‚Äêphosphate on DPPC liposomes diminishes with the addition of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> into the liposomes. Our results suggest how calcium‚Äêphosphate and/or vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, which have indispensable role for the functioning of the bone tissue, affect the thermal behaviour of DPPC liposomes at molecular level.</jats:p>",

Immersive 3D VR overcomes many of the conceptual limitations encountered when conveying or teaching 3D relationships via 2D images traditionally produced by these scans. Over the past year we have made advancements in several areas. First, we have improved the quality of our datasets by utilizing higher resolution multi-detector scans and altering the protocols used. Second, we now register multiple isosurface views with standard axial views and volume textured views to provide additional information and perspective. Third, we now routinely use auto-segmentation techniques to visualize individual structures.</jats:p>"

We show that the structure of network relationships is still largely determined by traditional forms of the organization of production, despite convergent developments. The network relationships of SMEs in Japan are thus very largely determined by a hierarchically organized system of production. By contrast, the German SMEs almost always have far more scope for strategic action than their Japanese counterparts because they are less dependent on large companies and have their own distinctive images in the final markets. In both countries, cooperative network relationships are on the increase. However, reregionalization as postulated in the flexible specialization hypothesis does not appear to be a dominant trend in either Japan or Germany. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract:</jats:bold> International conservation planning at the end of the twentieth century is dominated by coarse‚Äêfilter, supra‚Äêorganismal approaches to conservation that may be insufficient to conserve certain species such as the jaguar (‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ<jats:italic>Panthera onca</jats:italic>). If we are to retain broadly distributed species into the next century, we need to plan explicitly for their survival across their entire geographic range and through political boundaries while recognizing the variety of ecological roles the species plays in different habitats. In March 1999 the Wildlife Conservation Society sponsored a priority‚Äêsetting and planning exercise for the jaguar across its range, from northern Mexico to northern Argentina. Field scientists from 18 countries reached consensus on four types of information: (1) the spatial extent of their jaguar knowledge, (2) the known, currently occupied range of jaguars, (3) areas with substantial jaguar populations, adequate habitat, and a stable and diverse prey base, and (4) point localities where jaguars have been observed during the last 10 years. During the exercise, these experts also conducted a range‚Äêwide assessment of the long‚Äêterm survival prospects of the jaguar and developed an algorithm for prioritizing jaguar conservation units occurring in major habitat types. From this work, we learned that the known, occupied range of the jaguar has contracted to approximately 46% of estimates of its 1900 range. Jaguar status and distribution is unknown in another 12% of the jaguar's former range, including large areas in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. But over 70% of the area where jaguars are thought to still occur was rated as having a high probability of supporting their long‚Äêterm survival. Fifty‚Äêone jaguar conservation units representing 30 different jaguar geographic regions were prioritized as the basis for a comprehensive jaguar conservation program.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A remaining management system requirement is for major metropolitan areas to develop congestion management systems (CMS). These systems must identify and evaluate congestion and select mitigation strategies on the basis of systemwide analysis. In addition, congestion relief strategies must be selected that emphasize operational and demand management strategies in favor of, or in coordination with, new highway capacity. The CMS provides a level of analysis on a regional scale, but it can also guide additional studies that may be required at the subarea, corridor, or project level. This provides an important link between regional and subregional planning efforts and ensures that the policies to guide strategy selection are maintained throughout the process. In addition, a well-designed CMS can eliminate duplication of effort and support later major investment study or National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 planning work to streamline the planning effort. The CMS is an integrated part of the metropolitan planning process, but congestion mitigation must be considered in a larger context and with consideration given to other planning factors. WILMAPCO developed a four-step CMS process that included system identification, congestion identification, strategy evaluation, and system monitoring. The CMS was also developed through a strong interagency effort, including the input of planning and project development staff at member implementing agencies, who have the responsibility to use the CMS products to guide further planning and project development efforts. Although additional work is required, the WILMAPCO CMS will support planning work and influence policy debate regarding transportation investment priorities and regional quality-of-life goals. </jats:p>",

The femoral articular surfaces were represented by generalized, sagittally elliptical, toroidal surfaces. The medial and lateral tibial articular surfaces were represented by a dished spherical surface and the lower hemihyperbolic region of a torus respectively. Anatomical articular cartilage, knee ligaments and the posterior capsule were represented by spring-like deformable elements with non-linear load versus deflection characteristics. All the forces that act on the femur relative to the tibia were represented by three orthogonal forces and three associated moments. Spatial, articulation-dependent femoro-tibial kinematic constraint equations of the passive knee were formulated in an analytically explicit manner, based on the natural coordinates of the articular surfaces. The constraint equations were solved algebraically in closed form. Equations were derived that describe spatial femoro-tibial motion, ligament length, ligament strain, ligament-based elastic potential energy and the quasi-static equilibrium of the passive knee. Software was written, simulations on the motion characteristics and load versus deflection characteristics of the knee were carried out and graphical results were presented. The simulation of planar flexion/extension was almost spontaneous. The time taken to simulate spatial six-degree-of-freedom femoro-tibial motion was less than 2.5 min. The models were found to be capable of representing real-life passive knees to a high degree of satisfaction. It has been demonstrated that the models can provide knee surgeons with additional information on major aspects of the preoperative planning of knee surgery. The models can be used to enhance the preoperative planning of ligament reconstruction, articular surfaces related surgery, osteotomy and patellar tendon transfer surgery. </jats:p>",

In general, the analysis showed that the plan would not cause inequitable distributions of benefits or burdens for minority or low-income residents of the region.

In this system, radical polymerization in the presence of AIBN was carried out. Product formed at the particle surface was either physically bound by entanglement or chemically bound by covalent bonding to the silane. In this way, core‚Äìshell morphology was obtained with an inorganic core and a polymer shell. The results showed that bonding at the surface of bentonite took place by hydrolytic cleavage of methoxy groups of A‚Äê174 with hydroxy groups of bentonite. ¬© 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Improvisations in any phase of the works, as illustrated by the example presented in this paper, create a wrong idea on the forest state, which further results in unreal and inadequate forest management plans. In all situations in which the data in plan documents do not agree with the real forest state, disregarding the increased financial expenditures, the works on forest management should be revised and plan documents should be made. In this way, we eliminate the potential consequences which would result from the realisation of the planed works based on unreal forest state, which would be reflected both in the economic and in the ecological senses, without the possibility to remove the consequences in a short time period.</jats:p>"

Two thousand and seventy one (2071) intervention patients and 1317 control patients were eligible for the study. Data were collected from all sources recording the delivery of medical services, and the percentage of intervention and control patients receiving the service was compared. Two planned services - lipids tests and bowel cancer screening - were used in the analyses. A higher percentage of intervention patients than control patients received the lipid test and the bowel cancer screening test. Care planning has proved a useful means of increasing the delivery of at least two best practice services to a needy group of people with chronic illnesses.</jats:p>"

The plan sets forth strategies, provides a framework for directing investment, and identifies financial resources needed to sustain the plan‚Äôs vision. Setting the direction of a long-range transportation program revolves around forecasting future transportation conditions and managing investments to address future needs. An analysis tool was needed to help assess the impact of growth on the statewide transportation system and predict system performance based on multimodal strategic investments. The development and use of an analysis tool based on a travel demand model to assess congestion and mobility issues in 2025 are described. The analysis tool linked the state‚Äôs three metropolitan planning organization (MPO) regional travel demand models to perform a statewide assessment. Although the models were run independently, methods were developed to provide a common basis for forecasting future travel conditions. The models used MPO-generated trend-based growth in population and employment through 2025. Multimodal transportation supply and demand strategies, including transit improvements, capacity improvements, transportation demand management strategies, and intelligent transportation systems-transportation system management strategies, were simulated and tested to assess what types and combinations of improvements would be needed to relieve congestion and improve mobility. The tool proved very helpful in defining transportation needs and providing input to a financial assessment. The testing indicated that no single strategy is likely to improve future travel conditions, but a combination of multimodal strategies offers significant improvements over congestion levels predicted for 2025 if no improvements are made. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent economic expansion and population growth in developing countries have had a big impact on the development of large cities like Delhi, India. Accompanied by Delhi‚Äôs rapid spatial growth over the last 25 years, urban sprawl has contributed to increased travel. The vehicle fleet projected at current growth rates will result in more than 13 million vehicles in Delhi in 2020. Planning and managing such a rapidly growing transport sector will be a challenge. Choices made now will have effects lasting well into the middle of the century. With such rapid transport growth rates, automobile emissions have become the fastest increasing source of urban air pollution. In India, most urban areas, including Delhi, already have major air pollution problems that could be greatly exacerbated if growth of the transport sector is managed unwisely. The transport plans designed to meet such large increases in travel demand will have to emphasize the movement of people, not vehicles, for a sustainable transportation system. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the optimal transportation mix to meet this projected passenger-km demand while satisfying environmental goals, reducing congestion levels, and improving system and fuel efficiencies by exploiting a variety of policy options at the minimum overall cost or maximum welfare from transport. The results suggest that buses will continue to satisfy most passenger transport in the coming decades, so planning done in accordance with improving bus operations is crucial. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A planning-level adaptation was developed of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 procedure for estimating the level of service (LOS) on two-lane and multilane highways in Florida. The problems associated with planning-level adaptations in general and with uninterruptedflow highways in particular were identified. Although much of the adaptation was achieved though the use of default values for data items, some departures from the HCM procedures were required. The most significant deviation was the creation of a third class of two-lane highway to supplement the two classes currently defined in the HCM. A case was made for the existence of this class and its inclusion in a future edition of the HCM. The Florida Department of Transportation‚Äôs planning-level methodology, termed HIGHPLAN, is well suited to its intended application, which is planning-level analysis of two-lane and multilane highways in Florida. It maintains fidelity to the HCM procedures to the extent that Florida conditions will allow and Florida users will accept. As long as they are understood, the departures from the HCM should not pose significant problems for users outside of Florida. The planning-level methodology has also been implemented in a software program that produces LOS estimates and service volume tables covering sitespecific conditions. </jats:p>",

Vaginal specimens were collected to determine the distribution of <jats:italic>U. urealyticum</jats:italic> biovars and to estimate their possible association with age, absence of lactobacilli, and tetracycline resistance. Of the 94 women studied, 40 (43%) carried <jats:italic>U. urealyticum</jats:italic> and were biotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty‚Äênine (73%) strains presented with parvo biovar, 10 (25%) with T960 biovar, and one (2.5%) with both biovars. Parvo biovar was predominant in all age groups and appears to be more frequent in women 20‚Äì25 years of age (41%), whereas T960 was common in women 30‚Äì35 years of age (22%). In this study, <jats:italic>U. urealyticum</jats:italic> was not associated with changes in vaginal flora, although the inverse apparently was true for <jats:italic>Mycoplasma hominis</jats:italic>. However, T960 biovar was more associated with the loss of lactobacilli than was parvo biovar. The number of T960 biovar strains that presented tetracycline (40%) or multiple (100%) resistance was higher than that of parvo biovar strains (27% and 69%, respectively). J. Clin. Lab.
