The approach also allows the identification of the “least representative day” (the daily series that maximises the mean sum of squared residuals).The purpose of such typifying is that of outlining characteristic scenarios for a given period under investigation and than mathematical models make it possible to attempt simulations of a typical period trend, without the need to simulate all the days of the time interval covered by the typical period.</jats:p>"

The following scenarios were discussed: (i) the deep ecology scenario, (ii) the strong sustainable development scenario, (iii) the weak sustainable development scenario, (iv) the boomsday scenario, (v) the doomsday scenario and (vi) the World Bank ‘policy tunnel’ scenario. In this article a plausible, seventh social development scenario is presented: ‘social and ecological destruction in the first class’. The basic idea of this scenario is presented in this paper. The author argues that this scenario should also be taken into consideration in the strategic discussion of potential sustainable development paths.

The study was conducted using the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS). The IDS was equipped with an FCW system that provided auditory warnings based on two warning criteria. A total of 30 subjects were split across three conditions—a baseline of 10 subjects (no warning display), and two warning conditions (early and late) with 10 subjects each. The two warning conditions differed by the duration of an a priori driver reaction component (1.5 and 1.0 s) in the warning algorithm. Drivers’ collision avoidance performance in the two warning conditions was compared with that in the baseline condition. Results indicated that the early warning condition showed significantly shorter accelerator release reaction times, fewer crashes, and less severe crashes than both the baseline condition and the late warning condition. The results indicate that the timing of a warning is important in the design of collision warning systems. </jats:p>",

It was found out from the analyzed data, that the total energy utilized has increased from 15.801 MJha' in 1989-90 to 18,964 MJ ha in 1997-98 and the productivity has increased from 3,060 kg ha in 1989-90 to 4,442 kg ha in 1997-98. Quadratic model was fitted to understand the spatial variation in total energy consumption and yield. It was found out that the productivity level was proportionately reducing beyond certain level of energy utilization.</jats:p>"
