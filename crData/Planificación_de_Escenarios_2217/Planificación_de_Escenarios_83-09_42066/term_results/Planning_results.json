The needs assessment strategy is a technique that can be used to identify training needs, match these needs to organizational goals and resources, and allow for employee participation. Several assessment methods are discussed and a report format is suggested. A report of assessed needs, subsequent training, and positive outcomes resulting from training could be included in the departmental quality assurance report, as well as in the yearly managerial plan. Since using this strategy, the author’s department has been granted a substantial increase in monies for education and training.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the conception of equilibrium maintained by Tiebout cannot be sustained within the workings of reasonable adjustment mechanisms. A contextual argument is advanced to demonstrate the link between individual choice and the context of mobility, The implications of the Tiebout model and the proposed contextual theory of choice and mobility are both explored with respect to the equality of outcomes and public policy. </jats:p>",

Borts's criteria, however, presuppose the existence of an immobile labor force as an idle resource in a specific region, and this assumption makes the criteria practically inapplicable to the situation of present-day Japan, where the interregional mobility of the labor force is extremely high. The only way to justify the meaningfulness of regional development policies which use subsidy in Japan is to take the nationwide dispersion of population as a supreme social-policy objective and to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative economic policies instead of using the cost — benefit approach of Borts's criteria. In the present paper, different intervention policies to attain a desired distribution of population between two regions are compared from the point of view of social cost as well as from that of the amount of subsidy (or tax) needed. </jats:p>",

Crises of spatial coordination and the allocation of labor demand and supply, amongst other issues, are argued to result from such uncertainties. Assisted-mobility and spatial job-matching programs have been promoted as solutions to problems of inadequate information. These programs, however, ignore the fact that uncertainty is part of any rule-oriented exchange process. These programs also neglect the power relations between employers and employees which structure and sustain labor-market transaction costs. The crucial issue is the distribution of transaction costs between contracting parties. These principles are applied to a recent legal case in Michigan involving interregional labor migration. </jats:p>",

An alternative theory is proposed, and interpreted, not as a single cause of uneven development, but as a contributory factor. It is more accurate to record unequal exchange as a process which keeps the rate of profit high in developed sectors of production than as a geographical transfer of value which speeds the rate of accumulation in certain areas. Empirical evidence, obtained by calculating labour values in different countries from input-output data, shows that unequal exchange is an extremely important process in terms of its magnitude. The evidence also suggests that the deviation of observed prices from prices of production may be a more important component of unequal exchange than the deviation of prices of production from values. </jats:p>",

It is suggested that the economic problems being experienced by many older industrial areas can give rise to regional coalitions that seek to transcend class antagonisms in order to press for state investment to improve regional growth and employment prospects. But it is further argued that, because of the heterogeneity of the sociospatial base in such regions, supralocal coalitions will be vulnerable to the effects of allocative decisions favouring particular within-region locations. The notion of the vulnerability of regional social bases to the expression of local class interests is explored in the context of industrial South Wales. This region has been subject to successive attempts at economic revival, often in response to an apparently coherent regional voice pressing for state regional interventions. Important parts of various policies for restructuring the regional economy have been defeated in the past, precisely because of the impotence of regional coalitions to carry disadvantaged local class groupings along with them. On occasions, such local class groupings have been capable of mobilising popular support, indicating more the defensive than offensive nature of their power. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Among the most important changes in federal domestic programs in the United States of America under the first two years of the Reagan Administration has been a reduction in federal regulation of state and local governments. Three strategies of deregulation have been utilized by the Administration: (1) removal of the federal government's possibilities for regulatory involvement by cutting social programs and by devolving program responsibilities to the states; (2) reduction of federal regulations under existing statutes; and (3) relaxation in the enforcement of existing regulations. The study illustrates the three deregulatory strategies by examining their application to the civil-rights and environmental policy arenas. The conclusion presented is that the strategies have so far been successful in reducing regulatory activity in the environmental and civil-rights arenas; however, environmental and civil-rights advocates are mounting a counterattack by turning to Congress and the courts to prevent devolution and other deregulatory actions that weaken enforcement of national laws. </jats:p>",

The essence of his message is that energy planning does not take place in a social or political vacuum. In effect, if as a planner you value collective self-reliance and democratic control by people over their affairs and equity, you must not let yourself make energy prescriptions based only on economic (cost/benefit) and engineering analyses. Also, even as a \"well-trained \" energy planner, you still know less than you think about what any specific rural community needs in the way of energy investment. But your technical expertise, along with the community's sometimes unarticulated understanding of its real needs, may together ameliorate their energy problem in a progressive way. </jats:p><jats:p> The article is concerned first with energy planning in the Third World and second with the types and means of international support for appropriate, non-imperialist, transfer of energy technology.

Although implementing Ganapathy's program under current conditions may seem utopian, the issues raised here are nevertheless the ones raised in continuing discussions of the formation of official policies for rural development in a number of countries which profess to be following socialist paths to development. </jats:p>",

Increasing sample size and combining predictors in order to yield a useful effect size are well‐known tactics for increasing power. A third approach, increasing alpha, is rarely used because of zealous adherence to convention. There are two related aspects in setting the alpha level. First, the relative seriousness of Type I and Type II errors must be considered. This assessment must then be qualified and redetermined after taking into account the prior probability that an effect exists. Procedures that make these processes objective are demonstrated. When sample size and effect size are both fixed, increasing alpha may be the only feasible strategy for maximizing power.

In some large metropolitan areas the entire area is losing population, and employment is either growing very slowly or declining. In the United States of America and the United Kingdom these trends have triggered a substantial amount of public concern and debate and a variety of policies designed to focus on the problems of large urban economies. In most European countries, however, metropolitan population and employment stabilization or decline are either not perceived as problems or are just beginning to be seen as such. Indeed, in many of these countries the decentralization of population and employment from large urban areas is seen as consistent with the long-term objectives of regional policy. </jats:p><jats:p> This article first summarizes urban-area population and employment trends in the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Federal Republic of Germany. It then examines the way in which these trends are perceived in each of these countries and, in particular, whether they are thought to represent a ‘problem’. Finally, it sets forth and analyzes the public policies adopted by the national governments to address these problems, to the extent they are perceived to exist. </jats:p>",

The first saw series of protests by agricultural labourers in 1816, 1822, and 1830. The second saw a major scries of collective protests by small farmers, primarily over the issue of turnpike tolls, between 1842 and 1844, Of these four series, only the 1830 labourers' revolt showed clear spatial patterns of diffusion. Accounts of the resistance to the coup d'etat in France of 1851 give a further comparative perspective. As in France in 1851, for a massive mobilisation to occur in Britain in 1830, in a relatively short time span, there needed to be a major political crisis. The complex nature of the analysis offered here to account for the different patterns of spatial diffusion of the four series of protests should be a salutory warning against the glib explanations of the spread of the 1981 urban disorders in Britain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the dynamics of the dismantling of a large US federal grant-in-aid program, the Public Service Employment Program (PSEP), to determine whether the same factors that affect program expansion affect program contraction, and in a similar manner. Specifically, an examination is made of: (1) the impact local fiscal and political pressures have on the reactions of three groups of local policymakers (elected officials; PSEP administrators; administrators of agencies employing PSEP workers); and (2) the relationship between these policymakers' reactions and changes in PSEP objectives. The units of analysis are forty-two local governments located across the USA (a representative sample). The time frame of the analysis is December 1979–December 1980—a period of rapid phaseout in the PSEP. The results show that the same factors which dictate the actions of different sets of policymakers during program expansion also determine their relative levels of involvement in the phaseout period and their policy preferences (PSEP objectives) during retrenchment. The findings also suggest that local governments with long histories of federal program participation have developed fairly sophisticated reactive strategies, since phaseouts are expected events in the lives of most federal programs. These reactive strategies vary according to the economic and political conditions existing at the time of the mandated phaseout. </jats:p>",

The case study is based on the Conservative Government's attempt to restructure the property market in Britain between 1970 and 1974. The paper argues that policy was initiated in ignorance of the environment in which it was to be implemented and created the conditions for an unintended boom in property prices. This unintended consequence forced the Government to react, but, it is argued, in so doing, it once again failed to appreciate how its policy ‘U’-turn would cause a crisis for the financial sector. Ultimately the Government was constrained by this problem and forced to change its policy for a third time. The conclusion which is drawn from this is that in a largely privately owned market economy there are limits beyond which governments cannot go in policy initiation without incurring unacceptable economic or political costs. </jats:p>",
