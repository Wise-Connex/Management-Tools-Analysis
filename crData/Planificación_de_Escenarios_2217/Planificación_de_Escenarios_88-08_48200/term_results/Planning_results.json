Many applications were simply the conversion of an existing process to a computerized process. The manufacturing database required for the successful application of computer-aided process planning (CAPP) to the shipyard environment requires a \"back-to-basics\" approach, one that can lead to control of the processes occurring in the fabrication and assembly shops of a shipyard. The manufacturing database will not provide management feedback designed for the financial segment of the shipyard (although it can be converted to be fully applicable): it provides \"real-time\" manufacturing data that the shop floor manager can utilize in his day-to-day decisions, not historical data on how his shop did last week or last month. The computer is only a tool to be used to organize the mountains of manufacturing data into useful information for today's shop manager on a \"real time\" basis. The use of group technology to collect similar products, the use of parameters to clearly identify work content, the use of real-time efficiency rates to project capacity and realistic schedules, and the use of bar codes to input \"real time\" data are all tools that are part of the process—tools for the shop floor manager of tomorrow.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many sophisticated and expensive imaging devices are in common use for the planning of radiotherapy treatment. At the same time wide use is made of routine radiographs, for which much scope remains for the development of image-enhancement techniques. One approach recently reported by McFaul et al (1987) is the use of scanning equalization radiography to balance the exposures of different areas of the X-ray field. However, it will be some time before techniques of this type come into widespread use.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reports a much simpler but potentially very useful approach to exposure balancing applied to radiographs of the head, neck and shoulder region. Often in the planning of radiotherapy treatment for sites such as nasopharynx, trachea, thyroid or cricoid it is necessary for fields to be specified running from the neck through to the shoulder level or lower. However, the lateral radiographs of this area will contain a wide density variation because of the large changes in lateral separation from the neck through to the shoulders. The simple technique described in this report permits important structures such as cord to be visualized clearly on one film even when large changes in separation are present.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1 shows typical head and neck radiographs taken of the Rando radiotherapy phantom using Agfa-Gevaert film and a Curix MR400 cassette (Agfa-Gevaert pic). The exposures were chosen to optimize the definition either of the facial region (a) or of the shoulder region (b). Good definition of one region results in bad definition in the other.</jats:p>",

In Singapore, the bus services have changed from a disjointed system involving eleven companies to a unified operation, but this modernisation did not occur smoothly, nor did it follow inevitably from changes in demand, land use, or technology. Instead, there were several countervailing factors which included a lack of resources, both by operators and by government, the depredations of pirate taxis, and, for much of the period under discussion, a lack of political commitment to public transport. This last factor appeared only after the government had consolidated power, and opposition from interested parties had been disarmed. The complexity of the modernisation and incorporation process is highlighted. </jats:p>",
