The problem is solved here following two basic steps: i) planning input-output curves based on design requirements (input-output pairs, mobility, time ratio, etc.) and selecting data from the planned curve; and ii) setting up an optimization procedure to minimize a performance index (design error or structural error). Discussed in Part I is the first step of the optimization scheme, i.e., design-data preparation based on input-output curve planning, while, in Part II, the ensuing formulation and design strategies.</jats:p>",

In order to plan the entire welding process in the design stage, mathematical modeling of the planning procedure has become very important. Both the geometric and non-geometric representations, such as the geometric description of workpieces, fixtures, and end-effectors and the planning of the welding process, are the key elements to success. Emphasis in this paper is fixture planning, in which an automated fixturing approach is examined to greatly increase workcell flexibility. A feature-based modeling approach is proposed to simulate the fixturing process in an automated welding cell.</jats:p>",

Dabei war das institutionelle Verständnis der Raumplanungsaufgabe vorwiegend als fachplanerische Disziplin interpretiert worden, die temporär von den unterschiedlichen Politikbereichen wahrgenommen werden sollte. Die vorhandenen Organisationsstrukturen sahen dabei kaum planerische Teilräume vor.Erst im Rahmen der umfassenden Funktionalreform, die im Zeitraum 1972 bis 1977 realisiert wurde, erhielten die „Regioni“ in ihrer Ausstattung als konstitutionelle Gebietskörperschaften neben anderen auch die Kompetenz für die „Urbanistica“ zugesprochen und somit die Möglichkeit, organisatorisch und legislativ eine eigene Raumplanung aufzubauen. Mit den staatlichen Aufgabenträgern, die bis dato mehr als Bau- denn als Raumordnungsträger gewirkt hatten, gerieten die neuen Planer bald in Konkurrenzsituationen, in denen sich Konfliktpotentiale entwickelten. Die einsetzende Phase der Klärung von Zuständigkeitsfragen ist bislang noch nicht abgeschlossen und prägt, bei anhaltender Dualität der Interessenlagen, das Bild der raumplanerischen Umfeldbedingungen.</jats:p>"

Zu einem besseren Verständnis dieser Prozesse werden deshalb im ersten Abschnitt knapp die derzeitige Umweltsituation sowie im zweiten Teil einige Aspekte zur Regionalentwicklung in den neuen Ländern skizziert. Anschließend werden im dritten Teil einige Gedanken zum Einfluß derUmweltsituation auf eine mögliche Regionalentwicklung vorgestellt, um dann im vierten Teil umgekehrt die Konsequenzen der Regionalentwicklung für die Umweltsituation zu hinterfragen.

Eine auf dieser Methode basierende Untersuchung der Auswirkungen des Binnenmarktes bis zum Jahr 2000 kommt zu dem Ergebnis, daß mit einer unerwünschten regionalen Verteilungswirkung zu rechnen ist. Das Ausmaß, in dem die relativ finanzschwachen Gebietskörperschaften benachteiligt werden, ist zwar im Durchschnitt nicht so groß, daß dringender finanzpolitischer Handlungsbedarf besteht, aber für ein verstärktes, eventuell sogar präventives regionalpolitisches Engagement kann die Berücksichtigung der Binnenmarkteffekte eine sinnvolle Orientierung geben.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die Planungsmethode, die in diesem Beitrag angewandt auf erstmalige regionale Entwicklungsplanung für einen (Land‑)Kreis Chinas erläutert wird, hat ihren Ursprung hei der U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) – die im Bundesauftrag Entwicklungsprojekte durch Expertenentsendung ausführt – übernahm diesen Ansatz in den frühen 80er Jahren, um ihn unter der neuen Bezeichnung „Zielorientierte Projektplanung“, kurz ZOPP, methodisch weiter auszuarbeiten und bald allen ihren Entwicklungsprojekten als verbindliches Management-Muster aufzuerlegen. Das Wesen dieses Verfahrens liegt in einer ausgeprägten Partizipation derer, die die Nutznießer basisorientierter Entwicklungsprojekte sein sollen, der Zielbevölkerung und Zielgruppen, und in der Förderung der Effektivität der Projekte. Es kehrte in den letzten Jahren in einer „Logical Framework Matrix“ in die Projektzyklen mehrerer internationaler Entwicklungsorganisationen zurück.Regionale Entwicklungsplanung stellt eine andere Gesamtaufgabe als Projektplanung und -durchführung. Die regionale Perspektive übergreift grundsätzlich alle Wirtschaftssektoren und Verwaltungsteilgebiete einer Planungsregion, während sie Projekte und Programme in Abstimmung mit Fachplanung nur insoweit aufbereiten läßt, als Implementation kurzfristig unter den lokalen Verhältnissen im Entwicklungsland erforderlich und auch wahrscheinlich ist. In der regional breiten Perspektive mag ein Grund liegen, weshalb ZOPP bisher noch nicht unter regionaler Entwicklungsplanung angewandt worden ist. In diesem Rahmen erscheint eine ausgeprägt partizipative Routine jedoch ebenfalls angeraten, desto mehr, wenn westliche Planungsberatung von einer chinesischen Administration gewünscht ist. Es gilt dann, der Ideologie der sozialistischen „Massenlinie“ ein Verfahren mit substantiellem partizipativem Gehalt gegenüberzustellen.Dieser Beitrag befaßt sich nicht mit der übergeordneten Planungsaufgabe (die im Auftrag der Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung erfüllt wurde), sondern mit der Frage, wie ZOPP darunter praktisch nutzbar gemacht werden konnte. Das Verfahren mußte gegenüber seinem Entwicklungsstand bei der GTZ beschnitten werden, dafür aber in seinem ursprünglichen Kern, den partizipativen Workshops, vertieft und über die Breite der regionalen Perspektive gezogen werden. Eine Grundbedingung für Erfolg war sicheres Vertrauen der chinesischen Partner.</jats:p>"

Seit Anfang der 70er Jahre nehmen die Schlüsselzahlen der Mehrzahl der großen Städte, d.h. ihre Anteile am Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommensteuer, ab. In der politischen Diskussion werden die Anteilsverluste der Städte immer wieder mit Stadtflucht und Stadt-Umland-Wanderung in Zusammenhang gebracht. Die Schlüsselzahlen werden jedoch von einer ganzen Reihe von Faktoren beeinflußt.In diesem Beitrag wird der Versuch unternommen, für einen Zeitraum von sechs Jahren den Einfluß der wichtigsten Faktoren zu quantifizieren. Dabei ergibt sich, daß der Einfluß der Wanderung auf die Entwicklung der Schlüsselzahlen in diesem Zeitraum nicht nennenswert war. Entscheidend für die Entwicklung der Anteile der Städte und Gemeinden am Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommensteuer waren vor allem die Entwicklung des Anteils der Erwerbstätigen an der Wohnbevölkerung, also der Erwerbsquote, die Entwicklung des Einkommensniveaus und der Einkommensverteilung, insbesondere aber die Höhe der festgelegten Sockelbeträge.</jats:p>"

The presence of nonholonomic constraints makes the path-planning schemes, commonly used for fixed-base manipulators, unsuitable for free-floating manipulators. In this paper, we first apply inverse position and inverse rate kinematics path-planning schemes to a free-floating closed-chain planar manipulator and show that these schemes have shortcomings. Then, a working path-planning scheme is described which is based on careful study of the rate kinematics of the free-floating closed-chain manipulator.

An approach 10 distance-to-contact and interference calculations appropriate for RQP is described as well as a strategy for gradient computations which are critical to applying any efficient nonlinear programming method. Symbolic computation has been used for general six degree-of-freedom transformations of the robot links and to provide analytical derivative expressions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy efficiency of the robots of today’s generation is in general very poor due to the existence of “geometric work.” The geometric work is geometry dependent and can be eliminate by adopting a special geometry which decouples the gravitational motion from the horizontal motions. Instead of adopting a special geometry, this paper studies the geometric work of a regular open-chained manipulator and applies it to the path planning for minimum energy consumption. For a given manipulator geometry and end-effector position, the zones of velocity with zero geometric work are determined analytically. A map which describes these zones of zero geometric work at various positions in workspace is then constructed for path planning with zero geometric work. The path planning for minimum energy consumption is generated by the dynamic programming method and the results are compared with the map of zero geometric work. It is found that the end-effector tends to move within the zones of zero geometric work as much as possible. If the end-effector has to cross the boundary of a zone at some point, it again moves within the zones after crossing the boundary. The presented method can also be used to arrange the pick and place positions for minimum travel energy consumption. That is, the two positions should be selected so that a continuous path which connects them with zero geometric work and with monotonously ascending or descending features is available.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the issue of the most efficient allocation of regulatory responsibilities among the subnational, national, and European Community (EC) levels of government is addressed. The most obvious impact of EC regulations on national and subnational policies is a transfer of legislative competences to the EC, as the principle of supremacy of EC law bars member states from passing laws inconsistent with the relevant EC legislation. There are less obvious but no less important ways in which EC regulations influence the political process in the member states. Thus, the process of implementation of EC regulations at the national level has led to an increase in the rule-making powers of the member states' executives and a corresponding weakening of the role of the national parliaments. Also, the relationship between central and subnational governments is significantly affected, especially in countries with a federal or regional structure. It is argued that, despite the theoretical and political appeal of decentralization in a community of nations as varied as in the EC, many regulatory powers will have to be surrendered by the national governments after completion of the internal market. The dilemma of regulatory federalism is that, although local governments are more attuned to individual tastes, they are also unlikely to make a clean separation between the provision of public goods for their citizens and engaging in policies designed to the advantage of the locality at the expense of its neighbours. Because the integrated European market is such a new creation, the threat posed by the strategic use of regulation to the advantage of one jurisdiction at the expense of other jurisdictions is probably more serious than the danger of excessive and inefficient uniformity. It is also important to keep in mind that the optimal assignment of regulatory responsibilities between different levels of government does not have to coincide with existing national boundaries. There may be significant externalities and a need for coordination between some, but not all, regions within a country or group of countries. A model which deserves particular attention in this context is that of consortia or ‘compacts’ among several states, or regions within different states, sharing similar problems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cities in eastern Africa have been growing at an unheralded pace, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Despite this rapid urbanization, very little research has been focused on energy and the environment in urban eastern Africa. This paper contains a review of what little work has been carried out to date. Several conclusions are pointed out. First, cities throughout the region remain small and have formed largely without industrial development. ‘Urbanization without industrialization’ means that the existing urban environmental problems are attributable to inadequate provision of service and not to the industrialization-linked problems found in more developed countries. Even if economic growth improves, action will be necessary to alleviate existing environmental problems. Second, the expected rapid pace of urban growth will impose tremendous costs at all levels. Increased user costs, either through reliance on private-sector alternatives or through public-sector tariffs, must be increasingly relied upon to defray the fiscal impacts of rapid urbanization and to assure the sustainability of urban infrastructural systems. Third, as the anticipated urban growth and industrialization take place, the focus of energy and environmental planners working on cities in eastern Africa will shift from basic service provision to increasingly complex problems. These shifts will require labor and financial resources far exceeding those currently found in these countries. Fourth, although energy and environmental needs may differ according to the size of the city, there has been little or no attention paid to problems outside of the primate cities. As a result, it is unclear how the problems and solutions will differ across the urban hierarchy. Clearly, urban planners need to consider the importance of energy and the environment. At the same time, energy and environmental researchers must pay greater attention to urban areas. </jats:p>",

Focusing on two management techniques regarding the development of ‘team’spirit among company employees, we see these changes as coinciding with the emergence of a language, if not directly the practice, of HRM which has come to pervade management in this and other contemporary organizations.</jats:p>",

The degree to which each of these processes affects manufacturing employment change is treated here entirely as an empirical question and is examined by using an extended probabilistic shift-share model along the lines suggested by Theil and Gosh, and Knudsen and Barff. Results of the analysis indicate that change in manufacturing employment within the Midwest can be accounted for by interregional shift, intraregional shift, and the national decline of industries concentrated in the region, in that order. Once these other factors are accounted for, demetropolitanization of manufacturing played only a negligible role in changes in manufacturing employment within the region during the study period. </jats:p>",

The nature and extent of maternal assistance and child involvement during dyadic planning involving 40 mothers and their 4 or 8-year-old children, and the influence of the process of joint planning on the child's later individual planning were examined using a route planning task. In addition to planning in advance and planning-in-action, adult and child concern with the rules and organisational aspects of the task versus more strategic concerns were compared in the two ages to examine how microgenetic processes are responsive to ontogenetic development. Older children displayed more planfulness than younger children during interaction with an adult and later on their own, with the important difference being that the older children planned more during the course of action, a strategy that was related to the development of more effective plans during joint planning and to greater planfulness when children planned on their own. Mothers planning with older children were more concerned with strategy and mothers planning with younger children were more concerned with task procedures and rules, indicating that adults structure their guidance in relation to cognitive developmental needs. </jats:p>",

In the first section the most relevant theoretical factors of optimal government organization for service delivery are reviewed. A catalogue of criteria that have been debated in the Swiss context at both federal–cantonal and cantonal–local levels are covered in the second section. The main point is that the discussion is focused on rather different criteria from those noted in orthodox economic theory. The analysis of the causes and discrepancies between theory and practice permits a more general conclusion, addressed to fiscal federalism. The conclusion is that there is no general answer to how functions should be assigned to a particular level of government, as the solution depends upon the relevant value-judgments of the polity as well as the resources-use required to provide given services. The outcome is a set of proposals on how better procedures for the assignment of functions might be developed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> New Zealand, like many other capitalist countries, has recently witnessed an increased corporate involvement in medicine. One manifestation of this change has been the entry of medical ‘supermarkets’—multipurpose clinics which juxtapose general practitioners (GPs) and specialists, are company owned, and employ advertising. The authors document the development and implications of these clinics which, although small in number, have induced change in the behaviour of the GP community at large. They conclude that recent developments involve a ‘coming out of the closet’ of a fundamental contradiction in the way general practice is conducted in New Zealand. This is between the role of the caring providers founded on the Hippocratic oath, and that of income-generating business people within an increasingly market-driven society. This contradiction leads to speculation on a broader question: The degree to which competition among primary care provides is possible within fee-for-service and other types of health-care systems. </jats:p>",

To benefit policy analysis, the concept of probability must be considerably broadened.

Problems that encompass uncertainty can be characterized according to their: (1) fundamental requirements, for example forecasting, knowledge creation, fact establishment; (2) system properties such as disorderly versus orderly systems; (3) problem-solution strategy, for example subjective judgement, model-based analysis, data analysis; (4) problem-solution data requirements—from numerous and hard-to-measure variables to few and easy-to-measure variables, and (5) problem-solution frame—ranging from unbounded solution spaces to small and discrete solution spaces. The theory of lower probability is presented as a generalization of classical additive probability that can handle this generalized conceptualization of probability.

Second is a brief description of the recent changes affecting the economy in British Columbia over the last decade or so. Third, employment change and labour segmentation are examined in terms of occupational, gender, and industry characteristics for manufacturing, wholesaling, and producer service sectors in British Columbia.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Homeless people are popularly portrayed as highly mobile, but their migration behavior has never been systematically analyzed. In this paper a conceptual model of homeless migration is developed that links migration behavior with the coping status of homeless individuals. The model is evaluated by using data drawn from a recent random probability sample of men surveyed in Skid Row, Los Angeles, CA. Results indicate that homeless migrants tended to be young, never married, white, mentally disabled, and either newly or cyclically homeless individuals. Long-term residents, in contrast, were apt to be older, physically disabled or suffering from a health-related problem, and had been homeless for some time. The dominant reason given for moving was to find a job or improve life opportunities in some other way. Findings also indicate that the majorty of homeless men in the sample were ‘stayers’ rather than ‘movers’. This obviates a common political strategy by localities of attempting to avoid obligations to provide support to homeless individuals on the basis of their transiency. </jats:p>",

The geographical impact of these changing policies in the Inner Areas of the City of Cardiff is examined, highlighting the importance of historical rateable values and household sizes. By using a purpose-built street-level database, the implications of the different taxation systems are examined at increasingly detailed geographic scales, and the complexity of their impact is illustrated. This analysis focuses upon the geographical effects of using administrative community boundaries for the allocation of transitional relief in Cardiff, Wales. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing prominence of service activities in the advanced economies poses a substantial challenge for studies of urban and regional development. This paper is a review of different approaches to the analysis of service growth. Studies directed specifically at the development of producer or information services have contributed a valuable sense of the way in which services are leading economic change. They are, however, constrained by the predominantly sectoral nature of their approach, which plays down the diverse character of services and the intimate links between services and other sectors. The conceptualisation of structural change is also too narrow, viewed almost solely through the lens of changes in the service sector. In contrast, a number of Marxist-inspired analyses provide a broader interpretation of the character of structural change, emphasising the role of services in changing phases of capitalist development. They also provide a more sophisticated analysis of the diverse character of services and the types of development they provide. However, they have generally so far been constrained by the limited and derivative role given to services in the dynamics of the economy. The authors argue for a ‘service-informed’ view of structural change which contains a broad analysis of the dynamics of the advanced economies and a sense of the significance of individual service activities in change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A critical analysis of the formal structure of government in Britain as it relates to questions of regional and local development is presented. According to a broadly economic framework, the argument is developed that the way that two of the most influential policies—local economic development and land-use planning—have developed is increasingly in conflict with the present structure of government. The logic of the policies is only compatible with a regional tier of government. The emerging paradigm for regional policy prescribes a ‘bottom-up’ approach to development which is focused on supply-side instruments. But policy in England is entirely driven and largely delivered from the centre. Wales and Scotland have an administrative structure which is rather less inconsistent with ‘bottom-up’ policies. Land-use planning, which in practice has a significant impact on the regional pattern of development, has been increasingly displaced to the most local tier of government—the districts. Conflict between the goals and implementation of policy arises in this case because, although the costs of physical development are contained at the local level, the benefits of development arise at the regional level. Thus two policy sectors which should be complementary and coordinated are increasingly in conflict; and the economic logic of the policies is inconsistent with the governmental structures through which they are delivered. The solution to this problem is the introduction of a regional tier of government and an appropriate balance of functions between national, regional, and local government. </jats:p>",

The conclusion is that the first round of implementation was instrumental in building norms and consensus‐especially in the face of strong resistance to state planning from the policy environment. The main reason for the effectiveness of the Cross‐Acceptance process was that it brought local, county and state officials to a forum where they were able to discuss areas of consensus and discord.</jats:p>",

To meet these goals, genetic education was provided on a regional basis to 45 family planning professionals. A self‐administered family health risk questionnaire adaptable to individual family planning settings was developed. Five hundred and twenty‐nine family planning clients voluntarily completed the questionnaire. Cigarette smoking (35%) and alcohol use (57%) were two major categories of risks identified. The Preconceptional Family Health Evaluation Program was well received by all participants and provided an effective means for regional education of family planning health professionals. As a result of the program, state program planners, clinical genetics services, and family planning health professionals developed a strong relationship that will serve future educational and genetic risk screening efforts</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to describe and validate a computerized imaging routine which has the potential to objectively identify material on dental roots and measure the area covered by these deposits. Dentiform teeth with simulated plaque were videorecorded. A computer routine was developed based on a flood‐fill algorithm which analyzed images of the dentiform teeth and determined the amount of simulated plaque on their root surfaces. Results showed that the dentiform teeth and their simulated plaque patterns are duplicated by the imaging routine in a rapid and reliable fashion. The system shows a high degree of accuracy with an average error factor of only 0.58%. As well, the system enables precise reproducibility with an average error factor of only 0.71%.</jats:p>",
