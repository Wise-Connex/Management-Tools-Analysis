With but minor compromises, each was treated with highly absorptive materials to reduce and to localize the sounds of speech and other activities. In two of the three cases, a steady level of background noise is generated and distributed electronically. Partial-height barriers are employed to maximize privacy between work stations. This paper briefly reviews the acoustical principles employed, methods adopted, and results achieved. Specifically, it deals with the questions of surface absorptivity and background noise. The findings include observations on the level and uniformity of background noise, the level of activity sounds, sound attenuation with distance, and barrier performance. While there has been no opportunity to collect and tabulate occupant response, the over-all results are very encouraging. They largely substantiate the validity of the approach taken and reinforce the value of exact acoustical design.</jats:p>",

Part of the problem with conventional planning is methodologic and part of it is based on the inadequacy of data; but the greatest part of the problem is that conventional planning is based on wrong assumptions about the environment in which plans must be implemented. After discussing the shortcomings of conventional planning, the author proposes another approach involving “planning from the bottom up” which includes annual plans, improved budgets, and multi-annual sector programs. After testing the new approach in countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the author concludes that this approach is more promising than the conventional one. </jats:p>",

Social, political, cultural, and demographic elements may all be taken into account. When underdevelopment is analyzed from an economic point of view emphasis is given to the phenomenon of low availability of goods and services for the satisfaction of the needs and aspirations of the population. In this paper underdevelopment will be analyzed from the point of view of an economic planner. Integration of health services planning into the total development plan will also be discussed. Although this paper is only an introductory synthesis to a vast subject, it is believed that it may be of help to other specialists, particularly those whose efforts are directed towards raising the level of health and improving sanitary conditions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study compares a number of operational and structural planning alternatives using a simulation procedure. The objective is to demonstrate that the economic and physical disadvantages of oll‐in, all‐out replacement of laying birds can be significantly reduced by planning a laying operation so as to (a) ensure high rate of utilization of rearing and laying house capacities, (b) maintain a uniform flow of eggs to the market, (c) allow for the retention of laying birds beyond the normal duration of the laying cycle, (d) reduce “bottlenecks” in the flow of birds through the operation, and (e) reduce the importance of the in‐lay period in planning decisions. Four alternative plans were simulated over a ten‐year period. It was concluded that a commercial laying operation could be planned to meet stated objectives without having an adverse effect on the producer's net income position. It was also concluded that the “continuous” phasing of production through rearing and laying stages which results in an even flow of eggs to market could, if followed by producers, have a beneficial effect on egg prices to producers and might also alleviate some of the excess capacity problems of some poultry supply industries.</jats:p><jats:p>Cette dissertation présente la méthodologie, le modéle et les résultats ďune analyse économique comparant quelques alternatives de program‐mation fonctionnelles et structurales aux méthodes traditionnelles de rem‐placement discontinu dans la production commerciale des oeufs.</jats:p><jats:p>Une méthode mixte (stochastique‐déterministe) de simulation est employée afin ďy comparer un nombre ďalternatives de programmation utilisant les remplacements annuels et bi‐annuels.
