      "abstract": "<jats:p> Infrastructure building, maintenance, and financing are familiar issues to planners, but only recently has the relationship between economic development and the quality and quantity of infrastructure received much attention. Largely absentfrom this emerging economic development/infrastructure literature, however, is discussion of the importance of telecommunications infrastructure. As the U.S. economy moves away from traditional manufacturing and toward a reliance on knowledge-intense, high-tech servicefirms, access to this infrastructure will be an increasingly criticalfactor in the location of both commercial and residential development. To attract and retain the communications-dependent firms and industries that are driving the information economy, state and local planners must actively provide access to the telecommunications services that these businesses and their skilled laborforces will demand. Clearly, communities must begin to planfor and provide telecommunications infrastructure to promote economic development if they are to avoid being left behind as the United States competes in the internationally based information economy. </jats:p>",

The racial transition observed in earlier decades may have been caused by the large increases in Black populations in metropolitan areas. Secondary analysis ofthefindings from several of the racial segregation and neighborhood change studies supports this hypothesis. </jats:p>",

This is referenced through the publication of the Plowden Report in 1961 and also includes an introduction to the proposed cash planning in 1982. This chapter argues that the process was a gradual one and the new planning and control system's principles were rooted in the official Treasury's response to changing government objectives in the 1950s. The gradual development of PESC was abruptly halted in the middle of 1970s as the need to cut expenditure and restore control coincided with the Keynesian principle's crumble. After the planning of how PESC was to be done and implemented, monitoring and cash control were then the dominant characteristics of the process.</jats:p>",

Both the institution and the public expenditure process are the focus of this book. Based on research undertaken with the cooperation of the Treasury and Whitehall departments, it shows how the key decisions of planning, allocating and controlling public expenditure are made. With access to treasury Expenditure Controllers and senior financial officials in the main spending departments, the book provides an account of the roles, relationships and inter-actions of the key players in Whitehall Expenditure Community as they confront each other in annual rituals of the Expenditure ‘Survey’. It explains how the rules of the expenditure game were re-drawn in the 1980s in the relentless search for cuts, greater economy and efficiency in the design and delivery of public services, and the creation of a more enterprising administrative culture. It discusses how and why the Treasury was rarely able to impose its constitutional authority to stem the tide of rising public expenditure through the turbulent years of the Thatcher and Major Governments. The book also demonstrates that the Treasury is locked into a system of mutually constrained power relationships with the Whitehall departments, and obliged to negotiate discretionary authority to control their spending.</jats:p>",

While public spending changed radically and inspired changes in the administrative culture of Whitehall, the difficulties in managing and controlling public spending plagued the Conservative Governments of the 1980s and 1990s as they had affected the administrations of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan. This chapter examines through a theoretical perspective why modern British governments find it difficult to control public spending centering on the argument of the Treasury's failure to achieve both short-term and medium-term objectives for public spending set by successive governments through the years 1976 to 1993. Treasury Expenditure Controllers and senior staff in the Finance Divisions of the spending department were interviewed to verify the interpretation of events as the research progressed.</jats:p>",

The mechanism allows the Treasury to operate in a more effective and flexible manner of planning and controlling public expenditure. This is in part to allow successive governments to contain and reduce public expenditure growth through the improved control measures of the Treasury. This chapter explains its origins and why it is being used by the Treasury, including a description of the changes in the rules of its usage most recently modified in 1984.

Nevertheless, the distinction between the two main types of work is helpful in the analysis and explanation of what Expenditure Divisions do, although it is not as clear-cut in practice. The quality and effectiveness of the Treasury's in-year control of departmental expenditure is determined mainly by its success in delivering the intended outputs of the Planning/Control Total.

The current arrangements for allocating resources are discussed, stressing the importance of the formula and block, and examines the way in which the territorial departments organize the internal process of bidding for resources.

Spending departments have forfeited the right to extra resources in-year if prices have moved against them and, because the doctrine of annuality (that resources are provided for use in a particular year) has been enforced more tightly through cash limits and cash planning, they have lost managerial flexibility in planning those programs which do not fit neatly into the one-year cycle. This chapter focuses on the tensions which have arisen as a result, and which have eventually obliged the Treasury to accede to departmental demands for some modification to the principle of firm annual cash limits. In July 1983, the Treasury agreed to the introduction of an end-year flexibility scheme (EYF) which allowed central government departments to carry forward a limited amount of underspending on capital programs from one financial year to the next, on both voted and non-voted cash limits.</jats:p>",

Civil Service numbers have become a highly charged political issue, with all the associated rhetoric of ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘waste’. Separate budgets—running costs control—for central government departments' administrative expenditure, itemised in Parliamentary Supply Estimates, and the subject of cash limits, were introduced in April 1986.

The formulation of the initiative went through debates in the Whitehall and upon announcement of the policy it evolved and was implemented from 1988 to 1993. Both the Next Steps and Financial Management Initiative contributed to the context of many debates about the control of public expenditure by the Treasury. The Next Step undertaking only proved the reality of Treasury power by inserting a degree of caution about the need to balance value-for-money with the need for continued control of expenditure.</jats:p>",

Four hundred and fifty physicians and nurses (150 MDs and 300 RNs) were sent a questionnaire on the use of and knowledge of NFP. One hundred sixty-six (or 37%) returned the completed questionnaires. Fifty-two percent of the nurses who returned the questionnaires and 48% of the physicians indicated they were taught about NFP in basic (generic) medical or nursing school. The average lecture time spent on the subject in either nursing or medical school was less than one hour. The majority learned about NFP through self-education or on-the-job training. Only four (1 RN and 3 MDs) are certified to teach NFP. Fifty-three percent of the nurses and 44% of physicians would not advise the use of NFP to avoid pregnancy. The most frequent reasons given for not promoting the use of NFP to either avoid or achieve pregnancy were that it is not effective, not natural, too difficult to learn, better methods are available, and it only works for highly motivated educated women. </jats:p>",

Some changes have been made to cash limit coverage including the prescribed allocation for some health and community services previously excluded, but one-third of total public expenditure is still not covered by cash limits. The system also had other changes such as the assimilation of cash limits with the Estimates, extending cash disciplines to three-year cash plans, and the introduction of a system to carry on expenditure from one cash limit to the next year. Another significant development is the separation of expenditure on pay and administration costs from other programme expenditure prescribed for each central department.</jats:p>",

Finding a plan that achieves a desired state with maximum probability is known to be an<jats:italic>NP-Complete</jats:italic>problem. We consider two algorithms: an exponential-time algorithm that maximizes probability, and a polynomial-time algorithm that maximizes a lower bound on the probability. As these algorithms trade off plan time for plan quality, we compare their performance on a mechanical system for orienting parts. Our results lead us to identify two properties of stochastic actions that can be used to choose between these planning algorithms for other applications.</jats:p>",

Newer recorded five and six channel transmission systems employing a dedicated low-frequency effects channel require careful consideration of the type and placement of low-frequency loudspeakers. The optimum location and directional and other characteristics of loudspeakers intended for existing home theater audio formats are often considered different than those for music playback, but multichannel transmission formats for both video and music-only playback may impact these requirements. Layout requirements of the room, including screen size and placement, are reviewed in light of the coming availability of high resolution video formats such as the digital video disc (DVD).

This chapter looks at two other criteria: assessing the effectiveness of the system for making decisions about public expenditure, for regulating the interdependent relationships of the Treasury and the spending departments; assessing the extent to which the system provides, for the participation of Ministers collectively in the processes of deciding the priorities of both the total of public expenditure and its composition.

Only for silver and iron is there any indication that such a change has occurred. For silver, the change is transitory. It is believed that changes in resource scarcity have implications for future economic growth depending on the extent of the change and the degree to which resource scarcity and economic growth are interrelated. To see whether this is a relevant concern cointegration techniques are utilized to identify objectively a long-run equilibrium relationship between resource scarcity and economic growth. Only for the unit cost measure for lead and copper for one of the measures of cointegration is there a suggestion that resource scarcity has affected economic growth in the United States over the period 1889–1992.</jats:p>",

Two Cabinet Committees are scrutinized in this chapter looking at their origins, purpose, and operation including an assessment of the degree to which the Cabinet acts in making decisions on public expenditure. The ‘Star Chamber’ is an ad hoc committee of the Cabinet formally set up in 1981 to adjudicate bids for increased expenditure that is still unresolved through the bilateral process. To further develop the Public Expenditure Survey, a successor to the ‘Star Chamberߣ was created known as ߢEDX’ or the Expenditure Committee of the Cabinet.</jats:p>",

This development is of considerable interest to the neurosurgeon planning procedures near brain regions involving specific functions. In the present study, rolandic and visual cortices were imaged with a conventional 1.5-tesla clinical MR imager using a spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state sequence. Two patients, one with a right frontal astrocytoma and the other with a left parietal meningioma, underwent MR imaging of rolandic cortex while performing a repetitive finger apposition task. Two patients with complex partial seizures referable to the temporal and occipital regions underwent MR imaging of visual cortex while exposed to repetitive photic stimulation (8.3 Hz). Significant signal intensity changes up to 15% between the activation and rest conditions were observed near the surgical targets at the expected anatomical location of the rolandic and visual cortices. In two of these cases activation measured by MR was compared and found similar to the activation measured at the same plane by H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>O positron emission tomography (PET). These results suggest that functional MR and PET techniques can be used to obtain preoperative brain mapping in individual patients considered for neurosurgical procedures.</jats:p>",

A number of difficulties have been encountered in applying many of the standard multiple‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) tools and techniques directly in this context. The paper introduces a broader framework in which these difficulties may be overcome, so that MCDM tools can be used effectively for evaluating strategic planning options. This framework is based on direct evaluation of sequences of “policy scenarios,” which are neither a full set of possible planning “alternatives,” nor fully specified down to the finest level of detail. The overall procedure and some experiences in applying it within the context of regional water resource planning in South Africa are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology (IT) was conventionally viewed as a process that affects the spatial organization of production significantly yet has little impact on technical and managerial structures. Specifically, IT was said to encourage decentralization and centralization in space because the new infrastructure, ‘the electronic superhighway’, both compresses space and reduces turnover time. Regional policymakers were then advised to design measures to enhance the decentralizing effect of IT. Only recently has attention been directed toward the impact of IT on industrial processes. However, such contributions remain limited because of their view of IT as a process phenomenon. We argue that IT is better viewed as a process and as a productive force and that from this perspective its impact is not limited to spatial organization of industries as it also alters production methods. Beginning with this understanding of IT, we have identified and presented two emerging technospatial tendencies, namely, integration and disintegration. Whereas decentralization disengages production stages from a centralized hub of productive activity, disintegration actually alters a centralized production hub into new fragments, each of which incorporates every necessary production stage to create a comprehensive and self-sufficient structure. Likewise, whereas centralization simply collects production stages together, integration restructures groups of production stages into a new whole and leads to comprehensive resource-sharing among diverse industries. The implications of this new formulation for regional development policy are far-reaching. There are also ramifications for the existing theory of new international division of labor, a subject that is not treated in this paper. Regional planners will need to restructure ‘innovation techniques’ specifically to accommodate disintegrated firms and to design policies that correlate with the industrial objective of competitive advantage. The most significant ingredients in this process are the establishment of an intelligent network, high-quality labor training, and support of productivity strategies designed to meet the needs of firms in the 1990s. Policymakers must also introduce regulations to promote universal access to IT and prevent integrated firms from becoming oligopolies, including the creation of countervailing local forces. </jats:p>",

Global, regional, and national scale studies have been undertaken in an attempt to assess the future threat posed by sea level rise. To date none of these studies have fully encompassed the relationship between the physical change impacts and the socioeconomic implications. The authors utilise both a ‘GDP-at-risk’ and an economic cost—benefit approach, in combination with biophysical analysis, to model the impacts of sea level rise along the East Anglian coastline of eastern England. The economic results indicate that for most sea-level-rise predictions the protect strategy is economically justifiable on a region-wide basis. At a more localised scale a combination of response options, including ‘do nothing and retreat’, may be optimal. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose an unconstrained convex programming dual approach to solving these problems. In particular, we focus on a class of linearly-constrained entropy maximization problem with quadratic cost, study its Lagrangian dual, and provide a globally convergent algorithm with a quadratic rate of convergence. The theory and algorithm can be readily applied to the trip distribution problem with quadratic cost and many other entropy-based formulations, including the conventional trip distribution problem with linear cost, the entropy-based modal split model, and the decomposed problems of the combined problem of trip distribution and assignment. The efficiency and the robustness of this approach are confirmed by our computational experience. </jats:p>",

These new applications are using more and more sophisticated sources of data but are in large measure still operationalising the familiar concepts of market potential. Such potential is calculated for any zone by summing the representative economic mass of all other zones in the system each divided by some measure of the intervening travel impedance between that zone and every other zone. In this straightforward calculation it becomes necessary to incorporate the economic mass of the zone under consideration itself and to decide on the appropriate travel impedance. This apparently simple task is the focus of this paper. Most research of this type uses a weighting of the radius of the circle equalling the area of the zone in question to approximate the travel impedance. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the choice of weighting is important in determining the nature of the resultant potential surface. </jats:p>",

The UMP development process is interesting to examine because it can be viewed as a microcosm of broader general processes which are impacting cities throughout the world. After a brief overview of the key dimensions of globalization processes [the development and restructuring of the international financial system; the globalization of property markets; the changing role of the transnational corporation; the stretching of social relations, world social networks, and epistemic communities (including the overseas Chinese); and travelling and networking] contemporary urban development trends in the Pacific Rim Basin are outlined to provide a context for UMP development. Three UMPs—in Vancouver (Pacific Place), Yokohama (Minato Mirai 21), and Shanghai (Lujiazui Central Area, Pudong)—are then examined in order to tease out complexities of globalization processes and the global—local dialectic. Attention throughout the paper is focused on international linkages and global context in influencing the production of these new urban spaces—spaces often designed (at extraordinary expense) to symbolize a global urban ‘utopia’ for the 21st century. </jats:p>",

The DSS was based on a stochastic simulation model of investment decisions (ISM). ISM described a farm with one loan and one building using 23 variables. The simulation model calculated the results of a strategic plan for an individual pig farm over a time horizon of a maximum of 20 years for a given scenario. For six distinct replacement strategies, regression metamodels were specified to describe the outcome of the response variable as a function of the farm variables. The regression results indicated that a linear function with only nine or ten farm variables gave a reasonable estimate of the results of the simulation model. Turnover ratio, feed conversion ratio, percentage of meat, farm size, family expenses, and experience were the main parameters determining future relative farm position. For farms with high levels of family expenditures and/or financial leverage an economic replacement strategy was optimal. Risk attitudes played a minor role in the choice of the optimal strategy, because one strategy was preferred to another regardless of risk preference. To analyze the attractiveness of a chosen strategic plan for different ‘what‐if’ scenarios, the visual method using graphical representations offered sufficient information. The number of years ahead for which the decision maker evaluated the consequences of simulated strategic plans influenced which strategy was preferred.</jats:p>",

Although reaching movements are characterized by hand paths that tend to follow roughly straight lines in Cartesian space, a fundamental issue is whether this reflects constraints associated with perception or movement production. 2. To address this issue, we examined two-joint planar reaching movements in which we manipulated the mapping between actual and visually perceived motion. In particular, we used a nonlinear transformation such that straight line hand paths in Cartesian space would result in curved paths in perceived space and vice versa. 3. Under these conditions, subjects learned to make straight line paths in perceived space even though the paths of the hand in Cartesian space were markedly curved. In contrast, when the motion was perceived in Cartesian space (i.e., in the absence of a nonlinear distortion), straight line hand paths were observed. 4. These findings suggest that visually guided reaching movements are planned in a perceptual frame of reference. Reaching movements in the horizontal plane are adapted so as to produce straight lines in visually perceived space. </jats:p>",

This report presents data from 360 female family planning clients who reported using condoms as their primary method of contraception for at least 1 sexually active month during the study's follow-up period after their first clinic visit. RESULTS. Only 1% always engaged in all five use behaviors studied: using a condom for each sexual intercourse, putting the condom on before first entry, withdrawal after intercourse while there is still an erection, holding on to the condom's rim during withdrawal, and using foam. Multiple linear regression indicated that more effective condom use was reported by women who had not had an induced abortion, were not using condoms just because they were starting oral contraceptive pill regimens, had more knowledge about birth control in general, had received a nursing intervention, and had more communication with their partner. CONCLUSIONS. Increasing attention needs to be devoted to understanding determinants of the specific actions that differentiate between more and less effective contraceptive use. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Postcode addresses from National Health Service patient registers for Norfolk and Suffolk current on census day 1991 were assigned to census wards, and estimates of populations in wards were produced for the total population and for twelve age—sex groups. These were compared with adjusted counts of usual residents from the 1991 Census. Regression analysis was used to identify the characteristics of wards with consistent differences between register estimates and census counts. Patient register estimates were less than census counts for children aged 0–4 years. Patient register estimates exceeded census counts for residents aged 15–44 years (especially males) and over 74 years. Wards with high rates of in-migration and high proportions of residents employed in the armed forces tended to have lower register estimates than census counts. Areas of high population density had higher register estimates than census counts. Taking these effects into account, about half the patient register estimates of total population were within 5% of the equivalent census figure, and 95% of wards had estimates within 20%. The main differences between patient register population estimates and census counts can be explained by delays in the updating of records in family health service authority (FHSA) registers and by undercounting in the 1991 Census. In Norfolk and Suffolk, FHSA registers are an acceptable alternative to the census for population estimation purposes. This supports recent arguments for wider use of population registers and suggests that they may be particularly valuable as a source of intercensal information. </jats:p>",
