Recently, consideration has been given to how to link these two methods. An attempt is made in this paper to demonstrate the connection that exists between certain resource allocation formulae and planning models. Although this dependency may be a useful theoretical property, problems exist in that the best allocation formulae correspond to the worse planning models, and vice versa, so that this connection may be difficult to use in practice. Despite this problem, this property can be used to define some alternative allocation formulae, and a number of recommendations for doing this are given. </jats:p>",

He doesn’t’t need background: he wants evidence for a point of view-a position paper. This imaginary assignment has the familiar characteristics of many such writing tasks: there is n’t enough time to do a good job; there is a strong likelihood that what I say will not convince the reader as he weighs my views against those of others closer to him; but there is the possibility of doing something useful.</jats:p>",

There’s not much time so you decide you won’t need to plan extensively; once you get going, there will be plenty to say. How far back should you start? What about Nixon’s long history as an anticommunist, and then his sudden tum toward China?

In the wake of this activity, there have been two major accidents: Three Mile Island (TMI), near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1979; and Chernobyl, near Kiev, Ukraine, Soviet Union, in 1986. It is noteworthy that both of these accidents were related to human error and not to malfunction of the emergency back-up systems. So far, nuclear energy production plant accidents have occurred when either the data were misinterpreted or systems misguided by human function.</jats:p><jats:p>The major problem associated with a nuclear energy generating plant accident is the release of radiation. Even though the medical facilities may not be destroyed physically, they may be rendered useless because of contamination by radiation. Unfortunately, in the event of such an accidental release of radiation, all of the health-care facilities in the area will be contaminated. Therefore, all patients in hospitals and nursing homes will need to be evacuated to facilities outside of the contaminated area and not just relocated within the contaminated area.</jats:p>",

The paper seeks to develop a schematic model for crises and concludes by advocating that management needs to acknowledge the lim itations of its contingency planning in order to allow for more effective deci sion making. The model suggests that there are three phases within a crisis: the precipitation phase in which the potential for a crisis is created, the operational phase of the crisis, and the post-crisis phase. The resultant model provides a framework for the subsequent analysis of crisis events. </jats:p>",

The emergence of the aircraft industry in the region during the 1920s and 1930s is described. The formation of the postwar aerospace-electronics industry is then discussed in detail. The geography of Southern California's contemporary technopoles (high-technology industrial districts) is outlined, with a particular emphasis on the aircraft, electronics, biotechnology, and medical-device industries. The functional role of interfirm linkages and local labor markets in the high-technology industrial development of Southern California is analyzed. The paper ends with a few brief allusions to the strengths and vulnerabilities of high-technology industry in the region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Rainbow Coalition (and rainbow politics in general) provides a suitable context in which to explore ideas about the relationship between theories of social identity and actual processes of identity formation. A brief outline of the history of Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential nomination campaigns is provided. Existing academic interpretations of the Rainbow Coalition are then reviewed, and a class-based analysis is favoured rather than one grounded in racial politics or new social movements. This conclusion needs to be tempered by a fuller consideration of the geography of the Rainbow Coalition than has been available so far. The paper ends with a tentative examination of what geographical principles and themes are involved, drawing on case studies from Vermont, Van Nuys, CA, and Baltimore, MD, It is suggested that a focus on the circulation of finance capital may provide both the principle linking the coalition's diverse constituencies and places and a significant point of political leverage for future rainbow polities. </jats:p>",

In the introduction she outlines nationalism's relation to the concepts of patriarchy and racism, by highlighting their shared tendency to express dominance–subservience relations. At the same time, the concept of hegemony is introduced as the process which seeks to institutionalize unequal power relations based on characteristics of gender, ‘race’, and culture. In the body of the paper she then examines the way in which Frisian nationalism has responded to the cultural and political hegemony born of Dutch nationalism. Specifically, the author demonstrates how Dutch nationalism sought to establish Dutch hegemony; outlines the way in which Frisian nationalism—particularly its most recent phase of political activitism—has responded to Dutch hegemony; and evaluates the effectiveness of this Frisian response. The conclusions draw on the Frisian experience to show how hegemony can be challenged in ways which promote increased equality in the power relations of gender, ‘race’, and culture. </jats:p>",

The author focuses on the patriarchal imaginative geography which designates spaces either as public, masculine, and political or as private, feminine, and domestic, and argues that this is an oppressive structure of signification which limits women's identities and powers by denying them a place in the polity. The author concentrates on resistance by feminists against their confinement to the domestic sphere, and begins by briefly discussing their suffrage campaigns in the period before the First World War to enter and change the public arena. She then presents the lives of two interwar women radicals who overcame the public–private dichotomy in their attempts to liberate children from the oppressions of class, gender, and race, and examines the way in which their work offers a radical democratic critique of the state itself. Their efforts are compared favourably to contemporary revisions of the English polity by democratic socialists, and in consequence the paper concludes by advocating the destabilising and liberating effects of certain feminist critiques. </jats:p>",

Formal interventions seeking to overcome disabilities of the informal sector not only fail but in many cases exacerbate them. This is due to dissonance that occurs between the two planning styles. Failure to plan generatively results from systemic constraints on the institutions sponsoring the interventions, including values and goals, and in part from the training, values, and world view of the formal planners. It is possible for formal planners to engage in generative planning, but joining informal players in generatively pursuing mutually defined goals may prove unacceptable, [planning styles, generative and regulative planning]</jats:p>",

The thesis of this paper is that the persistence of British regional policy, with support from both major parties of government over a period of forty years or more, reflects an attempt to maintain the class-based dual party system of national politics by minimising the importance of other dimensions of political preference. The paper has two main sections. In the first a series of conventional rationales for regional policy are examined in terms of efficiency, equity, and the government's interest in reelection, and it is concluded that none of these adequately explains the uncontested basis of British regional policy. In the second main section a version of Downs's model of electoral competition is adopted to investigate the stability of forms of two-party competition, and it is argued that in a class-based national system the parties have a strong interest in avoiding the emergence of a separate territorial dimension of politics. The conclusion to the paper is a consideration of the relationship between regionalism, regional politics, and regional policy in the context of Mrs Thatcher's government's weakening of regional policy and emphasis on strong central control. </jats:p>",

In concert these approaches cast attention to the implications of recognizing subjects as knowledgeable human agents in analyses of social and economic change. These include a renewed emphasis on the ‘everyday’ and its links with general processes, an interest in methods appropriate for investigating the generation of meanings central to our social and spatial worlds, and the need to incorporate women's experiences in the construction of theoretical knowledge. Included in a new research agenda within feminist geography are questions concerning the active construction of gender identities through practices which vary over time and space. In the study reported the meaning of the domestic workplace to mothers of young children was explored. It is shown how the notion of motherhood and the sets of practices making up mothering work were interpreted and negotiated as women responded to social and economic structuring in a particular place. The paper includes a concluding discussion on the links between the theoretical underpinnings of the study and its empirical findings. </jats:p>",

Within 'mammal provinces' of Canada, several parks supported the same number of mammalian species, or more, than a single large park with the same area. The proportion of species that require undisturbed habitats increased with total area conserved. Human disturbances should be reduced in parks because these undisturbed-site species are unable to survive in disturbed environments not protected by a park system. An analysis of species distributions across parks indicated that not all small parks had the same composition. I therefore recommend establishing many parks in a biologically defined region and incorporating as much total area as possible. To aid in developing a strategy for placing parks across Canada, areas with high total mammalian richness and high richness of mammal species intolerant of disturbances are highlighted. Maps showing these areas are particularly useful because it is unlikely that several large parks will be established in every region and it is therefore important to identify the most diverse sites. </jats:p>",

Public housing in Hong Kong is subsidized by the government mainly in the form of land, infrastructure, and low interest rates, but housing subsidy is not allocated to the most needy people. Some of the public housing is occupied by people who can take care of their own housing needs. Housing subsidies can be used more efficiently and equitably if these people are encouraged to move out of public housing or charged a more reasonable rent. The nature of horizontal and vertical inequity in housing subsidies in the public housing of Hong Kong is discussed and the effectiveness of some of the measures that have recently been used to tackle the problem of unfair housing subsidy is examined. </jats:p>",

An examination of some of the historical research on how cultural ideals about the natural roles of men and women interacted with the construction of the early American national community is undertaken. The focus is upon seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century liberal bourgeois notions about public and private life and the way in which the problematic relationship between gender and nationhood undermined republican claims to universal membership. Geographers interested in issues of state formation and nationalism are encouraged to consider the importance of feminist approaches to citizenship. </jats:p>",

Material Requirements Planning literature reveals that MRP implementations are seldom adjusted in any systematic way to account for such yield improvement. A single product, single stage MRP model is developed which incorporates learning curve behavior into conventional MRP logic. A series of experiments systematically examine the impact on mean inventory level of various combinations of environmental conditions and managerial policies. The research demonstrates that substantial reductions in mean inventory levels can be realized in low yield environments if learning is properly included in the order release logic. This finding proves to be robust with respect to modest errors in the estimation of learning rate. </jats:p>",

Inner structures show the (weighted) forward and backward linkages between the Leontief and Ghoshian inverses and distribution or share coefficients of the final demand or primary input matrices. Final structures describe how the production and allocation matrices are related simultaneously to both final demand and primary input. Feedback structures show how changes in the distribution or level of final demand or primary inputs work their way through the system and change the original final demand and primary inputs according to how they are related to produced output. </jats:p>",

The spatial aggregation experiments constitute an extension and update of similar kinds of research reported on in a previous paper by Blair and Miller, in which hypothetical accounts and the 1963 US MRIO data were used. An important difference between the 1963 and 1977 data sets is that the latter are in the commodity-by-industry format. </jats:p><jats:p> In the experiments reported here, it has been possible to deal with larger data sets for the least aggregated base cases, and the amount of data that is ‘covered up’ in the aggregations is therefore much larger. Nevertheless, it is still possible to conclude that spatial aggregation in MRIO models need not generate unacceptable error. The term error suggests that the most disaggregated data are always most accurate; because this position is not embraced by all input-output observers, we can alternatively describe the work in this paper as an investigation into the sensitivity of MRIO model results to sectoral and/or spatial aggregation. </jats:p>",

The new adult pattern differs from that proposed by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) for the adult but is similar to that for two- to five-year-old children. FAO food availability data were used to evaluate the dietary patterns in selected countries, including those of Africa, the Far East, and the Near East. Lysine appears to be the limiting amino acid in diets heavily dependent on cereals, characteristic of those in poor countries; the analysis reveals that for these countries the mean lysine supply is below the newly estimated requirements, implying that adults could be at risk of an inadequate intake, especially when total protein availability is low. Further, this analysis reveals that when animal foods contribute about one-third of the total protein supply or when animal foods together with pulses and soybeans account for about 40% of the total protein supply, the lysine requirement for the population will be met. For the US diet, the high proportion of the total protein contributed by animal foods, about 68%, provides a lysine intake that is well above the estimated requirement and that is almost constant across all age and sex groups. This reassessment leads to the recommendation that, especially in countries whose diet is mainly dependent on cereals, complementation to improve dietary protein quality should remain a consideration in the design and implementation of food, nutrition, and agricultural programmes and policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an examination of how state policies have influenced the spatial distribution of industry in Greece throughout the period after World War 2. The focus is only on those aspects of state policy that directly influence the spatial distribution of industry, that is regional policy, which was always orientated, in theory at least, towards the vague notion of the ‘more even’ regional development of the country. It is argued that state regional policies were not on the whole successful. The regional incentives system for industry in particular, which was the most important instrument of state regional policy, was quite inadequate, and, moreover, its cost to society increased steadily while its contribution towards a more even spatial distribution of industry was marginal. That is, the incentives system does not seem to have facilitated the regional reorganisation of industry in the sense of diminishing the spatial inequalities in the distribution of industrial activities. It was not ‘accidental’ that the regional incentives system, with its innate weaknesses and increasing cost, survived for so long, despite the fact that it was ineffective. Its survival can be explained in terms of the particular characteristics of Greek society, such as the predominance of the political over the economic sphere and the prevalence of clientelism in politics. In such a context the innate weaknesses of the incentives system allowed certain groups of people to enjoy economic benefits with noneconomic means. </jats:p>",

Input-output analysis is used to introduce a technique that avoids these errors. The contribution of a basic activity to a regional economy is identified as the value added directly and indirectly throughout the economy as a result of export sales. The proper classification of basic and nonbasic activities and, consequently, the development of accurate multipliers depend upon the identification of embodied as well as direct exports. An application of the technique is provided in an analysis of the economic base of Canada's Prairie region and its growth during the 1970s. </jats:p>",

Our approach uses optics anal ogies, ray tracing, and Snell's Law and reduces the problem to an efficient graph search with a variety of pruning criteria. The time and space of our algorithm is O(V <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) in an intui tively average case, where V is the number of region vertices. In experiments in which space is held constant, an imple mentation of our algorithm was not only dramatically faster but also gave better cost solution paths than a representative implementation of the chief competing technique, grid-based wavefront propagation. This appears to be because of the quite different and considerably smaller search space required for our more intelligent algorithm. </jats:p>",
