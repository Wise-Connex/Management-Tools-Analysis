Furthermore, though German—Polish cooperation institutions have been created largely from the ‘top down’, research indicates that transboundary regionalism must also develop local roots through a slow and gradual process of routinized interaction. The real test of German—Polish regionalism will thus be the development of new networks between public and private actors stabilizing the institutions now in place, but there nonetheless remain questions as to the intrinsic economic development potentials of transboundary cooperation within a context of European integration and expansion. </jats:p>",

Demand for domestic gas has been recently stimulated while the Western Pacific Rim region presents an expanding LNG market. The proximity of these markets, together with the Venture's reputation for reliable supply, and a highly successful gas exploration program, places the NWS Venture in a strong position for substantial growth in its LNG, Domgas and liquids business.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The current offshore infrastructure will require expansion to capture the future market demands (Figure 1). Woodside has initiated an Offshore Development Planning (ODP) Process designed to deliver insight and understanding into the complex technical and commercial issues which surround the continued development of the NWS. Major uncertainties facing the Venture include timing of expansion opportunities; proven and exploration reserves; and the capacity, reliability and safety of surface facilities. The ODP is a decision-focussed process that analyses major infrastructure decisions and presents understanding and insight in support of development recommendations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper reviews the work associated with the current ODP program, describing the methodology and expansion strategies evaluated and how these methodologies have made a difference in the overall development strategy of the NWS.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 361</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This was followed by the Peninsular Gas Utilization Project (PG U) and the Sabah Gas Project in 1984.

The planning wheel is a promising, new planning model. The planning wheel bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear processes and addresses these important forces. This model allows for the interaction and interdependence of six major components of the programme planning process. Furthermore, the planning wheel provides a macro and micro systems approach. The model incorporates internal and external forces that influence new economic development by capturing political, social, cultural, technological, and economic forces of the marketplace. The planning wheel offers promises in application in a variety of environments and circumstances. For example, it is especially valuable for workforce training programmes in emerging economies.</jats:p>",

First, constructions of national identities and of the nation-state and their dissemination through development discourse is considered. Second, the textual dissemination of meaning through the process of writing development is explored with specific reference to Hegel's writings on the principle of development. Third, the dissemination of historical and geographical worlds through discourses of development is considered with the continued durability of the idea of three worlds as the key focal point of discussion. I formulate an antidevelopment incite which attempts to disrupt the enframing of postcolonial Africa through ‘Western’ discourses of development. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the worlds of development have proven so persistent, and of the implications for a more radical ‘post-colonial’ development geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>External beam radiotherapy has a role in each histological type of thyroid cancer. For treatment confined to the thyroid bed, an antero--oblique wedged pair of beams is simple to apply. More frequently, however, the volume needs to include both sides of the neck and adequate dose must be given down to the level of the suprasternal notch, precluding use of lateral fields. Thus, anterior and posterior fields are usually necessary, extending from the tips of the mastoid processes or hyoid down to the carina and laterally to include both sides of the neck and supraclavicular fossae. The mandible and infraclavicular portions of both lungs are shielded, but there is no midline lead in the phase one volume. A mid-plane dose of 46 Gy given in 23 daily fractions results in an acceptable early radiation reaction and will avoid late damage to the spinal cord. Because of considerable variation of interplanar distance along the length of the volume, a lateral simulator film should be taken to determine the maximum cord dose. For most patients, a three-dimensional CT planned phase two volume will be required and should be determined prior to completing phase one. The optimum beam arrangement, usually incorporating conformal beam shaping assisted by use of a multileaf collimator, should avoid further dose to the cord. If there is additional dose to the spinal cord, this phase can be introduced before 46 Gy is reached.</jats:p>",

In this paper I address two aspects of the spatiality of democracy through an assessment of transitional arrangements for local government in South African cities. Political identities, as well as spatial arrangements, involved in democratic politics are associated with instability, uncertainty, and ongoing contestation. In democracies, the contestation both of identities and of spaces is institutionalised and this implies the generalisation of particular spatialities. Drawing on a spatially informed interpretation of the work of Ernest Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, I argue that the transitional phase in the emergence of democracy in South Africa has involved the growth of a democratic culture—even in situations where substantial compromises have been made to keep recalcitrant white interests on board. I question the assertion of a nonracial politics which seeks to erase the possibility of ethnically based political identities and argue that the failure of the left to hegemonise their perspective of a nonracial political project and a nonracial postapartheid city may have ironically assisted in extending the possibilities for democracy. A key conclusion is that democracies are associated with different spatialities which facilitate contestation and representation. A politics of space, given the radical undecidability of spatial boundaries, is supportive of the extension of democracy. </jats:p>",

Two general approaches have been suggested for solution of the inverse radiotherapy problem: explicit and implicit. Explicit methods are typically fast, but generally require geometric and/or dosimetric simplifications. Implicit methods have also been used, but are computationally expensive because they require iterative manipulation of each beam's individual elements. The method presented here incorporates an integrated approach in order to efficiently solve the inverse problem without requiring simplifications which may affect the accuracy of the final result. A deconvolution algorithm (explicit approach) is utilized to determine the intensity modulation function for multiple user‐selected beam's eye views of the desired dose distribution. A simulated annealing algorithm (implicit approach) then optimizes each beam's macroscopic weight. Additionally, this method is fully three‐dimensional and accurately models phantom scatter by incorporating Monte Carlo generated energy deposition kernels into the dosimetry process. Several small target structure examples are presented and applicability of this methodology to larger targets for general radiotherapy cases is addressed.</jats:p>",

The study population consisted of 1443 young adults (494 females and 949 males) in the cities of Quito and Guayaquil, interviewed by the 1988 Ecuador Young Adult Reproductive Health Survey, who reported having experienced consensual sexual intercourse. Approximately 11% of females and 15% of males reported using contraception at first intercourse. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess jointly the effect of multiple factors on contraceptive use at first intercourse. The regression model was first run on the entire study population and then separately for males and females. In the overall population, the following variables were significantly related to using family planning at first sex: being male; being from Guayaquil; older age; father's completion of secondary school. Having lost one's virginity to a prostitute was significantly associated with non-use of family planning. Males were 3·6 times more likely than females to use family planning during their first sexual intercourse. For each year older a young adult was at first sex, his or her odds of using family planning was multiplied by a factor of 1·3. Twenty-eight per cent of males in this study experienced their first sexual intercourse with a prostitute, and these young men were highly unlikely to use family planning. A male who experienced first intercourse with his girlfriend was more than five times as likely to use contraception than a male who lost his virginity to a prostitute.</jats:p>",

The computational appeal of neural networks for solving some fundamental spatial analysis problems is summarized and a definition of computational neural network models in mathematical terms is given. Three definitional components of a computational neural network—properties of the processing elements, network topology and learning—are discussed and a taxonomy of computational neural networks is presented, breaking neural networks down according to the topology and type of interconnections and the learning paradigm adopted. The attractiveness of computational neural network models compared with the conventional modelling approach of the gravity type for spatial interaction modelling is illustrated before some conclusions and an outlook are given. </jats:p>",

First, an analysis of Christopher Koch's two novels, The Year of Living Dangerously and Highways to a War, is used to establish the parameters of change in Australian imaginings of themselves in Asia. This analysis of literary texts, we argue, can be used to develop an analytical framework for considering Australian aid policies to Asia as cultural texts, and the extent to which such policies can be seen to be part of a redefinition of Australian settler society towards a postcolonial understanding of the ‘white self’. In the second part of the paper we offer a preliminary analysis of how Australian overseas-aid policies have begun to acknowledge the fact of Australia's geopolitical location. We argue that these cultural texts reveal a repositioning of Australian identity which remains caught within a terrain of whiteness. </jats:p>",

The intent of this paper is to report on the compensators designed by the system and to compare them to those devised through conventional techniques. It is demonstrated that the system can model the dosimetric effects of compensators with a high degree of accuracy; measured and predicted doses agree to within 3%. Optimized compensators show slightly improved dose uniformity over thickness reduced compensators. Both show significantly improved uniformity over compensators that simply retract the bolus geometry. In cases where internal inhomogeneities exist, however, the dose uniformity from the optimized compensators vary by as much as 6% at the target depth. These deviations are comparable to the errors of the inhomogeneity algorithm itself. The pathlength reduction technique has been applied to both missing tissue and inhomogeneity compensation, and it has been found that for inhomogeneity compensation, the pathlength reduced compensators produce more uniform distributions than those generated by the optimization algorithm.</jats:p>",

The author describes how to develop new models via a machine-based inductive approach. A Cray T3D parallel supercomputer with 512 processors is used to investigate the potential of this approach to building computer models.

One of these has been the development of integrated education in Northern Ireland. However the reduction in government support for this initiative together with a contracting market and increased competition from other schools has led to integrated schools, and their umbrella organization, NICIE, to realize that effective strategic planning is necessary.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The year 1994 was a very significant year for the Japanese urban system. In that year the Tokyo metropolitan area (TMA), which had enjoyed a net inflow of interregional migrants since the 1950s, recorded a net outflow for the first time. What factors gave rise to such a remarkable migration change for the area? The results from a set of time-series analyses lead the authors to conclude that, as far as the study period (1979–92) as a whole is concerned, the changing migration pattern of the TMA arose from factors closely related to Tokyo's transformation into a world city (specifically in terms of industrial restructuring and changes in residential land prices) and from cycles of economic boom and bust. However, it was found that the change to world city was more important than the economic cycle. Such findings suggest that the Japanese migration system experienced structural change during the 1980s and entered a new phase in the 1990s. </jats:p>",

French chambers are powerful organisations in formal terms and have a unique potential for local economic development. Yet public-law status also creates a particular set of problems and difficulties for the French chambers. In this paper, the author examines the economic performance of chambers in France, focusing on the problems and constraints associated with public-law status. It is shown that, if the chambers derive considerable advantages from public-law status, this also imposes severe constraints on their activities. Indeed, these constraints have prevented the chambers from assuming a more dynamic role within the local economy. </jats:p>",

My claim is that globalisation involves a shift-in the object of economic governance away from the national economy and towards the circuits of global capital. This shift is associated with a change in spatial imaginaries. Through an analysis of three key arenas—social policy, foreign direct investment, and immigration—I show that policies and programmes, designed to fulfil these new political ambitions, aim to articulate individuals, sectors, and regions into the economic flows and networks of the Pacific Rim. In this regard, globalisation can be usefully understood as a political strategy that promotes a new understanding of the means and ends of economic governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, patients with brain neoplasms must undergo both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to take advantage of CT's density information and MR's soft tissue imaging capabilities. A method has been developed that allows virtual simulation, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), and 3‐D treatment planning of patients with brain neoplasms to be generated using only one T1‐weighted MR data set. DRRs of an anthropomorphic RANDO head phantom were generated using MR and CT imaging. The MR based DRRs provided structural information equivalent to CT based DRRs. The spatial linearity of CT and MR image sets was evaluated by measuring the percent distortion and spatial error. There was no statistical difference in spatial linearity or accuracy between the CT and MR image sets. MR and CT based treatment planning were compared using a variety of different treatment accessories, field sizes, photon energies, and gantry positions. Doses at various points throughout the head phantom were used as comparison points between CT based heterogeneous, CT based homogenous, and MR based homogenous treatment planning of the head phantom. Lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters were used to verify the dosimetric accuracy of MR based treatment planning by taking measurements at these points. For treatment plans with fields that pass through large air cavities, such as the maxillary sinus, homogenous treatment planning produces unacceptable dosimetric error (2%–4%). For treatment plans with fields that pass through the skull, MR homogenous treatment planning can be used with a dosimetric accuracy of ±2%.</jats:p>",

In turn, however, the example of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is used to reflect on a number of broader theoretical issues concerning discourses and processes of regional integration. The author notes how, in the early 1980s, the forerunner to the SADC was born (in part) out of a struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Today, the organisation includes the ‘new’ (postapartheid) South Africa and has accordingly shifted its avowed rationale away from an alliance against apartheid towards a scheme for regional integration, ‘development’, and reconstruction. Moving beyond these claims and drawing on interviews, journalistic sources, and official documentation the author seeks to understand the SADC's role as a diplomatic entity—and as operating within the same logics of power as the postcolonial African state. </jats:p>",

A pooled time-series analysis for 21 years in four states was used to test the relationship between adopting a gender-neutral insurance law and risk-adjusted prices, industry concentration, numbers of licensed drivers, and traffic fatalities. The authors find that gender-neutral automobile-insurance laws have no impact on the risk-adjusted price of insurance, the market share held by direct writers, the number of licensed drivers, or the rate of traffic fatalities. Gender-neutral laws were associated with a larger market share being controlled by the three largest firms. The authors conclude that because gender-neutral insurance laws have no impacts which are detrimental to consumers, they could be adopted by all states with few negative consequences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Building on the tabular analyses exemplified in our first paper and widely used in the medical literature, we use generalised linear models to provide a formal, statistical approach to the analysis of mortality and deprivation relationships, and their change over time. Three types of fixed effects model are specified and estimated with the same ward-level data sets for Wales examined in our first paper. They are: Poisson models for analysing mortality and deprivation at a single cross section in time; repeated-measures Poisson models for analysing mortality–deprivation relations, not only at cross sections in time, but also their changes over time; and logit models focusing on temporal changes in mortality–deprivation relationships. Nonlinear effects of deprivation on mortality have been explored by using dummy variables representing deprivation categories to establish the connection between formal statistical models and the tabular approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three types of iterative algorithms, algebraic inverse treatment planning (AITP), simultaneous iterative inverse treatment planning (SIITP), and iterative least‐square inverse treatment planning (ILSITP), differentiated according to their updating sequences, were generalized to three dimension with true beam geometry and dose model. A rapid ray‐tracing approach was developed to optimize the primary beam components. Instead of recalculating the dose matrix at each iteration, the dose distribution was generated by scaling up or down the dose matrix elements of the previous iteration. This significantly increased the calculation speed. The iterative algorithms started with an initial intensity profile for each beam, specified by a two‐dimensional pixel beam map of <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> elements. The calculation volume was divided into <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> voxels, and the calculation was done by repeatedly comparing the calculated and desired doses and adjusting the values of the beam map elements to minimize an objective function. In AITP, the iteration is performed voxel by voxel. For each voxel, the dose discrepancy was evaluated and the contributing pencil beams were updated. In ILSITP and SIITP, the iteration proceeded pencil beam by pencil beam instead of voxel by voxel. In all cases, the iteration procedure was repeated until the best possible dose distribution was achieved. The algorithms were applied to two examples and the results showed that the iterative techniques were able to produce superior isodose distributions.</jats:p>",

Sustainable development here became the front for an extension of corporate interest and private property. On the other hand, members of the local community drew on historically resilient symbols of collective identity, crofting, the Gaidhealtacht, and observance of the Sabbath, to claim an alternative discourse of sustainability. </jats:p>",

Much research draws upon and extends bodies of existing knowledge to gain better insights or to refine the accuracy of key parameters. Modern information-retrieval systems allow increasingly easy access to the findings of previous work. One of the bigger challenges today is to keep abreast of what is actually going on, and to extract insights from the existing body of knowledge where gaps still exist and the most fruitful research may be conducted. There are three broad approaches towards our existing body of knowledge, and the aim of this paper is to examine the usefulness of these alternatives and to pinpoint the types of circumstance where one may prove more helpful than the others. It places particular attention on work done which relates to the effects that transport has on the environment. </jats:p>",

We critically examine NPM in the context of recent public sector restructuring initiatives in the province of Ontario, Canada. Two NPM-inspired reform mechanisms employed by the Ontario government—the benchmarking of hospital-utilization indicators and the offloading of a greater share of patient-care responsibilities to the private sector—are examined as they impact on the economically disadvantaged city of Thunder Bay in the province's remote Northwestern region. We argue that the health reforms pursued by the Ontario government are focused on a one-dimensional notion of efficiency which denies important socioeconomic and health-service-environment dimensions that account for local differences in health-services utilization. Although this type of reform approach achieves short-term cost savings, we question whether the longer term effects on health and social services are efficient and equitable from a systemwide perspective. Ultimately, we question whether NPM will solve the problems inherent in publicly supported health and social services or will generate a new set of problems linked to the belief in the primacy of market mechanisms. </jats:p>",

Application of the Department of the Environment's existing methodological approach in conjunction with the SARs produces significant improvements in the explanatory power of the regression-based models. It is concluded that the SARs represent an invaluable source of data to supplement or replace the databases currently utilised in the standard spending assessment indices.

This has led to the need for a comprehensive set of quality assurance (QA) guidelines that can be applied to clinical treatment planning. This document is the report of Task Group 53 of the Radiation Therapy Committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. The purpose of this report is to guide and assist the clinical medical physicist in developing and implementing a comprehensive but viable program of quality assurance for modern radiotherapy treatment planning. The scope of the QA needs for treatment planning is quite broad, encompassing image‐based definition of patient anatomy, 3D beam descriptions for complex beams including multileaf collimator apertures, 3D dose calculation algorithms, and complex plan evaluation tools including dose volume histograms. The Task Group recommends an organizational framework for the task of creating a QA program which is individualized to the needs of each institution and addresses the issues of acceptance testing, commissioning the planning system and planning process, routine quality assurance, and ongoing QA of the planning process. This report, while not prescribing specific QA tests, provides the framework and guidance to allow radiation oncology physicists to design comprehensive and practical treatment planning QA programs for their clinics.</jats:p>",
