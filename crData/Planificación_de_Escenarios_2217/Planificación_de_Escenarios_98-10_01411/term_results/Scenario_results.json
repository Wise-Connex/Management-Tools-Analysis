In this model, the scale factor grows exponentially with time, while the scalar fields are time independent. A perturbation study is performed, and we establish the conditions for such a model to be stable or not. These stability conditions can have consequences either for the structure formation and for the graceful exit problems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> NIOSH researchers have been examining underground coal mining activities in order to evaluate work crew hazards. In 1994 a continuous mining machine operator was killed by falling roof during extended cut mining. Many aspects of the incident were used by NIOSH researchers to develop a scenario interview. The goal was to provide a realistic framework for acquiring frank and detailed insights. The interview consists of two sections. The first describes the underground mining conditions. The second recounts the fatal incident. Each section is supplemented by a diagram and a set of questions addressing relevant safety issues. The interview was administered at three mines that actively take extended cuts. Researchers found the scenario approach to be an effective interview tool as well as an effective hazard awareness and safe work practices training platform. </jats:p>",
