An integrative approach is one such framework that entails careful assessment of economic, social, and environmental impacts of tourism relative to other development strategies. This review takes a historical perspective of rural tourism planning progress. Core concepts of an integrative approach are collaborative planning with the affected stakeholders and the assessment of specific planning issues that foster integration of tourism with overall regional development. The application of more integrativeframeworks allows planners to improve the manner in which rural tourism development occurs. </jats:p>",

Image distortions and the efficacy of correction methods were evaluated in phantom, volunteer, and patient studies. From the measurement, analysis, and correction of machine‐related geometric distortions in MRI, it was concluded that MR image corrections are necessary in applications which require mm accuracy and that correction methods, based on 3D maps of static field inhomogeneity and gradient nonlinearity, are feasible in clinical practice. From the measurement and numerical analysis of object‐related geometric distortions, it was concluded that these distortions can be reduced to the order of the pixel size by imaging at 0.5 T and using gradients on the order of 3 <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8085-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8085:mp8085-math-0001\" /> Furthermore, in a study on volunteers, fast MRI scan techniques were used to measure the respiration induced kidney movement and in a study on patients with prostate cancer, the value of MRI for the evaluation of brachytherapy was demonstrated.

It focuses on the measures taken to solve these challenges in terms of planning, funding, hardware, software, database selection, installation, staff and user training, publicity, use policies and procedures, document non‐availability and evaluation. The paper concludes that the implementation of CD‐ROM in developing countries will continue growing, and that users will increasingly become more sophisticated and will keep demanding better CD‐ROM resources and services. In order to cope with these demands, institutions involved in implementing CD‐ROM services will continue pursuing the current trend of adopting resourceful, creative and innovative approaches in tackling the challenges posed by the implementation of CD‐ROM. Finally the paper recommends, among other things, that it is crucial to develop a new vision based on a thorough needs assessment to guide library information systems in planning, implementing and developing user‐oriented CD‐ROM. It is also strongly recommended that a partnership approach between library information systems and relevant departments (like information technology departments), funding organisations, CD‐ROM publishers and vendors is crucial for developing sustainable CD‐ROM services.</jats:p>",

This paper describes such a formulation and addresses the computational challenge of solving it. The problem is to determine the cost-efficient level of habitat protection that satisfies a viability constraint for a sensitive wildlife population. The viability constraint requires a high probability of attaining a population size target. Because of the complexity of wildlife prediction models, population survival probabilities under alternative protection plans must be estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. The computational challenge arises from the conflicting effects of sample size: fewer replications used to estimate survival probability increases the speed of the search algorithm but reduces the precision of the estimator of the optimal protection plan. Importance sampling is demonstrated as a simulation technique for reducing estimator variance for a given sample size, particularly when the tail of the population distribution is of critical importance. The method is demonstrated on a hypothetical problem involving gray wolf management in the Great Lakes region of the United States. In comparison to random sampling, importance sampling produces a 21-fold reduction in the variance of the estimator of the minimum-cost protection plan. Results from the optimization model demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the minimum-cost protection plan to the structure of the growth model and the magnitude of environmental variation. This sensitivity is not widely recognized in the literature on wildlife habitat planning and is a strong reason for using optimization methods that can handle stochastic population models with a wide range of structures.

Incorporates the risk of incorrect rejection of the account balance into a theoretical risk model and investigates the relationship between the risks of incorrect acceptance and incorrect rejection using the power function of the test. Concludes that, first, the ability of an audit test to identify the magnitude of the error in the population, and especially its ability to identify material error reliably, is very important and, second, planning of effective audit testing should be undertaken, rather than relying on the extension of testing when results fail to meet expectations.</jats:p>",

To improve accuracy and to prepare new workers in this field, quantitative and mechanics-based approaches will be required. In this paper, a kinematic analysis to determine the bending and in-plane strain distributions of compound-curved shells with reference to the flat plates and to the roller-bent shell plates is presented. These strains are important parameters for forming processes. The approach employed is in accord with the currently used sequential process of roller bending and line heating. In addition, it utilizes offset data provided with flat plates. Numerical solutions are presented with real data. The distribution of strains will aid shipyard experts in determining the forming parameters, such as rolling direction, radius, heating power, path, and related issues.

Some recent contributions have begun to criticise the approach, calling instead for the development of a more ambitious research agenda which illuminates the nature and role of all services, whether they are producer or consumer oriented, and supplied to manufacturers, to other service organisations, or to the general public. In this paper I contend that the analysis of manufacturing—service linkages remains a valid focus of study, but argue that future research needs to be accompanied by a philosophical change. A realist conceptual framework for the analysis of manufacturing—service linkages is developed which, it is suggested, improves significantly on the positivist and Marxist approaches hitherto employed. I conclude with an assessment of the main strengths and weaknesses of the realist approach and a brief consideration of its wider potential for research involving services. </jats:p>",

The use of these images are part of what Goldman calls the economy of ‘commodity signs’, where produced meanings are linked to commodities through the medium of the print or broadcast advertisement. The increased incorporation of global images in Western advertising presents an opportunity to analyze the ideological underpinning of the ‘new global economy’. The sheer volume of purchased advertising space places these often confusing images before our eyes at an increasing pace, producing meanings which tend to obfuscate and fetishize discourse related to globalism. A decoding of specific advertisements with the use of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation as a case study, juxtaposed against the real spatial practices of the company will reveal ruptures, contradictions, and incoherence in advertising messages which appropriate the symbolic power of global images. </jats:p>",

The major transformations in structure that have taken place in the health care industry throughout the 1980s call for more proactive and strategic approaches to planning and managing if health care organizations are to be successful in today's highly competitive environment.</jats:p>",

In this paper I argue that the development of a critical geopolitical imagination can help to illuminate issues of inside and outside, the transgression of borders, and the subversion of sovereignties, and that these issues are vital to our global understanding of democracy, justice, and ethics. I consider three interrelated questions. First, I emphasize the importance of situating the discussion of justice, equality, and power in a context which is not only transnational but in which a consideration of the geopolitics of power over other non-Western societies is also in the foreground. Second, I examine critically those treatments of ethics and politics that tend to isolate the national from the international, especially when the West is represented as a self-contained entity. Third, in the context of recent discussions on politics and the postmodern, I explore aspects of the ethics of difference and intersubjectivity. This is done against a general background of West–non-West relations, and the impact of geopolitical encounters. </jats:p>",

Most accounts of the content and implementation of the resulting immigration policies, particularly until the demise of the White Australia policy in 1972, have emphasised their racism. The ideal immigrant under these policies, however, was not merely of particular birthplace and ethnicity, but also had specified gender and age characteristics. The author proposes that selection of immigrant settlers in Australia since World War 2 has been gendered as well as racialised, often combining particular sexisms with particular racisms and specifying the ways that ethnicity and gender should coexist in immigrants of different age groups. She notes implications for immigrants once in Australia (especially women) of the category under which they have entered the country. And she suggests that a new phase relating immigration to redefinition of the Australian nation, in which the temporary migration of skilled workers is preferred to their permanent migration, may be beginning; a phase whose modes of regulation and outcomes are as distinctively gendered as were those of their predecessors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents theoretical and practical arguments for a new direction in task-based, computer documentation. It ar gues that common tasks that we document for users have grown in complexity to include many stages where decisions affect the outcome. The term \"complex problem\" is used to describe this scenario, in that users struggle to understand the obstacles to completion of a task, and the criteria for success at each stage.The design of information for \"complex problems\" is seen as needing to include Problem Analysis as a parallel activity to Task Analysis. This analysis can be used to highlight tasks for special attention in the information outline, when they are \"seen\" by the users as containing major challenges or problems. A definition of users in this context is also argued to confound the traditional view of audience analysis, in that so many different audiences use the same technology and encounter the same problems with many products. The biggest problem occurs when people learn to cope with particular technology in a superficial way, and then fail to transfer this knowledge to upgrades or new technology.The shift in documentation strategy recommended by this paper is summarized as adopting a \"problem focus\" by integrating the planning of tasks that involve complex problems in the stream of task steps. This involves the integration of the related tasks into the flow required for the whole solution. These arguments are developed in the Introduction and Background sections, and elements of the \"problem-focused\" style of information are demonstrated through examples from jobs I have had in areas that involve complex problems. Finally, the recommendations for this new approach are summarized in the Conclusion.</jats:p>",

In this paper four levels of geographical resolution in England and Wales are considered, between the most detailed census geography and individual property locations, and the potential for the creation of hybrid georeferences by the combination of existing data products is explored. With examples from a study area in Cardiff, South Wales, the interrelationship of the major data products is explored, with reference to basic household counts and incidence data. On the basis of these experiments, the use of hybrid georeferencing systems is reconsidered, highlighting potential applications as well as problems of data standards, confidentiality, and comparability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The adaptation of urban spaces to cope with increased automobile traffic has been called the ‘building of automobile cities’. This is a vague and otherwise politically naive interpretation of these important changes in capitalist societies. Cars do not run on their own and one has to ask who is behind the wheels, and for what purposes. I argue that these spatial transformations are definite economic and political undertakings related to capitalist modernization processes, in which the middle classes, as preferential partners of ruling classes, play the most important role. In these contexts, the automobile turns out to be an essential means for the reproduction of the middle classes in their pursuit of social mobility. Therefore I argue that these large transformations should instead be seen as the ‘building of middle-class cities’. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper is about how São Paulo was transformed into a middle-class city. In it I emphasize the period from 1960 to 1980, when the city population increased from 3.6 million to 8.5 million, and 1.6 million new automobiles were put into circulation. In this period Brazil experienced a highly dynamic capitalist modernization process, with high rates of GNP growth, under authoritarian (and often repressive) political rule. New middle-class sectors were generated, supported by the concentration of income and by their ideological commitment to the new regime. The city space was physically transformed to allow for a new pattern of circulation which was directly related to the new economic activities and the new lifestyle of these middle-class sectors, for whom the automobile became a vital means of social reproduction. The middle classes were represented, inside the state, by transportation planners who promoted the ideology of modernization. The space was then reshaped in a way which favored the circulation needs of the middle class population, in its prime role of driver, rather than the needs of the majority of the population, in their primary roles of pedestrian and captive public transportation user. Moreover, the mobility and fluidity needs of these selected middle-class sectors were pursued regardless of the safety and environmental consequences of the new circulation pattern. </jats:p><jats:p> Similar processes can be identified in the developing world where other middle-class cities have been created. In spite of social and political differences, these processes share the objective of readapting space to ease the circulation of the social sectors which are relevant to economic accumulation and political legitimation. </jats:p>",

In support of the RAP process, Environment Canada, through the Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy, and the City of Scarborough, commissioned Ryerson Polytechnic University to develop a generic planning strategy for stormwater quality management in urbanized areas. The generic planning strategy comprises five steps: (1) identification of ecosystem and economic goals and objectives; (2) identification of feasible retrofit stormwater management practices (RSWMPs); (3) formulation of alternative stormwater quality management strategies in accordance with a preferred hierarchy of RSWMPs; (4) evaluation of alternative strategies with respect to cost-effectiveness; and (5) selection of a stormwater quality management strategy. To demonstrate the application of the generic planning strategy, a stormwater quality management plan was developed for the Centennial Subwatershed (730 hectares) in the City of Scarborough, which is fully urbanized. Using the generic planning strategy, the recommended stormwater quality plan assumes (1) all the roads in poor condition will be retrofitted with stormwater exfiltration systems as they are reconstructed or rehabilitated; (2) an existing quantity pond will be retrofitted with a water quality function; (3) a new water quality pond will be constructed on a government-owned site; (4) 50% of the feasible residential areas will have downspouts disconnected; and (5) all the roads in the feasible commercial areas will be retrofitted with oil/grit separators. The average annual runoff volume reduction and solids loading reduction of this strategy were estimated to be about 9 and 30%, respectively, and the associated cost was about $1.2 million.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to develop and test a theoretical model for the explanation of moving plans among elderly persons. This model of moving behaviour of the elderly is more or less similar to the ‘residential satisfaction model of relocation’, developed by Speare, and consists of three sets of variables: (1) background characteristics (personal characteristics, discrepancies with regard to several housing and neighbourhood characteristics, and social bonds); (2) level of housing and neighbourhood dissatisfaction; and (3) moving plans. The main feature of this model is the intervening role of the two dissatisfaction variables: it is assumed that the background characteristics influence the levels of housing and/or neighbourhood dissatisfaction, which in turn affect the moving plans. </jats:p><jats:p> In order to test this model, covariance structure analysis is utilized among a sample of elderly residents in two districts of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Although the results support the residential mobility model to a large extent—the levels of housing and neighbourhood dissatisfaction act mostly as intervening variables—some unexpected findings emerge. In addition, the percentage of unexplained variance in moving plans is relatively large. For this reason, a number of suggestions are given to extend the theoretical model towards a better explanation of moving plans of elderly persons. One of these suggestions, that is, including the appropriateness of the dwelling in the near future as an intervening variable, is tested. It is shown that this factor plays an important intervening role, which implies that the elderly do not consider to move only because they are dissatisfied with their living conditions at the moment, but that those who expect their house to be inappropriate in the short term are more inclined to move. Therefore, in future research on the moving behaviour of the elderly it is necessary to take this anticipatory behaviour into account. </jats:p>",

We critically analyse Canada's foreign domestic worker programmes, noting the shifting definitions of which nationalities should participate. We note how gendered, racialised, and classed constructions of national identities infuse these programmes. We then turn to an empirical analysis of how foreign domestic workers are constructed in Toronto, where demand is the highest in Canada. In particular, we investigate how the practices of domestic worker placement agencies reinforce images about which national identities supposedly have qualities that make them best suited to certain types of domestic work. Finally, we explore how domestic workers' constructions of their occupation are interwoven with their own national identities, the (partial) internalisation of others' images of them, and how they define themselves in relation to other domestic workers. </jats:p>",

This research is focused on the skills necessary for effective negotiation planning. It is argued that the information processing tendencies of high self-monitors make them particularly adept at planning for negotiations. The authors extend existing work in planning by relating self-monitoring to plan generation, plan enactment, and plan consequences. Results indicate that self-monitoring is related to prenegotiation goal commitment, planning of impression management strategies, planning of integrative tactics, and plan complexity. During negotiations, high self-monitors are more likely to engage in argumentation. However, they are not especially inclined to engage in more information seeking or rapport building. High self-monitors are better able to accomplish negotiation goals, and this appears to be the result of their superior planning skills. Results have implications for plan-based theorizing and for practicing negotiators. </jats:p>",

I attempt to reconstruct the urbanization process as simultaneously a political-economic and ecological process. This will be discussed through the exploration of the history of the urbanization of water in Guayaquil, Ecuador. As approximately 36% of its two million inhabitants has no access to piped potable water, water becomes subject to an intense social struggle for control and/or access. Mechanisms of exclusion from and access to water, particularly in cities which have a problematic water-supply condition, lay bare how both the transformation of nature and the urbanization process are organized in and through mechanisms of social power. In order to unravel the relations of power that are inscribed in the way the urbanization of nature unfolded I document and analyze the historical geography of water control in the context of the political ecology of Guayaquil's urbanization. In short, Guayaquil's urbanization process is written from the perspective of the drive to urbanize and domesticate nature's water and the parallel necessity to push the ecological frontier outward as the city expands. I show how this political ecology of urbanization takes place through deeply exclusive and marginalizing processes that structure relations of access to and exclusion from access to nature's water. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We are concerned with making sense of the car-boot sale as an empirical and theoretical phenomenon. The paper is based on participant-observation field research, in-depth interviews, and site surveys and we start by challenging two of the most commonly held myths about car-boot sales; that these events arc all about ‘shady rogues’ disposing of volumes of dodgy gear onto an unsuspecting public, and that a preponderance of cheap goods means that car-boot sales are dominated by ‘tatt’ and disadvantaged sectors of society. Having examined patterns of purchasing within the car-boot sale, we consider how car-boot-sale goers themselves construct and participate within the space of the boot sale. At one level, this construction is shown to involve the use both of accumulated and of local knowledge and to be open to interpretation as illustrative of competitive individualism, Another reading of the car-boot sale, however, and one central to understanding the enduring popularity of this phenomenon, is its transgressive nature. The space of the car-boot sale is argued to be one where people come to play, where the conventions of retailing are suspended, and where participants come to engage in and produce theatre, performance, spectacle, and laughter. We go on to examine the connections between the car-boot sale and the Bakhtinian notion of carnival, arguing that the car-boot sale needs to be read in multifarious ways: as a liminal space which encapsulates the carnivalesque, the festive, and the popular, which subverts convention and yet which, through its celebration of the free market and the unshackled individual, embraces facets of the dominant order. We then move on to comment on the broader significance of the car-boot-sale phenomenon for studies of consumption. </jats:p>",

Subjects were required to plan a fluent solution to a range of 5-disc TOL puzzles and then execute their formulated plans as fast as possible. The number of errors and the times taken to prepare the most efficient solutions increased monotonically with the number of chunks of subgoal moves. A subgoal move is a move that is essential for the solution of the puzzle, but which does not place a disc into its goal position. A subgoal chunk is a consecutive series of subgoal moves that all transfer discs to and from the same pegs. Furthermore, preparation time was found to be sensitive to a manipulation that increased the number of competing alternative choices, at critical steps in move selection. When subjects planned their action sequences “on-line”, analyses of individual moves and individual move latencies suggested that planning TOL solutions was limited by the difficulty in evaluating and selecting one action (or one subgoal chunk) from the set of competing potential actions at each step in the course of problem solving. </jats:p>",

Modification of a simple spatial model of TB to include the effects of recurring social, political, economic, and other catastrophes shows that a sudden increase in the rate of such factors can markedly and synergistically lower the threshold area density of susceptible population needed for transmission of the disease from an epicenter into surrounding regions, triggering a sudden outbreak of disease from previously endemic or declining epicenters. Detailed application is made to New York City, where a recurrent process of fire, housing abandonment, and forced population displacement affecting poor minority communities threatens to spread multiple drug-resistant strains of the disease throughout a twenty-four-county metropolitan region containing nearly twenty million people.

In particular, we tested the ability of subjects to predict different hand-held loads by examining grip force adjustments used to stabilize the load in the hand during arm movements.</jats:p><jats:p>Subjects grasped a manipulandum using a precision grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger on either side. The grip force (normal to the contact surfaces) and the load force (tangential to the surfaces) were measured, along with the trajectory of the hand. The manipulandum was attached to two servo-controlled linear motors used to create inertial and viscous loads as well as a composite load, including inertial, viscous, and elastic components.</jats:p><jats:p>The form of the hand trajectory was independent of load for some subjects but varied systematically across load conditions in others. Nevertheless, under all load conditions and in all subjects, grip force was modulated in parallel with, and thus anticipated, fluctuations in load force despite the marked variation in the form of the load function. This indicates that the CNS is able to predict the load force and the kinematics of hand movement on which the load depends. We suggest this prediction is based on an internal model of the motor apparatus and external load and is used to determine the grip forces required to stabilize the load.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most important provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act precludes the “taking” of listed species on both public and private land. In past Endangered Species Act litigation, take has been broadly interpreted to include the destruction or modification of habitats as well as the direct killing of animals. This requirement created an extensive burden on private landowners to provide habitats for listed species. This burden was substantially lessened when the ESA was modified in 1982 to allow incidental takings conditioned on preparation of a satisfactory “habitat conservation plan.” Because the majority of listed species are imperiled due to habitat modification, most habitat conservation plans must demonstrate defensible methods to mitigate against incidental habitat loss. A review of HCPs for the Northern Spotted Owl ( Strix occidentalis), and other species, indicates that mitigation solutions are often arbitrary, lacking an empirical foundation in the species’ life history requirements. Based on data from the Spotted Owl, we illustrate a biologically based method for estimating the areal requirements necessary to mitigate against the take of essential habitats. Toward this goal we adopt the concept of “core area,” that portion of an animal’s home range that receives disproportionate use. We estimated core areas by means of the adaptive kernel density function and tested against a null distribution of animal use that assumes a bivariate, uniform distribution of locations within the home range. The method we illustrate, which is defensible, repeatable, and empirical, is a clear improvement over the ad hoc methods used in many habitat conservation plans. Further, the methods we propose should be applicable to a large number of terrestrial species for which home range is a meaningful concept.</jats:p>",
