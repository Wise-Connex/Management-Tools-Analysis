Such planning requires an understanding of the problems which can result from the presence of hydrogen sulfide, selection of equipment suitable for use in H2S environments, and training of personnel to work safely around hydrogen sulfide. Through proper planning, problems associated with drilling in planning, problems associated with drilling in areas encountering hydrogen sulfide can be minimized.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper covers several areas of additional planning required for H2S wells which differ from planning required for H2S wells which differ from requirements for non-H2S wells.

Drilling in planning important for all wells. Drilling in formations containing hydrogen sulfide requires even more planning to overcome problems associated with this poisonous gas.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A colorless gas with a specific gravity of 1.192, hydrogen sulfide is extremely toxic, is corrosive, and causes sulfide stress cracking (SSC) in many of the high strength steels commonly used in drilling operations. At low concentrations it has an odor comparable to rotten eggs; at higher concentrations an odor may not be detected because the sense of smell may be deadened. The high specific gravity of H2S causes it to settle and accumulate in low lying areas. These properties make hydrogen sulfide an extremely hazardous material and emphasize the need for careful planning in drilling H2S bearing formations. Areas in which additional planning is required include personnel safety, drilling fluids, tubular goods, blowout preventers, wellhead equipment, and general H2S preventers, wellhead equipment, and general H2S well planning considerations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>PERSONNEL SAFETY PERSONNEL SAFETY Personnel safety is the prime consideration when planning a hydrogen sulfide well. Table 1 presents a summary of physical effects of various presents a summary of physical effects of various concentrations of hydrogen sulfide. In low concentrations, H2S causes eye irritation, headaches, nausea and other symptoms. Concentrations in the range of 500–700 ppm can cause death. On an 8-hour time weighted average basis, the maximum acceptable exposure concentration is 20 ppm.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Providing breathing equipment and training personnel in its use and maintenance is an personnel in its use and maintenance is an important segment of well planning.

Particular attention is given to the dynamic reallocation of resources over the duration of projects as information about actual activity times becomes known. The effect of resource allocations on an activity is represented, by modifications in the probability function of the time to process that activity. Analytic procedures such as dynamic programming and distribution analysis, which might lead to optimal dynamic decision rules, are shown to be computationally intractable even for very small problems. For a set of project networks of relatively simple structure, the efficacy of several heuristic decision rules is tested via simulation.

The first part describes the space of the influencing relations between agglomerations, and in the second part the indeterminate dominance relations are analysed. A central-place hierarchy exists if and only if the dominance-relations space can be partitioned into like classes. The author develops several theorems on fuzzy Φ-graphs. The model is operational.

This framework is represented by a general model which balances innovative and aggressive behavior, common to small firms, against the ability to bear the cost and risk of innovation adoption more common to large firms. A similar model for city-size diffusion patterns, based on the fact that large cities are risk-minimizing locations, contrasts with traditional hierarchical models which assume that large cities are usually the sites of first adoption. Examples of two innovations in the American banking industry were analyzed to test the models. The results suggest that traditional strict size-ordered models for firms and urban systems are not always appropriate, especially for innovations by firms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The systems approach to strategic planning has been gaining popularity in recent years but it seems that little has been done to develop the techniques required for implementing this approach. This is particularly the case in the problem identification phase of strategic planning. The systems approach requires that one identify all problems and study their relationships before solving any one problem, but little has been said about how to identify the complex set of problems to be dealt with in a planning process. In this article we argue that the problems to be dealt with in strategic planning are produced by groups of people who either can affect or are affected by the output of an organization. From this it follows that problem identification consists of identifying these groups and their possible actions and ranking the most important groups and their most probable actions so that a study of the effects of these actions can be undertaken. This paper describes a method used at a consumer goods manufacturer to help identify important groups, rank their probable actions and arrive at a list of the most important group-action pair for that company. These group-action pairs then become the problems and opportunities to be dealt with in strategic planning. </jats:p>",

We develop a stochastic linear programming model that is computationally feasible for a firm's financial planning over several periods with all three types of uncertainty when there is a rich structure over the set of possible asset choices. The models' solution is facilitated using a recent novel algorithm for finitely distributed simple recourse SLPR problems developed by Wets and coded by Collins, Kallberg and Kusy.

The model output is an account call frequency schedule which maximizes anticipated sales or profit subject to limited time available. </jats:p><jats:p> Four passenger and one cargo sales representative utilized the model in each city.

After six months the average CALLPLAN salesperson had 8.1% higher sales than his matched counterpart (t = 2.42, 9 degrees of freedom). The probability that such a large increase could occur by chance is less than 2.5%. Combining both judgemental and objective data with a mathematical program resulted in behavioral changes which significantly improved sales performance. </jats:p>",
