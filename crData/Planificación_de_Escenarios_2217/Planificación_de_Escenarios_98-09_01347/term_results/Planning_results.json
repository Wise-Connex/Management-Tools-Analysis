      "abstract": "<jats:p> Historical changes in planning and its theory in the last century show planners and theorists turning away from the physical plan and its image of the city in favor of analytical modes of planning in the 1960s and 1970s and of discursive modes since the 1980s. In this article, I analyze those changes in the context of another historical change that has affected planning: the shift from government to governance. Until recently, urban planning was seen as state control over cities by governing institutions. As cities and governments experienced successive crises since the 1960s, planning underwent changes that enabled cities to administer their fortunes better. Planners invented new methods and institutions that brought in new actors. Planning was no longer government acting on the city. Now it is governance acting through the city. The role of planning and the use of images and plans in precipitating this move is explored. Three questions are posed. Why have images and plans, historically important carriers of planning knowledge and tools for urban change, gotten the short stick in current theories? What does this neglect have to do with the current state of theory? Is this neglect related to the epistemological split between knowledge and action? </jats:p>",

Changes during the last five years mean that planning school graduates are likely to face an increasingly competitive jobs market. In this article, I review trends facing the planning profession and explore how U.K. planning schools are responding to the challenge of promoting in students both the traditional academic skills and a much greater knowledge of practice. The European and U.K. government policy toward planning is reviewed, and the Network in Town Planning is discussed as a vehicle for exploring stakeholder interest in the educational process. I then propose the need to develop the concept of vocational learning. </jats:p>",

The future of the future, however, deserves more attention in urban planning. Utopian constructs have largely been abandoned and traditional methods of projection and modeling are poor techniques for anticipating qualitative and nonlinear change. An exploration of cyberpunk writings, a genre of science fiction, offers the opportunity to critically examine and assess the hegemonic model of the information society as well as more dystopian pictures of how evolving social, economic, cultural, and technological patterns could combine in the next century. Attending to the urban dimensions of these fictional works and discourses about them can contribute to more realistic and ethical planning scenarios of the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Improving the qualities of places is attracting increasing policy and academic interest in contemporary Europe. This raises questions about the appropriate governance capacity to deliver such improvements. I argue that a key element of such capacity lies in the quality of local policy cultures. Some are well integrated, well connected, and well informed, and can mobilise readily to act to capture opportunities and enhance local conditions. Others are fragmented, lack the connections to sources of power and knowledge, and the mobilisation capacity, to organise to make a difference. In recent years, the emphasis in attempts to change urban governance capacity, particularly in Britain, has been on encouraging catalytic projects and partnerships. Recent experience across Europe suggests that wider transformative effects are difficult to achieve without careful consideration of the partnership form and how it connects to the wider policy culture. They may also have the effect of increasing the fragmentation of local capacity. I examine the potential of collaborative approaches in place-making initiatives in achieving more effective and durable transformations. Collaborative approaches emphasise the importance of building new policy discourses about the qualities of places, developing collaboration among stakeholders in policy development as well as delivery, widening stakeholder involvement beyond traditional power elites, recognising different forms of local knowledge, and building rich social networks as a resource of institutional capital through which new initiatives can be taken rapidly and legitimately. They shift the task of urban planning from ‘building places’ to fostering the institutional capacity in territorial political communities for ongoing ‘place-making’ activities. </jats:p>",

I am interested in communlcative action as a normative basis for participatory decision making of public policy matters. Empirically, however, differences of discourses have led to participants talking past each other rather than negotiating with each other. Using a case study from Perth, Western Australia, I demonstrate the idea of procedural justice and examine the reasons for participants' dissatisfaction with public participation processes. I then develop some tentative principles for a more procedurally just communicative planning practice. </jats:p>",

Complete and correct information is crucial in many situations where the success or failure of an operation depends of the quality of information. When the unexpected or unknown occurs, conditional planning, execution monitoring, or situated planning can help system to recover and get back on the right track. This paper shows how incomplete and incorrect information problems can be solved using conditional planning, execution monitoring and situated planning agents - intelligent knowledge-based software agents.</jats:p>",

I use concepts of social performance to frame issues of culture and power that have received limited attention in earlier planning research. Drawing on three brief ethnographic accounts of a public interaction or “speech occasion,” I extend Forester's call for planners and policy professionals to understand and respond to the diverse communication styles and subtle power relations that shape public life. Informed responses are critical if planners aim to learn and get results while meaningfully involving various “publics” or stakeholders in decisions. Without such competence, many efforts to deliberate to “do” democracy in a diverse society will struggle along at needlessly high levels of confusion, distrust, and even resentment. </jats:p>",

If the most suitable plan is selected after all solutions are found, it will be very time consuming and unrealistic. Motivated by the success of genetic algorithms (GAs) in solving combinatorial and complex problems by examining a small number of possible candidate solutions, GAs are employed to find a near-optimal assembly plan for a general environment. Five genetic operators are used: tree crossover, tree mutation, cut-and-paste, break-and-joint, and reproduction. The fitness function can adapt to different criteria easily. This assembly planner can help an inexperienced technician to find a good solution efficiently. The algorithm has been fully implemented. One example product is given to show the applications and results.</jats:p>",

We know homelessness affects a diverse population. We also know that, in addition to needing shelter, homeless persons draw on a variety of social services. For various reasons, however, the matching of services and shelter problems to individual characteristics is often ad hoc. This is a mounting concern as the pool of homeless persons diversifies even further. Based on a unique survey of the homeless population in Orange County, California, we employ a carefully constructed behavioral framework to link individual and structural circumstances to preferences for aid. We find that though the sample is diverse, financial problems dominate while medical problems, substance abuse, and financial needs are often unrelated. Further, these patterns do not generally vary by race and only rarely by gender. The results inform not only the targeting strategy of the community planning process, but also our broader understanding of poverty-related housing and public service demands outside the inner-city. </jats:p>",

After three centuries (from 1523 to 1814) of domination over Norway, Denmark, which had been involved in the Napoleonic Wars on the side of Great Britain, was obliged by Bernadotte to abandon this domination and give way to Sweden (the Treaty of Kiel, 1814). Denmark had, however, tried a last-minute manoeuvre to avoid this loss of sovereignty, and granted Norway an extremely liberal constitution, called the ‘Eidsvold constitution’ and a parliament, the storting.

But, whatever the topic or approach, in every case the lesson of our analysis and research was the same: social relationships lie behind language relationships, and the linguistic phenomena we have described are the evidence for this. We are now going to leave the battlefield, the in vivo management of multilingualism and the relationships between languages to turn to the in vitro management of these problems, that is, the direct and deliberate intervention by those with political power into the domain of language.</jats:p>",

The main bore would be sidetracked only in the event of irretrievable fish, collapsed casing, depleted reservoir, etc. In recent years however, the re-entry drilling has become an increasingly popular option for production optimization as a result of advanced developments in the milling, drilling and measurement tools and technology.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the important aspects of re-entry drilling is to mill a window in the existing casing and sidetrack the well bore. Past experience shows that inadequate planning for a window milling project has resulted in either an aborted attempt or premature failure in the hole.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to achieve a successful window milling operation, the following ten (10) points must be addressed and situations resolved prior to commencing with the casing exit operation; (1) Selection of best place to set and to orient the whip-stock, (2) Hole angle, (3) Radius of curvature (build, drop, left or right tum) in the vicinity of casing exit, (4) Whip face orientation methods (MWD, gyros), (5) Flexure characteristics of the bottom hole assembly and resulting dogleg severity, (6) Length of sidetracking assembly, (7) Depth of rat hole to facilitate drilling objective (short, medium or long radius) after milling window, (8) Casing conditions, (9) Formation types, and (10) Retrievability of whip-stock assembly.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will discuss the above points in detail using data from actual field runs.

In 1994, a gas exploration well, Makarem, was sidetracked past a bottomhole assembly, which had become stuck almost 1,000m off bottom. A kick was subsequently taken, indicating charging of shallower horizons from a deep, sour, high-pressure gas reservoir at potentially high rates. Attempts to reenter the original wellbore while drilling ahead in the sidetrack hole were unsuccessful. The well was re-entered in 1997 with the objective of isolating the flowing zone to prevent potential environmental impact, future drilling problems, and the loss of hydrocarbon reserves resulting from uncontrolled flow of gas in the subsurface. This case history reviews planning and execution of a deep horning-in operation to locate and re-enter the 12 1/4\" open hole below the bit of the stuck assembly, 3680m below surface. Key issues addressed during the planning phase included relief well strategy, positional uncertainty, well control scenarios, options for isolation and contingencies. An active electro-magnetic ranging technique was employed to successfully locate and track the target assembly to an eventual direct intersection with the crossflowing hole. Execution of the intersection plan is detailed, with emphasis on horning-in on the fish, borehole surveying techniques and quality assurance. Also covered is the operational organisation, and details of the activities following intersection, which included stabilisation, cleanout and abandonment of almost 1,000m of borehole which had been inaccessible for over 3 years.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 367</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The subject is presented in the context of experience primarily gained during a major organisational change that was brought about in a large Australian industrial company. A process linking management training and involvement, activity based costing, economic value added analysis, market participation analysis, market positioning choice and organisational structure is discussed. The scope of this paper encompasses planning processes used in commercial organisations. Three very important questions arise. How can directors and managers gain access to accurate, non‐judgemental, non‐institutionally biased information so that sound, value creating, strategic decisions can be made? How can directors and managers ensure that the design of the company’s structure, activity system and processes will enable and support their chosen strategic direction? How can directors and managers overcome the “institutional imperative” and bring about the structural changes required for effective strategy implementation? The author proposes that a business planning process known as value creating management (VCM) offers effective answers to the above questions.</jats:p>",

This information in turn can be used in various engineering analysis applications, such as kinematics analysis or automatic tolerance chain generation for tolerance analysis. In this paper, application of mating conditions in an assembly sequence-planning task is investigated. The proposed approach mainly engages the mating information represented in the CAD assembly model to automatically generate sequence plans based on the minimization of the number of assembly directions.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study were to: ascertain reliability of the scale and confirm, through factor analysis, that satisfaction with the FP service was based on interpersonal and organisational dimensions. The sample comprised 199 black adult interviewees (158 women and 41 men), who had previously used or were currently using contraception, from an informal settlement in Gauteng, South Africa. Three items were removed from the scale due to unacceptable communality estimates. The reliability coefficient of 0.76 for the 17-item scale was satisfactory. The principal components analysis, with orthogonal and oblique rotations, extracted two factors; accounting for 51.8% of the variance. The highest loadings on Factor I involved an interpersonal dimension (friendly, encouraging, competent, informative and communicative). Factor II tended to focus on the organisational elements of the system, such as different methods, choice of methods, service availability and length of waiting time. It was concluded that this scale was a reliable, easily administered and scored measure of satisfaction, with underlying interpersonal and organisational dimensions.</jats:p>"

Up to the present time, a method which guarantees conservative motion for a redundant manipulator tracing an arbitrary trajectory has not been presented. Moreover, the implementation of any conservative motion trajectory planning in discrete time domain has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, a trajectory planning method which guarantees conservative motion and preserves minimum norm of joint rates for a redundant manipulator tracing a closed-loop trajectory is presented. This method includes two intermediate via points in each incremental movement so that the manipulator can precisely pass through, with constant joint accelerations, all incremental positions with minimum jerks. The tracking errors exist only at the via points but not at the incremental points. Thus, conservative motion is ensured. The overall tracking errors can be reduced by simply selecting a smaller increment. The presented method is simulated with a three-linked, planar redundant manipulator and the results are discussed.</jats:p>",

The assembly design agent consists of three modules: the assembly sequence planning module, the assembly resource planning module, and the assembly simulation module. The assembly sequence-planning module takes the design information and generates an assembly sequence. This sequence is structured in a tree form, called the Constructive Assembly Tree (CAT). The leaf nodes of the tree correspond to the components of the product. The intermediate nodes are the assembly process operators, each of which characterizes a particular assembly operation, and their associated subassemblies. The resource module assigns the necessary tools, fixtures, supply bins and other resources to each of the process operators. The assembly simulation module traverses a CAT, extracts the necessary assembly information, and drives external physical simulation/animation system to perform virtual assembly simulation/animation process.</jats:p>",

This encouraged the field operator Phillips China Inc and its partners China Offshore Oil Nanhai East Corp and Pecten Orient Oil Co. in South China Sea to apply this technology to develop a marginal field named XJ 24-1 which is located about 8 km from an existing platform – XJ 24-3. The XJ 24-1 field was discovered in late 1985. Attempts have been made to jointly develop it with existing fields by either unmanned satellite platform or subsea completion but these concepts were uneconomical due to the size of the field. The feasibility of the project was questionable from inception since the XJ 24-3-A14 well was a unique operation and limited resources were available in South East Asia. Through the team's dedication and perseverance, this project was completed on time and below budget and even exceeded some forecasts on reaching targets. This well was drilled and completed by June 10, 1997 in a total of 101 days reaching a TD at 9,238 m MD with 8,063 m of horizontal displacement.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>World records set on this well were: Longest horizontal displacement (8,063 m)Deepest real time transmission of the MWD/LWD data (9,106m)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A series of new technologies specifically developed for extended reach wells have been successfully applied on this well.

The Voronoi tree is similar to the Voronoi diagram in that it is maximally distant from all objects in the robot’s environment, but the Voronoi tree is developed for cavities modeled by splines. By adding a potential field to the robot manipulator, a robot path can be found by seeking the manipulator position with the minimum value of the potential function. This position as defined by the potential field is also maximally distant from cavity walls. Results with the potential field method are discussed and conclusions are drawn.</jats:p>",

There was a few months of low Btu gas injection, followed by ten years with high Btu gas injection. A gas sweeping was achieved in 1986 to convert the reservoir to a low Btu value gas storage. The cushion gas is therefore a mixture of low and high Btu value gases. The average Btu value during withdrawal periods since 1986 is occasionally very close to the maximum allowed value, potentially raising operational difficulties. For the next ten years, additional wells and surface facilities will be gradually added to increase the working gas and the peak flow rate capacities. This paper describes how a history matching of gas Btu content is performed for the first time using a full field in-house reservoir simulator. In fact, a model was matched the conventional way, then the detailed Btu value history was added. The results of the model in terms of energy and nitrogen content during withdrawal periods have accurately reproduced the actual behavior of the gas storage. This confirms as correct the previous history matching of the reservoir pressure and saturation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>By calculating the evolution of Btu values within the storage, the model proves very efficient in assisting the engineer to define the best strategy for injection and withdrawal periods in order to meet the customers required gas Btu value. Therefore emissibility problems can be avoided by choosing the most suitable wells.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>It has been possible to optimize inert gas injection planning by evaluating, under various operational scenarios, the influence of gas mixing on the withdrawn gas Btu values.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 563</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Precedence relations among machining operations are systematically generated based on geometric information, tolerance specifications, and machining expertise. The feature recognition method using Alternating Sum of Volumes With Partitioning (ASVP) Decomposition is applied to obtain a Form Feature Decomposition (FFD) of a part model. Form features are classified into a taxonomy of atomic machining features, to which machining process information has been associated. Geometry-based precedence relations between features are systematically generated using the face dependency information obtained by ASVP Decomposition and the features’ associated machining process information. Multiple sets of precedence relations are generated as alternative precedence trees, based on the feature types and machining process considerations. These precedence trees are further enhanced with precedence relations from tolerance specifications and machining expertise. Machining sequence planning is performed for each of these precedence trees, applying a matrix-based method to reduce the search space while minimizing the number of tool changes. The precedence trees may then be evaluated based on machining cost and other criteria. The precedence reasoning module and operation sequence planning module are currently being implemented within a comprehensive Computer-Aided Process Planning system.</jats:p>",

The problem is divided into two parts: path planning for off-line processing, followed by on-line path tracking using an adaptive controller. The path planning is done at the joint level. The motion of the robot is specified by a sequence of knots (positions of the robot’s tip) in space Cartesian coordinates. These knots are then transformed into two sets of joint displacements, and piecewise cubic polynomials are used to fit these two sequences of joint displacements. The cubic spline function is used to construct a trajectory with the velocity and the acceleration as constraints. Linear scaling of the time variable is used to accommodate the velocity and acceleration constraints. A nonlinear scaling of the time variable is performed to fit the velocity to a pre-specified velocity profile. The adaptive scheme used takes full advantage of the known parameters of the manipulator while estimating the unknown parameters. In deriving the dynamic equations of motion, all of the physical parameters of the manipulator, including the distributed masses of the links, are taken into account. Some simulation results for the manipulator with unknown payload masses following a planned trajectory are presented.</jats:p>",

The total processing time for a layer is the sum of the times for the movements of the tool, which can be in one of two modes: when it is switched on (machining time), and when it is switched off (non-machining time). Typically, the machining velocity, at which the tool travels along each curve is decided by technological factors. However, for any reasonably complex shape, there is a significant portion of the tool motion while jumping from the end of one curve to the beginning of the next curve, during which time the tool is not machining. It is therefore interesting to see if we can reduce the non-machining time in RP, and this paper proposes a genetic algorithm attempting to do so. Results of a test case are also presented.</jats:p>",

The study of the interplay between gay subculture and servicescapes is grounded in qualitative and observational data through field work conducted in the Manchester “gay village”. Findings indicate that communitas, individualism and diversity are key facets of the subculture, with bars being used as individual expressions of identity, moods and emotions. Other influences on consumption patterns include interpersonal interaction with friends, the hetero‐ and homosexual cultural interface, and the ambience of the service environment.

Deshalb wird zu ermitteln versucht, welche Aussagekraft Patentdaten für eine Regionalanalyse der Erfindungstätigkeit in Deutschland besitzen. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine Unternehmensbefragung patentanmeldender Unternehmen durchgeführt. Dabei wurde u.a. nach den Gründen gefragt, die das unterschiedliche Patentierungsverhalten der Unternehmen und damit indirekt auch der Regionen erklären lassen.

These issues are explored by considering female consumer buyer behaviour in relation to joint purchase decisions regarding “high‐involvement and high‐risk” household products at three stages of the selection and purchase process: pre‐purchase, consumption and post‐purchase ‐ as defined in the services consumer behaviour model.</jats:p>",

Darunter werden räumliche und funktionale Standorte verstanden, deren herausragende Funktionen im internationalen Maßstab über die nationalen Grenzen hinweg ausstrahlen. Als Motoren der gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und kulturellen Entwicklung sollen sie die Leistungs- und Konkurrenzfähigkeit Deutschlands und Europas erhalten und dazu beitragen, den europäischen Integrationsprozeß zu beschleunigen. Die Besonderheit des Netzes der europäischen Metropolregionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland liegt in einer ausgeprägten Funktionsteilung, z.B. Hauptstadtfunktion der Metropolregion Berlin/Brandenburg und internationaler Großflughafen Frankfurt in der Metropolregion Rhein-Main. Der Beitrag nennt Bereiche, in denen vordringlicher Bedarf an raumwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen zur Abstützung des Metropolregionenkonzepts wie auch zur konkreten Stärkung der Metropolregionen gesehen wird. Abschließend werden bisherige Ansätze zur Verbesserung der infrastrukturellen, sozialen und ökologischen Strukturen sowie Vorschläge zur stärkeren Vernetzung und interkommunalen Kooperation innerhalb und zwischen den europäischen Metropolregionen aufgezeigt.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

New technology can seem a threat to small business owner‐managers and there is a link between business growth and the use of IT. There has been increased adoption of all categories of software, from databases, CAD‐CAM and presentation packages, to spreadsheets and communications software, but respondents expressed dissatisfaction with software, more than with hardware. There is a perceived lack of expertise in the planning process as well as the technology itself. Responses were split over loss of managerial control: SME owner‐managers want to remain in control, IT may be associated with growth, and some may resist growth. A strong need for impartial advice, independent from computer vendors, has been expressed, and a worrying number of respondents did not consider maintenance and training costs when purchasing technology. Organisational factors such as staff skill levels, familiarisation time, and the impact on jobs, were rarely considered prior to purchase. Opinions on training provision were divided. More complex IT‐related business and organisational changes may require integrated technical and managerial training, so that SMEs can become more strategically oriented and benefit better from IT.</jats:p>",

A single MSDT involves testing k specimens simultaneously until the rth failure. The traditional sudden death test (SDT) is a special case when r=1. The complete MSDT plan consists of g single MSDTs run in sequence. When r&amp;gt;1, there can be up to r−1 idle test positions at any time. We propose testing “standby” specimens in the idle positions and use simulation to gage the improvement over the basic MSDT plan. We evaluate test plans with respect to the asymptotic variance of maximum likelihood estimators of quantities of interest, total experiment duration, and sample size. In contrast to traditional experimental plans, shorter total testing time and smaller sample sizes are possible under MSDT plans.</jats:p>",

Die Startbedingungen der Region und ihrer Unternehmen in einen intensivierten Wettbewerbsprozeß müssen jedoch kritisch gesehen werden: Die Entwicklung der Industrieumsätze deutet auf Marktanteilsverluste der regionalen Unternehmen hin, das regionale Innovationspotential weist Schwächen auf und die Standortbedingungen lassen neben Stärken auch Defizite erkennen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> New approaches to the management of subcontracting relations are interpreted as indicating a shift from adversarial to cooperative linkages. This shift is thought to encourage greater use of external suppliers and to encourage localisation of buyers and suppliers. These propositions are examined through a case study of linkage development in Singapore, a major centre of multinational manufacturing activity. The case study draws on evidence from a sample of participants in a scheme promoted by Singapore's Economic Development Board known as the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP), which has aimed to promote linkage development. The paper reports two surveys of participants in LIUP: (1) a postal survey of buyers (mainly made up of foreign multinationals as well as a few Singapore organisations) and subcontractors; and (2) a personal interview survey with representatives of twenty-two buyer organisations. The analysis, partly presented through brief case studies of individual organisations, shows how variable strategies affecting subcontracting linkages are evolving. Increased information flows between firms are found to be well established but a low priority to linkage localisation is discovered. These findings are interpreted in terms of MNC (multinational corporation) strategies to retain flexibility in subcontractor selection and their increased capabilities to manage spatially dispersed supply linkages. </jats:p>",

GIS technology, like any other technology, is more than a tool; it connects different social groups in the construction of new localized social arrangements. We examine several instances of how GIS technology involves social negotiation by using a construct of boundary objects developed in a social constructivist framework. Much like geographic boundaries, boundary objects separate different social groups at the same time that they delineate important points of reference between them. Boundary objects stabilize relationships through the negotiation of flexible and dynamic coherences. The negotiation of differences between different groups is fundamental to the construction of GIS technology. Social-constructivist theories and the concept of boundary objects open new ways to understand the relationships between technology and people. We illustrate the application of boundary object theory through studies of the use of GIS data standards and the definition of wetlands. </jats:p>",

Adjustments reflect pressures arising from foreign investors, economic bottlenecks, management, and labour as well as from local, regional, and national political interests. Spatial reallocation of resources and opportunities has enabled China to sustain rapid growth without major internal constraints. Nanjing is a case in point. Investment patterns reflect a regional variation in development but, notwithstanding local inputs, the end result fits in with the overarching federal model. Expansion in the Nanjing region is driven by foreign investors searching for new opportunities and the need for state enterprises to restructure. Growth is diversified among a number of sectors and balanced between the domestic and foreign markets. Management and technological transfers are providing a solid foundation for continued expansion. Nanjing appears to have found a niche in the Yangzi basin as a regional centre and possibly as a future gateway city. </jats:p>",

Data collection involved participant observation, in‐depth interviews and a study of both commercially and consumer generated secondary materials (climbing club literature for example). The researchers identified an environment in which temporary leisure identities were supported and at times modified by the retail relationships and were embedded in a rich sub‐cultural narrative. Postmodern concepts pertaining to the consumption of place and space corresponded with the observational data, to the extent that recommendations for retailers are less overtly managerial, and more about facilitating the consumer’s ownership of the spaces and relationships within them.</jats:p>",

Common elements of interest to evolutionary innovation research and new regional science are important in understanding processes of agglomeration, trust building, innovation, institutions, and learning in regional systems. The authors develop analytical frameworks for designating regional systems of innovation in terms of distinction between institutions and organisations, hard and soft infrastructures, and the cultural superstructure.

The same collection refers to his \"situational analysis.\" This article explores the implications of both for spatial planning. Spatial planners have to justify proposals. The article first summarizes earlier work on planning methodology evolving around the rationality principle and the implications for it of Popper's work for how to do this. It then discusses the notion of the definition of the decision situation, which flows from this principle. This, of course, implies taking a leaf out of Popper's book where he discusses situational analysis. The article then gives an account of the author's work on Dutch planning doctrine, relating it to the definition of decision situations in planning and confronting it with Popper's strictures against The Myth of the Framework. The conclusion is that, whereas in the sciences that are after explain ing reality in terms of universal laws, Popper's argument holds, in planning it does not. Planning is about the search for the right course of action. In it, Popper's concern with fighting relativism and what he calls \"justification\" is misplaced. The quality of decisions depends on the position and the concerns of the decision taker. Relativism is in-built and so is the need to justify decisions. </jats:p>",

Means, standard deviation and devel opmental growth curves for the 8 tests ofPASSprocesses were obtained. Factor analyses were also obtained in order to determine if the 4 PASS factors can be replicated. Atten tion, Simultaneous and Successive factors emerged clearly whereas the status of Planning as an independent factor was unclear. In conclusion, the PASS processes were suggested to be universal across cultures.

This production lot size problem is frequently faced in industry where a forecast of future demand must be made and production is to be scheduled based on the forecast. Because forecasts of the future are costly and difficult to validate, a firm would like to minimize the number of periods into the future it needs to forecast in order to make an optimal production decision today. In this paper, we first prove that under very general conditions finite horizon versions of the problem exist that lead to an optimal production level at any decision epoch. In particular, we show it suffices for the first period infinite horizon production decision to solve for a horizon that exceeds the longest time interval over which it can prove profitable to carry inventory. We then develop a closed-form expression for computing such a horizon and provide a simple finite algorithm to recursively compute an infinite horizon optimal production schedule. </jats:p>",

We compare SGHC with steepest descent hill climbing (SDHC). In SDHC, candidate moves are evaluated within a 360-degree radius and the best candidate is selected by the robot. One would think that SGHC would be at a disad vantage ; however, the performance of SGHC is comparable with SDHC.

This same power can mislead investigators who use visualization to explore georeferenced data—if data reliability is not addressed directly in the visualization process. Here, we apply an integrated cognitive-semiotic approach to devise and test three methods for depicting reliability of georeferenced health data. The first method makes use of adjacent maps, one for data and one for reliability. This form of paired representation is compared to two methods in which data and reliability are spatially coincident (on a single map). A novel method for coincident visually separable depiction of data and data reliability on mortality maps (using a color fill to represent data and a texture overlay to represent reliability) is found to be effective in allowing map users to recognize unreliable data without interfering with their ability to notice clusters and characterize patterns in mortality rates. A coincident visually integral depiction (using color characteristics to represent both data and reliability) is found to inhibit perception of clusters that contain some enumeration units with unreliable data, and to make it difficult for users to consider data and reliability independently. </jats:p>",

As a case study of the broader class of educational efforts, the inquiry focused on educational efforts regarding a central patient care issue for nursing homes: the use of life-sustaining medical treatment. Results indicated that nonprofit and for-profit nursing homes were equally likely to conduct educational efforts concerning advance care planning. However, nonprofit nursing homes were more likely than for-profit nursing homes to have ongoing, rather than sporadic, discussions about advance care planning; to broaden such discussions beyond life-support wishes; and to have ethics committees to support advance care planning. Other empirical research has demonstrated ownership differences in both cost and quality of care. This study offers new evidence regarding additional ways in which nonprofit long-term care facilities may be distinguished from their for-profit counterparts. </jats:p>",

Four study areas were chosen: Switzerland as a whole; the city of Zurich; its surrounding suburban regions; and one particular suburban region. All these areas are highly identified with the financial sector. First we evaluate the changes in numbers of employees between 1980 and 1990 and the gender breakdown within different occupational categories in the three study areas. The data for the analysis were gained from the Swiss censuses of 1980 and 1990. Second, we look at the circumstances that caused the suburbanisation of bank back-office functions and the impact on office employment, putting special emphasis on women occupied in clerical–secretarial work. The focus is on one suburban zone around Zurich which experienced the most noticeable growth in office employment of all suburban regions over the last two decades. The findings of this study suggest that the Swiss banks are a male bastion. Women are mainly found in the lower qualified occupations, such as clerical–secretarial work. Moreover, the suburban belt is characterised by a high percentage of women in pink-collar jobs whereas the city is dominated by male employees. </jats:p>",

It analyses how different people might be affected by environmental degradation in the region by looking at their social and economic activities, the degree of dependency on wild resources, land ownership and the social relations underpinning the structure of the labour force. The study covers three districts within the ecological system of <jats:italic>terra firme.</jats:italic> Extractivist activities generate income and contribute considerably to food supplies throughout the year. Access to these resources is not generally tied to ownership. Environmental degradation may reduce the future availability of resources or, alternatively, attack health directly. Peasants exposure to these risks is assessed and the long‐term sustainability of their livelihoods examined. Possible planning solutions to problems are presented and the more recent debate on the creation of conservation units (SNUC) in Brazil is discussed.</jats:p>",

Our focus is on the methods of analysis for small area (ward-based) multiple cross-section mortality data and their application to the substantive issue of the persistent and widening inequalities in Wales. In this paper we examine all-cause deaths and mortality by specific disease classes for groups (quintiles) of wards ranked according to standard measures of material deprivation. Although there have been reductions in premature mortality across all deprivation groups in Wales, over the decade, the gap has widened between the most and least deprived areas. Mortality decline in the largest disease category (circulatory) was found to be significantly lower in the most deprived quintile of wards than in the rest of Wales. Compared with results from the North of England, mortality decline in Wales has been rather greater. </jats:p>",

Data were collected on radiologists' workloads, and patient and image flow within and between these medical centres. These were used to estimate the size and cash flows associated with a system-wide implementation of PACS, CR and teleradiology services. A cost analysis model was used to estimate the potential cost savings in a filmless radiology environment. ATM technology was selected as the communications medium between the medical centres. A strategic plan and business plan were successfully developed. The cost model predicted the cost-effectiveness of the proposed PACS CR configuration within four to six years, if the base costs were kept low. The experience gained in design and cost analysis of a PACS teleradiology network will serve as a model for similar projects. </jats:p>",

Regional scientists have been stressing the importance of new industrial districts, with an emphasis on interfirm relationships and the regional economy in which firms are embedded. In this paper, we document the state's role in regional growth and offer a reminder of the external and political actors which have influenced growth of industrial districts. We have acquired information from the US General Services Administration on each piece of property owned by the United States, including data on the agency controlling the installation and the functions performed at this location. Our examination of employment growth from 1970 to 1990 provides evidence that federal installations did stimulate growth in the regions in which they were located. More specifically, we find that NASA installations and the military's industrial facilities exerted a positive influence on employment growth over the period. However, despite the large budgets commanded by Department of Energy installations and their highly educated labor force, we found that the Department of Energy installations inhibited employment growth. </jats:p>",

Data came from a sample of 176 African American and 194 White American caregivers who were identified as part of a prospective study of changes in functional status of older hospitalized patients. When interaction terms were added to a multivariate model assessing the relationship between race and strain, race lost its significant influence on strain. Instead, its combination with two other variables-being an adult child caregiver and being married-emerged as important correlates. Being an adult child had deleterious consequences for White caregivers, whereas being married had advantageous consequences for African American caregivers. Findings emphasize the need to reevaluate how the race variable is used in future research and the need for hospital staff to be sensitive to racial diversity when working with families to plan for older patients' discharge. </jats:p>",

The cost of water supply (public or well), effluent treatment (in-plant treatment and/or sewerage system), and disposal of sludge and packaging were also compared. Total environmental costs in Germany, Italy, and Ireland were small: usually less than 1% of turnover. Compared with the Irish firms, German companies had relatively high environmental costs as well as productivity levels. There was, however, a lack of a clear relationship between company competitiveness and the size of regulation costs: in Ireland and Italy environmental costs were similar but German firms had much higher productivity; compared with German counterparts, Italian firms had lower environmental costs but higher productivity. </jats:p>",
