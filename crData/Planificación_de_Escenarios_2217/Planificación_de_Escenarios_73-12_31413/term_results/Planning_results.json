      "abstract": "<jats:p>In late 1972 Social Service Departments were formally requested by the Department of Health and Social Security to prepare development plans covering the next ten years. Ten years earlier local health and welfare authorities had been asked to do the same exercise and the results appeared in April, 1963, and were subsequently revised twice. After 1965 demands for ten year planning ceased although shorter-term three-year capital programme forecasting did continue. With the amalgamations of welfare, mental health and children’s departments under the Seebohm re-organisations in 1971, ten-year planning has come back into fashion, this time in a rather more detailed form, especially in respect of manpower forecasting. Criteria, admittedly very unsophisticated, were provided by the DHSS and suggestions on the organisation of the planning task were issued by the Social Services Research Group. Though some authorities, notably those well advanced with corporate planning models seem to have found the creation of ten year plans relatively painless, others found it much more difficult and this was doubtless reflected in the fact that around half of the plans missed the DHSS delivery deadline set for 28 February, 1973.</jats:p>",

The author\n      believes that it is useful to approach economic integration from a\n      planning point of view and to develop planning models for it, because\n      the theory of economic integration relevant for developing countries\n      should be directed towards the impact of integration on future\n      investments and future production. The type of models used in the book\n      are the multisector linear programming models and the method of analysis\n      is essentially a comparison of two situations; one with economic\n      integration and the other without. For each prospective partici¬pant a\n      medium term planning model is drawn up taking account of its economic\n      situation in some base year. The results of these single country\n      planning models are analysed and compared to those of a similar planning\n      model for the integration area as a whole. The consequences of the\n      integration policy are then evaluated.</jats:p>"

To contribute to the improvement of corporate planning in Canada, management scientists must learn how to generate commitment to their models among management. They must achieve such commitment gradually, for it is impossible to take an operating manager out of the main stream, protect him from his peers and then get him to change his personalized way of taking action. Based on my experience management scientists, for the most part, have not had the patience to create commitment to their methods. </jats:p>",

With ultrasound it is possible to record simultaneously the contour of the patient and the location and depth of tumors and normal structures. This information can easily be incorporated into current methods of computerized treatment planning. Ultrasound examination also assists in the accurate placement of treatment ports on the body surface, and allows adjustment of field size as tumors respond to treatment. It is predicted that diagnostic ultrasound examination will become a standard method of obtaining anatomical information for radiation therapy planning in all modern radiation treatment facilities.</jats:p>",

These agencies must establish water quality standards within their area and design a control program to meet these standards efficiently. This paper describes a model for planning an efficient water quality program within a river basin. The waste abatement control employed is called the rent allotment control, whose merit is that its implementation provides a solution to the information problem of efficient waste abatement. The control is implemented through a bargaining process or game between the agency and the waste dischargers that may be characterized as an n-person prisoner's dilemma. The game provides the agency with information about individual waste abatement costs, and terminates in a set of agreements on rents and allotments which depend upon the bidding strategies adopted by each player. “Optimal” bidding strategies are examined under the assumption that waste dischargers are risk averse and cost minimizing. An example of the operation of the control is provided using data from the Ottawa River Basin. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning within a structural and geographical macro-perspective — defining desirable relations between regions, countries, and industrial sectors and units — should precede planning at the microlevel. Development aid by industrialized countries to the developing world should be conceived on the basis of an international division of labor and distribution of joint natural resources which appear optimal from a global standpoint. The global solution constitutes a point of departure for suboptimizing down the scale of geographical and sectoral levels.Managing common property fisheries to maximize net economic returns (i.e. by setting yield targets below the maximum sustained yield level) makes sense for the industrialized countries. As long as people in developing countries go hungry, however, and production of food resources below the maximum level cannot be made up by imports, a level of fishery resource exploitation below the maximum sustained yield does not seem to be justifiable on a global basis. Neither can maximum economic efficiency be accepted as the governing criterion for management, since this would undoubtedly work toward the creation of a virtual monopoly of exploitation by the countries with the most sophisticated technologies, in the absence of an international mechanism to guarantee that resulting economies would benefit others as well.Global redistribution of fish production and processing may be the most effective form of development aid, as the cost of \"aid\" given in this manner may be lower than that of financial and technical aid made available by industrialized countries. The \"sacrifices\" implied by this redistribution of natural wealth would not be great, as support for unprofitable or marginally profitable fisheries has often been no more than an impediment to general economic growth in the industrialized countries. Many developing countries, on the other hand, would enjoy considerable comparative cost advantages — because of their vicinity to rich, relatively unexploited fishing grounds — if only existing gaps in technology and know-how were being eliminated. Radical solutions along these lines do not appear feasible at the present time but attempts to move in the right direction through judicious application of aid measures, should not be neglected. In the absence of effective supranational decision-making bodies, it will be the responsibility of the international and bilateral agencies to ensure that resources made available to one country do not create \"external diseconomies\" for others. To achieve this goal, everybody will have to be educated on the benefits of planning fully integrated investments for large areas.Unless timely action is taken to harmonize development aid, investments, and fishing effort on a regional basis, the mistakes made and the sorry results produced in such areas as the North Atlantic will be repeated in areas of primary interest to developing countries and everybody will ultimately be a loser. </jats:p>",

This activity lends itself aptly to mathematical modelling. Building from the well-known difference equation model of population growth, a model is constructed which integrates population dynamics, program activities and resource consumption. The model may be used predictively to assess the outcome of various program activities. Alternatively, it may be used to determine the pattern of activities which yields the greatest reduction in births under the projected resource constraints. A further use of the model is the identification of the parameters to which predictions are most sensitive; such information provides valuable insights to those gathering the input data. The model is here applied to two family planning programs currently in progress. An evaluation of the feasibility of the program's goals is provided, as well as information on limiting resources, data sensitivity and the most important ages for contraceptive acceptance. The model's generality is such that it can be applied to most birth control programs which are planned at the national or regional level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> College students in West Germany, the Netherlands, India, and the United States made birth-planning \"decisions\" for forty hypothetical family situations. The situations depicted eight familial characteristics which could be descriptive of families in any country where there is monogamous marriage, where it is expected that the husband (father) should be the major provider, and where the wife (mother) should be chiefly responsible for activities involving the home and children. Comparisons of responses revealed large similarities across national samples in thinking about the family in the abstract. Some irregularities in decisions across samples were also evident. It is suggested that a similarity in thinking regarding family structure may underlie the cultural differences found by earlier crossnational family research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health information about total populations is a prerequisite for sound decision-making and planning in the health care field. Experience with a population-based health data system in Vermont reveals that there are wide variations in resource input, utilization of services, and expenditures among neighboring communities. Results show prima facie inequalities in the input of resources that are associated with income transfer from areas of lower expenditure to areas of higher expenditure. Variations in utilization indicate that there is considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness of different levels of aggregate, as well as specific kinds of, health services.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Informed choices in the public regulation of the health care sector require knowledge of the relation between medical care systems and the population groups being served, and they should take into account the effect of regulation on equality and effectiveness. When population-based data on small areas are available, decisions to expand hospitals, currently based on institutional pressures, can take into account a community's regional ranking in regard to bed input and utilization rates. Proposals by hospitals for unit price increases and the regulation of the actuarial rate of insurance programs can be evaluated in terms of per capita expenditures and income transfer between geographically defined populations. The PSRO's can evaluate the wide variations in level of services among residents of different communities. Coordinated exercise of the authority vested in these regulatory programs may lead to explicit strategies to deal directly with inequality and uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of health care delivery. Population-based health information systems, because they can provide information on the performance of health care systems and regulatory agencies, are an important step in the development of rational public policy for health.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world food and agricultural situation in the 1980s must be looked at, as now, in terms of the division between developed and developing countries. While there will still be problems in the developed countries - such as surpluses - the great crisis will remain in the developing countries. The most obvious feature of the crisis is the balance between the increase in population and the increase in food production. In the 1960s, the balance was extremely precarious and, in the first two years of the 1970s, population actually grew faster than production. Hence, it is imperative to accelerate the increase in production in the developing countries. In order to achieve this, it is important to see to what extent the obstacles are due to lack of knowledge on how to obtain more from natural resources - primarily a technological problem - and to what extent they are due to the weaknesses of human institutions and of the political will for change. In addition, the prospects for a more rational and hopeful world food and agricultural situation in the 1980s will depend very largely on how the national agricultural production and trade policies of both developed and developing countries can be modified by practical steps towards international agricultural adjustment for the benefit of all.</jats:p>",

The last is a major consideration.Secondary criteria include such physical considerations as crew amenities, vessel support facilities, communications, and transport.Tertiary criteria include the overall size of the project, the dimensions of the market, the nature of competition, the possibility of overcapitalization, and, ultimately, luck and the behavior of humans and fishes. </jats:p>",

The first paper sets out the theoretical framework for the model. This second paper documents the results for housing price indices and implicit prices for housing services, or characteristics, such as accessibility to employment and to schools, floor space, age, storey height, and number of garages. The third paper contains results for housing demand equations at three levels of aggregation, and for the real annual costs paid for similar housing in different tenure groups. The research is concerned with ways of obtaining information which is directly relevant to cost-benefit analysis in urban planning, information concerning what are urban services, the relative prices for the services, and the types of environments that produce these services. While the empirical work is restricted by the available data to a cross-section study of demand, the approach might be usefully applied to all types of urban analyses which involve evaluation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning responsibilities for fisheries should be entrusted to specially trained staff, not to economic and agricultural planners or even to fishery specialists with a technical, scientific, or general administrative background. Characteristics of fishery resources (\"invisibility,\" mobility, and nonexistence of ownership rights) and of fish production (the large range of input/output combinations, technical and managerial requirements, fishing labor remuneration, and fish utilization) elevate such essential features of planning as inventory-taking and supply- and demand-projecting to an \"art,\" which a planner unfamiliar with fisheries cannot be expected to have mastered. Fisheries specialists lack the know-how for selecting projects, and their record in planning is generally no better than that of nonspecialists.Basic techniques of sectoral planning are summarized, and the methods of adjusting them to overall economic and social plans are described. Examples relating to countries bordering the eastern central Atlantic are presented, listing the types of questions planners might raise in initiating or evaluating programs.Two proposals for improving fisheries development planning are mentioned — workshops on fisheries planning; and appointment of fisheries planning experts to give advice, set up planning units, and train counterpart personnel. </jats:p>",
