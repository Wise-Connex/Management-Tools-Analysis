Without these incentives, many life‐saving new drugs would have not been developed and produced.</jats:p><jats:p>For economic reasons, the development of medicines for the treatment of diseases prevalent in the developing world (or tropical diseases) is lagging behind. Among several factors, the low average per‐capita income makes pharmaceutical markets in developing countries appear relatively unprofitable and therefore unattractive for R&amp;D‐oriented companies.</jats:p><jats:p>The case of ODL may offer some useful insights and perspectives for the fight against neglected tropical diseases. First, the measures used in ODL may also be effective in boosting R&amp;D for neglected tropical diseases, if appropriately adapted to this market. Second, small‐sized companies, which have played a successful role in the development of orphan drugs for rare diseases, may also represent a good business strategy for the case of tropical diseases.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the 1993 publication of <jats:italic>Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>World Development Report: Investing in Health</jats:italic>, micronutrient fortification and supplementation interventions have been recognized as being among the most cost‐effective public health interventions. This paper reviews nearly 100 studies of the cost of micronutrient interventions. The literature contains enormous variation in the estimated costs of these programs due to differences in program structure, delivery systems and a host of country‐specific factors, differences in the studies' objectives, designs and costing methodologies. The most diverse estimates reported are those of vitamin A supplementation programs, where estimates vary by a factor of more than 1000. The costs of fortification programs, too, vary substantially from a factor of two for iodine, six for iron, and 15 for vitamin A fortification. As the magnitude of these variations suggests, the bulk of these studies are idiosyncratic, and their results are not directly comparable. The review highlights the need for greater specificity in discourse about these programs, and for greater transparency about cost estimation methods. The review provides several insights: (1) average costs are several‐fold higher than has traditionally been maintained; (2) fortificants account for 80% of annual, incremental costs of vitamin A fortification; (3) whereas 70% of those of vitamin A supplementation programs are personnel; (4) the imprecision of food fortification coverage and impact estimates owes primarily to the paucity of food consumption data. Addressing the food consumption information gap is an essential next step to improving micronutrient program policies: to better targeting programs and to devising more cost‐effective program portfolio mixes. Cost studies have a largely unrealized potential role to play in increasing program efficiency, coverage, and effectiveness. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The application of portfolio analysis to US hospital settings has been frequently reported. In Europe however, the application of this technique has received little attention, especially concerning public hospitals. Therefore, this paper examines the peculiarities of portfolio analysis and its applicability to the strategic management of European public hospitals. The analysis is based on a pilot application of a multi‐factor portfolio analysis in a Dutch university hospital. The nature of portfolio analysis and the steps in a multi‐factor portfolio analysis are reviewed along with the characteristics of the research setting. Based on these data, a multi‐factor portfolio model is developed and operationalized. The portfolio model is applied in a pilot investigation to analyze the market attractiveness and hospital strengths with regard to the provision of three orthopedic services: knee surgery, hip surgery, and arthroscopy. The pilot portfolio analysis is discussed to draw conclusions about potential barriers to the overall adoption of portfolio analysis in the management of a public hospital.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) of Afghanistan has adopted the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as a tool to measure and manage performance in delivery of a Basic Package of Health Services. Based on results from the 2004 baseline round, the MOPH identified eight of the 29 indicators on the BSC as priority areas for improvement. Like the 2004 round, the 2005 and 2006 BSCs involved a random selection of more than 600 health facilities, 1700 health workers and 5800 patient‐provider interactions. The 2005 and 2006 BSCs demonstrated substantial improvements in all eight of the priority areas compared to 2004 baseline levels, with increases in median provincial scores for presence of active village health councils, availability of essential drugs, functional laboratories, provider knowledge, health worker training, use of clinical guidelines, monitoring of tuberculosis treatment, and provision of delivery care. For three of the priority indicators—drug availability, health worker training and provider knowledge—scores remained unchanged or decreased between 2005 and 2006. This highlights the need to ensure that early gains achieved in establishment of health services in Afghanistan are maintained over time. The use of a coherent and balanced monitoring framework to identify priority areas for improvement and measure performance over time reflects an objectives‐based approach to management of health services that is proving to be effective in a difficult environment.

There is no statutory requirement to create a sustainability plan – and therefore no standard definition of what constitutes such a plan for local government in NSW. The same is true of the term ‘sustainability’, for which there is no standard or legislative definition. However, the NSW state division of Local Government Managers Australia (LGMA - a professional organization for council managers) has recently released a ‘Sustainability Health Check’ as a resource to assist councils in assessing their current performance and devising appropriate strategies and action plans for sustainability. In addition, several individual councils have used the opportunity provided by the state government’s Urban Sustainability Program to make a first attempt at developing a sustainability plan.</jats:p>"

Based on lessons learned from years of disaster response experience, FEMA is now taking a more proactive and collaborative approach with its partners. This paper discusses how FEMA is placing a greater emphasis on response operations and strengthening capabilities across the full range of operational and support missions by comprehensively revamping its disaster operations model; enhancing its headquarters and regional operations centres; enhancing its headquarters and regional operational planning capabilities; and addressing catastrophic disaster planning and related critical preparedness issues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the past hundred years Esperanto has found adepts in China and Japan. Outside Europe and the Americas, nowhere has Esperanto spread as much as it has in East Asia. The Chinese and Japanese were drawn to it through their desire to learn from the west; they hoped to use Esperanto as a bridge between east and west or they found in it a link to anarchism and communism. Often the Esperantists used their language for campaign purposes, for example in the battle against the Japanese invasion of China beginning in the 1930s (“For the liberation of China through Esperanto”) or for the popularization of pacifism in postwar Japan. As in the west, many Esperantists in China and Japan based their connection with Esperanto on the idea of the harmony of all humankind. The movement progressed thanks primarily to those who avoided too much missionary zeal and preferred to recruit on the basis of Esperanto as a neutral device. Given the lack of opportunity to use the language in practical ways, for more than half of the past hundred years the Esperantists of East Asia tended to emphasize Esperanto as an idea; but the economic prosperity of Japan and the opening of China, by allowing greater contact with the outside world, have given Esperanto the opportunity to demonstrate more strongly its usefulness as an easily learned means of communication, also for direct contact between Chinese and Japanese.</jats:p>",

It is a thought-provoking examination that can help anybody in the `c-suite' examine their particular requirements, characteristics and culture to determine appropriate staffing levels. The reader will have a quantitative approach for determining the size and structure of a resilient enterprise which can provide a solid foundation for a programme that adapts and adjusts quickly and cost-effectively to disasters and events. It can also help build executive support for a programme management office which could ultimately increase the overall success of the programme.</jats:p>"

The logic of the city as a locus of accumulation and social reproduction in the modern economy is then discussed. Here, special attention is paid to the dynamics of intraurban production space and social space, and to the complex interrelations between the two. The concomitant shape and form of urban public policy are subject to investigation. Three major dilemmas and their underlying etiology are subject to scrutiny. These are: the fragility of localised competitive advantage in a globalising world; the widening social divide with its many-sided negative consequences on urban life; and, the growing mismatch between the internal geography of the city and the institutions of urban governance. The paper concludes with a comment on the implications of the new cognitive-cultural economy for understanding urban dynamics and problems. </jats:p>",

Because the complexity of the problem, it is proposed a heuristic, in the context of genetic technique, for solving it. Several numerical experiments are presented at the end of this work. The results show that the performance of our approach is very good, being its results very close to exact solutions.

Drawing on case‐studies of plans for inland and coastal areas, and involving stakeholder workshops, this paper reports on a trans‐national study examining the scope of spatial plans in the Netherlands, England and France in addressing the impact of climate change. It concludes that spatial planning is making provision for biodiversity and dynamic natural processes. However, while good practice in planning for biodiversity under conditions of climate change is developing, systematic use is not being made of available procedures. The paper examines some of the barriers to implementation of this new policy commitment to climate change adaptation. Recommendations are made covering policy development to include climate change impacts upon biodiversity, modified procedures for plan‐making and the appraisal of plans and projects. Amongst the specific measures recommended are the climate‐proofing of projects and plans through the use of EIA and SEA; the integration of plans through adoption of common objectives and review of time horizons and boundaries; and an ecosystem‐based planning approach.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the late 1990s the question of whether to ratify the status of Swedish as the “principal” language of Sweden by means of a language law has been subject to considerable public dispute. Drawing on Blommaert’s concept of a “language ideological debate,” we explore how and why this particular debate seemingly ground to a halt without achieving any kind of tangible closure. In order to do so, we introduce Habermas’s notion of “legitimation crisis” and describe how such crises are, according to Habermas, typically underpinned by one or more “rationality deficits,” i.e. discursive paradoxes that emerge in a given historical, cultural, social and economic context. We then propose that the concept of “legitimation crisis” not only may help to explain why some language ideological debates sometimes reach a stalemate at a specific historical moment as in the Swedish case, but also constitutes a theoretical framework that could be productively incorporated into the study of language politics more generally.</jats:p>",

The project involved intervention in three wells over a period of 9 months. The wells had been shut in for some time following production of reservoir solids. A hydraulic workover unit (HWU) was selected to clean out the production tubing to allow isolation barriers to be installed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In rig-assist mode, the HWU deploys pipe against surface pressure with the rig providing pipe-handling support. The paper details the planning and pre-engineering work that preceded offshore operations. Detailed planning and risk assessment were also required during operations because well conditions changed. Some equipment problems required a review of planned operations, and during an annual process plant shutdown, onshore tests were carried out before mobilization for the second phase of the intervention project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Modifications were required to the HWU to withstand the high buckling loads associated with snubbing against high pressure. Additionally, special downhole tooling was required to accommodate extreme well conditions. The paper discusses the development work involved and the subsequent performance of the equipment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Operating performance statistics and key lessons learned during the project are presented.</jats:p>",

Previous attempts to implement a `traditional' form of BCP had been ineffective, but following the events, the firm began to look at BCP in a new light. This paper deals with three main themes: creating a culture of resiliency, leveraging technology, and building flexible plans. Distributing accountability for BCP to business line managers, integrating BCP change management into the normal course of business, and providing every employee with personalised BCP information breeds a culture of resiliency where people are empowered to react to events without burdensome, hierarchical response and recovery procedures. Building a strong relationship with one's application development community can result in novel, customised BCP solutions; existing systems and data structures can be used to enhance an existing BCP. Even the best plans are often challenged by events; understanding that flexibility is essential to effective incident response is a critical element in the development of a proper business continuity plan.</jats:p>"

A key component of the management system is its geographical information system capability and how this can be used to enhance emergency response.

It is estimated that 20 000 woodland caribou remain in Ontario, of which approximately one quarter inhabit the boreal forest and are described as the sedentary forest-dwelling population. This paper examines the recovery strategy for this population developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources, as well as discussing the implications of provincial forestry policy on woodland caribou management. Commercial timber harvesting will likely soon be allowed in parts of the northern third of the province, in which woodland caribou habitat currently is relatively unimpaired by industrial development. Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag:Planlegging for bevaring av skogsøkotypen av Rangifer tarandus caribou i Ontario, CanadaSkogsvillreinen av skogsøkotypen i Ontario er vurdert som sårbar både føderalt og på provinsnivå. Av provinsens rundt 20 000 skogsvillrein hører omtrent en fjerdepart til den stasjonære skogsboende skogsøkoypen. Artikkelen ser på bevaringsstrategien som er utarbeidet av naturressursdepartementet i Ontario for denne spesielle bestanden og diskuterer konsekvensene for villreinen av provinsens skogpolitikk. Kommersiell hogst vil mest sannsynlig og snart bli tillatt i deler av Ontarios nordlige tredel der skogvillreinens leveområder er relativt upåvirket av industriell virksomhet.</jats:p>"

Engaging future inhabitants in planning processes opens previously unseen potential for including consumerist possibilities for cities and developers. This paper illustrates that this new 4Ps participation method makes comprehensive participatory planning and development possible through giving an opportunity to include consumers’ opinions and needs into an alternative to traditional communicative planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

First, chronometric studies on the time to initiate vocal responding and gaze shifting suggest that spoken word planning may require some attention, even though it is one of our most highly practiced psychomotor skills. Second, neuroimaging studies that localized brain activity during word planning suggest that attention enhances activity in perisylvian cortical areas. What word to enhance and for how long is determined by an executive control system located in anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex. Commonalities of anterior cingulate function across verbal vocalizations (speech) and nonverbal vocalizations (e.g. human crying, laughter, and monkey calls) are outlined.</jats:p>",

Be that as it may, engagement techniques are still in their infancies, and land-use planners are struggling for tools to facilitate discourse on public values related to landscape change. Accordingly, this article responds to urgent needs to define planning processes that represent the values of stakeholders, empower communities, and lead to landscape changes that maintain and enhance a community's sense of place. It does so by exploring the combination of photo elicitation and narrative as a form of civic science aimed at engaging citizens in the planning process. Findings from a study incorporating these techniques are used to show the merits of this participatory form of inquiry. The authors argue the use of stories, unlike traditional public engagement techniques, allows the landscape-change process to be situated within the social meanings relevant to a community. </jats:p>",

The research takes a systems view of organisations, recognising that there are multiple interdependencies within and between different organisations that influence their abilities to respond and recover. This means that effective resilience management for any one organisation must look beyond that single organisation and consider the resilience of other organisations on which it depends. Particular aspects of organisational resilience focused on by the research team include: how individual organisations are positioned to respond to and recover from major crises; their ability to communicate and share information in order to direct resources effectively during crises; and the legal and contractual frameworks within which they will need to operate during crisis response and recovery. None of these issues can be resolved by a single organisation acting unilaterally. Organisations are required to work together towards greater system resilience.</jats:p>"

The model is based on the building blocks of a comprehensive BCMS and SMART maturity levels (ie specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound). In terms of principles of maturity, the dashboard draws its inspiration from the Software Engineering Institute's capability maturity model. However, the commonalities end there, as the components of a BCMS are different from those of software development. This customer-centric paper addresses the need of professionals who are entrusted with developing, implementing and validating business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

The TMDL programme has received renewed attention since the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published revised guidelines in 1991. Under the TMDL programme, pollutant-specific TMDLs are developed for impaired waters. A TMDL specifies the pollutant load reductions needed to achieve water quality standards. The magnitude and distribution of the load reductions among pollution sources can have implications for watershed stakeholders. Implementing the TMDL load reductions is the responsibility of the individual US states. Adaptive implementation occurs when limited corrective actions designed to improve water quality are implemented using available information and data; and as information and data availability improve implementation adjustments are made, i.e. 'learn while doing'. While several policy tools are available to ensure that corrective actions are implemented, economic incentives are most often used, particularly for non-point source pollution sources. Typically, successful TMDL implementation depends on careful planning and stakeholder engagement. However, meaningful stakeholder engagement requires that stakeholders be empowered to make decisions about outcomes relevant to their goals, which may be problematic given the narrow way the TMDL process is currently enacted. Planning using watershed-scale models to assess plausible load reduction scenarios is most likely to produce credible TMDL pollutant load estimates. Models should be coupled with adaptive implementation so that pollutant load estimates can be revised as better information becomes available. TMDL implementation plans should consider both barriers to and opportunities for implementation.</jats:p>"

Data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were combined with data from the 2000 HRS exit interview to analyze Black and White participants' completion rates. Whites were more likely than Blacks to grant durable power of attorney for health care, to complete a written will, and to informally communicate their wishes; group differences remained after controlling for personal characteristics. Also, Blacks were less likely than Whites to engage in more than one form of end-of-life planning. The authors speculate that sociocultural differences in trust in the medical system and knowledge about advance directives may partially account for these findings. The findings may aid policy makers and practitioners in increasing the level of participation in advance directives. </jats:p>",

One way to create compelling and interesting programs that meet the needs of students is to include them in the planning, development, and evaluation of such programs through focus groups. Children provide a perspective about their particular needs, interests, and understandings that cannot be obtained from adults or health care professionals. When children take part in program planning, the programs become more appealing to children because of the feedback from their perspective. This article describes ways focus groups can be used to examine the effectiveness and usability of health-related programs. Included is a discussion of the pros and cons of using focus groups with school-age children for planning and evaluating programs and guidelines for conducting focus groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As most of our readers will be aware from previous publications and from the special articles contained in this edition, a lot of work has gone into highlighting the implications of an influenza pandemic for critical care services and trying to work out how to make the best use of the resources that may be available. The latest Department of Health Document ‘Pandemic influenza: surge capacity and prioritisation in health services – provisional UK guidance’ (available on the DH website) has made an encouraging start in providing official recognition of the problems likely to be encountered as a result of limited bed capacity, and also supports the concept that triaging decisions cannot be left to secondary care (and particularly critical care specialists) alone. Regrettably, however, even if its recommendations for patient selection are fully followed and the number of inappropriate referrals to critical care is reduced significantly, there is still a strong probability that during the peak of a pandemic the number of patients who are likely to benefit from critical care will still significantly exceed bed capacity – even if this is maximally expanded. </jats:p><jats:p> In the original working of the Critical Care Contingency Planning Group a draft document on Phased Responses and Triaging was produced as a starter to addressing these difficulties. Further work on this was then put on-hold pending the production of official ethical guidance and other documentation to address these problems. However, now that these have been finalised and we still face potential dilemmas about how ICUs will be able to cope, feedback from critical care network discussions has persuaded us that it may be useful to circulate a revised version of this document, updated to include more recent recommendations, in the hope that this may be of help in assisting local planning. </jats:p><jats:p> In particular, the document addresses two concepts that were initially felt to be inappropriate or unacceptable, but which now may be considered reasonable/realistic. These are the possibility of using some method of lottery selection if there are several appropriate referrals but insufficient bed numbers, and the fact that at some point there may be a requirement to accept temporary closure of intensive care to further referrals if no beds are available. It is hoped that consensus support for the principles of this document may help to produce reassurance for staff (with the support of local PCTs and Trust Management) that if potentially preventable deaths occur in such circumstances they will not be vulnerable to litigation or professional criticism when no other treatment options were available. </jats:p>",

Spatio-temporal patterns of fishing pressure on UK marine landscapes, and their implications for spatial planning and management. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1081–1091. The spatio-temporal distribution of fishing pressure on marine landscapes in offshore UK (England and Wales) waters is assessed, based on a time-series of fishing vessel monitoring system (VMS) data for UK and foreign fleets deploying beam and otter trawls, and scallop dredges. The results reveal that marine landscapes with coarse or mixed sediments and weak or moderate tide stress are heavily fished. Marine landscapes experienced different intensities of fishing pressure depending on their spatial location in UK offshore waters and the regional heterogeneity of landscape types. Spatial patterns of fishing pressure vary by region, but within regions, patches of high fishing pressure remain centred at the same locations. When designing marine management plans, it is important to take account of the spatial extent and patchiness of fishing activity, and the consistency with which areas are fished in the same region from year to year. Descriptions of the spatial distribution of fishing pressures will become more meaningful at a local level if they also reflect the sensitivity of the habitats to those pressures. The further development of such sensitivity analyses, using life-history traits or measures of benthic production, is now becoming a priority.</jats:p>",

The aim of this report is to analyze the relevance of individualized eye models for refractive treatment planning from a theoretical point of view.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>A method for the customization of eye models based on various types of measurement data of a specific patient is presented and the calculation of optimal ablation profiles and IOL shapes by means of ray tracing through customized model eyes are discussed.

Calculations have shown that in theory ray-tracing optimized ablation profiles do not leave any residual aberrations in the eye whereas wavefront-guided corrections were found to have the potential to increase specific types of aberrations by a factor of two. This is due to the negligence of the multi-lens structure of the eye.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>\n              Optical ray tracing algorithms allow the highest degree of customization. The systematic induction of higher order aberrations by means of wavefront-guided treatments or standard IOLs has to be overcome by such a method. However, these theoretical observations must be compared to the corresponding measurement accuracies and precisions and they must be supported by future clinical trials.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">One assumption of pandemic planning is that, during an influenza outbreak, acute care facilities may be quickly overrun with patients and as such must prepare in advance. In order to operationalise one component of a pandemic plan, Capital Health in Edmonton, Alberta, piloted a mobile triage centre facility (portable isolation containment systems) and tested pandemic influenza triage and assessment guidelines in the winter of 2006–07. The mobile model provided emergency department surge capacity for communicable disease emergencies with scalable deployment capabilities. The deployable module has several advantages over a fixed structure like a community facility. The triage facility is a location for short-term treatments, such as intravenous therapy, prescriptions, medication distribution, and self-care education, which are needed during a pandemic influenza outbreak. Decanting infectious patients away from the emergency department protects a highly-vulnerable hospitalised group from viral transmission. Based on the pilot, it is found that community triage centres are a viable support option for emergency departments in an urban setting during pandemic influenza.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since humans can walk with an infinite variety of postures and limb movements, there is no unique solution to the modeling problem to predict human gait motions. Accordingly, we test herein the hypothesis that the redundancy of human walking mechanisms makes solving for human joint profiles and force time histories an indeterminate problem best solved by inverse dynamics and optimization methods. A new optimization-based human-modeling framework is thus described for predicting three-dimensional human gait motions on level and inclined planes. The basic unknowns in the framework are the joint motion time histories of a 25-degree-of-freedom human model and its six global degrees of freedom. The joint motion histories are calculated by minimizing an objective function such as deviation of the trunk from upright posture that relates to the human model’s performance. A variety of important constraints are imposed on the optimization problem, including (1) satisfaction of dynamic equilibrium equations by requiring the model’s zero moment point (ZMP) to lie within the instantaneous geometrical base of support, (2) foot collision avoidance, (3) limits on ground-foot friction, and (4) vanishing yawing moment. Analytical forms of objective and constraint functions are presented and discussed for the proposed human-modeling framework in which the resulting optimization problems are solved using gradient-based mathematical programing techniques. When the framework is applied to the modeling of bipedal locomotion on level and inclined planes, acyclic human walking motions that are smooth and realistic as opposed to less natural robotic motions are obtained. The aspects of the modeling framework requiring further investigation and refinement, as well as potential applications of the framework in biomechanics, are discussed.</jats:p>",

To improve the accuracy and efficiency of treatment plans for helical tomotherapy, we have developed a dual-source model to characterize the radiation emitted from the head of a commercial helical tomotherapy accelerator. Percentage depth dose (PDD) and beam profiles computed using the dual-source model with the EGS/BEAMnrc Monte Carlo package agree within 2% of measurements for a wide range of field sizes, which suggests that the proposed dual-source model provides an adequate representation of the tomotherapy head for dose calculations in routine treatment planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this study is to develop an Automatic Post-processing Tool for four-dimensional (4D) treatment planning (APT4D) that enables the user to perform some necessary procedures related to 4D treatment planning, such as automated image registration, automatic propagation of regions of interest, and dose distribution transformation. Demons-based deformable registrations were performed to map the moving phase images (such as the end-inhalation phase or 0% phase) to the reference phase (typically the end-exhalation fixed phase or 50% phase). Contours were automatically propagated into the moving phase using the image registration results. The dose distribution of each moving phase was transformed to the fixed phase and subsequently was summed as an average with equal weighting factor. To validate the application of APT4D utility, the 4D computed tomography (CT) images of a lung cancer patient and an abdominal cancer patient were acquired and resorted into ten respiratory phases. 4D plans based on the 4D CT images were developed. The correlation coefficient ranged from 0.992 to 0.999 for the re-sampled deformed moving phase image against the fixed phase image for the lung patient plan and from 0.977 to 0.999 for the abdominal patient plan. For all the organs, the match indices between the manual contours and automatic contour propagation results were around 0.92 to 0.95. The 4D composite dose-volume histogram showed dosimetric reductions for liver and kidneys in the high dose region. The APT4D adds automation, efficiency, and functionality, while integrating the whole process of 4D treatment planning. </jats:p>",

In 2007 the gradual elaboration of HM for all municipalities started after the completion of all pilot‐schemes in several parts of South Tyrol. The experiences made in Cortaccia are taken into account for all these new and definite HM. During the past few years HM have established as a cartographic basis for clear‐sighted urban and infrastructural planning in alpine areas. For the elaboration of HM the local risk must not be considered, i.e. without respect of the potential material damage in the wake of occurrence of natural hazards. But later on, the local management of the urban and infrastructural development as well as the planning of particular precautionary measures and targeted technical actions have to be carried out taking into account each location's specific risk. Almost three years after handing over the HM to the mayor of Cortaccia urban consequences for the municipality are described and the first precautionary measures and technical actions that were taken are presented.</jats:p>",

The study enables to understand the consumptive water demand of sorghum and water use efficiency in relation to yield. The results can be used for efficient management of both rainfall and limited water resources available for sorghum production.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nSeasonal Evapotranspiration (ET) losses were studied for non- irrigated kharif sorghum at Akola and Parbhani and for Rahuri and Coimbatore seasonal ET losses were studied for rabi sorghum for well distributed normal and deficit rainfall years. In the normal rainfall years ET losses were more compared to deficit rainfall years. However, water use efficiency was found higher during deficit rainfall years than normal rainfall years. The seasonal ET- yield relationship was found positively correlated but insignificant for Akola, Parbhani, Rahuri and significant for Coimbatore (5% level). At Akola and Parbhani optimum yields were observed for seasonal ET of around 486 mm and 470 mm respectively. At Coimbatore maximum yield was observed for seasonal ET of 416 mm whereas at Rahuri yield was maximum when ET loss was about 475 mm. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) ranged from 6.3 to 12.2 mm for kharif season and 5.5 to 10.1 mm for rabi sorghum. Crop coefficient Kc was found negligible during early growth stages and reached peak during flowering stage and declined subsequently during maturity to harvesting stage.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe study revealed that during deficit rainfall years life saving irrigation need to be applied for all stations        under consideration. If limited irrigation is available irrigations at vegetative stage (25-35 days after sowing) and at boot- flowering stage (55-65 days after sowing) be given. The boot stage is found to be the most critical stage and if only one irrigation is available, it may be given at this stage. Water stress at this stage is found to cause reduction in yield by 35 to 40%.</jats:p>"

To satisfy this requirement, we propose an accurate model based on mixed integer programming for optimizing cooperative logistics networks where “round transportation” exists together with “depot transportation” including lower limit constraints of loading ratio for round transportation vehicles. Furthermore, to achieve interactive response performance, a dummy load is introduced into the model instead of integer variables. The experimental result shows the proposed method obtains an accurate solution within interactive response time. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Considerable attention has been devoted in recent years to the proposition that private providers offer efficient alternatives to government-financed and administered secondary schools. This study examines the rise of private secondary schools in Uganda and calculates a unit cost estimate for representative samples of secondary schools, both private and government. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Setting</jats:title><jats:p> A unit cost analysis was conducted among 28 randomly selected secondary schools in Uganda. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Research Design</jats:title><jats:p> A national sample of secondary schools was stratified in three ways. First, schools were selected according to the type of school, allowing half of the sample to be government schools and the other half private schools. A second stratification involved urbanicity, so both urban and rural schools were included in adequate numbers to allow subsequent comparison. Finally, the school sample was stratified by the four primary geographic regions in Uganda: Central (n = 10), Eastern (n = 6), Northern (n = 6), and Western (n = 6) Regions. All findings are based on analysis of sample survey data derived from randomly selected administrators, teachers, and parents of students. Using secondary school leaving examinations as the measure of effect, the article examines the relative cost effectiveness of private and government schools. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> Private schools in Uganda appear to be attractive, low-cost alternatives to government secondary schools. Per-pupil spending is significantly related to learning achievement, regardless of whether a student attends a private or government school. Thus, if higher performance is the desired ultimate student outcome, additional spending will be required. For their per-pupil cost, this article shows that private schools produce good learning gains—better, in fact, on a dollar basis, than government schools. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions/Recommendations</jats:title><jats:p> Unit cost data, when combined with reliable and valid measures of student learning achievement, are helpful to policy analysts and policy makers in determining the most efficient use of money. Although the comparatively high unit costs of government schools in this study are affected by the inclusion of capital costs, there is strong evidence to support the contention that private schools are a cost-effective alternative to government schools in the provision of general secondary education. Recommendations for future research include extending the analysis beyond the comparison of costs and examination scores by also considering the intangible component gains of schooling experiences in both private and government schools. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

For example, in mature fields offshore Brazil, production platforms with minimal open work space and without workover rigs have been a challenge for restoring production in wells with serious scaling problems. The scale build-up reduces production, month by month, until a rig has to be mobilized to replace the production string.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Trying to recover production efficiently, service and operating companies have been presenting solutions that circumvent the practical limitations of these locations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the last three years, an operator's engineering department has worked with service company engineers to develop the means to rig up a 1-3/4-in., 4500-m-long coiled tubing string in a work area of 234 sq. meters and with a crane with a 12-ton maximum capacity. This cooperation allowed intervention in wells on rigless platforms, reducing working time, environmental impacts and costs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>These interventions helped to increase oil production from Field A in the Campos Basin and gas production from Field B in the Santos Basin, currently the most important gas field offshore Brazil.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Both fields suffer from severe scale deposition -- barium sulfate in Field A and calcium carbonate in field B -- which builds up in the production string and effectively reduces the internal diameter, consequently reducing production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The new successful interventions in these fields using rigless coiled tubing and scale removal techniques enhanced the hydrocarbon production from these fields.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In Field A (oil production), interventions were performed in seven (7) wells, providing around a 40% increase in production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In Field B (gas production), interventions were performed in five (5) wells, providing a production increase of around 27% per day.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper details the planning, logistics and techniques used to successfully meet both challenges. The same solutions would apply in other fields around the world where platform space and scarcity of rigs limit an operator's ability to remediate scale or other wellbore problems that constrain hydrocarbon production.</jats:p>",

Concessions in this region are in various stages of exploration and require completion of an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process to comply with Peruvian regulations. Baseline studies needed for this process include sampling of environmental, physical, and socioeconomic parameters. The region is remote and undeveloped; over 90% is covered by primary rainforest and inhabited by indigenous communities. The region also has some potential for the presence of uncontacted people or communities in voluntary isolation. This paper will highlight the steps taken by ERM, with the support from Dr. Martha Rodriguez (who is also a Profesor at Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru) and HSE LLC to prepare field teams for the responsibility of interacting with indigenous communities in remote jungle environments, as well as the eventuality of encountering uncontacted people.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To date, we developed preventive measures and guidelines, a sociocultural contingency response plan for uncontacted communities or communities in voluntary isolation, and a communication protocol. These innovative and unique tools provide practical guidelines to minimize the risk for encounters with uncontacted people and outline steps in the event that such a contingency should occur. A process of due diligence was also undertaken to summarize publications, research, accounts, and hypotheses on the potential presence or transit of uncontacted people through particular areas. An evaluation of our clients' practices was completed to ensure consistency with policies, procedures, and reporting requirements. Contractors and employees were engaged via workshops and training. Finally, ERM Peru adopted a policy on working in areas potentially used by uncontacted peoples. The process, tools, and plans developed can serve as models for others working in the region or similar remote areas with the potential presence of uncontacted people or communities in voluntary isolation.</jats:p>",

The first part will deal with surgical guides based on tomographies or CT scan data often using dedicated software, but manually fabricated. In the second part, CT‐derived drill guides are discussed, which are fabricated by means of CAD/CAM technology or other computer‐controlled technology. The deviations between the position of the implants at the planning stage and after the surgery are of utmost importance, especially when flapless procedures are applied. The maximal deviations are often not stated in the literature. This should be taken into account when a system is applied clinically.</jats:p>",

Latinos and subjects with less than a high school education discussed ACP more often with family or friends (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;.06) and clinicians (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;.03) than other ethnic groups and subjects with more education.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS: </jats:bold> ACP involves distinct steps including contemplation, discussions, and documentation. The ACP paradigm should be broadened to include contemplation and discussions. Promoting discussions with family and friends may be one of the most important targets for ACP interventions, and literacy‐ and language‐appropriate advance directives may help reverse patterns of sociodemographic disparities in ACP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, priority areas for biodiversity are relatively well known, yet few detailed plans exist to direct conservation action within them, despite urgent need. Madagascar, like other globally recognized biodiversity hot spots, has complex spatial patterns of endemism that differ among taxonomic groups, creating challenges for the selection of within-country priorities. We show, in an analysis of wide taxonomic and geographic breadth and high spatial resolution, that multitaxonomic rather than single-taxon approaches are critical for identifying areas likely to promote the persistence of most species. Our conservation prioritization, facilitated by newly available techniques, identifies optimal expansion sites for the Madagascar government's current goal of tripling the land area under protection. Our findings further suggest that high-resolution multitaxonomic approaches to prioritization may be necessary to ensure protection for biodiversity in other global hot spots.</jats:p>",
