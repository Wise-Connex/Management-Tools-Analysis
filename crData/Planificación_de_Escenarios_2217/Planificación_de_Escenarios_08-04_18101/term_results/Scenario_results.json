Identifying, assessing and managing risks associated with these substances are integral part of our continuous efforts to improve safety. The management of risks involves reducing the risks for both inside and outside our sites to a level As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The principles involved in the assessment and management of major risks are: Hazard identificationPreliminary risks evaluationDetailed and quantified risks analysisRisks assessment and ALARP demonstrationDevelopment of a priority-based program of improvements and of a major risks register.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There are two approaches for risks assessment, Aggregate Risk Assessment and Scenarios Based Risk Assessment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although these methodologies are often complementary, the first approach allows calculating the aggregate risk to personnel, expressed as Individual and Societal Risk. Thus the advantage of this approach is to address the global risk, the principal disadvantage is that it doesn't allow identifying the main critical scenarios of accident and the final results (Individual and Societal Risks) are hidden in mathematical calculations, with the use of computer model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the second approach, the Scenarios Based Risk Assessment, the critical events are selected in the preliminary evaluation step and studied in detail to establish the severity of damages and the likelihood of occurrence. The recommended methodology for the detailed risks analysis is the Bow-Tie approach (causes tree – consequences tree and safety barriers). Each critical scenario is assessed with respect to the Company risk acceptance criteria based on a Risk Ranking Matrix.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This methodology ensures the demonstration of the ALARP level of the risks and the identification of the Safety Critical Measures (SCM). Definition and ranking of the additional risk-reducing measures allows preparing a priority based program of actions and a register of the Major risks.</jats:p>",

Systems that purport to support scenario planning are complex and difficult to use and do not fully support all phases of scenario management. We introduce scenario as a core component of decision making systems and present a life cycle approach for scenario management, which helps the decision maker with idea generation, scenario planning, development, organisation, analysis, execution, evaluation, and decision support. This research designs and develops a domain independent framework and architecture for Scenario-driven Decision Support Systems Generator that aligns the DSS with the scenario management process. We then propose a generalised evaluation process that allows homogeneous and heterogeneous scenario comparisons among multiple instances of similar and dissimilar scenarios respectively. The framework and architecture is implemented and validated through a concrete prototype.</p>",

We performed an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis using Expert Choice to determine which data mining package was best suitable for us. Deliberating a dozen alternatives and objectives led us to a series of pair-wise comparisons. When further synthesizing the results, Expert Choice helped us provide a clear rationale for the decision. The issue is that data mining technology is changing very rapidly. Our article focused only on the major suppliers typically available in the market place.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Unsuccessful zonal isolation and occurrence of sustained casing pressure indicate transport of fluids along a conductive pathway in a well's cemented annulus. Conductive pathways in cement can be grouped into three general classes: separation of the cement and formation or casing to form a micro annulus; micro fractures in the cement; and gas/mud channels in the cement matrix. In geologic storage of CO2 similar conductive paths are most likely to be responsible for CO2 leakage out of the reservoir along a wellbore. Moreover, cement is reactive with both CO2 gas and acidified brine (a product of CO2 dissolution into formation water) and the resulting cement product is of lower mechanical strength than the intact cement.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recent research indicates that in neat cement the reaction rate is slow and long term degradation of intact cement is not a risk. Reaction at surfaces of conductive pathways raises a new set of issues, however. In any field situation a cemented annulus, and conductive pathways within it, support the effective stress of surrounding rock and pore fluid. If the mechanical properties of the opposing faces of the conductive pathway are altered by chemical reaction, or if the effective stress changes, then relative displacement (opening or closing) of the faces will occur.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our lab has developed a system to i) create a fracture in a cement core that is representative of what one would expect in a conductive pathway within a cemented annulus and ii) measure the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture under confining stress. We use this apparatus to characterize how increasing the confining pressure controls the size of the aperture. We reacted the surfaces of the fractured cores and repeated the stress/aperture measurements. The results are consistent with the points of contacts between the core halves becoming mechanically weaker after reaction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our observations support the possibility that conductive pathways can be self-sealing. Degradation of the cement's mechanical properties by reaction with acidic aqueous phase at the surface of the fracture would lead to a narrower pathway, if effective stress is unchanged. Further work is underway to measure the extent of irreversible (plastic) deformation in these experiments. Our ultimate goal is to project the core scale relationship onto the well scale to determine the conditions (earth stresses, cement exposure to reactive fluids, and leak source pressure) under which a conduit tends to seal.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of ontologies to represent data and knowledge combined with service-based software provides new opportunities for the integration of command and control systems, simulations, and dynamic data. The U.S. Department of Defense's Global Information Grid (GIG) is envisioned to integrate complex communications networks, data from disparate sources, and services-oriented applications. The GIG will provide analysis, decision support, and information visualization to both human and automated users. This paper describes concepts and architecture for an experiment which demonstrates the use of knowledge-based technologies to support tactical maneuver. Open source and in-house software were linked together to conduct a simple simulation of a realistic mission (move from A to B along a “safe” route). Events which may affect the route are injected, reported, and stored in the knowledge base to simulate battlespace dynamics. Through the use of an automated reasoner, events which affect the route are identified and passed to the decision maker to stimulate possible replanning. Follow-on efforts will convert the maneuver related software into web services, moving closer to the GIG concept. Discussed is the value of a formal ontology within the domain of military maneuver, architectural approach, and lessons learned. </jats:p>",
