      "abstract": "<jats:p>The majority of radiation treatment planning problems are relatively straightforward, involving only specified gantry angles in a treatment plane which is perpendicular to the patient longitudinal axis. In addition, there are a number of more complex three‐dimensional problems which require combined rotation of the gantry, collimator, and turntable for their solutions. These include, for example, the use of non‐coplanar fields and oblique treatment planes, the matching of field edges in three dimensions, the treatment of the breast with opposing tangential fields, and the treatment of inclined elongated lesions. Unfortunately, there is no general systematic approach to the solution of these more complex problems. One may attempt an analytic solution, but this approach is often too cumbersome and tedious. On the other hand, one may resort to a “trial and error” session with the simulator. This paper, therefore, presents a mathematical method which is easily applied and applicable to a wide variety of complex three‐dimensional treatment planning problems. The method considers the gantry, collimator, and turntable as coordinate systems. These coordinate systems are derivable from each other by specified coordinate transformations, which contain the rotation angles of the gantry, collimator, and turntable. Within this mathematical framework, the treatment planning problems are found to reduce to two general types, of which various clinical examples are then given. Key words: treatment planning, coordinate systems, coordinate transformations, three‐dimensional treatment planning, rotation operators</jats:p>",

The evaluation demonstrates that past research is biased to produce overestimates of net program impact. A new estimate is derived to account more completely for the effects of the social context and socioeconomic development on fertility. This estimate indicates that 5 percent of the variation in crude birth rate decline for 89 developing countries is due to family planning programs. This is substantially less than past estimates.</jats:p>",

To retain a holistic, dialectical framework, humanistic elements from existential phenomenology are considered, although such humanism must be materially grounded. The notions of contradiction, alienation, seriality, and ideology are used to illustrate the potential of a critical, humanistic Marxian framework for understanding the nature, production, and reproduction of lived experience. </jats:p>",

The analysis is based upon a newly available data source—Federal income tax returns. Approximately 90% of the US population is covered by this data series. The matching of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) returns between filing dates enables the determination both of the origin and of the destination of migrants, with few of the risks of geographic miscoding present. These data illustrate that despite divergent economic fluctuations over the past nine years, the patterns of interstate migration have remained virtually unchanged. With few exceptions, the number of migrants either leaving or entering a particular state comprise identical proportions over time. Unlike migration data obtained from the Current Population Survey which enables the study of regional mobility only, the IRS data document current state-to-state flows that can be constructed on an annual basis. Comparisons are also made with the Current Work History Sample. In addition, these data offer considerable evidence that current residence has a significant impact on the selection of a destination. The resistance of migration patterns to large economic and social shifts during the period examined also implies that the explanation of individual migration determinants and the forecasting of aggregate migration flows should be treated as separate research questions. The potential of the data for the addition of further demographic detail and for use in forecasting also is considered. </jats:p>",

The first concerns the construction of an adequate method, which should (a) take explicitly into account the multidimensional character of a regional profile, (b) disentangle policy effects from autonomous developments, (c) make it possible to compare the effects of different policy instruments, and (d) be capable of dealing with theoretical constructs and measurement errors. The second problem relates to the scarcity of regional data, both concerning time-series and cross-sectional data. A linear structural equation model is presented which meets the first set of conditions. This model is then modified in such a way that it can be estimated by pooling cross-sectional and time-series data, thus increasing the number of observations. In addition, as an application the effects of regional industrialization policy on investments in the Netherlands during the period 1973–1976 are estimated. </jats:p>",
