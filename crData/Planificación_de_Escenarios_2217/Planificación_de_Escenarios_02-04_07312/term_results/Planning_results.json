This is not an accident. To the extent that navigating the future occupies an uneasy place between rigorous research and science fiction, it requires contributions from many minds, not just one or two.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although promotion of the compact city is now enshrined in land-use planning policy in many countries, including the United Kingdom, there is little evidence to support the many claims in its favour. In seeking to provide empirical data to advance the debate, one of the key problems researchers face is the task of measuring urban compactness. Research on the compact city is hampered both by a lack of consensus on its meaning and by the absence of recognised indicators for measuring it. This paper describes the development of a large set of urban compactness indicators used in an investigation of social sustainability outcomes in twenty-five English towns and cities. The paper begins by identifying and defining the different aspects of urban compactness, then outlines the indicators (including sources and methods) used for measuring each of these aspects. Finally, the values of these indicators for a range of English towns and cities are presented and reviewed. The aim of the paper is to contribute methodological tools to the compact city debate and provide a model for further research, essential in this field. </jats:p>",

Traditionally, studies of distribution of activities within metropolitan regions have been carried out on vastly aggregated spatial units of analysis based on census geography. Recent innovations in computer technology and software developoment in the field of geographic information systems have allowed much more comprehensive, high-level resolution studies to be undertaken. The study, presented in this paper, is an attempt to develop a fine-grained inspection of the evolution of suburban growth patterns through a detailed documentation of land-use-cover changes in the suburban periphery of Seattle. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to provide input to a discussion on the potential for reduced commuting with retained accessibility to work, when the development of information technology sets new conditions, and provides new opportunities, for the location of workplaces. The potential impacts on commuting of a node-structured Stockholm region is calculated. The result of the calculation is presented as a comparison between the node-structured city and a reference scenario for the year 2010. The reference scenario has been designed by the planning authorities in the region. The calculation started with the selection of a number of nodes. The exact number of nodes was not defined in advance. Rather it was a result of requirements for reasonable public transport and on reasonable population densities. This resulted in approximately 100 nodes. These were then treated as attractors of workplaces in the calculation. Some of the commuting trips in the reference scenario were rerouted according to specified assumptions. One assumption was that the desire to cut a trip would increase with distance. Another was that the desire to start working in a node would increase with decreasing distance to the node. A third assumption was that the propensity to work from home would increase with the distance to the workplace in the reference scenario. The calculation resulted in a scenario with considerably shorter commuting trips, with a consequent reduction in commuting volumes, and a subsequent increase in walking and cycling, compared with the reference scenario. </jats:p>",

However, these public regulatory mechanisms are themselves in a state of flux, often as a function of internal conflict between government policy sectors. Internationalisation itself is also an agent of change and we illustrate this using the example of retail regulatory systems in Britain and the Netherlands at the time of Wal-Mart's entry into the EU. In both countries, an ambivalent stance by the central government was evidenced by the publication of reports by planning authorities and investigations by competition authorities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a simulation approach to modeling the linkages between physical infrastructure systems and the urban economy is developed. A simulation approach based on probabilistically specifying the key model relationships is effective for situations that involve substantial uncertainty, and is particularly suited to assessing risk from natural hazards. In this paper, a model of economic losses from earthquakes is developed and applied to the Memphis, Tennessee, region of the United States. We focus on water as a critical infrastructure service supporting the urban economy. The methodological approach involves systems integration of natural-science, engineering, and social-science databases and models. The concept of infrastructure services provides the linchpin in this integration process. Key spatial, temporal, and functional dimensions of infrastructure services are explicitly modeled in the simulation framework. The resulting model permits the analyst to compare the effectiveness of alternative actions, including both predisaster mitigation and postdisaster emergency-response activities. The model is calibrated in part with data from the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. Results for several scenario earthquakes indicate the likely range of loss from economic disruption as well as uncertainties associated with the loss estimates. Sensitivity analysis indicates that one type of risk-management strategy for the water system, retrofitting pump stations, appears to be highly effective in reducing expected losses from future disasters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Province of the Punjab underwent a number of attempts to decentralize the health sector in the 1990s. Among the most important were the decentralization of financial management within the district, the Sheikhupura PHC Pilot Project, the establishment of the District Health Authorities and District Health Management Teams, the creation of semi‐autonomous hospitals and the programme of District Health Government (DHG). These usually received donor support and promotion, and emerged from within the provincial Department of Health, and more specifically the Secretariat and the internationally supported Second Family Health Project (FH2). Of particular significance was the DHG change, which involved a decentralization to the district, the appointment of powerful Chief Executives, the formation of District Management Committees and purchaser–provider separation. The paper reviews these proposals, focusing on the need to build on experiences and learning lessons from pilot projects, reform continuity, developing consultation and involvement and policy analysis. The latter indicates the importance of developing more in‐depth policy analysis around the role of the central organization, the form of decentralization and the purchaser–provider separation. The paper concludes by underlining the need to ensure that political strategy and in‐depth policy are appropriately coordinated in the policy process.

It appears from current practice that, in order best to meet performance criteria derived from the SEA literature, these three types of SEA should be applied within a tiered system. Although the recently adopted EC SEA Directive includes provisions for the SEA of plans and programmes, the analysis of current assessment practice indicates that consideration should be given to extending the formal requirements to cover the SEA of policies as certain tasks are probably better dealt with in policy-SEA than in plan-SEA or programme-SEA. </jats:p>",

Moorhouse Associates Inc. was contracted to develop and implement a Public Participation Plan for the South Central Texas Region. The two goals of the public process were to take planning information out to the public and to provide a format for bringing the public opinion back to the planning group. The overall goal of the project was to provide public input throughout the planning process that will facilitate the development of a water plan that is widely accepted by the public. By using county government to establish focus groups, participation was encouraged from all of the twenty‐one counties in the region. The tools used in the process included an Internet site, surveys, focus groups, public meetings, community group presentations, media communications, and newspaper clippings. The public participation process as implemented, maintained communication throughout the planning process and at key decision points. This ongoing communication helped alleviate an initial uneasiness with the integrated resource planning approach.</jats:p>",

One consequence is that the issue of health sector performance is moving higher on the agenda of many developing countries, and particularly that of the corporate performance of health sector staff. Along with this movement has come increased attention to strengthening evidence‐based management decision‐making. To date, studies on measuring health sector performance, have had little impact on developing country health systems and have been limited to explorations primarily at an operational level. However, there is a growing recognition that there is a need to strengthen the policy function of ministries and their ability to monitor policy impact. </jats:p><jats:p>Sri Lanka is one country that has identified the need to strengthen policy at national level. Many developing countries, like Sri Lanka, are familiar with input, process and output dimensions of operational performance. However, most are not ready to engage in routine performance assessment that can strengthen policy processes at national level. This paper explores (1) the implication and the use of indicators to support evidence based policy decision‐making, and (2) the complexity of doing so in Ministries of Health that are undergoing some form of health sector reform.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper emphasizes that new forms of organizational support are required for performance management at policy level. A conceptual framework for managing the collection and use of performance evidence is developed, including proposals for the introduction of outcome indicators into that process. The paper concludes with recommendations on initiatives required to develop appropriate organizational and technical capacity to engage with performance management at policy level and for further research towards creating ministries of health as ‘learning organizations’ that can change and adapt with informed decisions.

Now Ogilvy shows how we can use this cutting-edge method for social change in our own neighborhoods. In Building Better Futures, Ogilvy presents a profound new vision of how the world is changing--and how it can be changed for the better. Ogilvy argues that self-defined communities, rather than individuals or governments, have become the primary agents for social change. Towns, professional associations, and interest groups of all kinds help shape the future in all the ways that matter most, from schools and hospitals to urban development. The key to improvement is scenario planning--a process that draws on groups of people, both lay and expert, to draft narratives that spell out possible futures, some to avoid, some inspiring hope. Scenario planning has revolutionized both public and private planning, leading to everything from the diverse product lines that have revived the auto industry, to a timely decision by the state of Colorado to avoid pouring millions into an oil-shale industry that never materialized. But never before has anyone proposed that it be taken up by society as a whole. Drawing on years of experience in both academia and the private sector, where he developed both a keen sense of how businesses work best and an abiding passion for changing the world, James Ogilvy provides the tools we need to create better communities: better health, better education, better lives.</jats:p>",

It has been repeatedly hypothesized that CBI schemes need to be grounded in national as well as local traditions of solidarity. This paper presents a typology of informal risk sharing arrangements (IRSAs) in a rural area of North‐Western Burkina Faso and discusses their <jats:italic>modus operandi</jats:italic> as well as the underlying concepts of solidarity and reciprocity. The research was explicitly multi‐disciplinary, combining anthropological and economic as well as qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Focus group and interview data were complemented by a census of existing IRSAs. In addition to presenting the main features of existing institutions, the paper discusses whether IRSAs can serve as entry points for CBI schemes. In spite of the fact that existing IRSAs fulfil important solidarity functions in the rural Burkinian context, we conclude that they cannot serve as institutional models for more formalized CBI schemes. Community participation in a future CBI scheme will need to tap into existing notions of solidarity and mutuality. The CBI scheme itself, however, needs to be newly tailored.

Traditional “bricks and mortar” businesses are facing the prospects of losing their competitive advantage owing to the emergence of new competitors in the “new economy”. The regulatory changes in the financial services industry and the explosion in the use of the Internet for e‐commerce have given rise to unforeseen competitors in the banking industry – the “non‐bank” financial services providers and the “pure” Internet banks. These competitors are not restrained by the high costs of the branch infrastructure and as a result are able to differentiate on the basis of offering high interest rates. These players are fast and flexible. In spite of being newcomers, they have the potential to grow and recast the rules of the banking industry. Yet, incumbent banks still have the strongest sustainable competitive advantage: their corporate identity.

Well shut-in time is a critical factor because the wells are producing high volumes (up to 56 000 bbl/day initially). Due to this, a project group was formed to improve the efficiency of coiled tubing operations on the Heidrun field. The field center is a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) at 330 m water depth. Because of rig movement, a complicated rig-up structure with heave compensation is used. On most operations, both coil tubing and wireline is used throughout the different operational phases. This comes in addition to pumping and return handling equipment. A lot of equipment is rigged up in a relatively confined area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The project group started off with identifying all operational steps and finding the critical path. Areas with high potential for savings were identified and the cost for proposed improvements were calculated. Systematic implementation of improvements to the rig-up equipment and procedures gave a reduction in the rig-up time from 82 hours down to 11.5 hours over a 6-month period. As an extra bonus, the operations were carried out at a higher safety level than before. The savings for the client were calculated to USD 450 000 per well, whilst the cost of new equipment, modifications and implementation was USD 110 000.</jats:p>",

After outlining the scale and nature of contemporary development gaps in Italy, the author explores the way these inequalities have changed, showing that convergence in the 1960s and early 1970s gave way to divergence, and identifying the respective roles of productivity, employment, and demographic growth in shaping the overall trend in inequality. To examine what underlay the aggregate trends attention is paid to the comparative evolution of twenty Italian regions, indicating clearly the changing relative fortunes of the metropolitan northwest, the Mezzogiorno, the Third Italy, and the Adriatic coastal regions. In the final sections several decompositions are employed to identify the contribution of productivity and employment growth across a range of sectors to the comparative performance of Italy's regional economies. </jats:p>",

Its purpose is to situate the new critical issues facing the reindeer-herding collectives after the economic collapse in Russia in 1998. My main argument is that the increasing economic isolation of the tundra periphery forces the herders to redefine their relationship with both the centre(s) and the other tundra actors. Reindeer herding on the Kola Peninsula is analysed in relation to its heterogeneous economic system defined by the old Sovkhoz-like management and the new Western buyer of reindeer meat. Furthermore, the social environment in the herding territories has changed since the deterioration of the central planning economy, implying new renewable resources' users. After massive loss of jobs, militaries, miners and geologists came into the tundra for substantial hunting and fishing and so became actors in the local informal economy. Finally, tundra-located herders and hunters seem to be somewhere unified by a discourse against the town-based administrative power and economic actors such as mining industry. Therefore herders have to deal with both an old administrative system in the agrocentre and new realities in the tundra. Based on a case study of herding/hunting activities in a tundra camp, the paper analyses the social relationships between the different actors in the post-Soviet Kola tundra and express their quest for solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The general purpose of sensors is to obtain information on the system. However, in many cases, sensors cannot provide all the information on the system being controlled. On the other hand, the controller system does not need all the information in the process to guide the system into the goal, which provides the opportunity of utilizing simple sensors and then reducing the operational cost and time. The key point is that the information needed from the strategy should match the information which can be provided from the sensory signal. The difficulty left is due to the dependence between the sensor selection and strategy investigation. In other words, the two issues, (a) how to select the sensors and (b) how to form the commanded action, depend on each other. Benefited from the pre-image concept proposed by Lozano-Perez, Mason and Taylor1 and the attractive region concept proposed in the author’s previous work (2000), a logical method to design the pre-image of the goal is presented in this paper. Then the requirement of sensory feedback and the design of commanded action are given. Within this principle, the strategies in the robotic assembly with force sensors are investigated and applied in experiments in the present paper. It should be noted that the robotic assembly plays an important role in manufacturing automation. Also the assembly strategy presented here can be used with any machine.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a knowledge‐enriched representation model for enhancing process FMEA in process planning. This  model can effectively represent the process FMEA knowledge other than specific process failure instances or data. Furthermore, in order to effectively utilize the previous process FMEA knowledge, an algorithm is proposed to calculate the similarity among process failure problems based on “concept distance”. A knowledge‐enriched process FMEA tool has been developed by adopting Web technique so as to provide cooperative process FMEA services for process planner on the Internet or Intranet.</jats:p>",

Certain aspects of this classification are explored, and attention is then given to a number of issues surrounding the concept of agglomeration economies that do not appear to have been adequately considered. These include the extent of agglomeration economies, the possible absence of agglomeration economies at a given agglomeration, and the spatial context of agglomeration economies. </jats:p>",

Within a specialty different categories of patients can be distinguished on behalf of their requirement of resources. The type of resources required for an admission may involve beds, operating theatre capacity, nursing capacity and intensive care beds. The mix of patients is, therefore, an important decision variable for the hospital to manage the workload of the inflow of patients. In this paper we will consider the following planning problem: how can a hospital generate an admission profile for a specialty, given a target patient throughput and utilization of resources, while satisfying given restrictions? For this planning problem, we will develop an integer linear programming model, that has been tested in a pilot setting in a hospital. The paper includes an analysis of the planning problem, a description of the model developed, an application of a specialty orthopaedics, and a discussion of the results obtained.</jats:p>",

As a result, cereal, mainly rice, which is a less riskier crop remained dominantly planted in the current farm plan. But the return generated from rice cultivation has not been able to improve the livelihood of the poor, as rice profitability is low compared to some profitable but risky crops like jute and vegetables. To investigate the behavioral pattern of the farmers towards risk, Dhaka division, largely known as central region of Bangladesh, is selected. The prevailing farm plan of Dhaka division is compared with the efficient one at the current level of expected return in order to check whether the current farm plan is risky or otherwise. Quadratic and MOTAD as well as linear programming techniques have been employed for the analysis. The result of the study reveals that the prevailing farm plan in Dhaka division is risky compared to the efficient plan. Since the current return level is low, the study has recommended that more jute and vegetables should be planted to achieve higher remuneration.</jats:p>",

Large population-based surveys of women ages 15-44 were carried out at the beginning of project implementation (in 1996) and 3 years later in two project sites and a comparison site. Results from these surveys indicate that project activities affected women’s knowledge of family planning methods, and caused women to have more favorable attitudes toward modern contraception. In addition, abortion rates decreased in project sites while remaining virtually unchanged in the comparison site. Because of uneven implementation of project interventions in the demonstration sites, however, the intervention’s actual impact on abortion rates remains unclear. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper offers a contribution to the recent emergence in geography of studies of travel writers and the production of other representations of the non-Western world. I consider a rather different text to those normally studied in that the book, Empire of Signs by Barthes, purports not to represent any real place. A number of writers, influenced by Said's pathbreaking work Orientalism, have considered whether Barthes perpetuates Orientalist images. Rather than structure my argument around the binary of Orientalist/not-Orientalist I will consider the ways that Barthes subverts the structure of Orientalism from within. Barthes counterfeits travel: playing with the concept of ‘wonder’ which halted the representational language of more conventional travellers. Through the construction of his own ‘hyper-Orientalist’ account, Barthes produces a poststructural ethics which I argue offers some important reflections on the politics of representation both of travel writing and of academic critiques of it. </jats:p>",

The aim is to provide breadth of integration and depth of functionality across multi‐functional and often multi‐national organizations. However, current research has shown that there has been a notable decrease in the satisfaction levels of ERP implementations over the period 1998–2000. The environment in which such software is selected, implemented andused may be viewed as a social activity system, which consists of a variety ofstakeholders e.g.users, developers, managers, suppliers and consultants. In such a context, an <jats:italic>interpretive</jats:italic> research approach is appropriate in order to understand the influences at work. This paper reports on an <jats:italic>interpretive</jats:italic> study that attempts to understand the reasons for this apparent lack ofsuccess by analyzing issues raised by representatives of key stakeholder groups. Conclusions are drawn on a wide range of organizational, management, cultural and political issues that provide guidance in managing such large‐scale, complex business projects. These conclusions have led theauthors to review the area of critical success factors (CSFs) for IS projects and to identify those peculiar to ERP projects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Objective: The three-dimensional relation of a liver tumour to the intrahepatic vascular trees is basis of operation planning in liver surgery. Yet it has not been proven whether 3D reconstruction and further computerised processing will enhance precision of operation planning in liver surgery which has been based on the liver segment classification of Couinaud up to now. Design: Our interdisciplinary group (department of Surgery, German Cancer Research Center and Department of Radiology) has developed a new interactive computer-based quantitative 3D operation planning system for liver surgery which is being introduced into the clinical routine. The system quantifies the organ structures semiautomatically, defines resection planes depending on safety margins and the vascular trees, and presents the data in digital movies as well as in quantitative reports. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate whether 3D reconstruction will lead to an improved operation planning. Data of 7 virtual patients were presented to a total of 81 surgeons in different levels of training. The tumours had to be assigned to a liver segment and subsequently drawn together with the operation proposals into a liver model. The precision of both was measured quantitatively for each surgeon and stratified concerning 2D and different types of 3D presentations. Results: The 3D anatomy can be visualised in high quality which results in good perception of the third dimension (depth). Tumour assignment to liver segments was significantly correlated to the level of training (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant increase (p &lt; 0.001) in the precision of tumour localisation by 51% and resection proposal from 2D through 3D reconstructions by 13%-21%. Quantitative differences of the simplified Couinaud's classification of the liver segments compared to the true vascular anatomy of up to 40% were found. Conclusion: The impact of individual 3D-reconstruction on surgical planning has been proven to be significant and increases precision quantitatively. The merit of Couinaud's classification may be enhanced by individualisation of the segment borders in future. </jats:p>",

Empty space embodies understandings of national parks as ‘pure’ nature, external to (modern) society. Organic space circumscribes modes of representation that link nature to conceptions of ‘Swedishness’. Through a multimedia dialectic of images, texts, and maps—the optical space of visual immediacy and ‘proof’—these spatialities are maintained and policed. </jats:p>",

Currently, actors engaged in a conflict over a small forest at the margins of Jerusalem harness nationalism/Zionism, and ‘other’ their opponents, as they seek to enlist support beyond their natural constituency. Fieldwork with Green groups and an analysis of their public and internal documents show that municipal officials who are converting the area of the forest to commercial development are cast as (Arab) attackers of the city. Municipal officials also tap national tropes and a security discourse, and claim to be defending Jewish control of Jerusalem. In this paper I show that theories of space, place, and resistance must be supplemented with a contextual and rounded analysis of the master cultural narratives that form the symbolic grounds of these conflicts. It also reveals the complexity of resistance narratives, as the weak seek to benefit from discourses they share with their opponents. </jats:p>",

In general these debates have taken place within the context of states that are dominantly market economies and are highly integrated into the international system. In this paper we examine the issues of resistance to globalisation and the decomposition of the central state in the context of Vietnam. It is argued that here, as in the PRC (Peoples Republic of China), the development of elements of the market economy and integration into the global system are taking place under the auspices of a still centrally planned, single-party state, which continues to affirm its commitment to state control over the economy. It is proposed that although this has enabled a considerable measure of control to be exerted over the forces of economic globalisation, the processes of reform and related economic growth and participation in the global economy are undermining the authority of the central state. This is increasingly reducing the effectiveness of the central Vietnamese state as power shifts to more local structures. </jats:p>",

In related analyses, Poisson‐based modeling indicated that species richness is better explained as a function of elevation and local topographic heterogeneity than by area per se. Therefore, we explored whether area, elevation, and topographic heterogeneity affected relative degree of nestedness. Elevation and topographic heterogeneity not only explained a significant percentage of the total deviance in species richness but also may be responsible for generating nested species distributions. The species‐presence matrix ordered by the elevation‐heterogeneity model was significantly more nested than the matrix ordered by area. The matrix ordered by the elevation‐heterogeneity model also was significantly more nested than matrices ordered by three other environmental variables that did not explain significant variance in species richness, indicating that the model is unlikely to be an artifact. The influence of area on distribution patterns may be relatively slight because it was not significantly correlated with species richness or topographic heterogeneity in this system. Elevation covaried with both species richness and area, but the former correlation was positive and the latter was negative. Our results suggest that faunal richness and compositional patterns are related to independent variables that can be measured extensively—through satellite or airborne telemetry—thus reducing dependence on labor‐intensive measurements of habitat. Because nestedness analyses may help reveal causes, or at least correlates, of species composition, we believe they are a promising tool for conservation planning.</jats:p>",

Three experiments are reported, which were designed to distinguish between these views using a new hybrid task that factorially manipulated preparation and auditory priming of spoken language production. Minimalist theories predict no effect from priming of non-initial segments when the initial segment of an utterance is already prepared; observing such a priming effect would support non-minimalist theories. In all three experiments, preparation and priming yielded main effects, and together their effects were additive. Preparation of initial segments does not eliminate priming effects for later segments. These results challenge the minimalist view. The findings are simulated by WEAVER++ (Roelofs, 1997b), which employs the phonological word as the lower limit for articulation initiation. </jats:p>",

From the perspective of critical geopolitics, boundary making for conservation purposes is understood as an act of power embedded within a discourse of environmental geopolitics. Through reborderings, environmental geopolitics thus reflects and informs everyday practices and relations of power between local, state, and international actors. In this paper I illustrate a process of rebordering in Trinidad, the West Indies, in which local, state, and international actors engaged in a contest to define conservation boundaries and produce bounded identities within the Nariva Swamp. Rebordering in the Nariva Swamp reflected and influenced state and local practices in complex ways, altered relations of power on multiple levels, and led to the production of a bounded space that is simultaneously local and global. </jats:p>",

Through examining the geography invoked within a particular hagiographie account about the life of St Samson, I explore how the medieval ‘natural’ world is both rendered understandable through its sacred symbolism, and reified as a familiar ‘map’ of instruction and collective social memory. Following a general discussion of the meaning of medieval hagiographies (which are comprised of curious compilations of factual and imaginative material relating to the ‘lives’ of saints from an even earlier time), I focus on their role as mediators of cultural identity. It is my premise in this paper that hagiographies are profoundly geographical, and are shot through with environmental metaphors and references to spaces, places, and landscapes. I examine how they both served as crucial tools of religious instruction, and carried geographical coordinates that helped to establish a sense of place. Through instilling local identity and collective memory with references to an imagined landscape of religious order, these saintly legends literally showed people how to experience the familiar landscape that they inhabited. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Eye-hand coordination requires the brain to integrate visual information with the continuous changes in eye, head, and arm positions. This is a geometrically complex process because the eyes, head, and shoulder have different centers of rotation. As a result, head rotation causes the eye to translate with respect to the shoulder. The present study examines the consequences of this geometry for planning accurate arm movements in a pointing task with the head at different orientations. When asked to point at an object, subjects oriented their arm to position the fingertip on the line running from the target to the viewing eye. But this eye-target line shifts when the eyes translate with each new head orientation, thereby requiring a new arm pointing direction. We confirmed that subjects do realign their fingertip with the eye-target line during closed-loop pointing across various horizontal head orientations when gaze is on target. More importantly, subjects also showed this head-position–dependent pattern of pointing responses for the same paradigm performed in complete darkness. However, when gaze was not on target, compensation for these translations in the rotational centers partially broke down. As a result, subjects tended to overshoot the target direction relative to current gaze; perhaps explaining previously reported errors in aiming the arm to retinally peripheral targets. These results suggest that knowledge of head position signals and the resulting relative displacements in the centers of rotation of the eye and shoulder are incorporated using open-loop mechanisms for eye-hand coordination, but these translations are best calibrated for foveated, gaze-on-target movements. </jats:p>",

Previous work examined these expectations and found clear evidence that the ex ante estimates of transition costs given to the Westminster parliament were serious underestimates, and that the expected savings had not, at that time, materialised. This work was done at a time when it was known that some of the official data on transition costs would not be complete until after the close of the 2000/01 financial year. The author's primary purpose is to place on record what may be regarded as the final estimates of the transition costs in England, Scotland, and Wales. In addition, comparisons between the ex ante estimates of the costs of structural change and the ex post evidence concerning actual costs are updated. The discrepancy between these is such as to confirm the need for some form of independent scrutiny of new legislation at the time when it is being considered in parliament, to ensure that decisions are taken in the light of realistic assessments of the costs and benefits of proposed enactments. </jats:p>",

The method is consistent with the penalty function approach, which requires the formulation of an objective function with penalty terms proportional to the magnitudes of constraint violations. Dose constraints with respect to minimum and maximum target dose levels are incorporated in quadratic, dose‐penalty terms. Analogously, quadratic volume‐penalty terms in the objective function reflect the violation of dose‐volume constraints imposing limits on the fractions of healthy organ volumes that can be irradiated above specified dose levels. It has been demonstrated that within the framework of this formulation neither modified objective functions nor finite difference gradient calculations are necessary for the incorporation of gradient minimization algorithms. As an example, a simple steepest descent algorithm is presented along with its application to illustrate prostate and lung cases.</jats:p>",

The role of location in the decisionmaking underlying marriage migration, and the relations between marriage and labor migration, are little understood. Research that focuses on international marriages and on Western or capitalist economies has highlighted marriage as a strategy, but little attention is given to domestic marriage migration and to socialist and transitional economies. In this paper, through a field study of two villages in western Guangdong, China, and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from that study, we wish to advance two arguments. First, we argue that changes in the spatial economy have reinforced the importance of location in the matching and trade-off processes that lead to marriage migration. Evidence of spatial hypergamy across long distance supports the notion that marriage is a means for peasant women to move to more favorable locations. Second, we show that increased opportunities for labor migration—a product of economic transition—have enlarged peasants' marriage market and at the same time promoted division of labor within marriage. The findings underscore household and individual strategies in response to macrolevel constraints and opportunities, the centrality of marriage for understanding migration, and the relations between marriage and labor migration. </jats:p>",

We first describe the general design of EAs that can be used to generate alternatives that are optimal or close to optimal with respect to multiple criteria. Then we define the problem addressed in this research and discuss how the EA was designed to solve it. In this procedure, called MOEA/Site, a solution (that is, a site) is encoded by using a graph representation that is operated on by a set of specifically designed evolutionary operations. This approach is applied to five different types of cost surfaces and the results are compared with 10 000 randomly generated solutions. The results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of this EA-based approach to geographical analysis and multiobjective decisionmaking.

In the final section they consider some of the wider policy issues raised by the programme in terms of the extent to which: first, effective regional models can be developed to encourage widespread participation by appropriate private sector organisations; second, access to appropriate finance, including seedcorn and venture capital, can be increased for high-growth-potential start-ups; third, universities are able to contribute to the generation of new business activity and become integrated into regional business support infrastructures; and fourth, the enhanced support programme is tuned to the needs of the target group and is effectively delivered. </jats:p>",

In contrast to its neighbors, large areas of Myanmar's forest cover remain intact, providing a unique opportunity to conserve biodiversity within protected areas. High levels of deforestation, unrestricted hunting, and destructive agricultural practices have resulted in significant wildlife declines and rapid loss of natural habitats. We analyzed the status of 20 of the 31 officially gazetted protected areas in Myanmar within a framework that classified activities incompatible with protected‐area status into two broad categories, small and large scale. Small‐scale incompatibilities driven by economic necessity and lack of alternatives for local populations within and adjacent to protected areas occurred more frequently than large‐scale incompatibilities driven by larger economic interests. Extraction of nontimber forest products was reported in 85% of the protected areas and ranked highest among the 15 identified incompatibilities. Grazing, hunting, fuelwood extraction, and permanent settlements occurred in more than 50% of the parks surveyed. Forty percent of the protected areas had some infrastructure for reserve management (with significant gaps) but insufficient on‐site personnel to adequately perform management activities. Thirty‐five percent had approximately half their staff trained in basic field techniques, and 60% had a planning document that was yet to be implemented. Older protected areas were affected by a greater number of incompatibilities than recently established protected areas. Major recommendations include the critical need to address the issue of hunting; involving local communities in the management of protected areas and buffer zones; building the technical capacity of protected‐area staff; implementing a comprehensive land‐use plan focused on stabilizing land use; and amending existing wildlife laws to fulfill international treaty obligations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I will examine the effects of the implementation of the Gestion des Terroirs approach in several villages in the cotton-growing region of southwestern Burkina Faso, an area of both extensive immigration and fast-paced socioeconomic change. Efforts to restructure land-tenure relations have failed, despite the rhetoric of participatory development, because projects misunderstand the nature of changing land rights, agricultural practices, and village social relations. Failures of efforts to zone land have been exacerbated because land has become a major site of conflict. Population growth and agricultural growth have led to land shortages, intensified competition, and overt conflict. Efforts to restructure landholding by using participatory development methods have had unintended consequences as individuals and groups manipulate meanings and representations about rights to land and land-management strategies in order to lay claim to land. On the one hand some local farmers are attempting to expel migrant farmers from land by invoking notions of who is and who is not using environmentally sound management practices. Migrant farmers, on the other hand, are fearful of leaving land fallow because they fear that the project or their local hosts will take it away from them. Both of these outcomes have increased tension among ethnic and generational groups and fostered mistrust of the motivations of environmental projects. Instead of homogeneous cooperative entities, villages are often based on conflict and competition. Projects, therefore, should focus on conflict resolution and reconciliation when attempting to restructure how natural resources are allocated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of the Small Business Service (SBS) has been accompanied by a renewed interest in ethnic minority enterprise. The content, nature, and efficacy of engagement processes with ethnic minority business (EMB) are likely to be important criteria for the granting of local SBS franchises, if the support needs of EMBs are to be successfully identified and responded to in the light of community and socioeconomic differences. This imperative has thrown into sharp relief unarticulated assumptions upon which policy towards EMBs has been, or should be, constituted. A review of these policy questions, and an assessment of the way forward, is long overdue. This is the key aim of the paper. In addressing this task, the authors draw upon a range of recent and ongoing studies of different facets of EMB activity, focusing in particular on the policy dimension. The discussion is divided into three main sections. First, there is an assessment of the support needs of EMBs. A key question is the extent to which such businesses are distinct from the general small firm population; and whether differences can be attributed to other factors, such as size and sector. This issue has implications for the delivery of business services; in particular, should services be delivered within existing ‘mainstream’ business support institutions, or through agencies predicated upon notions of ethnic differentiation? Second, issues and lessons from previous policy initiatives are considered. In particular, the role of specialist agencies, urban regeneration initiatives, and business-led organisations are assessed. After considering issues emerging from extant studies, part three identifies elements for a more coherent policy towards EMBs. Such a policy should include: clearer objectives; placing support EMBs within mainstream provision; an engagement strategy; closer integration between business support and regeneration policies; better access to finance; and more client-focused business support. </jats:p>",

One model was based on empirical habitat data, and the other two (opinion‐ and literature‐based) were based on expert information developed in a multicriteria decision‐making process. We validated the performance of the models with an independent data set. Four classes of highway linkage zones were generated. Class 3 linkages were the most accurate for mapping cross‐highway movement. Our tests showed that the model based on expert literature most closely approximated the empirical model, both in the results of statistical tests and the description of the class 3 linkages. In addition, the expert literature–based model was consistently more similar to the empirical model than either of two seasonal, expert opinion–based models. Among the expert models, the literature‐based model had the strongest correlation with the empirical model. Expert‐opinion models were less in agreement with the empirical model. The poor performance of the expert‐opinion model may be explained by an overestimation of the importance of riparian habitat by experts compared with the literature. A small portion of the empirical data to test the models was from the pre‐berry season and may have affected how well the model predicted linkage areas. Our empirical and expert models represent useful tools for resource and transportation planners charged with determining the location of mitigation passages for wildlife when baseline information is lacking and when time constraints do not allow for data collection before construction.</jats:p>",

A growing number of studies examine in detail the spatial structure of particular metropolitan areas, or present comparisons at a relatively aggregated spatial and sectoral level. From these studies, certain authors have deduced a general pattern of metropolitan spatial development—one involving the suburbanisation of economic activity and the weakening of the central business district. The scarcity of comparable data covering different cities renders these generalisations somewhat tentative, however. In this paper we use a unique database to compare the spatial structures, and their evolution over time, for the four largest Canadian metropolitan areas: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Ottawa – Hull. These data allow highly disaggregated spatial (census-tract level) and sectoral (thirty economic sectors) analyses. The results, which illustrate the existence of three distinct patterns of development amongst these four metropolitan areas, call into question the existence of a single model. In doing so they also raise a series of questions regarding possible explanations for these differences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The broad focus of this paper is the divergence of implemented policy from intended policy in UK small business support. The Small Business Service (SBS) is the United Kingdom's most recent attempt to provide coherent support for small business. With its structure of local franchisees and multiagency partnerships, the SBS is part of the United Kingdom's Modernising Government agenda, which aims to provide ‘joined-up’ and responsive public services. However, it is not always easy for policymakers to execute new plans in the form in which they were intended. Street-level bureaucracies develop where those who implement complex policies amend them to make them easier to apply in practice. This paper investigates the UK Business Links' Personal Business Adviser (PBA) service. The paper draws on data from a focus group often PBAs and subsequent survey of the 175 PBAs in England and Wales conducted in summer 1998. The experience and tacit knowledge of PBAs provides the expertise for a bespoke support service to small businesses. Business advisers have both technical expertise and closeness to delivery that confers the power to amend small business policy. This tacit knowledge confers powers akin to a ‘street-level technocracy’. Thus, policies that do not carry PBA support, such as targeting, are unlikely to be implemented effectively. A new approach to small business support has been formed from the difficulty in controlling PBAs through performance indicators, which appear to have distorted the intended policy, and the Modernising Government agenda. The new SBS devolves the operation, but not all control, of business advice from the national SBS to local Business Links. PBAs will play a major part in the network mode of governance of the new SBS franchisees. </jats:p>",

We conclude that adoption policies can be justified for a number of reasons, and may contribute to urban development in several respects. However, in many cases, policies lack effectiveness because crucial factors that determine ICT adoption are not taken into account. Also, in too many cases, public policies interfere with market initiatives. On the basis of our case studies, we conclude that the most effective policies are not only problem driven but are also opportunity based and integrated: this includes infrastructure provision, content development, and resource building among low-adoptive groups. </jats:p>",

This study is conducted in the light that neither urban economics nor urban planning research has utilized useful development control information that can help better understand the spatial and linkage aspects of the industrial sector in economic development. A probit study of a relatively large population of statistics (with 1728 observations) concerning planning applications for uses in lands under industrial zoning in Hong Kong is conducted in terms of 5 refutable hypotheses about the role of the planning authority in respect of land uses that are neutral to, complementary to and substitutes of industrial uses in a local context where major structural changes are occurring in the economy. The hypotheses are derived from standard price theory. The test discovers that, consistent with the theory of substitute goods, that the probabilities of mixed industrial/office and pure office uses in industrial zones being approved were dependent on the rise and fall of the manufacturing sector (measured in terms of labor share). However, those for ancillary office use, a use that theoretically should be complementary to industrial activities, were independent of the state of the manufacturing sector.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many studies in the USA have noted inequities with regard to the socioeconomic status or racial character of communities and their relative exposure to environmental disamenities. In this paper the authors focus particularly on the environmental equity of air pollution in the English city of Birmingham. Using statistical methodologies they examine the pattern of exposure to two key air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) across certain population groups in the city. Estimated emission levels of CO and NO<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> were mapped by using modelled associations between vehicle densities and measured emissions at existing monitoring stations. These data were input to a geographical information system (GIS) for subsequent comparisons with population maps. Three types of variables were considered to distinguish possibly disadvantaged populations: age profile, ethnic make-up, and poverty indicators. From the 1991 Census, relevant statistics were derived for each enumeration district in the city. No relationship could be established on the age variable (that is, neither children nor pensioners appear to differ from the general population in their likely exposure patterns). However, there was a striking relationship between modelled emissions and poverty indicators and ethnicity. The effects are difficult to separate out but there is strong evidence to suggest that the two factors (poverty and ethnicity) operate in an independent manner. The implications of these findings, with regard to the causes of the disparities and the likely impacts of possible efforts to improve air quality in Birmingham, are discussed. </jats:p>",

The Service inherited a substantial number of policies and initiatives which have been criticised for their poorly stated aims and overall lack of coherence. The authors examine justifications for small business policy in Britain and the role of research in small business policymaking. They suggest that research has had relatively little impact, and some reasons why this has been the case. They also suggest ways of setting a small business research agenda—raising standards and ensuring the independence of research. Attention is given to the evaluation of small business policy and initiatives. It is argued that currently this is not sufficiently independent or rigorous, and the authors suggest remedies. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation approaches are examined in order to redefine good practice. The overall aim is to suggest how the Small Business Service can be better supported by research and evaluation, enabling it to function more successfully than its predecessors. </jats:p>",

The method has been developed mainly along the lines of local regression and smoothing techniques, a strategy that has led to a number of difficult questions about the regularity conditions of the likelihood function, the effective number of degrees of freedom, and in general the relevance of extending the method to derive inference and model specification tests. In this paper we argue that placing GWR within a different statistical context, as a spatial model of error variance heterogeneity, or what might be termed locational heterogeneity, solves these difficulties. A maximum-likelihood-based framework for estimation and inference of a general geographically weighted regression model is presented that leads to a method to estimate location-specific kernel bandwidths. Moreover, a test for locational heterogeneity is derived and its use exemplified with a case study. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, the exploitation of natural resources and the preservation of the natural environment imply objectives that are often in conflict within a sustainable development paradigm. Managers and other decision makers require techniques to assist them in understanding strategic decision making. This paper illustrates the use of a multiple‐objective decision‐making methodology and an integrative geographical information system‐based decision‐making tool developed to help watershed councils prioritize and evaluate restoration activities at the watershed level. Both were developed through a multidisciplinary approach. The decision‐making tool is being applied in two watersheds of Oregon's Willamette River Basin. The results suggest that multiple‐objective methods can provide a valuable tool in analyzing complex watershed management issues.</jats:p>",

As a jobbing manufacturer the company excelled at reactive management, responding rapidly to short lead-time demands. This approach, however, was inappropriate for the increasingly competitive production of steady state orders (‘runners’) and spare parts orders (‘repeaters’). As a result, the company experienced falling delivery performances and increasing work-in-progress, inventory levels and overtime requirements. Furthermore, there was only a modest understanding of customer requirements due to the poor visibility of the order book. There was also little awareness of internal and supplier capabilities, and the planning and control systems were non-existent, relying heavily on senior management expertise. The company, however, was reluctant to invest in new management information systems, aware of the risk of expensive systems unsuited to the company requirements. Instead, prototype solutions were developed using low-cost and readily available software, which provided the stability and visibility that the company required and formed the basis of a more long-term understanding of planning and control requirements. This paper describes the iterative prototype developments to support the new company infrastructure and quantifies the benefits that were achieved through their introduction. </jats:p>",

Conventional debates over public versus private service provision obscure the multiple configurations possible. We consider the effectiveness and desirability of an alternative approach to public-service provision of water and wastewater services, specifically the Border Waterworks program, which has helped deliver water-related services to economically disadvantaged communities ( colonias) along the US – Mexico border. We explore some issues that emerge when nonprofit organizations take on functions of governments and service providers, and examine the conditions under which the provision of water and wastewater infrastructure can be advanced by nonprofit organizations. We conclude that the general effectiveness of Border Waterworks was thanks to its ability to adapt to local circumstances and respond to situations as they arose in the context of the numerous problems in colonias. We also conclude that nonprofit providers are most effective when they serve as catalysts that assist the public sector rather than when they provide public-service infrastructure on their own. </jats:p>",
