Theoretical considerations are discussed together with empirical data from Sweden. Formulation of targets, priority settings, resource allocation and monitoring systems are some ways in which epidemiological data can improve health planning. One important lesson for planning is that problems related to health, inequalities in health, and access to care, must be made visible to politicians, health personnel and the public. Further, there is a need to complement a national health policy with a decentralized planning system that takes local conditions and needs into consideration.</jats:p>",

At least eight different causal explanations of steel job loss have been offered, and diverse normative objectives have been invoked. This research exam ines the intergovernmental issues and the politics involved in a num ber of innovative steel strategies. The paper concludes that this type of controversy is bound to escalate in the coming decades. Therefore, economic development planners will need a broad education in both po litical economy and institutional and intergovernmental settings, as well as improved skills in conceptualizing and testing causal models of indus try evolution. </jats:p>",

In 1983, the Dutch Secretary of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs decided to establish a Steering Committee for Future Health Scenarios (STG). The chief task of this Committee is to create alternative pictures of possible futures in the field of public health and health care. These health scenarios are used to increase the anticipatory capability of policymakers and health managers. This paper evaluates the Dutch experience with scenario‐projects on ‘health and ageing’, ‘cardiovascular diseases’, and ‘cancer’.</jats:p><jats:p>After a short introduction on the structure of the STG, and the concept of scenarios, the scenario‐projects are described and analysed. The conclusions to date of the projects are mentioned briefly. This article ends with some recommendations, with respect to the methodology of scenarios in the field of health, the structural prerequisites for successful projects, and the communication aspects of these types of studies.</jats:p>",

Findings of a case study on the Planning Agency for the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Ja neiro, Brazil, covering the 1975-82 period, suggest that planners' rela tionships with higher-ranking offi cials of the planning agency were a crucial factor affecting professional performance. Effective planners were those able to carry out professional work in a fashion consistent with their goals. To do this, they had to devise appropriate strategies to ac quire influence over top officials. The majority of planners, however, failed to devise such strategies, due to their negative attitude toward politics at the level of the organization. </jats:p>",

The analysis describes the ev olution in the use of workshop courses over time. There has been a transition from a three-workshop se ries at the heart of the core curricu lum in the mid-1950s to several dis tinct patterns of workshop use today. Among other characteristics, the larger the number of degrees offered by a planning school (including the Ph.D.), and the larger the student/ faculty ratio, the fewer the number of workshops required. Nevertheless, the workshop is still central to the curriculum at many schools: 72% re quire at least one workshop for all students and nearly 65% require two or more. </jats:p>",

While health planning in the USA started in 1946, it was the comprehensive health planning program in 1966 that created the form to be followed by Health Systems Agency effort in 1974: local, voluntary planning, coordinated by state agencies, supported by federal funding. Health planning in the Netherlands has moved through four distinct periods: a hospital construction period, starting during the post‐war recovery; a hospital regionalization period, from 1971 through the late 1970s; a transition period from the late 1970s to 1982, during which several planning approaches were considered; and, the current comprehensive health and social services planning period. Today, federal support for health planning in the US has been eliminated as part of the current de‐regulatory, competitive health care strategy. Health planning in the US is now an institutional activity, with less focus on community needs. Advocated changes in the Dutch planning approach incorporate ideas similar to past approaches in the US; but, a failed approach in one nation may work in another, if the underlying cultural and organizational characteristics are sufficiently different.</jats:p>",

This article presents a model of filtering gleaned from the literature and discusses its assorted criticisms. Next, the literature is cast in its one hundred-year historical context to show how it evolved and how it was influenced by housing policy considerations of different eras. The article then offers a unifying framework for filtering's exposition. This framework allows the basic dimensions of filtering to be presented within its shelter system, and also shows how they are connected to larger economic and demographic forces in society that drive the filtering processes in the first place. The framework also allows a substantive rather than merely chronological organization of the literature. Finally, areas for future research are suggested based on this framework. </jats:p>",

In response, a group of concerned citizens and environmental groups formed the Save Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani Association to advocate for the protection of the resorts' ecology. The government of Maharashtra then formed the Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani Regional Planning Board, which was tasked with preparing a regional plan to preserve the resorts' ecology and regulate transport, communications, water supply, and other amenities. The plan prepared by the board sought to balance the need for economic development with the preservation of the natural beauty and ecology of the resorts, and included measures to regulate the number and movement of vehicles, as well as the development of public transport options to reduce reliance on private vehicles.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p />"

Rather, that integrating these particular areas of expertise into a systematic and coherent approach to branding frequently relies mainly on intuition. Furthermore, certain key parts of the branding process — for instance, brand‐name development — have generally in the past been tackled haphazardly and, at times, illogically. The author's view of what branding is all about is presented and the role of one vital component in a brand's personality — the brand name or trademark — is discussed.</jats:p>",

Yet, as I write this, the nightly news is announcing another economic milestone—U.S. consumers now have over 500 makes and models of VCRs to choose from. Exhibit 2 provides a picture of year‐to‐year changes as well as a five‐year moving average to demonstrate that the trend in U.S. growth rates is definitely downward, and that the variability above and below this trend has been increasing in the last decade.</jats:p>",

Two of the possibilities are reviewed: representation in terms of joint angular motions versus representation in terms of motions of the hand in external space coordinates. A second concern is the transformation from intention to action: how is an internal representation of motion expressed by the neuromuscular system? The computational complexity of this problem is reviewed. A way in which the mechanics of the neuromuscular system could be exploited to simplify this problem is discussed. </jats:p>",

In downtown of an average-sized Swedish city (about 80000 residents), 150 shoppers were interviewed in a parking lot when they were coming back from shopping rounds. 69% of the shoppers visited more than one location, and 51% visited more than two locations. Of those who visited more than two different locations, 35 (69%) attempted to minimize walking distance. This was most frequently done by first choosing the location farthest away, then minimizing distance successively back to the parking lot. In this way shoppers probably attempted to minimize both the walking distance and the effort to carry goods. Some shoppers managed to choose routes which were shorter than if they had minimized distance successively. This finding was consistent with the results of laboratory studies demonstrating the role of maplike mental representations for distance-minimizing choices. </jats:p>",

To this end, a simultaneous equations model, which represents a conceptual model of the process, is calibrated with intraurban-travel survey data. In addition, as the process is found to be hierarchical, a recursive model, which provides both consistent and unbiased estimates of the structural parameters of the model, is calibrated. Household activity, trip frequency, and travel time are each shown to be directly influenced by several exogenous socioeconomic and locational characteristics of the household. Furthermore, frequency of household trips and accrued travel time are shown to be consequences of levels of household activity and of those exogenous variables found to influence this activity. </jats:p>",

Firms interact with all others at equal probabilities in the city to produce economic agglomeration. Each firm occupies office space, and the construction cost of office buildings is a function to the power two of the density of firms. By use of these assumptions, together with the generalized notion of bid rent, an equilibrium urban land-use model is formulated. It is shown that three types of configuration exist in equilibrium, which depend on the different values of the parameters. </jats:p>",

Experimental design techniques are extremely effective for identifying improved factor levels in problems that involve a large number of factors. Taguchi's success in getting engineers to use experimental design techniques is due, at least in large part, to his use of tools and techniques that simplify the experiment planning process. Recognizing the advantages of this approach, this paper proposes a new set of tools, confounding tables, which offer more guidance to experimenters. Confounding tables provide a clear and systematic representation of confounding relationships. They are simple and useful tools for constructing experiment plans, and they enable users easily to evaluate the confounding patterns of a completed plan. We show how confounding tables provide more information than Taguchi's linear graphs, and are useful for a large class of experiment plans.</jats:p>",

The principles of the welfare policy are: 1) universality of population coverage, 2) comprehensiveness of risks covered, 3) adequacy of benefits and 4) citizens' right to health and social services. The goals are usually expressed in brief slogans like solidarity, universality, equality of opportunity, quality, efficiency and pluralism/“freedom of choice”. Our welfare model is thus based upon ideals deriving from both individualistic and collectivistic philosophies, just as Scandinavia's mixed economy is. Similar to other health sectors, dental care is an integral part of the welfare state, striving to attain its manifold goals. Planning of oral health services should therefore be directed toward these goals, considering the shifts in the disease and problem panorama.</jats:p>",

Since then, the robust design problem and Taguchi's approach to solving it has received much attention from product designers, manufacturers, statisticians and quality professionals.

Energy savings differ markedly across the four communities served by RECAP, and are only weakly associated with installation costs. Savings are greater where audits are used to select participants with significant potential for conservation; households with large preretrofit electricity consumption generate particularly large savings. Regression analysis of survey data suggests that the net impact of behavioral and household changes upon electricity savings is minimal. </jats:p>",

This effect, and the utility of the conclusions of the project work, are likely to contribute significantly to the institutional development of the planning agency.

The emerging possibilities for the coordination of forestry production in New Zealand are also identified. Evidence is presented on the nature and degree of integration of ‘New Zealand’ private and state capital into the wood-fibre markets of the Pacific Rim. It is concluded that unprecedented restructuring in the 1980s by organisations, both private and public, engaged in New Zealand's forestry production has made the realisation of forest assets in New Zealand difficult, with significant implications for owners of forests and for labour dependent on various facets of exotic forestry. </jats:p>",

These themes demonstrate the importance of the group matrix, the levels of manifest and latent meaning in discourse, and the role of the conductor in facilitating the group structure and processes. We conclude that in-depth small groups are a valuable research strategy for the exploration of the interpenetration of individual and collective values for environment. </jats:p>",

In order to do this more systematically, this paper suggests a descriptive structure that defines terms and categories of the planning environment. The paper then suggests corresponding terms and categories to define the planning approach as a first approximation. The planner can then tailor the planning approach to the specific study environment. Such an exercise should enhance the success of the planning effort.</jats:p>",
