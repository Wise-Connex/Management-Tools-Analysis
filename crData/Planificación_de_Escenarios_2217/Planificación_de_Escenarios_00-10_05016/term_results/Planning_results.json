      "abstract": "<jats:p> An investigation of planning obligations is used to explore the political and economic dynamics associated with the interaction between the planning and development processes. A significant widening in the use and scope of planning obligations has occurred in the last ten years. Obligations are used not only to remove physical constraints on development and to mitigate direct development impacts, but also to ameliorate more diffuse social, economic, and environmental impacts, to provide community benefits, and to support wider policy objectives. This broadening of practice has been spurred on by the austere financial environment within which local authorities must operate. Planning obligations have provided a mechanism for shifting part of the immediate financial burden of the provision of off-site infrastructure, facilities, and services from government to building producers and consumers. This poses a dilemma for planning practice. On the one hand, the profile of planners is raised because they are key negotiators in delivering improvements in local infrastructure and services. On the other hand, the financial aspects of development proposals now influence planning decisions. The potential to negotiate planning obligations is influencing land-use patterns, spatially, sectorally, and in terms of local built form. Short-term planning gains are tending to override longer term planning concerns such as environmental quality. These trends challenge fundamentally our conception of the nature of planning. </jats:p>",

The ‚Äòbooking system‚Äô emerged out of New Zealand's core services debate and the government's desire to remove waiting lists. It was targeted for implementation by mid‚Äê1998. However, the booking system remains in an unsatisfactory state and a variety of problems have plagued its introduction. These include a lack of national consistency in the priority access criteria, failure to pilot the system and a shortfall in the levels of funding available to treat the numbers of patients whose priority criteria ‚Äòscores‚Äô deem them clinically eligible for surgery. The article discusses endeavours to address these problems. In conclusion, based on the New Zealand experience, the article provides lessons for policy‚Äêmakers interested in introducing surgical booking systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Integration in health sector reform tends to mean horizontal interaction between vertical programmes. This can result in a larger more complex system than a set of individual vertical programmes. This article looks at the HIV/AIDS programme in Tanzania and the possible impact of system‚Äêwide health sector reform involving ‚Äòdecentralization‚Äô and horizontal integration. It implies that the build‚Äêup to reform is likely to be costly, at least initially (although eventually the system may become more cost‚Äêeffective). Integration can thus save resources, but it will also demand additional inputs, and may lead to reduced service output if operations depend on horizontal functions that fail to deliver. The objective of reform must be to create a reasonably sized, well‚Äêbalanced, system which aims to maximize the output of quality services, both preventive and curative, and to facilitate community efforts to improve health. It is doubtful whether present reform efforts in Tanzania will contribute to more effective services, if not based on a more thorough analysis adapted to the local situation and given considerably more resources, both human and financial. There is also a risk that key preventive programmes, such as those aimed at the control of STD/AIDS, will be further weakened because of both integration with subsequent dependence on poorly functioning horizontal units and reduction in allocated resources.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many countries in Africa have embarked on health sector reforms. The design of the reforms differs considerably. A key feature of the reforms is decentralization, of which Uganda and Zambia are implementing two different models. This paper analyses the two models of health sector reform, and their implications for ultimate development goals. In Uganda, the whole government has been decentralized, with a wide range of powers and resources transferred to the districts. The health care system is part of the political set up of the country. In Zambia, only the health sector has been decentralized. Power and resources for health care have been divested to new parallel organizations. While useful lessons can be drawn from the managerial and administrative experience in the two countries, not least concerning donor coordination, it seems that neither form of decentralization has so far led to a clear and appreciable improvement of health services and, ultimately, to a clear focus on development goals, such as poverty alleviation. The conditions for this to happen are discussed in this paper. Copyright ¬© 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In response to UNICEF's Bamako Initiative, hundreds of privately run Community Drug Funds were established in Honduras during the 1990s, generally under the auspices of a non‚Äêgovernment organization and usually with the financial assistance of international agencies. Honduras' Community Drug Funds (CDF) are rotating drug funds intended to: (1) serve as a means of increasing access to care in isolated rural populations, (2) promote the more rational use of medicines and (3) promote community participation in the financing and oversight of primary health care activities. This study is the first to analyse empirically the impact and efficiency of these institutions, relying upon primary data obtained from a survey of 51 of the 450 active CDFs in Honduras. Archival data from Ministry of Health and other sources were also analysed. The structure, operations, and impact of CDFs are detailed, with special attention given to access and quality of care issues. The study found that CDFs are rapidly becoming under‚Äêcapitalized because of basic management problems, principally in pricing and in medicine purchasing practices. These shortcomings, and more generally, increasing financial pressures on NGO sponsors, are negatively affecting quality and access to care. Given the rate of erosion in CDF assets, unless they are recapitalized, the current average estimated lifespan of a CDF is 5.5 years. If these funds are to be sustainable, changes in their financing, training and supervision will be required. In addressing these issues, Honduran health policy‚Äêmakers must decide how best to balance the competing goals of holding down costs, while maintaining adequate quality and improving access to care.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although the Bamako Initiative from its very beginning was caught up in wider debates about the potential equity impact of any form of user financing, to date there has been little empirical investigation of this impact. This three‚Äêcountry study, undertaken in Benin, Kenya and  Zambia in 1994/95, was initiated to add to the body of relevant evidence. It sought to understand not only what had been the equity impacts of community financing activities in these countries but also <jats:italic>how</jats:italic> they had been brought about. As a result, it investigated equity primarily through consideration of the design of these financing activities and through the perceptions of different actors, within a limited number of purposively selected geographical areas in each country, about their strengths and weaknesses. Additional data on utilization were either collected during the course of the study (Kenya) or drawn from other available studies (Benin and Zambia). Key issues considered in the studies' assessment of equity were the extent to which both relative and absolute affordability gains were achieved, as well as as an influence over both the distributional and procedural justice of the financing activities, the pattern of decision‚Äêmaking. Across countries there was evidence of relative affordability gains in Benin and Kenya, but Kenyan gains were not sustained over time and no such gains were identified in Zambia. In addition, no country had given attention either to the issue of absolute affordability, through the implementation of effective exemption mechanisms to protect the poorest from the burden of payment, or to the establishment of community decision‚Äêmaking bodies that effectively represented the interests of all groups including the poorest. Overall, therefore, although the Benin Bamako Initiative programme might be judged as successful in terms of what appear to be its own equity objectives, the other two countries' schemes had clear equity problems even in these terms. The experience across countries also highlights the unresolved question of whether equity is concerned with the greatest good for the greatest number or with promoting the interests of the most disadvantaged.

Promulgation of the socialist market economy and the recent reforms in national healthcare industry have compelled impetuses for change in the distribution systems, forms of investment of multinational pharmaceutical companies, and product/market strategies. The conventional wisdom on pioneer marketing may be challenged by these situations in the PRC. This study examines four markets that encompass both specialty and general pharmaceuticals so as to explore whether there is a product category effect on entry strategies. The findings indicate a possible synergistic effect of product category and order of entry. In addition, product life cycle has a direct impact on order of entry whereas brand position has an effect on product category. Both government policies and corporate strategies have implications on product categories and order of entry. The recent reforms in China have helped to build a foundation for pharmaceutical companies to conduct business in a manner that is similar to that of the developed countries. The entry strategies for pharmaceuticals may therefore involve more complicated considerations in accordance with these new arrangements in the legal and regulatory environments. Further research into relationships among these variables and the mediation effect is therefore indicated.</jats:p>",

The findings suggest that organisations do not respond to environmental changes by adapting their marketing effort, hence the environment is a poor predictor of marketing effort. Organisational strategy has a far greater impact on marketing effort than the environment. However, the environment is an important predictor of organisational performance and has significant interaction with business strategy in influencing organisational performance hence it is a quasi‚Äêmoderator. Our result suggests that in regulated environments there may be ‚Äúideal‚Äêtype‚Äù strategies for effectiveness and across all environments the concept of equifinality is not supported. There is evidence to suggest that more adaptable strategy types outperform their less adaptive competitors. These results extend a popular typology to developing economies and allow some findings to be generalisable across countries at different stages of economic development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently model checking representation and search techniques    were shown to be efficiently applicable to planning, in particular to    non-deterministic planning. Such planning approaches use Ordered    Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) to encode a planning domain as a    non-deterministic finite automaton and then apply fast algorithms from    model checking to search for a solution. OBDDs can effectively scale    and can provide universal plans for complex planning domains. We are    particularly interested in addressing the complexities arising in    non-deterministic, multi-agent domains.  In this article, we present    UMOP, a new universal OBDD-based planning framework for    non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. We introduce a new planning    domain description language, NADL, to specify non-deterministic,    multi-agent domains.  The language contributes the explicit definition    of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents. We    describe the syntax and semantics of NADL and show how to build an    efficient OBDD-based representation of an NADL description.  The UMOP    planning system uses NADL and different OBDD-based universal planning    algorithms. It includes the previously developed strong and strong    cyclic planning algorithms. In addition, we introduce our new    optimistic planning algorithm that relaxes optimality guarantees and    generates plausible universal plans in some domains where no strong    nor strong cyclic solution exists. We present empirical results    applying UMOP to domains ranging from deterministic and single-agent    with no environment actions to non-deterministic and multi-agent with    complex environment actions. UMOP is shown to be a rich and efficient    planning system.</jats:p>"

I begin by suggesting that music‚Äîprecariously positioned between the myth of silence and the threat of noise‚Äîoffers one means of accessing the soundworld. Then, in order to develop an approach to music that prioritises its sonic qualities, I turn to ideas about performance. This also draws attention away from musical texts and towards the physicality involved in making and listening to music. With reference to some exploratory case studies, I try to appreciate how music‚Äîthrough its embodiment in performance‚Äîworks as a powerful way of knowing and being. Most of the paper is therefore devoted to a discussion of the intersecting political, economic, and emotional spaces which are made through musical performance (and listening) practices. Like the performances they draw from, the conclusions are incomplete. But they do confirm the importance of imagining‚Äîof creating, of engaging with‚Äîa world in the doing, shaped by senses other than sight. </jats:p>",

However, most FMDSS have been designed to implement silvicultural treatments rather than prescribed fire and fuel treatments. Results from a survey of 277 Forest Service employees in the western US show FMDSS need modifications to be better adapted to the needs of prescribed fire planners. Survey responses indicate that, on average, prescribed fire planners would like to increase the area treated annually by 12 times current levels. Available time windows for burning provide the most severe constraint for managers, while funding and personnel constraints were rated as comparably less important. Given these results, FMDSS may be most appropriately designed to help managers develop a long-term strategy for prioritizing prescribed fire treatments. Necessary FMDSS modifications may include different methods of delineating treatment boundaries, improved integration with wildlife habitat models, emphasis on short-term costs, and flexible intervals between repeated treatments.

Two retail rent series are used, compiled by LaSalle Investment Management and CB Hillier Parker, and the emphasis is on forecasting. The results suggest that the use of the vector-autoregression and time-series models in this paper can pick up important features of the data that are useful for forecasting purposes. The relative forecasting performance of the models appears to be subject to the length of the forecast time-horizon. The results also show that the variables which were appropriate for inclusion in the vector-autoregression systems differ between the two rent series, suggesting that the structure of optimal models for predicting retail rents could be specific to the rent index used. Ex ante forecasts from our time-series suggest that both LaSalle Investment Management and CB Hillier Parker real retail rents will exhibit an annual growth rate above their long-term mean. </jats:p>",

Although these processes are playing out in geographically uneven ways, differentially affecting various parts of the globe, there are three sets of general implications associated with them. First, the speed with which the consequences of economic and political events are transmitted through markets has increased dramatically during the past decades. Second, the rhetoric of neoliberal globalization is being used in an attempt to shift the balance of power to global capital. Third, the international migration of both work and people is likely to increase, the former fueled by Internet technologies effectively allowing global telecommuting, the latter fueled by falling birth rates in the industrial economies of the global North. I conclude with some observations about how workers and their organizations may respond to these developments. </jats:p>",

We illustrate this argument by using the case of the new statutory minimum wage in Britain. We consider whether the introduction of the national minimum wage represents a genuine departure from the preceding neoliberal labour-market regime, and examine how far it will begin to redress some of the pronounced geographical inequality in wages across local labour markets which developed under that regime. To provide comparative context, we examine the international geography of minimum wages and assess whether, and to what extent, the new UK minimum wage indicates a shift towards a new model of labour-market governance and regulation. We then review the geography of low pay in the United Kingdom and consider the possible geographical impact of the new national minimum wage. We argue that the effects of the minimum will vary depending on the nature of local labour-market characteristics. Then, perhaps most contentiously, the case is considered for regionally differentiating the minimum wage to reflect geographical differences in the cost of living. Finally, we examine the arguments for and against a single uniform national minimum in the light of administrative systems operated in other countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Various parties have expressed serious concerns regarding the effect of environmental taxes on innovation. The argument is that innovation and investment in emission-abatement technology frequently require capital for investment. Pollution taxes siphon working capital from firms, and new investment becomes more difficult and/or more costly if it is necessary to borrow the capital from banks. In recent years, voluntary agreements have gained increased popularity and have become a central instrument in several countries' environmental policies, the Netherlands perhaps being the most notable example. A core rationale behind voluntary agreements is that they permit collective targets to be set for the entire sector, allowing for a different pace of realization of energy-efficiency improvements among the various individual companies within a sector. This provides the flexibility for firms to set their own goals in a cost-effective manner and to use their own resources to innovate and effect changes in the manner which suits them best. It has been claimed that voluntary agreements provide an improved climate for innovation. How voluntary agreements rate with regard to innovation incentives relative to environmental taxes depends on several factors, in particular the specific design of the agreement and whether the agreements are renegotiated after the market penetration of new technology. The author claims that, whatever advantages voluntary agreements have over the traditional regulatory approach, which makes mandatory particular forms of behavior or specific technological approaches, it is difficult to see that agreements would provide better incentives for innovation. Incentives for innovation may be particularly poor if the regulator requests renegotiation of the agreement with the arrival of new technology that substantially changes marginal conditions. It is proposed that if the authorities for various reasons nevertheless choose to use voluntary agreements as instruments, the agreements should be designed to be incentive-based. </jats:p>",

Because owners of businesses located in a given commune are for the most part located outside that commune, just as are the purchasers of goods produced by these businesses, and even (in urban areas) wage earners working in these businesses, a large share of the tax paid to a given local government is exported out, and borne by capital owners, consumers, and wage earners located in other jurisdictions. The magnitude of these leakages is estimated from a study of 38 French communes. Some implications of tax exportability are discussed. It is concluded that, for a local tax, exportability may not be as great as is generally argued. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Diverse and competing principles of equity are argued to be relevant to the burden-sharing problem for environmental improvement programmes. In this paper, a survey-based approach is used to reconcile this conflict, which is defined as sharing of the costs of an environmental programme among different individuals or groups. Respondents were asked to rank hypothetical individuals or groups on the basis of differences in relevant characteristic attributes. These attributes reflect the degree to which individuals are ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô for the problem, ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô from the policy change implemented, and are ‚Äòable to pay‚Äô for the programme. The econometric analysis of responses casts light on the magnitude of trade-offs between, for example, burden-sharing rules based on the polluter-pays principle and some of its alternatives. Our results indicate that these trade-offs do exist and, furthermore, are significant. Assessment of trade-offs in this way could be an important input into the design of mixed criteria rules for sharing burdens. </jats:p>",

Therefore, many innovative equipment and operational techniques have been introduced to more effectively support these needs in offshore scenarios. For example, cut-to-release production packers provide the reliability of permanent packers but also provide capability to retrieve the entire completion without conducting costly and potentially damaging milling operations. The use of nippleless lock technology keeps the required number of landing nipples to a minimum, while providing the utility to place flow-control devices anywhere in the completion string. In addition to these and other proven completion technologies, the thorough precompletion make-up and testing procedures that are conducted for the assemblies further enhance reliability. When Petrobel began development of their offshore Baltim Field and decided to adopt the above mentioned philosophies, their effectiveness was proven very early in the campaign when leaking tubing necessitated pulling of the completion in the first well of the project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Because of the overall success experienced in completing the Baltim wells, Petrobel is planning to use the same completion design, though modified to eliminate slickline intervention, in the upcoming Temsah Platform development.</jats:p>",

He examines theoretical arguments concerning the performative specificity of sonic experience and considers three ways in which the sonic properties of music are centrally involved in the production of cultural geographies.

This paper describes how HCOs have justifiably become dependent on HMIS and how these organizations may proactively plan for disasters which can impact on HMIS.

By experimental I refer to a broad set of performances that have the potential to bring about something new. In this view, experiments are not, even in their more restricted sense in scientific laboratories, limited to the corroboration or representation of an idea or thought. Experiments are on going. They are considered in this paper to be thought-in-action. This concern with experimentation and experimental knowledge is developed through an engagement with training activities on outdoor management courses in Britain. Meanwhile, and in addition to this empirical focus, the paper serves as an appraisal of some current themes in social science thinking and practice. So, in part 1 of the paper, I detail some of the recent shifts in academic approaches to knowledge, focusing in particular on the much-vaunted decline of epistemology. This partial review of academic practice then allows me, in part 2 of the paper, to discuss the changes in knowledge practices and styles that have been set in motion in the management professions. Particular emphasis is given in this paper to the changing roles of corporate training with respect to the production of ‚Äònew‚Äô kinds of knowing and organising. Picking outdoor management training as a useful case with which to explore these shifts, I trace some of the ways in which large organisations set about the task of creating knowledgeable employees. Three themes of outdoor training are developed (embodiment, play, and experimental learning). In part 3 I develop an analysis of the ways in which a training course is conducted. The paper ends by drawing together some of the characteristic features of a performative geography of performance. </jats:p>",

The findings indicate that radio and television are two important mass media for disseminating family planning information in Bangladesh. However, access to them and exposure to family planning through them are still limited. Slightly more than 40% (42¬∑1%) of respondents reported that they had heard family planning messages via radio, while 17¬∑2% said television, 8¬∑4% said poster and 5¬∑4% said billboard. Respondent‚Äôs place of residence, education, economic status, geographical region and number of living children appeared to be the most important variable determining mass media exposure to family planning. Multivariate analysis shows that both radio and TV exposure to family planning messages and ownership of a radio and TV have a significant effect on current use of family planning methods. These factors remain significant determinants of contraceptive use, even after controlling socioeconomic and demographic factors. The study reveals that both socioeconomic development policies and family planning programmes with a special emphasis on mass media, especially radio, may have a significant effect on contraceptive use in Bangladesh. The principal policy challenge is to design communications strategies that will reach the less privileged, rural and illiterate people who are by far the majority in Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Flexible working has been widely advocated as a social panacea, capable of resolving unemployment, maintaining economic competitiveness, and enhancing equal opportunities between women and men. Flexibility has neutral or even positive connotations for both employers and employees. These meanings are differentiated, and empirically explored, by reference to the British component of a qualitative, comparative six-country European study of flexible working in the retail sector. Specific attention is paid to the determination of flexibility; for example whether it is employer led, employee chosen, or a complementary combination, and whether flexible working facilitates equal opportunities, both within the workplace and in the wider sense of promoting long-lasting changes in parental roles and responsibilities as specified under the European Union's mainstreaming initiative. It is concluded that the introduction of flexible working has opened up a whole range of possibilities for differential engagement in the workplace. However, these arrangements need to apply to all levels of the occupational hierarchy and similar arrangements need to be introduced in relation to caring if the officially stated objectives for greater equality of opportunity are to be realised. To bring about gender equity it is necessary to consider social reproduction as a whole and modify the division of labour between women and men within, and between, paid and unpaid work. </jats:p>",

I first examine some of the comparative dimensions of employment and labour-market change in the region. The differential links between uneven employment loss and unemployment are explored to highlight the diverse national experiences of labour restructuring. I then go on to assess the links between employment restructuring and increasing nonparticipation in the labour market, again highlighting the importance of national differences which belie neoliberal notions of a unidimensional transition to capitalist employment relations. Having established the severity of the ‚Äòemployment shocks' across East-Central Europe, I then go on to examine the links between labour-market restructuring and emergent social inequality since 1989. The polarisation of employment opportunities and constraints provides a context for discussing the development of household economic practices that lie outside the ‚Äòformal‚Äô, emergent capitalist economy. Through an exploration of a household data set for Bulgaria I examine the ways in which households in different labour-market positions have developed ‚Äòstrategies' that involve economic activities constituted outside of formal capitalist, market relations. On the basis of this analysis I argue that a theoretical space becomes opened, through which it is possible to situate household economic practices not solely as ‚Äòresponses' to the austerity of transition, but as constitutive of alternative sites of economic relations with their own autonomies and histories.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A pipeline project normally not only covers a large geographic range, but also deals with a variety of data sources, such as geological, geographical, environmental, engineering and socioeconomic data. GIS has proven to be the effective approach to integrating, managing and analyzing these heterogeneous data sources. Due to the nature of pipeline applications, the third dimension of geospatial data is of considerable importance for pipeline planning, construction and maintenance. There is an increasing demand for the development of a 3-D GIS for pipeline applications. With the advent of Internet, distributed computing and computer graphics technologies, development of web-based 3-D GIS becomes technologically possible. The combination of 3-D GIS and web-based computing technologies opens a whole new avenue to the pipeline industry. In this paper, we will address the development of a web-based 3D GIS in terms of benefits and technical challenges. The detailed system architecture as well as the algorithms developed is also discussed. Finally, potential applications for the pipeline industry are introduced and a prototype system, GeoEye 3D, developed by the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary is described.</jats:p>",

Kananaskis Country is a 4160 km2 ‚ÄúPlanning Area‚Äù that has both Prime Protection and Multiple Use designations. Situated just west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada it has considerable recreational and environmental value, including significant wildlife habitat.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The original exploration and subsequent pipeline construction applications required separate Alberta Energy &amp; Utilities Board (AEUB) public hearings with both involving significant public consultation. Prior to drilling on the lands that had been purchased more than a decade ago, Husky adopted several governing principles to reduce environmental impact, mitigate damage and foster open and honest communication with other industrial users, regulators, local interest groups and local aboriginal communities. During planning and construction, careful attention was paid to using existing linear disturbances (seismic lines, roads and cutblocks). A variety of environmental studies, that incorporated ecologically-integrated landscape classification and included the use of indicator species such as the Grizzly Bear, were conducted prior to and during the early stages of development. The results of these studies, along with the information gathered from the public consultation, historical and cultural studies and engineering specifications formed the basis for the route selection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Watercourses presented particular challenges during pipeline construction. The pipeline right-of-way (RoW) intercepted 26 small water runs and 19 creeks. Fishery and water quality issues were identified as important issues in the lower Coxhill Creek and Jumpingpound Creeks. As a result, Jumpingpound Creek was directionally drilled at two locations and all other watercourses were open-cut using low-impact techniques. To minimize new RoW clearing, substantial portions of the pipeline were placed in the ditch of the existing road. Husky attributes the success of this project to planning, broad community input and the co-operation and buy-in by the project management team and construction companies.</jats:p>",

The most commonly used indicators have generally been developed in relation to urban problems and there is a concern that this fails to reveal problems as experienced in rural areas. Many of the indicators that might be used are ambiguous and there appear to be few single indicators that adequately capture the complex nature of the problems facing people living in rural areas. An alternative approach is proposed, involving the development of bundles of indicators that are defined around notional numbers of people living in particular sets of circumstances relating, for example, to employment, service provision, and access to housing. A number of bundles are suggested and illustrative results are presented for three counties. Analysis illustrates how the results may be used to compare the incidence of disadvantage between urban and rural areas, the concentration of disadvantage within rural areas, and the relationships between the various types of disadvantage. The approach has potential both for analysing the incidence of rural disadvantage and as a basis for the allocation of rural development assistance. </jats:p>",

In order to begin to minimize such dissonance, it is vital that mental health nurse perceptions of service user involvement in the core activity of care planning are better understood. The main findings of this qualitative study, which uses semistructured interviews, suggest that mental health nurses value the concept of user involvement but consider it to be problematic in certain circumstances. The study reveals that nurses hold similar views about the ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô of patient involvement in care planning but limited resources, individual patient characteristics and limitations in nursing care are the main inhibiting factors. Factors perceived as promoting and increasing user involvement included: provision of accurate information, ‚Äòuser‚Äêfriendly‚Äô documentation, mechanisms for gaining service user feedback, and high staff morale.</jats:p>",

The field is currently producing approx. 8000Sm3/d and is on steep decline from its plateau rate of 19400Sm3/d.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In March 1999 it was decided to stop the drilling for approximately one year. During this year new reservoir models were built and history matched. Although this work proved to be both complicated and tedious it was fairly successful. However there was still a high degree of uncertainty in the understanding of the flow pattern and the pressure behaviour of the field. It was therefore decided to perform a comprehensive uncertainty analysis to get better estimates of the expected production and risk related to a resumed drilling. The analysis was performed both on a well to well basis and combined into a drilling campaign.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper will describe analysis in detail illustrated with field examples.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A reservoir simulator is utilized to estimate the unconstrained well potential for each well. Then total field water handling constraints is imposed using a tool that optimizes the production given the individual well profiles and the platform constraints. This gives a basis for determining the base case Present Value, PV, for each well's contribution to the field production. For each well target, the most important uncertainties with corresponding probability distributions are identified, and their effect on the PV determined by simulations. In cases where the simulation model is judged not to represent the reservoir behaviour correctly, analytical methods are used. Finally, these results are used together with the drilling cost into a Monte Carlo simulation loop to determine probability distributions for the NPV of each well and for the total drilling program.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It is shown that even though most of the individual well targets has a high risk of a negative NPV, the economy of the total drilling program is robust and has a significant upside economical potential.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The procedure, which is based on commercially available software only, has proven to be very flexible. It is easy to incorporate new uncertainties related to a well target, or to include or exclude a well target from the drilling schedule. Finally, the resulting NPV probability distributions provide an easy way of ranking well targets based on expected NPV and risk.</jats:p>",

Among the features of this regulatory system, which supports improved environmental performance for privatized firms, are a tough system of facility licensing, a flexible approach to compliance, good information availability at the local level, and broad agreement as to the legitimacy of environmental protection among firms in Poland.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the theoretical and policy debate on local labour markets has focused upon improving the educational, training, and other ‚Äòsupply-side‚Äô characteristics of job seekers. However, complementary employer ‚Äòdemand-side‚Äô factors, in particular the characteristics of employers, job openings, and recruitment practices, are also important in local labour markets but have been relatively neglected in the literature. The authors investigate such factors and argue that job vacancies in an environment of high unemployment are not only the result of traditional ‚Äòstructural‚Äô or ‚Äòskill mismatch between local labour markets, but may result from a mismatch between employer and job-seeker expectations combined with an asymmetry of information between these groups, resulting in ‚Äòfrictional mismatch‚Äô within local labour markets. Skill shortages can therefore be seen as a subset of wider recruitment difficulties. The authors survey a sample of employers to examine their characteristics, vacancies, and recruitment practices. The results provide evidence on the importance of employer and job factors on the flow of people into job vacancies. They also indicate that certain recruitment practices and inherent characteristics of vacancies and employers result in job offers that are either unattractive or inaccessible to the unemployed and hence increase the duration of job vacancies. It is argued that research into and design of local labour-market policies need to take more explicit account of the employer and job characteristics when discussing skill mismatch. </jats:p>",

Significantly, it was prepared against the backcloth of a proposal for a major strategic new road, the Western Peripheral Route. The authors consider whether the STSA provides a rigorous and objective examination of the full range of practical transport strategies for the city of Aberdeen in northeast Scotland, and consider how far it conforms in its scope and methodology to that advised in (subsequently published) government guidance on MMSs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contingent valuation (CV) is a technique for providing estimates of the monetary value of public goods which have no market. The authors consider whether the information provided for the hypothetical market enables respondents to express their ‚Äòtrue‚Äô preference for the ‚Äògood‚Äô, or whether their willingness to pay is dependent on the quantity and quality of information provided in the survey. They argue that a cultural perspective in which the CV transaction is viewed as a communicative ‚Äòdialogue-at-a-distance‚Äô between researchers and respondents through the medium of the CV text provides more insight into the encoding and decoding of the ‚Äògood‚Äô‚Äîin this case an agri-environment policy to enhance nature conservation on an internationally significant wetland in South East England. They argue that, within its own scientific parameters, CV surveys are unable to capture fully all the aspects of the ‚Äògood‚Äô to be valued. The problem is more acute when the ‚Äògood‚Äô represents the uncertain outcomes (in terms of landscape and biodiversity) of a policy. Without a complete specification, which may well be an impossibility for environmental ‚Äògoods‚Äô, respondents are able to bring their own readings to their interpretation of the scenario. This means that CV researchers cannot know precisely what ‚Äògood‚Äô respondents were attempting to ‚Äòvalue‚Äô. The authors follow the production of the CV scenario for the valuation of the Pevensey Levels Wildlife Enhancement Scheme; conduct a critical discourse analysis to demonstrate how the linguistic and visual representations inevitably fulfil rhetorical functions; and then present the deliberations of respondents to the CV survey who participated in in-depth discussion groups after completion of the survey. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Person Centered Planning (PCP) is an approach to designing support that is guided by the individual with disabilities (or his/her advocates) that receives support, builds from personal strengths and vision, and results in practical action plans. While PCP procedures have been advocated strongly and adopted widely, there is little empirical documentation of the impact of the approach on the quality of resulting plans or the perceived impact of support on the lives of people with disabilities. The present study provides an analysis of the impact that the use of PCP had with ten transition-age students receiving special education services. Interviews with eight educators and ten students/parents indicated that PCP training was associated with (a) increased use of PCP procedures, (b) increased number of written goals supported outside the school-time, (c) increased number of non-paid individuals scheduled to provide support, and (d) higher satisfaction with the planning process by educators and students/parents. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the problems and difficulties associated with cable harness design and planning and reviews published material on the subject. A case study approach involving a number of advanced manufacturing organizations was used to confirm current industrial practice. Cable harness design and planning is revealed to comprise a sequential, iterative set of lengthy activities carried out late in the overall product development cycle. It was found that there has been little attempt to integrate any of the core activities involved. The paper concludes with a proposal for a new concurrent engineering approach to cable harness design that makes use of an immersive virtual environment within which stages in the process can be addressed.</jats:p>",
