This paper describes the evolution of development plans for the North Sea Brent field, a field that is composed of two oil plans for the North Sea Brent field, a field that is composed of two oil reservoirs, both of which are overlain by condensate-rich gas caps.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The development of a North Sea oil field such as the Brent field, which consists of two reservoirs covering an area about 17 x 5 km in Block 211/29, is characterized by costly appraisal drilling and very long lead times necessary to design and build platforms. As a result, a large amount of capital must be committed and spent before a clear understanding of the reservoir has emerged. The present program includes pressure maintenance largely by injection of treated sea water and provision for a gas sales scheme with British Gas Corp. provision for a gas sales scheme with British Gas Corp. This means that full secondary recovery projects will have been committed before the reservoir has been produced. The potential reservoir performance for various producing mechanisms was predicted using numerical and physical models that were constructed on the basis of a seismic structure map and control from only the first two wells. Most early decisions were based on the results of this work. This paper discusses the early work and describes how development plans have evolved as additional data have been obtained from new wells and as more detailed studies have been completed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Fig. 1 shows the location of the Brent field. It is situated about 150 km from the Shetland Islands in an area of the North Sea with a water depth of 470 ft and where wind speeds up to 125 miles/hour and waves of 100 ft have been observed. Early exploration drilling in this area appeared promising. The regional seismic picture showed some very large structures with estimates of picture showed some very large structures with estimates of potential reserves ranging up to 2 billion bbl. The Brent potential reserves ranging up to 2 billion bbl. The Brent field discovery well was drilled in the summer of 1971. Because of the severe weather conditions in the Brent field area, semisubmersible drilling vessels available at that time could only operate from May through August and appraisal drilling was delayed until the following summer. Since that time a large number of exploration wells have been drilled in the northern North Sea and the great potential of this environmentally hostile area has been confirmed by the discovery of other major gas and oil fields. Significant technological advances in rig and platform construction, offshore loading systems, subsea well completions, and deep-water pipeline laying are being made to develop these fields.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Historical Development</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A feasibility study for the development of North Sea oil fields was carried out at the beginning of 1971. The aim of the study was to evaluate the economics of developing North Sea oil fields for a wide range of environmental and reservoir conditions. One of the potential fields studied was an anticlinal seismic event in Block 211/29, and development of both an undersaturated reservoir and a reservoir having a gas cap were considered.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In Aug. 1971 oil was discovered in Well 211/29-1, the most northerly well to be drilled in the North Sea at that time.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper gives a personal perspective on some models of national settlement systems, and draws attention to the importance of population migration within these models. It includes a discussion of the inadequacies of current models of interurban migration for the analysis of the dynamic interaction between the demographic and economic growth sectors of a system of postindustrìal cities. The paper is not, however, a review; instead, the aim is to obtain insights on how to progress towards a framework and a strategy for research that will usefully contribute to the analysis of national settlement policy. </jats:p><jats:p> Section 2 considers recent developments in multiregional demographic analysis and argues that these are of limited usefulness unless they are integrated with models of regional economic growth. Results are presented which show that multiregional demographic analyses are extremely sensitive to the assumptions about migration movements. Section 3 outlines three models which interrelate demographic and economic growth, and stresses the links between the two sectors. Each model considers population migration a key link, and two of them assume that the movement of workers provides an equilibrating mechanism between labour supply and demand. Section 4 questions the validity of this traditional approach to migration and argues that, for a system of postindustrial cities, a new approach is required (Morrison, 1973; Renshaw, 1972; Cordey-Hayes and Gleave, 1973; 1974). A conceptual framework, which emphasizes information flows, differential mobility, and inhomogeneity of labour, is sketched. </jats:p><jats:p> The final section concludes that no single model or approach provides a royal road to models of national settlement systems, owing to gaps in our understanding of the dynamics of interactions amongst cities. It is suggested that a hierarchy of models should be developed at varying levels of approximation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines empirical and theoretical issues associated with the growth-center approach to regional development, and argues that despite many difficulties the major themes of the growth-center literature still have relevance to regional policy. Although there has been increasing interest in analyzing the nature and significance of spontaneously growing urban places, the growth-center approach is most meaningful in the context of induced growth. There is little evidence that induced growth centers generate significant spread effects on their economically lagging hinterlands; but they can properly serve as regional centers of in-migration. </jats:p><jats:p> It is difficult to derive an adequate growth model from a market-oriented hierarchy of central place schemes. If one is concerned with innovations and impulses of economic change, using the central place model as a locational matrix or landscape, it should be recognized that information and innovations can be transmitted upward through the hierarchy or laterally among centers of the same level, even though the diffusion process is likely to operate in a downward direction. Recent studies by Pred, Törnqvist, and Goddard indicate that these issues may be clarified by shifting attention to organizational information flows within urban systems. Nevertheless, attempts to focus on the functioning of the ‘postindustrial’ society should not detract from the opportunities that manufacturing decentralization represents for many nonmetropolitan areas. Of course, better access within national (or even international) communications networks can be of considerable help to these areas, not only in attracting more manufacturing activity, but also in upgrading its quality. This in turn depends on the ability of people in lagging regions to take advantage of opportunities, that is, on the quality of rural human resources. The failure of most growth-center theory and practice to include explicitly human resource and manpower dimensions is at least equal to the neglect of information circulation. </jats:p>",

By using a computer programme, results can be generated for these designs according to pre‐set rules laid down by the organizers. 3. The game itself acts as a vehicle for emphasizing the practical and theoretical problems associated with clinical trials. Further valuable information can be imparted during the group discussion periods when the trial design is being developed and during analysis of the results. 4. Limitations of this type of workshop include the need for students to have a working knowledge of clinical medicine and pharmacology, the competence of the tutors and organizers and the technical problems associated with computers and a comparatively rigid computer programme. 5. The value of this type of workshop lies in its ability to allow students to apply themselves to practical problems in clinical trials and to make mistakes with no harm to the patient.</jats:p>",

Let the set of economic activities in a city of given rank be a proper subset of the city of higher rank. Assume that production is characterized by constant input coefficients and that demand is described by proportional expenditure functions. The income (or value added) generated by each activity in any city of given rank can then be calculated. From this the income of cities, regions, and the population of cities and regions may be derived. </jats:p>",

Currently, WOLAP is capable of handling up to thirty instrument-components. Its program and data can easily be handled by most small computers. </jats:p>",

The methodology is used to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental impact of alternative land‐use plans. The methodology consists of a regional analysis submodel and a site analysis submodel. The first component is based on an expanded input‐output analysis incorporating land use, resource inputs, and waste‐emission outputs. The second component is an empirical analysis based on the specific suitability and compatibility of proposed land‐use development packages. The land‐use planning model developed is applied to a case‐study area centered on Charleston, South Carolina.</jats:p>",

Although the two appear independent, attempts to evaluate “intangibles” in the benefit‐cost analysis and to include economics in environmental evaluations cloud the issue, and it is preferable to keep the objectives separate. The benefit‐cost analysis is represented by a simple ratio that is easy to comprehend, immediate as the pocketbook, and as tempting as a pocketful of cash. The attempt to balance it by an all‐too‐often verbose statement of complex ecological description and environmental interactions is just as bad. The environmental impact statement can be the instrument to achieve the Water Resources Council's environmental objective. It should not be an encyclopedia of the local ecology, but should accurately represent the environment which the action will impact, and thoroughly analyze only the potential impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives on that environment. The first step is to develop a “tiered“ approach to policy, programs, projects, and practices involving resources development, so that unnecessary duplication of analysis and reporting is eliminated, and so that each statement deals only with the action, environment, and impact at hand.</jats:p>",
