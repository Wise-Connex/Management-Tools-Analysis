The principles discussed are the following: an integrated health system; a thrifty planning of tiers within that health system; a specificity of tiers; a homogeneity of the tiers' structures; a minimum package of activities; a territorial responsibility and/or an explicit and discrete responsibility for a well‐defined population; a necessary and sufficient population basis; a partial separation of administrative and public health planning bases; and, finally, rules for a geographical division and integration of nongovernmental organizations. The definition of two strategies, primary health care and district health systems, is also revisited.</jats:p>",

Although its primary focus is on the methods that would integrate demographic and economic models to yield housing stock forecasts, the considerations can apply to large scale modeling efforts in general. A case study provides the context for practical considerations. Technical, theoretical, institutional, practical, ethical, and planning issues are considered. The institutional context within which large models are developed and used can affect the information content of forecasts. Realistic contexts can make simpler projection models backed by qualitative studies, produce better forecasts than the large projection models that absorb most of an agency's research budget. Theoretical and econometric considerations as well as track record may favor the use of simpler projection models. The commitment to modeling, however, can help staff development and reduce the role of expediency, wishful thinking, and political manipulation of forecasts. The article stresses the need for a balance between quantitative and qualitative methods. </jats:p>",

Throughout the OECD the hospital, that enduring and pervasive organization which has delivered the vast majority of acute care services for decades, is being reconceptualized. We briefly analyse trends which clearly indicate that the existing concept of the hospital is rapidly coming to an end. The emerging model consists of a core facility comprising only the most acute services, intensive care, operating theatres and an accident and emergency unit, with all other services and units linked by information technology to each other and to the core facility. We explore some of the management challenges confronting those who will be responsible for taking their organization through the transition to the boundaryless hospital arrangement, discuss a number of the existing problems with today's hospitals which the new model has the propensity to resolve, and deal with some of the emerging issues which it brings with it.</jats:p>",

First, there was useful substantive information which broadened our delineation of the subject area addressed. Second, we developed a heightened awareness of university and institutional administration and the logistical issues that must be attended to if faculty/student initiatives are to succeed. This paper extracts some elements of this experience in the areas of substantive inquiry, logistical arrangements, and implications for pedagogy, which may be useful to other academics considering similar activities. In this paper we favor the process issues involved in designing the intellectual content of the conference and its output, believing them to be applicable to other initiatives which seek to weave together pedagogy, research, and action, depending on the culture and the mandate of the host institution. </jats:p>",

In addition, the study sought to find out the procedures and likely constraints in the development of future health care services for the elderly.</jats:p><jats:p>An opinion survey was carried out on a randomly selected sample of decision makers, drawn from: hospitals of 100‐bed capacity or more; and, from directorates of education, agriculture, police, municipalities, commerce, transport and media, in each of the regions of Saudi Arabia. A predesigned Arabic questionnaire was completed by the respondents during February‐April, 1993.</jats:p><jats:p>Of the 244 respondents, the most important categories of elderly to be cared for were considered to be those with handicaps, the chronically ill, and those without family support. The non‐medical decision makers gave higher scores to these alternatives than did the medical decision makers (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05). Use of the family home for elderly health care was rated as the most appropriate, followed by medical rehabilitation centres, and only then by hospitals. Non‐medical respondents gave more emphasis on rehabilitation centres (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.02). Medical respondents thought that primary care doctors (87.2%), physiotherapists (87.2%) and general nurses (78.2%) can adequately fulfil the needs of most elderly patients. In contrast, non‐medical respondents demanded the presence of specialist doctors (72.3%), specialist nurses (78.9%), laboratory and X‐ray facilities to run such services (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05).</jats:p><jats:p>Medical decision makers were also more concerned than the non‐medical respondents that the availability of such medical facilities might encourage some people to neglect their elderly parents (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.04). Equally, medical respondents were seemingly more aware of the high cost of hospital beds than their non‐medical counterparts (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.0001).</jats:p><jats:p>The conclusion to be drawn is that there is a need to provide both acceptable and suitable health care facilities tailored to the needs of the elderly in Saudi Arabia. Any proposed setting should be both cost‐effective and avoid socially adverse outcomes. Above all, the community should be encouraged to participate positively in the development, running and periodic evaluation of such facilities.</jats:p>",

The development and application of systems analysis techniques to assist decision makers in evaluating project alternatives having more than one objective in river basin planning is of recent origin.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper an attempt is made to demonstrate the use of ELECTRE (ELimination and (Et) Choice Translating REality) I and ELECTRE-II techniques for water resources planning in one of the major river basins (Krishna river basin) of South India. The river basin consists of 8 reservoirs and a diversion work. Formulation of the problem is provided leading to an array of 27 alternative systems (different combinations of reservoirs with a minimum of three in each alternative) with 6 criteria related to: (i) irrigation, (ii) power production, (iii) drinking water, (iv) environmental quality; (v) floods and (vi) cost of the project. Out of the six criteria two, namely environmental quality and floods, are qualitative in nature. A set of best alternative systems with their partial ordering is obtained from ELECTRE-I, which forms the input for ELECTRE-II. Complete ordering of the reduced alternatives is achieved with ELECTRE-II. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the weights assigned to each criterion has greater effect on the results than does changing the scales. However, neither effect is significant. Therefore it is recommended that ELECTRE-I be used for screening alternatives under consideration and ELECTRE-II for complete ordering of the reduced set.</jats:p>",

The ultimate success of the planning methodology is validated by the fact that the Australian Defence Force is now capable of executing a larger number of nationally determined tasks than was possible in the past. Australian experience demonstrates that greater jointness can be developed, but only after significant changes have been made to the force development bureaucracy. While perhaps not all of the Australian experience is relevant to every country, it does provide a successful model of a capabilities-based defense planning and force development model, which emphasizes the maximum use of jointness capabilities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Local unemployment rates are frequently used as economic and social indicators at the subregional scale. However, in the early 1990s there has been increasing debate amongst social scientists, economists, and planners about the scope, coverage, and usefulness of unemployment counts and rates. This paper is concerned with comparing and contrasting information available on unemployment from three main data sources—the Employment Department claimant count, the Census of Population, and the Labour Force Survey, lie main substantive focus is on a comparison of the census and claimant-based counts for different subgroups of the population (disaggregated by age and gender) at a range of spatial scales. Analyses reveal that in some cases there are substantial variations in unemployment counts and rates derived from different data sources. It is concluded that the most appropriate way forward would appear to involve the use of alternative parallel measures of unemployment, specifically tailored to the purpose in hand. This necessitates a greater understanding on the part of users of the strengths and weak-nesses of alternative sources, in order that the most appropriate measure is selected. </jats:p>",

In turn, I demonstrate how an ethnographic approach mitigates spatial science's erasure of gay men and space. Turning the critique of distance back on my own ethnographic research I then discuss the ironic benefits of distance in geographic research. I conclude that distance in itself is neither essentially concealing nor revealing, but its implications for research must be constantly considered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a regional input-output model is used to evaluate the distribution of short-run and long-run economic impacts of regional level environmental policy decisions among urban and rural household income classes. Both demand and price changes are analyzed. Demand changes are modeled as increases in final demand, and price changes are analyzed as exogenous shocks. In the short run, regional prices do not respond to the exogenous price shocks but, in the long run, the regional prices can vary following input substitution in a Cobb-Douglas production function. An income allocation matrix distributes to income classes the wage and nonwage income changes generated by the input-output formulations. A case study is presented that involves efforts to enhance fish populations in the Columbia River Basin in the US Pacific Northwest. The policy analysis shows that the type of initial policy impact (change in final demand or in prices) as well as the time frame considered (short or long run) can influence the final distribution of economic impacts among urban and rural income classes. The approach outlined here thus allows decisionmakers to explore several aspects of the income effects of a project across disaggregated segments of an affected population. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade, the U.S. electronics industry has experienced a 10% annual growth rate in the assembly of printed wiring boards (PWBs). For many companies, this activity represents the most profitable component of their business with revenues in the billions for the industry as a whole. The basic functions associated with PWB assembly include inventory management, materials handling, production scheduling, and quality control, all of which are subject to a host of system-wide constraints. For the Texas Instruments facility in Austin, Texas, planning and scheduling is further complicated by the need to deal with over 10,000 different components and up to 400 different board types, each with their individual routing and bill of materials. This paper describes a decision support system known as Insites designed to assist Texas Instruments in the day-to-day assembly operations of their PWB facilities. The emphasis is on the heuristic techniques used to solve the underlying multiple machine scheduling problem and the efforts undertaken to validate and deploy the system. The identified benefits, coupled with the acceptance of Insites by both shop floor personnel and management, led the way to full system integration in early 1992. </jats:p>",

A mathematical planning model is used for the entire Israeli agricultural sector, in which an ‘optimal’ allocation of the water resources is found and compared to the existing one.</jats:p><jats:p>The results of the model are used in order to gain insight into the shadow price of the different water bodies in Israel (about eight). These prices can then be used to grant property rights to the water users themselves in order to guarantee rational behavior of water use, since now one can sell their rights at the source itself. The implication is clear with regard to any possible movement towards a market system in any other sector. From the dual prices of the primal problem we can forecast the equilibrium prices and their implications for the different users. The central government does not have to interfere with the market mechanism because, as will be shown, every farmer has the option to sell his right or to use it. As participation in the market is voluntary, every farmer makes a decision that is both individually and socially rational. However, in moving from a central planning allocation to a market mechanism, the government has another task, which is to <jats:italic>grant</jats:italic> the property rights in order for the market to begin to evolve. It is not guaranteed that under any initial allocation a decentralization of the system will benefit <jats:italic>all</jats:italic> the regions but at least part of the problem is to be resolved between the regions themselves.</jats:p><jats:p>As the results shows, there is a potential budgetary benefit of 28 million dollars when capital cost is not included and 64 million dollars when they are included.</jats:p>",

The focus of the paper is on jury trials, where lawyers engage in an open contest to develop the most convincing narrative.

The author also argues for the necessity to recognize the influence of extralegal discourses on interpretive legal struggles, and focuses in particular on two such discourses, those of morality and scientific administration. It is further suggested that such discourses can be infused with conceptions of space and territory in ways that affect their capacity to influence juries, An attempt is made to demonstrate the significance of these arguments with an analysis of the trials of the four Los Angeles Police Department officers charged in the beating of Rodney King. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The 1984 municipal incorporation of West Hollywood, California offers an opportunity to explore two related themes: (1) the role of place in the creation of identity generally, and (2) the role of place in the creation of sexual identity in particular. Work on the second subject has largely concentrated on the political economy of gay territories, although there has been an ongoing concern with the symbolic importance of these places. Although these studies have provided valuable insights on these themes, they do not reflect the renewed concern in humanistic geography with the normative importance of place, and the study of morally valued ways of life. These latter topics provide alternative avenues into questions of identity. In the coverage of the incorporation campaign, the gay press presented an idealized image of the city. In defining a new gay identity, the gay press utilized the holistic quality of place to weave together the ‘natural’ and cultural elements of West Hollywood. This idealized ‘gay city’ united the place's real and imagined physical attributes with social and personal characteristics of gay men. More simply, the qualities of the city itself expressed intellectual and moral virtues, such that characterizations of the city became part of a narrative defining the meaning of ‘gay’. This new gay male identity included seven elements: creativity, aesthetic sensibility, an orientation toward entertainment or consumption, progressiveness, responsibility, maturity, and centrality. The effort to create an identity centered on West Hollywood was relatively conservative in the sense that it was not a fundamental challenge to existing social and political systems. Rather, it reflected a strategy based on an ethnicity model, seeking to ‘demarginalize’ gays and to bring them closer to the symbolic ‘center’ of US society.</jats:p>",

This paper is an exploration of the patterns revealed by these new data. After an introduction to the subject of the paper in section 1, section 2 is a discussion of the issue of ethnic group identification and measurement. In section 3 the spatial distribution of six ethnic groups is outlined: Whites, Blacks, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Other-ethnicities in two northern British cities—Leeds and Bradford. Nonwhite groups all show a familiar inner-city concentration, but with some interesting locational differences. The degree of change over the period 1981–91 is examined by using synthetic estimates of ethnic group for 1981 based on country of birth converted into ethnic group via conditional probabilities of ethnicity given country of birth. The degree of spatial change and dispersion is evaluated. Sections 4 and 5 are examinations of the characteristics of each ethnic group according to thirty indicators grouped into six domains: demographic, household, employment, education, social class, and housing/consumption. The rationale for indicator extraction and use is described and the degree of reliance which can be placed in the statistics is assessed in section 4. The differences in profile between ethnic groups are established at city level and then the pattern of variation across wards in each city is described in section 5. A fascinating picture unfolds of disadvantage and advantage across the ethnic groups which establishes their sociogeographic position in the two northern city societies. </jats:p>",

Discussions surrounding the future political and constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland frequently include evidence adduced about the relative size of the two ‘tribes’ widely identified by the labels ‘Protestant’ and ‘Catholic’. The major source of that evidence comes from the question on religion contained in the Northern Ireland Census, and this paper is concerned with the nature and use of that data. The legitimacy of certain uses of the data is questioned; the reliability of the data is considered; and certain tentative findings are presented based on the data published in the (hard copy) reports.

To appraise the Ohaozara Five-Year Action Plan, 600 persons stratified by geographical location and sex were interviewed in three randomly selected autonomous communities in the Ohaozara Local Government Area to determine their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP). </jats:p><jats:p> The findings in this study showed a high awareness level with a moderately positive attitude and generally low level of practice. Comprehensive reproductive health education (RHE), budgetary increase, evaluation of FYAP, and program coordination arc recommended. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper describes an attempt to derive a median effect level (EC50) of PCBs for reproduction of mink based on experimental literature data. Unfortunately, the conditions of the mink studies carried out during the last two decades vary widely, which makes it difficult to establish unequivocal dose-effect relationships. This study describes an attempt to correct for the differences in exposure time using a one-compartment bioaccumulation model. This model estimates the whole-body concentration of PCBs in mink. Two approaches are tested. First, the whole-body concentration of 10 isomer groups of PCBs in mink were estimated and compared with reproduction data to calculate an EC50 value. Alternatively, estimates for the whole-body concentration in mink of 11 individual biologically active PCB congeners were made. With these, the toxic equivalent concentration (TEC) in mink was estimated using the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalent factor (TEF) approach. Whole-body dose-effect relationships were estimated and EC50 values for litter size and kit survival were calculated. The application of the one-compartment bioaccumulation model of the first approach resulted in a significant improvement in the dose-effect relationship in comparison to the raw data set. A further improvement in this relationship was achieved using the congener-specific bioaccumulation model in combination with the TEF approach. This study proposes a critical body residue (EC50) for mink litter size of 1.2 μg/g (total PCBs/wet weight). From the second approach a critical body residue (EC50) expressed in TCDD equivalency for litter size of 160 pg/g (TCDD equivalence/wet weight) and 200 ng/g (TCDD equivalence/wet weight) for kit survival is proposed.</jats:p>",
