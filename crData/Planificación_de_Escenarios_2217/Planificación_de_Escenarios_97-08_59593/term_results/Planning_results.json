      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning theory and social choice theory are merged to shed light on a liberal paradox. The theorem stating the impossibility of a Paretian liberal says that a cycle-free collective decision procedure cannot be guaranteed with liberalism and preference sovereignty. Liberalism grants each individual some right to decide within his or her personal sphere, and preference sovereignty means that the Pareto principle is respected. It may be impossible to design procedures for planning and decision making simultaneously realizing the values of rationality, individual liberty, and the public interest. In light of social choice theory, the article examines whether the well-known modes of planning prescribe practices serving to alleviate this conflict or causing it to arise lessfrequently. The author concludes that several modes (e.g., disjointed incrementalism, critical pragmatism) hold such properties and shows how communicative planning helps to circumvent Sen's liberal paradox. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I endeavour to show that town planning in Britain, although placed within the ‘public domain’, is largely operating in accordance with the principles of private law. I also argue that town planning is an integral part of the land and property market which itself is conditioned by the definition of the rights in land and property. These rights are shown to be grounded in the traditions of the private land law as evolved over centuries from the feudal system of land and property relations. I therefore begin with an examination of development under the leasehold system in London during the 18th and 19th centuries and find that landowners, in their efforts of maintaining the value of their estate, conducted a form of environmental control very similar to what planners do nowadays as part of their activities in development control. It is then shown how the old system was unable to cope with the pressures of industrialisation and rapidly expanding urban areas. Politicians, royal commissions, and expert committees sought to adapt the leasehold system and to reform existing property rights to accommodate a newly emerging property market. These efforts finally culminated in the 1925 Property Statutes. At the same time governments pursued efforts of devising new structures of urban governance. However, these measures generally were piecemeal and their implementation was fraught with difficulties. A new approach, recognising the interdependence between market processes, market regulation, and ‘public improvement’, were championed by the radical Liberals towards the end of the 19th century. This philosophy is reflected in the enactment of the first planning statutes of 1909 and 1919. Both Acts made provisions for the retainment of development value for reasons of social justice and the funding of urban infrastructure. Subsequent enactments have tended to isolate town planning not only from housing but also from the land market and the issue of betterment, and thus from urban governance. The reason, it is argued, is that property as well as planning legislation are still hemmed in the strait-jacket of the private land law. I conclude that the isolation of town planning within a fragmented ‘public domain’ bodes ill for the future of our cities. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this review is to examine the conceptual issues surrounding this theory, to analyze NIDL's intellectual relationship to key economic theories, and to draw a conceptual critique. </jats:p>",

In the current paper these restrictions are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters. These limitations result in a system of inequalities for core length and displacement velocity. For the cases of waterflood and EOR, the sets of significant parameters have been determined. The code written in a simple spreadsheet allows to determine minimum core length which provides fulfillment of above mentioned conditions and to calculate the optimal displacement velocity.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Relative phase permeabilities are the basic functions which determine the efficiency of the waterflooding.

We study a popular class of serial assembly lines where all stations have the same production cycle. We address a workforce planning problem for such lines which finds applications in labor-intensive operations in automobile, fire engine, aircraft, and PC board assembly. The problem presented can be applied to lines that produce several variations of a basic stable design; i.e., mixed model transfer lines. Given a set of n jobs, we want to find a sequence that minimizes the maximum workforce requirements over all production cycles. An optimal polynomial algorithm for the two-station line is presented, and the three-station case is proved to be strongly 𝒩𝒫-complete. Several heuristic algorithms that produce upper and lower bounds are developed for the general problem. Worst case behavior of the upper bounds, as well as average performance of lower and upper bounds, are reported. Computational results show that some of the heuristics produce near optimal solutions. As an extension of the basic model we exploit the tradeoff between cycle time and workforce level. </jats:p>",

The existence of latent and explicit managerial parameters to the role played by users in the planning of services was confirmed by the research at a very general level.

Set against the backdrop of the shift from government to governance, the SRB is read as a mechanism through which those occupying ‘spaces of governance’ are further empowered. With the real costs of the competition hidden, the author seeks to unpack the bidding partnerships, seeing the SRB as a dynamic process. Grounded in the USA, urban regime theory seeks to explain the rise and management of coalitions. In conclusion, the author suggests that the discourses surrounding the SRB, which emphasise empowerment, the role of the ‘community’, and the importance of coalitions in procuring discretionary funding, outweighs the monies available and that instead it is participation in the competitive process that is important. </jats:p>",

Corresponding to the two routing policies, two location models are introduced: the reliable 1-median and a location framework for considering multiple routes. Based on realistic assumptions for assigning accident probabilities to segments created when an edge location is considered, vertex optimality results for both problems are obtained. An example to illustrate reliable routing and location in Massachusetts is provided. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Forestry planning is usually approached as the problem of combining and scheduling stand treatments. Stands are assumed to be homogeneous and spatially static and are usually delineated and described by subjective surveying methods. Because, in reality, stands vary internally, only subsets of the possible management alternatives will be considered in stand-based planning. As price expectations and other planning parameters change over time, it is likely that optimal locations, extensions, and schedules for forest operations change. This paper proposes a method whereby timber volumes and treatment priorities are estimated on objectively inventoried geo-referenced circular plots. Kriging interpolation and image analysis of scanned aerial photographs are then used to predict the variables in a spatially near-continuous raster. Treatment units are dynamically formed, based on price-expectations, and objectives defined by the forest owner. Given strategic goals, tactical plans are produced for two wood price situations, and compared with a plan based on conventional stands. The results imply that forest management planning should, perhaps, not be based on static stands if economic efficiency and planning flexibility are desirable. For. Sci. 43(3):317-326.</jats:p>",

The problem is not that there is no theory of economic development but that there is too much and that there is little unity to this theory. Theory is also by construction about \"what is, \"whereas planning is about \"what should be. \"Planning is socially constituted and is, therefore, contingent on ideology, history, and politics. Similarly, planning initiatives reverberate through a region's historic, geographic, economic, social, and political fabric. It is the artificial separation of theory and planning that is at the heart of both \"the problem with planning\" and the \"problem with theory.\" </jats:p>",

The two laws are also viewed within the broader framework of an hierarchically structured urban system. Exact correspondence between the laws is again possible under particular circumstances, but the descriptive capacity of the LMA is greatly increased when approximation is allowed.

After increasing for several decades, the index declined in the 1970s when nonmetropolitan population growth surged past metropolitan-area growth, but the index rose in the 1980s as metropolitan population growth recovered and surpassed nonmetropolitan growth. We update these trends, introducing careful controls for changes in metropolitan-area boundaries, and we incorporate a ‘functional urban region’ approach. Although the nonmetropolitan population growth rate is still below the metropolitan rate, we conclude that in the 1990s some features of the ‘turnaround’ of the 1970s have returned. </jats:p>",

This gap is not a rent gap, therefore, but an investment gap. Modelled in this manner, gentrification appears as a problem of maximization under constraint and a subsubset of general home improvements. It is a transient and historically unique (noncyclical) phenomenon. Similarly, these constraints and the opportunities currently available to overcome them exist only in a particular historical context, the peculiarities of which must also be taken into account if gentrification is fully to be explained. In particular, these include the development of domestic technologies and the 19th-century conditions of supply of the housing available currently for gentrifying. I concentrate on the supply-side issues in gentrification, but deny that the demand-side issues can be handled via explanations based on postindustrialism, postmodernity, or the rise of a new middle class. </jats:p>",

We constructed a mixed-integer programming model to support this planning effort in several South Carolina counties; however, we encountered a number of problems in moving the optimal solution into the decision-making process. Most of these problems emanated from the fact that people making policy decisions know that many factors must be considered that are not part of an economic model. We discovered that understanding the decision-making process was key to having the optimal solution used during planning. This understanding led us to construct a spreadsheet-based model to serve as an interface between the optimization model and the decision makers. As such, the planning effort was greatly enhanced by the information contained in the optimization model, but it included all the other factors that are important to communities but are not modeled. We provide the actual results from one county as a case study. </jats:p>",

The production of difference is characterized as necessarily a social and a spatial process which allows the self to be partitioned from the Other. In the aggregate, such processes facilitate the stigmatization of whole classes of people and the institutionalization of rules for boundary maintenance between different groups. One important consequence among the population at large is a ‘hierarchy of acceptance’, that is, a structure of preferential ranking among various disability categories. A metaanalysis of 44 acceptance hierarchy studies since 1968 reveals both stability and change in community preference structures. The largest impetus for change derives from the appearance of new ‘disabilities’ including most especially people with AIDS, and homeless people. Evidence also suggests that significant attitudinal variations occur through space as well as time and when different facility types are considered and that actual behavior may differ from expressed attitudinal preferences. This paper concludes with remarks directed toward a more adequate sociospatial theory of disability. </jats:p>",

With the convergence of the traditional familial order and the development of a modern nation-state, the “public” sphere of the Chinese socialist state is a disrupted space where the “state” still calls for its people's sacrifice for the collective good and yet at the same time, a terrian where citizens can claim their rights. It is also a domain where Chinese women's reproduction is collectivized for the cause of socialist modernization and yet a realm where they claim their voices. In the conclusion, the author addresses the question of Chinese women's agency in maneuvering through the patriarchal system and using the policy as a springboard to effecting changes in it. </jats:p>",

Instructional effects have been investigated using different research designs (multiple-baseline-across-subjects with multiple probes in baseline and between-group comparisons); in different settings (individual instruction, small groups in resource rooms, and general education classrooms); and with different types of students (fifth through eighth graders, including students with and without learning disabilities). Instructional procedures and methodology from these studies are summarized, and the central findings from the first two investigations are presented. Suggestions for future interventions that focus on planning strategies are proposed. </jats:p>",

The evidence indicates that such schemes typically produce variable but limited VFM, reflecting deficiencies both in the quality of the access experiences provided and in the information flow to the public. Mechanisms for increasing efficiency are discussed. The current expansion of public expenditure on access, despite evidence of limited benefits to users, is analysed by examining the positions of actors and interest groups within the policy process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the postwar long boom, the economic, political, and cultural configurations adopted to regulate the crisis tendencies of capitalism in New Zealand were broadly those of social democracy. Key features of social democratic policy in this period were the assistance of primary production through subsidies, the protection of domestic industry, a well-developed welfare state, and the promotion of economic development in marginal places and regions. These regulatory arrangements found expression as a distinctive geography of the long boom. In small towns this was typified by clusters of agencies associated with the state's intervention in production and its provision of infrastructure. Local employment was often concentrated in these agencies. We examine the nature of such a geography during the long boom in Reefton, a small town on the West Coast of the South Island, and its subsequent reworking during the restructuring of the 1980s. This reworking is explored through a focus on the major state and private sector workplaces within the town's economic base and their employees. As key influences upon the newly emerging geography of the town, the forms of local governance that are being adopted in order to attract the spending and investment lost during restructuring are examined. </jats:p>",

In it we review the contemporary child-care and preschool education service issue; consider questions of market efficiency and equity, and formulate these in a general equilibrium model which generates testable household labour-supply and service-supply functions. In part 2 we report on an empirical study in which aggregate versions of these functions are calibrated for the supply of labour from mothers with young children and for the supply of childminding services. We focus on the childminder sector, which is of interest as a personal social service that has traditionally been left to the private sector and as a private service with relatively easy entry and exit. These models yield interesting results which indicate on the one hand that access to child-care services is a binding constraint on female labour-market participation and on the other, that the supply of child-care services is quite unresponsive to demand. </jats:p>",

The SAR does not give information on why such moves have taken place. However, an examination of the characteristics of the movers and their elderly receivers, and the relationships between the two, sheds some light on the issue. Analysis shows that most movement into the homes of elderly people is by people who are related to them—mainly their children and their children's partners and/or children. It is often assumed that coresidence between elderly people and their younger relatives is driven by the care needs of the older generation. However, in this paper we cast doubt on this simple assumption, arguing that it is equally necessary to look at the characteristics and circumstances of movers in order to understand coresidence in the elderly households under examination. </jats:p>",

The discussion is set in the context of recent work by Clark and Wrigley in which they seek to relate locational decisions and other elements of corporate strategy to the economic concept of sunk costs. This concept is shown to be relevant to the recent experience of some British retailers which have incurred irrecoverable costs through overpayment for ‘premium’ sites for grocery store development. More generally, property development and ownership have in recent years become important activities for leading retail firms. Policies to separate property ownership and management from the mainstream retail trading function appear to have been successful, but some companies have lost money through overambitious programmes of property development. The conclusion is that, though retail development inevitably incurs sunk costs both at entry and exit, these are for most companies outweighed by the long-term growth of land and property values in the United Kingdom. Sunk costs may therefore be of less significance than in other types of private enterprise. </jats:p>",

Such a concept has allowed regional and local influence to be presented as the context in which the operation of global processes is fine-tuned, rather than as being a formative part of those processes. I aim to apply nonhierarchical modes of thinking about scale to an empirical example by examining a federally funded urban development programme in Adelaide: the Western Area Strategy, a federal initiative, administered in a local setting by a state administration. The relations between processes, institutions, sociocultural, economic, and political conditions at a variety of scales are shown to operate simultaneously and multidirectionally in defining the local outcomes of the programme. These relations are constitutive of scale itself. The ‘local’ outcomes of policy are shown to be formulated at a variety of scales and to be mutually constitutive of outcomes at other, ‘higher’, scales. Accepting the notion that scales are mutually constitutive and questioning the production of scale and interscale relations opens new paths of explanation for the spectrum of economic, sociocultural, and political processes determining the nature of contemporary society and determining their concrete expression in political and social interactions within nation-states and localities. </jats:p>",

A global path planning technique is used where the paths are represented by a string of via-points that the robots have to pass through, connected together by cubic spline polynomials. Since the entire paths of the robots are considered for optimization, the problem of deadlock between the arms and the static obstacles does not occur. Repeated path modification is done through evolutionary techniques to find an optimized path with respect to length and collision among the robots and the obstacles and the robots themselves. The proposed algorithm departs from simple genetic algorithms in that floating point vector strings represent the chromosomes and customized operators are used to improve upon the performance of the search. Moreover, a local search is carried out on each individual in addition to the global population based search. The result is a highly efficient path-planning algorithm that can deal with complex problems easily. Simulation results are presented for collision-free paths planned for two planar arms and then for two 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) PUMA®-like arms moving in three-dimensional operational space.</jats:p>",

Six‐month follow‐up was obtained at both time periods.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</jats:bold>: Advance care planning was defined as the documentation in the medical record of a living will, a durable power of attorney, a “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) order, a “Do Not Hospitalize” (DNH) order, or an order to forgo artificial nutrition or hospitalization.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: The rate of chart documentation of living wills increased from 4.2% in 1990 to 13.3% in 1993, and DNR orders increased dramatically from 31.1% to 51.5%. The rates of DNH and orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition remained less than 8% in both years. We found striking variations in advance care planing among the 10 states. In 1990, having a DNR order varied from 10.1% to 69.2% across the 10 states. With the exception of Oregon, where 69.2% of patients already had a DNR order, the states saw a 1.5 to 3.1 times increase in the rate of DNR orders in 1993 compared with 1990.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>: With the implementation of the PSDA, there was modest increase in documentation of living wills, but DNH and orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition remained the same. There was a substantial increase in DNR orders that began before the PSDA implementation. This increase was associated both with the implementation of the PSDA and the increased debate about the appropriateness of CPR for nursing home residents. This increase varied considerably among geographic areas from the 10 states. Future research is needed to understand this geographic variation.</jats:p>",
