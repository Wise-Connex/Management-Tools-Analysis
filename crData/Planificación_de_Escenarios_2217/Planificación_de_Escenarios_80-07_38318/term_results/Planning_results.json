Application of computer graphics to distribution engineering simplifies data base formation and maintenance and aids in interpreting the results of analysis. Graphic-aided distribution analysis allows the engineer to quickly see the results of alternate modes of system operations, thus speeding the iterative process of decision-making. Future applications for graphics techniques in utilities extend to distribution SCADA, work order prepration and protective device coordination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Program planning refers to the process of selecting an integrated set of projects for implementation. Ultimately, decisions tend to be “political” in the sense that they involve compromises and tradeoffs among different interests, though the arguments may be couched in technical terms. Program planning may be structured as a multi-stage process. One stage involves the assessment of various alternatives for the project components of the program. A second stage then involves the selection of the required program, i.e., a specific combination of project designs. This paper presents a Boolean method called Interactive Program Planning (IPP) for structuring the assessment process at the project level. The method may be used in an interactive procedure that finds which project alternatives are acceptable to different interest groups. An algorithm that identifies crucial points of disagreement between groups may then be used to help reduce disagreements, thus enlarging the set of acceptable programs. Although the focus here is on program planning, the method is of general relevance to complex issues involving collective decisions. Further, IPP implies the view that optimization methods requiring (a perhaps implicit) consensus on general objectives are of limited value as general frameworks for program planning. Instead (or in addition) the program planning process should be supported by interactive methods that can assist in achieving the widespread acceptance of specific alternatives which meet a variety of perhaps conflicting interests. </jats:p>",

In particular, the central axiom in his paper is shown to be equivalent to a pair of independent axioms, designated as the ‘cumulative dominance’ and ‘cumulative separation’ properties of perceived-accessibility behavior. In addition, it is shown that the degree of perceived substitutability among spatial alternatives plays an important role in distinguishing the behavior implicit in each of these properties. Finally, it is shown that this axiom system together with that in Weibull's paper offers certain analytical advantages over more classical characterizations of additive accessibility measures. </jats:p>",

The objective is to maximize net present value resulting from the optimal combination of life insurance and self‐insurance, subject to a budget constraint in each period of a finite horizon. In addition, a death‐benefit requirement must be satisfied in each period. The model is sufficiently flexible to include both term and whole life (cash value) insurance, self‐insurance (alternative investment), policy loans, and buy back (cancellation) amounts in each period. By modifying the budgets and requirements, the model provides useful information related to interest‐adjusted cost and marginal rate of return which can then be used to compare different policies. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the technique.</jats:p>",

At the level of the British standard region, where employment data by industry are readily available, experiments are conducted on a variety of aggregations of freight-flow data to see whether explanatory-variable data collection and manipulation can be minimized. This would be the case if common relationships between freight generated and employment data hold for broad groupings such as ‘heavy’ industry, chemicals, and engineering. At the zonal level an examination is made of the spatial distribution of residuals from the regression of total road freight generated on resident population. It is shown that for different zone types different relationships hold, and it is demonstrated that the centre–periphery explanation of the spatial distribution of residuals can be seen to be valid if ‘centre’ and ‘periphery’ are defined in a functional sense. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a previous article published in this journal (Anas, 1979a), a simulation model developed by the author was used to examine the impact of transit investment on property values in an urban transportation corridor that had a completely centralized employment distribution. The present paper examines the effect of rail-transit investment in the context of various scenarios which deal with urban employment decentralization, housing distribution, transportation pricing, and income composition. From these simulations it appears that under a variety of assumptions regarding urban change the taxation of short-run differential changes in property values caused by transit investment can raise only a small portion of the cost of typical transit investments. The distinctive feature of the simulation model is that it is consistent with the discrete-choice theory of travel demand currently used in transportation planning and travel-demand prediction. But whereas the state of the art in transportation planning ignores the simultaneity of transportation changes and price changes in the housing market, the model developed here is a first attempt to deal with these effects by incorporating discrete-choice theory into a Walrasian market-equilibration procedure. In addition to being a theoretical alternative to the classical bid-rent model, still made use of by urban economists, the new approach is computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale simulation. </jats:p>",

A two-stage estimation procedure is used to analyze the significance of origin characteristics as determinants of out-migration, and the factors that allocate migrants to particular destinations. The model is applied to understanding the patterns and determinants of out-migration from a depressed region, the Central Appalachians of the United States of America. Time-series and cross-sectional models are utilized to evaluate the hypothesized two-stage process over the period 1958–1975. </jats:p>",

The problem has been formulated as a deterministic discrete-time optimal control problem, with linear transition equations, a highly nonlinear objective, and bounds on both the state and the control variables. The solution algorithm is of the reduced gradient type, with the control variables nonbasic to provide good conditioning. Because of the linear relationship between the state and control variables, the set of feasible directions at a point is a polyhedral convex cone and the bounds both on the state and control variables can be accounted for by means of an algorithm for the orthogonal projection of the gradient on the cone. Some computational experience with this large-scale non-linear program is given, followed by a discussion of implementation. </jats:p>",
