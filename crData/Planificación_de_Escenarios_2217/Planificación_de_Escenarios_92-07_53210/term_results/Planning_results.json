Although ‘projectized development assistance’ is viewed by many as inappropriate to bring about development, projects are bound to remain for some time an important instrument of development assistance. Project managers, donor agencies and recipient countries need to be aware of the extent that their projects are likely to be sustained in the future and contribute to the viability of the whole health system. This article proposes a conceptual framework to monitor the performance of externally‐assisted health projects in building their own sustainability.

Utilizing their frameworks, this article offers an explanation for the development of high‐volume screening mammography policies in Canada, despite the suggested inefficacy of screening technologies for ‘unavoidable’ illnesses such as carcinoma in the breast. The preliminary results of Canada's National Breast Screening Study further complicate this issue. Inappropriate framing of the ‘problem’ in the policy‐making process, by actors highly influenced by societal values and scientific evidence, is identified as the reason for present and planned policies and practices contradicting the first principles of health‐policy analysis.</jats:p>",

When every point of the robot body is subject to potential collision. The corresponding planning system must include these four basic components: sensor hardware; real-time signal/sensory data processing hardware/software; a local step planning subsystem that works at the basic sample rate of the arm; and finally, a subsystem for global planning. The arm sensor system developed at Yale University presents a proximity sensitive skin that covers the whole body of the arm and consists of an array of discrete active infrared sensors that detect obstacles by processing reflected light. The sensor data then undergoes low level processing via a step planning procedure, which converts sensor information into local normals at the contact points in the configuration space of the robot. This paper presents preliminary results on the fourth component, a real-time algorithm that realizes the upper, global level of planning. Based on the current collection of local normals, the algorithm generates preferable directions of motion around obstacles, so as to guarantee reaching the target position if it is reachable. Experimental results from testing the developed system are also discussed.</jats:p>",

The analysis of data indicates that demographic, cultural, and spatial factors have stronger effects on the health search behavior of the parents than the socioeconomic conditions of the parents. The parents' preference for boys emerges as the strongest factors followed by distance to qualified doctors and parity. Implications of the findings are also discussed. </jats:p>",

As a result of variations in attractiveness and distance, destinations are considered to exert varying degrees of spatial dominance on origins and to compete on that basis for the attention of would-be movers. It is hypothesized that at origins where dominances are more uniform, there is ‘less to choose’ among destinations and it is more difficult to predict accurately spatial interaction (and vice versa). The basic concept put forth is that spatial uncertainty and the spatial interaction-model performance are related to the relative location of origins with respect to destinations. The empirical analysis employs data on recreational day travel and population migration. </jats:p>",

The deal to construct a modified version of General Dynamic's F-16 called the FSX (fighter support experimental) for the Japanese government with use of US technology was first approved by the Reagan administration and subsequently revised and supported by the Bush administration. The submission of the deal to Congress for approval by the Bush administration on 1 May 1989 provided the occasion for a sustained and wide-ranging debate within the US political system over the role of the USA in a changing world order. For many the question of the FSX fighter was symbolic of a series of larger issues which confronted the USA. Could the USA continue to conceptualize national security in geopolitical terms when its leading ally was also its leading competitor in world markets? Was the most significant threat to the USA from an East-West struggle with the Soviet Union, or with Japan? This paper is a critical geopolitics of the FSX debate in which the conflicting geographical scripts of Japan as both ally and threat are investigated. The debate provides a window into a larger struggle within the USA between an emergent geo-economic definition of national security and an increasingly materially unsustainable geopolitical vision of the US role in the world. </jats:p>",

Rationalization of production and distribution is postponed. The historical example is derived from the Swedish brewery industry. It may be seen as a game with a set of rules and some probabilistic parameters. The game is played thirty-seven times, by two persons at a time. The results span a spectrum of spatial strategies, dominated by three main types, one of which corresponds to the historical outcome. To get a firmer hold of ‘good’ strategies, the probabilistic elements are replaced by a simple indicator, the territory is abstracted into a network, and the decisionmaking sequence is analyzed deductively. The same three main types of strategy reemerge. One of them is tentatively considered to be a Nash equilibrium. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many multiple criteria decision making methods have been proposed and applied to water planning. Their purpose is to provide information on tradeoffs among objectives and to help users articulate value judgments in a systematic, coherent, and documentable manner. The wide variety of available techniques confuses potential users, causing inappropriate matching of methods with problems. Experiments in which water planners apply more than one multicriteria procedure to realistic problems can help dispel this confusion by testing method appropriateness, ease of use, and validity. We summarize one such experiment where U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel used several methods to screen urban water supply plans. The methods evaluated include goal programming, ELECTRE I, additive value functions, multiplicative utility functions, and three techniques for choosing weights (direct rating, indifference tradeoff, and the analytical hierarchy process). Among the conclusions we reach are the following. First, experienced planners generally prefer simpler, more transparent methods. Additive value functions are favored. Yet none of the methods are endorsed by a majority of the participants; many preferred to use no formal method at all. Second, there is strong evidence that rating, the most commonly applied weight selection method, is likely to lead to weights that fail to represent the trade‐offs that users are willing to make among criteria. Finally, we show that decisions can be as or more sensitive to the method used as to which person applies it. Therefore, if who chooses is important, then so too is how a choice is made.</jats:p>",

In each case there is a strong and steady downward trend of around 2% per annum and a price elasticity of less than 5%. It is argued that those accounts of energy use which attribute improvements in energy efficiency mainly to the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 are misspecified and wrong. It is suggested that the direct effect of the oil price on energy use is relatively small. This in turn implies that the use of general taxes such as a carbon tax is unlikely to be effective in reducing energy use without widespread collateral damage to the economy. </jats:p>",

Brotherton has made a comparison between the two most important types of agreement: management agreements on Sites of Special Scientific Interest and participation in Environmentally Sensitive Areas. However, his analysis suffers from a number of limitations which are not fully elaborated in the paper. As a result, there is little justification for the conclusions which he reaches. The comparative analysis of conservation instruments is an important objective, but more complete data and analysis are required. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, the government family planning service delivery systems, primarily the family welfare center (FWC), cover less than 10 percent of the people in rural areas. Although there are cultural and religious constraints to social change, it can be argued effectively from recent surveys that there is a considerable need for family planning that has yet to be met. Certain barriers to, and options for, meeting this need are reviewed, particularly in terms of strengthening information, communication and education (TEC) at the community level. </jats:p>",

All analyses are anchored to the study area itself; the region's ground-level reality plays a prominent role throughout; and the Amazon as a place is the object of study. The more universal the explanation, the less information it provides about the Ecuador Amazon per se; but each conceptualization illuminates a distinct aspect of the Amazon experience. A comprehensive understanding is the end result. The research protocol is situated within current concerns over place, the new regional geography, and related research strategies. </jats:p>",
