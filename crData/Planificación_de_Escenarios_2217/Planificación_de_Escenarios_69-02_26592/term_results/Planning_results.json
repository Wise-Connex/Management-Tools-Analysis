The system consists of a market-response model, a heuristic search routine, and a conversational input-output program. The user supplies a list of media options, a budget, and various objective and subjective data about the media options and the desired audience. The system selects a set of options and schedules them over time, seeking to maximize total market response. </jats:p><jats:p> The model of market response works as follows: The population is divided into market segments. People in each segment are characterized by their sales potential and media habits. Ads placed in the media options lead people to be exposed to the advertising. The pattern of exposures in each market segment is determined by media coverage and duplication data. People tend to forget exposures and so the retained exposure level decays in the absence of new advertising. The response of an individual, in terms of the fraction of sales potential realized by the advertiser, increases with exposure level but with diminishing returns. Total market response is a sum over people, market segments, and time periods. The calculation of response is based on analytic formulas that are computationally very efficient. </jats:p><jats:p> A maximum-seeking, heuristic calculation starts with any schedule, adds options with a high increment of response per dollar and deletes options with a low increment per dollar until no more improvement can be found for the given budget. </jats:p><jats:p> An on-line system, called mediac, permits the use of model and heuristic at a remote console of a time-shared computer. Communication with the computer is conversational and largely self-explanatory. The system is operational. Computing costs have been a fraction of a per cent of the cost of the media scheduled. Improvements over previous schedules, as calculated by the model from the user's input data, have run from 5 per cent to over 20 per cent. </jats:p>",

Due to changes in costs of leasing, purchase prices, etc., there should be frequent evaluations of whether the existing strategy is optimal. The usual approach is to perform a “macro-steady-state” analysis, where cash flows and/or return-on-investment calculations are performed. However, some macro-analyses indicate only which choice is preferable and do not take into account either the possibility of a mixed strategy (own some and lease some) or implementation problems and the resulting costs that occur when converting from one system to another. Furthermore, if there is to be a conversion from leased to owned equipment, additional burdens will be placed on the maintenance department. </jats:p><jats:p> An overall planning model has been developed which yields an optimum conversion schedule and the cost of conversion. The optimal solution can be updated over time if there are changes in leasing and purchasing costs, taxes, interest rate and maintenance costs. Various assumptions are discussed, along with the inputs, the model structure, and the use of a matrix generator. The specific example considered is the problem relating to leasing or purchasing railroad equipment for transporting finished products to the customer. </jats:p>",

Four basic characteristics are identified: (1) the subject of the model; (2) its function; (3) its underlying theory; and (4) its method. Besides providing a conceptual framework for the analysis and development of urban planning models, this conceptual scheme serves as the basis of a classification scheme which allows the study and comparison of existing models.
