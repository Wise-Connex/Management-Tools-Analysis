The second part of the paper attempts to foresee some potential alternatives to managing the crisis, on the basis of the projects of defending collective consumption, affirming cultural identity, and enhancing political self-management, that are being fostered by grass-roots groups and progressive local governments all over the world. Relying on some recent experiences of local government in Europe and the USA, the paper ends by outlining some alternative urban policies that could also be socially feasible, technically efficient, and politically progressive.

Many smaller firms, while remaining good \"oil finders,\" have difficulty maintaining control and direction during this rapid expansion. The recent weakness in petroleum prices and demand has emphasized the fragile financial prices and demand has emphasized the fragile financial position of many independent producers. Recognizing position of many independent producers. Recognizing the need for planning and financial controls can prevent serious financial problems from developing. prevent serious financial problems from developing. The independent petroleum industry represents a unique financial situation that influences appropriate planning activities. It is capital intensive with planning activities. It is capital intensive with most independent operators working in a capital rationing environment (more acceptable investment opportunities than available capital). At the same time the special financing approaches used by the industry may provide financial leverage while actually reducing the risk of the operator.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The operating characteristics are also unique, resulting in high operating leverage. As with all high operating leverage situations, petroleum production has relatively high fixed costs compared production has relatively high fixed costs compared to variable costs, creating high profit margins on incremental production. Earnings and cash flow will be sensitive to both volume and price changes. However, there is also the factor of exploration success which can result in even greater changes in production volume and therefore earnings. A relatively small change in exploration success, either in number or quality of discoveries, would have a substantial effect on the smaller producer. Manufacturing and other traditional industries do not have this unique characteristic.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Management \"style\" also plays a role in designing an appropriate planning operation. Frequently firms have grown from a \"one man operation.\" Delegating authority and establishing more ridgid management guidelines is not always an easy transition.

Most aspects of strategic planning will be closely related to operational decisions. The dynamics of the industry in recent years has led to changing strategies. However, the strategic decisions may have been passive rather than intentional changes in the firms' passive rather than intentional changes in the firms' operation. Care must be taken that new unplanned and possibly undesirable strategies are not imposed through a series of operational decisions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Pure strategic decisions are made infrequently, therefore analysis of these strategies should not consume a major share of the resources devoted to planning within the independent firm. Strategic decision areas would include geographic area of operation, financing sources, mix of exploration/ development/workover ventures, mix of oil versus gas exploration or production, degree of participation in ventures, diversification within the industry and selling existing production. Although these all have substantial strategic implications, the decision frequently results from operational analysis of investment opportunities rather than an intentional strategic decision.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>p. 231</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Starting in the mid‐1960s, many firms issued bonds and borrowed heavily to fuel their growth. At the time, this method of creating capital offered numerous potential benefits, including improved returns to shareholders and lower average costs of capital. However, as the economy began to enter a volatile period of increased competition and skyrocketing interest rates, many firms began to feel the first symptoms of overindulgence in debt. Yet, despite these warning symptoms, the trend toward higher leverage and declining interest‐expense‐coverage ratios continued clear through the 1970s. Only with the financial crunch of the 1980s bringing the well‐publicized problems of Braniff, Chrysler, and International Harvester before us as cautionary tales, have corporate strategists begun to ask themselves: Has financial leverage gone too far?</jats:p>",

TPLAN is an “Open” system that provides the user with a collection of conformable utility functions which operate on the principal tables. The package consists of 52 APL functions which contain an average of 3-4 lines of code.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains a critical review of the concept of urban politics by means of an examination of three theoretical problems: the specificity of the term urban, the question of the local state, and the separation of the economic and the political in capitalism. Recent work on urban politics is seen to rely on untheorised notions of politics which rest on ahistoric and ethnocentric conceptions of the urban. The term the local state, it is argued, misleadingly conflates theoretical and empiricist approaches becoming therefore a slogan rather than the name of a theoretically coherent object of study. A different perspective is proposed which rejects the label urban, but which focuses on state organisation and contradictory relations between central and noncentral government. This necessarily involves consideration of historical dimensions of state formation, and of class struggle within and against state institutions and their many and varied concrete manifestations. The conclusions stress the need to replace ahistoric notions like urban politics with theoretically rigorous historical analyses, and outline some research implications in the Australian context. </jats:p>",

The benefits of such participation have not, however, been documented through controlled experimental inquiry. The present study tested the hypotheses that participation in course planning would result in higher achievement and satisfaction. A post-test only control group design was employed with replication. The subjects of the initial experiment were 28 nursing supervisors randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions. The experimental group participated in planning their course in supervision. The control group completed the course as planned by the experimental group. The experiment was then replicated with 26 support service supervisors. The results were nearly identical for both experiments. No differences were found between the experimental and control groups in either achievement or satisfaction. One explanation for the findings is that control group subjects reaped the benefits of a “good course” planned by co-workers with similar needs. Nonetheless, direct participation in itself was found to have no effects, thereby raising important questions for future research. </jats:p>",

FMSs are becoming an attractive substitute for the conventional means of batch manufacturing, especially in the metal-cutting industry. This new production technology has been designed to attain the efficiency of well-balanced, machine-paced transfer lines, while utilizing the flexibility that job shops have to simultaneously machine multiple part types. Some properties and constraints of these systems are similar to those of flow and job shops, while others are different. This technology creates the need to develop new and appropriate planning and control procedures that take advantage of the system's capabilities for higher production rates. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper defines a set of five production planning problems that must be solved for efficient use of an FMS, and addresses specifically the grouping and loading problems. These two problems are first formulated in detail as nonlinear 0-1 mixed integer programs. In an effort to develop solution methodologies for these two planning problems, several linearization methods are examined and applied to data from an existing FMS. To decrease computational time, the constraint size of the linearized integer problems is reduced according to various methods. Several real world problems are solved in very reasonable time using the linearization that results in the fewest additional constraints and/or variables. The problem characteristics that determine which linearization to use, and the application of the linearized models in the solution of actual planning problems, are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The problem is essentially one of model misspecification. With a correctly specified model assumed, in which destination attraction depends on whether it is near to an origin or not, the consequences of using a misspecified model are examined. Explicit expressions for bias in the parameter estimates are derived; these are complex, but depend on terms that can be clearly interpreted in terms of aspects of spatial structure, such as scale, compactness, shape, remoteness of destinations, etc. Some simple special cases show how, with misspecified models, estimates from different systems will almost certainly differ. Extensions of the analysis and problems of estimation and interpretation are discussed. </jats:p>",

A hypothetical model using mean cost components has been presented, together with strategies for cost reduction. Although clinical cost management is a complex task, these costs are the most significant and manageable in the dental school. Clinical cost containment is related to curriculum, faculty ego, staff morale, and many other factors separate from clinic operations. Rational cost containment requires a thorough understanding of the relative value of various costs and of the interrelation of costs, as well as firm commitment to control these costs by responsible faculty, particularly the dean. The escalating effect of uncontrolled clinical costs may result in the financial downfall of some schools in the 1980s. The observation that in the average dental school costs exceed income by a factor of approximately 3.5:1 (with an estimated range of 2:1 to 30:1) suggests that cutting costs in many schools may be more effective than raising clinic income. With inflation, the effect of the predominant cost factor versus income becomes more significant over time.</jats:p>",

It is argued that the nature of the changing interrelationships between production and reproduction, as part of a single inseparable process that varies across space and over time, should be the key focus for a feminist urban studies. Ways in which an understanding of these changing relationships can add to the analysis of housing policy in postwar Britain are outlined. </jats:p><jats:p> The principal aim of the paper is advocacy, and the plea is for feminist theory and feminist analysis. It is beginning to be accepted that urban studies, by ignoring gender divisions, is neglecting an important structuring element of urban space and urban processes. Recognition of the significance of gender divisions, however, must not lead to an insistence on analysis focusing solely on women and women's behaviour. Thus the object of feminist research should not be women alone, but rather the structure of social relations that contributes to female oppression, this involving confrontation with the theoretical issues raised by an analysis of patriarchy (a term used here to refer to temporally and spatially specific relations between men and women, rather than to the oppression of all women in all forms of society). Despite the advances already made in integrating women's lives into urban studies, a large number of the studies about women and the urban environment are ultimately unsatisfactory. Their foci stop short at the description and analysis of women's behaviour only. However, this is not to denigrate the very real function they serve in bringing gender differences to the research forefront. After a review of the literature on gender differences in the organisation, use, and conception of urban space, a more specific focus for a feminist urban studies is outlined, with an example of how this might be applied to the historical analysis of postwar housing policy in Britain. </jats:p>",

In the final section of the paper I outline a programme which is intended to show what this social theory might look like when extended to the smaller scale and to the consideration of unique events.

In the general case, D is in most instances sensitive to compositional changes.

The methodology is sufficiently general to be applied to any service delivered by British local government. The allocation of expenditure to different geographical areas of the authority and contributions in the form of taxation from these zones are each identified in order to estimate net fiscal incidence. A brief review of existing studies is presented, which shows that although increasing attention has been given to the geographical distribution of local government spending, there have been few systematic studies examining expenditure and revenue flows. The problems associated with measuring expenditure incidence are discussed and reviewed. It is suggested that ‘participation’ forms a basis for estimating expenditure distribution to the household sector. Revenue is contributed by households in various roles. Here, contributions through income are used as a surrogate. Household incomes can in turn be estimated by category analysis techniques. In addition, contributions through the rating system are assessed. Finally, a systematic statement of the methodology is outlined and its possible contribution to important policy areas suggested. </jats:p>",

Moreover there are distinct geographical and industrial patterns in the observed rigidities. Neoclassical implicit contract theory has been vindicated. Or has it? Obvious empirical difficulties remain, especially with regard to predicting which adjustment variable has precedence. There are conceptual shortcomings as well, evidenced by ad hoc assumptions of cooperative wealth maximization. By integrating the underlying structure of inequality with the processes of production and exchange, principles of an alternative conceptualization of contract theory are sketched and their implications noted for a set of hypothetical local labor markets.

The three processes of suburbanization, growth of social mobility, and an industrial economy increasingly based on domestic consumption, including innovations in household technology, all had the potential to unburden and enrich women's lives. Interrelationships among the three processes, however, worked to the detriment of some middle-class women with limited financial resources. A structurationist perspective is used to examine the interrelationships between social processes that affected women and the responses of individual women to these processes. The role of ideology, which made it acceptable for some middle-class women to do domestic work in 1920, whereas the opposite was true in 1850, is singled out for special attention. </jats:p>",

It is shown that what have often been interpreted as Jacobin tendencies in French government may be no different than the concentration of policy power in many areas of policymaking in all modern welfare states.

Both the general propensity to migrate and the spatial allocation of mobile people over regions of destination are characterized by important dynamic properties. This paper discusses several factors that may explain these dynamic properties of internal labor migration. We focus especially on the influence of labor market and housing conditions on the mobility of people. A two-stage, generation-allocation model is proposed to investigate the role of different factors in the explanation of aggregate interregional migration flows. This model is applied to recent data on interprovincial labor migration in the Netherlands. The results indicate that housing supply seems to be an important determinant of temporal developments of spatial mobility, and that also the conditions on national and regional labor markets are associated with specific properties of recent migration patterns. </jats:p>",

The reforms of 1982 show the first linkage for a century of the local and central political majorities towards a policy of dentralisation. Stimulated by this socialist movement these reforms have aimed to reduce the power of the prefect, to institute general socialist change, to increase the power of local communities, and to decrease central administrative checks and controls. The effect of the reforms has been to strengthen the départements and large cities against the prefect, but for the small communities decentralisation will probably remain a pious hope. The paper discusses these reforms against the background of the historical ‘honeycomb’ structure of French central-local relations. </jats:p>",

The comprehensive proposals published on behalf of the Social Democratic Party in July 1982 are taken as a basis for examining why this reform theme nevertheless persists. The assumptions underlying the call for regional government in Britain are set out and then examined in the context of West German federalism. It is argued that the main assumptions in the British case for regional decentralisation were of relatively little importance in the reshaping of a federal system in West Germany, nor have they had much influence on the subsequent consolidation of such a system. Further light is thrown on the obstacles to decentralisation in Britain by considering some of the centralising tendencies which have actually been reinforced after the structural reform of local government. The conclusion is that proposals for extensive regional decentralisation in Britain fail because they work against the grain of British experience in the structuring of government. </jats:p>",
