      "abstract": "<jats:p> Culture as an organizing concept and framework offers planning a new, deeper and more sustainable foundation. The fact that culture constitutes and is constituted by our geographies, histories and societies, is expanding, and is the world's leading intellectual resource, can be the basis for a new positionality for planning. A positionality of this kind is proposed as a new paradigm, and tagged with the neologism of `culturization'. As a specifically ethical, reflexive and critical approach, it stands in contrast to the broader, socio-economic trend to `culturalization' and its acknowledged commodification. For the purposes ofculturization, an integrated concept of culture and an integrated approach to planning research are described in order to engage all of the forms and dimensions of culture, and to link a plurality of cultural theory and communicative and postmodern planning theory to the enterprise. Further, innovations in theoretical writings and culturized planning practices that have emerged in recent times are cited for their relevance to a more systematic culturization of planning with greater sustainable and transformational potential. </jats:p>",

This is a multiple, relational approach of dynamic complexity to understanding and working with contingencies of place, time and actant behaviours. Inspired by the planar philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, I offer the potential for multiple planes: several — or perhaps one collectively preferred — broad trajectories or `visions' of the longer-term future — (Deleuzean planes of consistency or immanence) — and shorter-term, location-specific detailed plans and projects with collaboratively determined tangible goals — (planes of organization or transcendence). I explore what spatial planning practice could look like if it were to become along Deleuzean lines. I argue the case for performance-based planning rather than performance-measured, target-based master plans, discussing critical problems and issues for theory and practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses research into planning, and specifically how we might best frame the ethical issues which arise in, and through, such research. One of its central contentions is that ethical sensitivity is developed by researchers as part of a social practice, that is, through communal activity of a particular kind. Therefore, important as it is to ensure that researchers are aware of their personal ethical responsibilities, understanding what the moral point of view requires — that is, being sensitive to ethical issues, especially in new circumstances — is something which researchers acquire through involvement in appropriately conducted social practices. The article's suggestion is that the notion of a social practice, as used by MacIntyre (1985) and others is helpful in framing thinking about research ethics in planning because it places the individual's acquisition and development of a moral perception, and judgements, within a social context. The first section discusses this notion. The article also explores whether the notion of a social practice can usefully be employed to distinguish between the ethical issues which arise in scholarly research in planning as opposed to those which arise in policy-related research in planning. </jats:p>",

This article addresses the benefits of recognizing that negotiation is the key vehicle for joint decision making and therefore lies at the heart of planning. It calls for applying negotiation theory and practice lessons to examine and improve the dynamics of collaborative interactions. It proposes that analytical frameworks informed by negotiation theory can improve planning decisions and enhance the odds of their implementation. To illustrate their claims, the authors revisit three key concepts from the negotiation field—interests, mutual gains, and information—and illustrate their use in planning situations with vignettes from planning practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In response to the growing critique of decentralized and participatory approaches to development, the article develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the relationship between community-based planning and poverty. Building on contributions from research on collective action, social capital, and social movements, the framework identifies a series of variables that are theorized to affect a community's capacity to alleviate poverty. Using this framework, three community-level case studies in Oaxaca, Mexico are analyzed. All three communities are characterized by a decline in subsistence agriculture, increasing out-migration, and the use of remittances to finance community-based planning projects. The article documents each community's capacity to alleviate the material manifestations of poverty. It concludes that only the community with the strongest capacity for community-level collective action was capable of planning independent of the state, and thus in a position to take incipient steps toward addressing poverty's structural causes. The findings call into question the often assumed desirability of collaborative planning and support the need for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of distinct forms of community-based planning interpreted within broader socio-political contexts. </jats:p>",

Another difference is that the BTPI was created specifically for use in psychological treatment planning, which sets it apart not only from the MMPI-2 but also from many of the assessment measures that are employed for this purpose. Its three sets of scales assess overall profile validity and degree of cooperation with the assessment process, interpersonal and related factors that affect treatment progress, and current psychological symptoms. It is intended to be used at several possible points during the course of therapy. At the outset of intervention, its data provide a means of assessing the therapy climate and gauging factors that are likely to facilitate and impede psychotherapy progress.</jats:p>",

The task of assessment may precede the initiation of treatment or it may be ongoing throughout therapy. Therapists of different theoretical views approach the task of assessing and evaluating the client from different avenues. Assessment can involve providing a “normative framework” within which the therapist can compare the patient’s problems with others, or it may be more “idiographic,” with the therapist seeking to understand the patient on his or her own terms through interview, observations, and information from others such as a spouse.</jats:p>",

First, psychological test results can be processed rapidly and the information from the MMPI-2 or BTPI can be immediately available to incorporate in therapy planning early in the intervention, even in the initial session. Second, a computer-based test result can provide extensive personality information in a readily usable form without the need for the therapist to search through the empirical research for each patient’s proﬁle. The automated MMPI-2 or BTPI report summarizes the most valid test correlates in a readable format. Finally, the automated personality test report is an informative, interesting format for use in providing test feedback to clients, a process that is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.</jats:p>",

Utilizing a case study approach of three New Jersey communities, this article argues that changes in local growth strategies are brought about by advocates who incorporate fiscal arguments with quality-of-life concerns and capitalize on a perceived development threat to achieve a more favorable political environment. By reframing local debate over formerly contentious issues such as open-space preservation and environmental quality, advocates are able to permanently change the local political culture. However, such action can have exclusionary consequences and act as a hindrance to the implementation of a balanced-growth approach to urban development. </jats:p>",

What changes will be needed in society and in our schools both for the child and for the family? What reforms might this year's newly qualified staff bring about in our schools and services and in society as a whole by the time they retire in the 2040s? Professor Mittler proposes that the time is ripe to take advantage of new international and national opportunities to lay the foundations for a society that fully includes disabled people and safeguards their basic human rights. He argues that each one of us can help to determine the values and priorities of the society in which today's baby will grow up and suggests that the Make Poverty History movement has provided powerful evidence that the voice of ordinary citizens can shape policies and set priorities. He encourages us all to think globally and to act locally on a host of issues, including supporting families, planning for transition, promoting quality of life, professional development and challenging inequality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In October 2005, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was enlisted to produce rebuilding plans for eleven towns along the Mississippi Gulf Coast that had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. The plans they produced are microcosms of New Urbanist social doctrine: an accessible public realm, neighborhoods that are socially diverse, and walkable access to life's daily needs—design principles that are essentially aimed at promoting social equity. This article examines the rhetoric and reality of the social equity goals of the New Urbanist plans for the Mississippi Gulf Coast region. While social equity goals are both implicitly and explicitly stated and visualized throughout the plans, the realization of social equity goals will require more than physical designs. Without the policy, institutional, programmatic, and process requirements that go along with the New Urbanists' physical design proposals, the designs may lose their connection to social equity goals. Given the intensity of development pressure in the region, realization of social equity goals may require an unprecedented level of effort and commitment. </jats:p>",

Analysis of census data in thirteen Canadian metropolitan areas shows that households where one or both maintainers work from home have a greater propensity to reside in larger single-family detached houses than comparable households with maintainers who commute to work. The home-work variable increases the probability of single-family dwelling occupancy more than age, immigration, and household size, demographic variables generally highly associated with single-family dwelling occupancy. Although issues of causality cannot be empirically resolved here, if home work requires more space, it is one of the factors that would influence the tendency to continue to reside in the larger single-family dwellings. These dwellings have greater environmental impacts than more compact housing types that planners promote as part of their sustainability goals. </jats:p>",

This study evaluates ninety-nine villages from two water supply schemes— projects built under a social investment fund program and those built under a nongovernmental program funded by the Swiss government. Overall, the study finds that the projects are performing very well. Multivariate regression analysis suggests that household- and village-level PCS is linked with financial performance, overall household satisfaction, and attitudes toward long-term future performance after controlling for project and community determinants of sustainability. </jats:p>",

Welcome, to prove that the field of libraries and information has not and will not die, but rather is trying closely to follow developments. In this paper, we try to identify the changes occurring in the field of digital libraries from the beginning of the idea until its development now, while mentioning the stages and steps that must be followed to plan digital library projects.</jats:p>"

This involves analysis and discussion of various current approaches at national level and of the development trends of integration-based urban policy in the field of tension between the Lisbon Strategy and territorial cohesion. In addition to historical developments and local strategies, focus is also placed on the analysis and (further) development of models of urban governance with their idealised notion of a local community of responsibility; European reality does, however, to a greater of lesser extent diverge from this ideal.</jats:p>"

Indeed, the most prominent challenge in the early stages of treatment is to develop a comfortable relationship that allows disclosure. In this volume, the authors show that objectively interpreted personality measures can be applied in psychotherapeutic assessments to facilitate an understanding of the patient and a thriving treatment program. Successful psychotherapy depends upon an early understanding of the patient's problems and personality and the establishment of attainable treatment goals. The extensive accumulated base of knowledge about personality and its maladjustment has become crucial when making treatment decisions about individuals in psychotherapy, and the field of personality assessment provides both methods and substantive information to support treatment-oriented evaluation. The MMPI has a long tradition of providing personality information about clients in mental health settings since the 1940s. James Butcher participated in the creation of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) in 1989, which has continued to be one of the most commonly used personality tests in clinical evaluation. Over a thousand studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of the MMPI in treatment related assessments. Here, Butcher and co-author Julia Perry explore the MMPI-2 as well as a new assessment tool, the Butcher Treatment Planning Inventory (BTPI). In using psychological evaluation techniques for treatment planning, many clinicians incorporate information from a broad base of instruments-clinical interview, projective testing, behavioral data, and personal history-and do not rely on data from a single source. Therefore, while this volume focuses on the use of the MMPI-2 and the BTPI in treatment planning, it will provide a context not to the exclusion of other measures.</jats:p>",

Complete search of the combined state-space soon becomes intractable. In this paper we present a novel form of abstraction that allows us to plan much more efficiently. The key to this abstraction is the partitioning of the map into subgraphs of known structure with entry and exit restrictions which we can represent compactly. Planning then becomes a search in the much smaller space of subgraph configurations. Once an abstract plan is found, it can be quickly resolved into a correct (but possibly sub-optimal) concrete plan without the need for further search. We prove that this technique is sound and complete and demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a real map.\n\nA contending solution, prioritised planning, is also evaluated and shown to have similar performance albeit at the cost of completeness. The two approaches are not necessarily conflicting; we demonstrate how they can be combined into a single algorithm which outperforms either approach alone.\n</jats:p>"

In the first case, the assessment efforts centered on the MMPI-2, which significantly informed the consequent treatment plan recommendations. For the next two cases presented, the BTPI was at the heart of this endeavor. For the final case, both instruments were incorporated into the evaluation (including the computer based interpretation of the Minnesota Report and BTPI) and treatment planning processes. Each case illustrates particular therapy challenges that may be faced with clients and highlights some of the issues that arise when objective assessment instruments are incorporated into clients’ treatment plans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When elected in 1997, the British Labour Government made urban policy one of its key policy concerns. Criticism of the shortcomings of previous, predominantly market oriented urban policy, was combined with new approaches to state action. Numerous programmes were developed, new institutions created and urban policy initiatives were launched which are still reflected in both national and municipal urban policy in England. The urban policy of the Blair government has received an overall favourable assessment in recent evaluative reports. Such studies conclude that in the towns and cities social cohesion has grown over the last ten years, they have become more competitive and the quality of life, which in England is commonly defined in relation to the quality of public space, has risen. This article outlines the main features of this urban policy over the last ten years. It takes the example of Manchester’s urban policy, widely regarded as a particularly successful and notable case, to demonstrate policy outcomes.</jats:p>"

As part of its strategic growth plans, in 2007 it was going to start-up in excess of 20 very diverse rig operations over the twelve month period.

The paper analyses the successes and failures of various start ups across the organisation and demonstrates that the more involvement HR, HSEQ &amp; Training had in the early stages the more successful the overall start up was.

The screening and ranking process used to select projects causes an optimizer's curse (OC) effect (Smith and Winkler 2006). A portfolio's true outcome value will tend to fall below the forecast distribution mean. Stated another way, we should expect to be disappointed in the value of the eventual outcomes. This optimizer's curse effect can be huge: the true portfolio value might be half its forecast value when forecast in the usual way.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes a correction process based upon Bayesian inversion obtained with Monte Carlo simulation. Estimate/Actual distributions characterize component evaluation errors. The mean and standard deviation of the E/A distribution measures the quality of judgments and estimates. Examples demonstrate the value of better information in project or asset evaluation, portfolio optimization, and competitive bidding.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The premise of our approach to correct for optimizer's curse is straightforward enough, though implementing this method requires judging the population of evaluated projects—or at least assessing the shape of this population's distribution. We offer a process and guidelines for correcting for the optimizer's curse in both project and portfolio value calculations. Correcting estimates for systematic biases restores luster to the recommended expected value-maximizing decision policy. We also tie back to the winner's curse phenomenon (Capen et al. 1971) experienced in competitive bidding and how it affects bid optimization.</jats:p>",

However, there is also substantial evidence that social problems are growing in many cities. Linking economic competitiveness to increasing social inclusion is a crucial challenge for policy-makers at all levels of government. The article intends to shed light on the way the Dutch central government tries to support cities to develop into sustainable, vital, complete and competitive entities. As response to a powerful plea by the largest cities themselves, an integrated policy (linking spatial, economic, social, environmental and safety policies) explicitly focused on cities, was given shape. Prime issues are covenants between central government and each city, based on tailor-made long-term strategies, including measurable objectives. To get a clear picture of the policy’s effectiveness — after 13 years of experience — appears to be difficult. Reviewers argue that a lot of aspects could be improved. For the current phase most of these comments have been taken into account.</jats:p>"

Urban lighting has both social and economic benefit, that is why in many cases the city is illuminated, but quite spontaneous together with the process of energetic economics evolution. The artistic value of urban night lighting is still not discovered in Lithuania. The aesthetics of illuminated streets, pedestrian areas, squares, plants, monuments and exclusive architectural objects, which form urban night scenery, is still not valued and, fortunately, it has substantial future vista. Santrauka Analizuojamas naktinis miestovaizdis, kurio reikšmė formuojant vizualinį miesto identitetą iki šiol Lietuvoje nebuvo tyrinėta. Apšviesti miestą socialine ir ekonomine prasme yra rentabilu, todėl apskritai miestas yra pakankamai apšviestas, tačiau tai vyksta spontaniškai energetinio ūkio evoliuciniame procese. Naktinio miestovaizdžio meninis reikšmingumas Lietuvoje vis dar neatskleistas. Apšviestų gatvių, pėsčiųjų zonų, aikščių, skverų, želdinių, monumentų ir išskirtinių architektūros objektų, sudarančių naktinį miestovaizdį, estetika nėra įvertinta, nors jos galimybės yra labai didelės.</jats:p>",

The methodology extracts only the most relevant information from the historical database, utilizes a rule-based system to make adaptations, and then suggests the most appropriate solution for a given well intervention. This technique was used for production operations as a front end tool for well workover planning and design and was applied to sample data from a large oil field where the main artificial lift system is rod pump. This simple case demonstrates how case-based reasoning can be applied to improve the planning and execution of well interventions, thus reducing cost, rig time, and well turnaround time, while maximizing reliability and production.</jats:p>",

Also, these wells are considered HP/HT when they have bottomhole pressures of approximately 10,000 psi and bottomhole temperatures in excess of 300°F. Several wells under these extreme environmental conditions have recently been tested in Brazil, and these attempts have confirmed the importance of the proper preliminary analysis of test parameters according to the specifications of the prospect, the requirements at surface, and the possible impact of testing at bottomhole conditions. Typical variables such as high hydrostatic pressures and high temperatures are usually considered, but it is also important to assess the types of operations involved in performing the tests that could increase the value of the different physical variables in such a way that the tool string could be damaged. Often, combined variables can surpass the design characteristics of the test tools, and if this occurs, the test data or even the well could be lost. Thus, it is critical that design specifications of the necessary equipment and operational limitations be considered with a detailed analysis of operations and alternatives in a HAZID/HAZOP.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will focus on the steps that must be followed to enable successful well-testing evaluations in HP/HT environmental conditions. With the planning suggested, it is possible to minimize the risks that can negatively impact testing operations. The planning, design criteria and tools required to perform successful well-testing evaluation in severe well conditions will be discussed in detail. The steps discussed here for designing deepwater well-tests can provide a safety envelope for equipment and help ensure that the operations will be successfully performed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The degree of localization of manufacturing, defined as the excess geographic concentration remaining after correcting for both sectoral concentration and the agglomeration of overall economic activity, has recently gained new techniques of measurement in the form of indexes and numerical methods. These techniques are illustrated, compared, and theoretically discussed to show that they are consistent advancements, but none is yet able to satisfy all desirable properties. The measurement of localization would be more interesting if it could be related to economic processes and not limited to simple observational aspects. In achieving this, there are a number of complications, which are reviewed in the paper. Among these, the choice of the right sectoral scale at which these measures have to be applied is normally given too little importance. The second part of this paper advocates that this is a complex issue, since no digit level is appropriate for all industries. Moreover, different aggregations of narrowly defined subsectors may be more suitable than the standard industrial classifications. This is supported by an exploratory analysis, in two British sectors, based on the investigation of possible localization reasons identified in recent taxonomies. As the many localization measurement techniques have become available, it is recommended that they be applied to sector studies, and not confined to countrywide extensive explorations of all sectors. </jats:p>",

Second, a viewpoint detailing the therapist’s duty to provide psychological test feedback to potential or ongoing therapy clients is covered. Next, a description and illustration of a method for conducting test feedback sessions using the MMPI-2 or BTPI with clients will be described. And, finally, some of the pitfalls and limitations in the feedback process of which the therapist-diagnostician needs to be aware will be detailed.</jats:p>",

However, the role of servicescape in non‐traditional service settings has received comparatively little attention. The aim of this paper is to fill in some of this research gap by testing the effects of servicescape (ambience, layout and functionality) on consumer behaviour within UK betting shops, as part of the wider UK gambling industry.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>In order to achieve this objective an exploratory research methodology was chosen. Firstly, three betting shops in the same metropolitan area were chosen as the base for interviews with managers and structured observations. This was complemented by fifty semi‐structured customer interviews from the same three betting shops. The use of these different methods allowed triangulation and validation of the results.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The key finding of this paper are that customers in betting shops appear to be unaffected by some of the elements of the servicescape.

These empirically derived behaviors provide a solid basis for clinical description and prediction of behavior from the individual’s self-report. The major strengths of this approach lie in the extensive external validation of the MMPI scales and profile codes; they provide valid and reliable test correlates that can confidently be applied to a broad range of treatment cases. One disadvantage to the MMPI empirical scale approach is that the heterogeneous item content of the scales makes face valid or intuitive interpretative statements difficult at times. In other words, items that empirically separate groups or prove themselves to be valid predictors may not “hang together” or be intuitively related to what the patient tells the therapist. The empirical correlates of the clinical scales, with rather heterogeneous content, may not be as intuitively understandable as are interpretations that are based on content-homogeneous scales.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This document is limited to rehabilitation of oustees of projects in rural areas. The idea, initially, was to prepare a draft enactment of Development Planning, Minimum Displacement and Just Rehabilitation. However, considering the efforts made by the relevant groups and movements as well as the National Rehabilitation Policies of the government in 2003 and 2006, it was decided to call this document National Policy only. It can be converted into a draft enactment with ease, as and when required. This document is based on the structure of the 2006 NRP because the government itself has accepted the need to have a proper R&amp;R. There are substantial changes, incorporations made in the 2006 NRP by taking into consideration the comments of NAC, NBA and other organizations/NGOs/Movements. This document may require yet another effort to make it precise and to tie all the loose ends, wherever they occur. </jats:p><jats:p> In the Preamble itself, the essential principles of rehabilitation have been mentioned. Several changes have been made in the definitions; certain new definitions like that of'Development planning’ and ‘prior informed consent’ have been added. Acquisition of the land and private purchase of land have been put at par when they result in physical displacement of 100 or more families en masse in plain areas, or 25 or more families en masse in tribal or hilly areas, DDP blocks and areas mentioned in Schedule V and Schedule VI of the Constitution of India. The Requiring Body may be State, Corporation or a private company. The burden of rehabilitation remains equal on all of them. In the SIA and EIA, many changes have been made. The finalization of SIA and EIA reports will be after hearing is granted to the affected persons. Gram sabhas/NGOS/mass movements have been included in the multi-disciplinary expert group. The final clearance to the project is given by the National Rehabilitation Commission. The role of the Administrator and the Commissioner in R&amp;R has been clarified. The preparation of R&amp;R has been ensured in consultations with gram sabhas and affected persons and families. After declaration of the affected zones, there is a provision for survey by the expert teams. The gram sabhas and the affected people have been given the right to raise objections on the findings of the survey. There is also a provision for appeal before the Commissioner against the decision of the Administrator. The Draft R&amp;R scheme has to be endorsed by gram sabhas. The land-based rehabilitation is one of the important components. Affected persons, who have not been granted rehabilitation benefits, have been given various opportunities to stake their claims, upto the National Rehabilitation Commission. There is a time limit fixed for the concerned authorities to take a decision. The land for rehabilitation should be available simultaneously with the availability of land for the project. Benefits of R&amp;R have been enumerated in Chapter VIII. Chapter IX contains the dispute redressai mechanism and Chapter X, the Monitoring Mechanism by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Commission. </jats:p>",

In their original work, they used a method of scale construction referred to as the empirical scale development, or criterion-referenced strategy, to develop the MMPI clinical scales (see Butcher, 2000b). The items making up the clinical scales were selected with assurance that each item on a given scale actually predicted the criterion or membership in a clinical group. For example, in the development of Scale 2, the Depression scale, responses of patients who were clinically depressed were contrasted with those of a group of “normal” individuals. The items that empirically differentiated the groups became the Depression scale; and the individuals who had received high scores on this scale displayed symptoms found in the reference group of depressed patients. The test authors provided a set of appropriate norms for the basic MMPI scales to enable test users to compare a particular patient’s scores with responses of a large group of “normal” individuals.</jats:p>",

These data were used to design a quantitative crosssectional survey that was administered to all Tasmanian general practitioners to assess their willingness to participate in emergency management and to measure their skills base and training needs.Results: The response rate to the survey was 100 percent. The survey found that 42 percent of respondents were willing to volunteer their services in an emergency. Of those, 46 percent had emergency management training and/or skills and/or experience. Focus group participants felt that general practice resources, including nondoctor staff, practice infrastructure, and equipment, could make a valuable contribution to emergency management.Conclusions: General practitioners are willing to participate in management of emergencies.A significant number have emergency management training and experience. However, appropriate systems and supports are required to facilitate their involvement.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we interrogate the ways in which supermarkets ‘place’ responsibility for children's ‘healthy’ eating with parents and/or children, as set within the contemporary British public health concern with the prevalence of childhood obesity. We use British food retailers' corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a way of identifying specific relations of responsibility between supermarkets, parents, and children. We do this through focusing upon a critical interrogation of two supermarkets' children's ‘healthy’ eating initiatives; a supermarket own-brand range of children's ‘healthy’ food products; and a supermarket in-store ‘healthy’ food tour. The emergent geographies of embodied responsibility illustrate a deferral of responsibility from supermarkets to parents. This is problematic because it conversely excludes the possibilities for the child to be a consumer on the grounds that they are irresponsible and incapable of engaging with ‘healthy’ food. We suggest that this implied model of responsibility, which conceptualises responsibility as contained within the individual, is unhelpful because of its exclusivity and suggest that a collective notion of responsibility is necessary to understand fully the relations of responsibility that exist between bodies. This opens up possibilities for a more nuanced account of the ‘child’ consumer and the relationships that children have with ‘healthy’ food. </jats:p>",

The primary goals of the study were to evaluate mathematics achievement levels in several countries and to attempt to understand and explain the reasons for the differences (Stevenson 1998). The TIMSS case studies were compiled in Germany, Japan, and the United States and included videos of class sessions that were analyzed by an international team of researchers (TIMSS Video Mathematics Research Group 2003). The summaries of the research have been a basis for suggestions and changes in American classrooms. Specifically, the study clearly showed differences in the ways that teachers in Japan and in the United States conduct their classes that, in turn, may affect the academic achievement of their students. Several of the key findings will be discussed in this article. Then, based on the research, questions will be presented and recommendations for teachers will be suggested concerning how U.S. mathematics teachers might rethink their methods of planning and teaching.</jats:p>",

However, it is not possible or practical to test drinking water for all potentially harmful characteristics. If drinking water is contaminated, people may already be exposed by the time test results are available. The ‘boil water alert’ issued in Sydney, Australia in 1998 following the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in the finished water supply, highlighted the uncertainties associated with the public health response to test results. The Sydney experience supports the international consensus that a preventive risk-management approach to the supply of drinking water (manifesting as water safety plans (WSPs)) is the most reliable way to protect public health. A key component of a comprehensive WSP is that water suppliers and health authorities must have plans to respond in the case of water contamination and/or outbreaks. These plans must include clear guidance on when to issue warnings to consumers, and how these warnings are to be communicated. The pressure on health authorities to develop clear and systematic boil-water guidance will increase as utilities all over the world develop their WSPs.</jats:p>",

This one has kinematics architecture and dimensions identical to the mechanical hand. This feature allows us to obtain manipulation trajectories for the mechanical hand, very easily and very quickly, by using the exoskeleton, without complex calibration. Manipulation's trajectories are replayed offline with an autonomous control, and, consequently, the exoskeleton is not used with any feedback strategy for telemanipulation. This paper presents the characteristics of this exoskeleton and the graphic interface that we developed. This one uses a method to determine the object's evolution during the manipulation with the exoskeleton, without using exteroceptive sensors. This new approach was tested for standard trajectories by simulation on a Computer-aided design (CAD) robotics system and by using the mechanical hand. Thus, we validate the use concept of an isomorphic exoskeleton to mechanical hand for manipulation planning with the LMS mechanical hand.</jats:p>",

Settlement houses were founded from the 1880s as centres of neighbourhood welfare and social work, and housed resident workers in the poorest parts of cities. Founded in 1897, Christodora House occupied a purpose-built ‘skyscraper’ on Tompkins Square from 1928 to 1948. This building not only provided new and modern accommodation for settlement work, but also incorporated new forms of housing. The author considers the ways in which the building itself—both as ‘house’ and as ‘skyscraper’—was not only shaped by, but also recast, embodied practices of settlement, inhabitation, and domestic life. As a skyscraper built for settlement work, Christodora House represented a new, but ultimately unsuccessful, form of dwelling in the city. </jats:p>",

This article illustrates how researchers can address this challenge by recourse to well-established bodies of basic theory and research in the wider social and organizational sciences that suggest robust design options. Adopting this approach, we draw upon the insights of social identity theory, self/social categorization theory and the Five Factor Model of human personality from the field of personality and social psychology to distil a series of propositions to inform the design of scenario planning interventions, centred on team composition and the facilitation process. In so doing, our article exemplifies the benefits of adopting a pragmatic science approach to the design of processes that promote organizational change and development, thus adding to the growing design science movement. </jats:p>",

In contrast to the Lisbon process, which shifted the focus unmistakably to “strengthening competitiveness”, the Leipzig Charter — hatched during Germany’s presidency of the EU — stresses the need to promote socially integrative urban development. Notwithstanding this conflict, the author argues that the real key to understanding European urban policy is “governance”, i.e. changes in forms of municipal steering and control.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The modernist conception of the autonomous ‘subject’ as centred, sovereign, and coherently rational, acting intentionally, knowledgeably, and volitionally, has been challenged from a variety of sources, including poststructuralism, feminism, and posthumanism. A different kind of attack on the modernist subject has recently been staged by neurobiologists who have started to decentre the subject from within—to ‘naturalise’ (and materialise) the subject. This biological naturalism—the new ‘life sciences’—claims to challenge our conceptions of self, the ethical subject, and what we conceive of as ‘life’. But what conceptions we have of the configurations of the self is fundamental to our understandings and conceptions of ethics. This paper traces a debate between German neurobiologists and (post)humanist philosophers on the ontology of such things as ‘free will’, ‘ethical agency’, and the ‘self’ as an example of how the dispute between naturalists and nonnaturalist or postnaturalists is instrumental in sharpening our understanding of the self and of ethical agency. The paper argues that naturalism is bound to fail due to its inability to grasp the intersubjectivist nature of ethical agency, a theme which links up with recent geographical writing on ethics. I suggest, building on a recent contribution of Huib Ernste in this journal, that we should consider Helmuth Plessner's concept of eccentric positionality and ontology of the possible as a postmetaphysical kind of ethical humanism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the ways in which Zimbabwean professionals have reconfigured family life in a transnational context. It argues that issues surrounding family and children have received too little attention in the literature on contemporary African diasporas, despite the central importance of family concerns not only in decisions about mobility, work, and remittances, but also in debates about moral value. The paper focuses on children, both as objects of responsibility around which support networks of different sorts are organized, and as moral markers in diasporic debates about identity and belonging. It examines the ways in which family networks have influenced nurses' and teachers' negotiation of work, before investigating issues at stake in decisions to bring children to the UK and the ways that both of these have shaped ongoing transnational connections and embeddedness in the UK context. Despite the appeal of educational opportunities for children in Britain, problems in securing dependents' entry and the cost and difficulty of supporting and caring for children in Britain can lead parents to keep them in Zimbabwe. In addition, encounters with norms of behaviour in schools, childrights legislation, controls on parental discipline and teenage youth culture (black and white) are unappealing and can encourage a sense of difference among Zimbabwean parents. This is often expressed in terms of African' values of respect for parents, authority and extended family, perhaps more than in terms of racial, national, regional or ethnic identities. The paper places such moral debates provoked by everyday interactions in Britain in the context of the very real strains on family relationships created by the crisis in Zimbabwe, the multiple dimensions of exclusion of migrants in the UK, and further problems created by the feminization of employment, different gender norms, and a high rate of divorce. </jats:p>",

Previous research has mostly studied the impact of partnership and employment changes on spatial mobility. The author focuses on the effect of child-bearing on migrations and residential moves. The study is based on retrospective event-history data from Austria, to which intensity (or hazard) regression is applied. The analysis suggests, first, that the birth of a child triggers housing-related and environment-related residential relocations. These are mostly moves within a labour-market area, but there are also migrations from cities to rural areas. Second, growing family size significantly reduces couples' wishes to and chances of moving over long distances for a job. The event of first conception also induces moves related to partnership formation. </jats:p>",

This article examines the relationship between procurement planning and accountability of local government procurement systems in Uganda. The findings arose from a study that was conducted among 99 local government stakeholders selected from 11 Districts of Uganda, using a correlation research design. The data was analyzed using principal component factor analysis that aimed at identifying the critical components of procurement planning and accountable local governments systems in Uganda. Consequently, correlation analysis to establish the direction and magnitude to which the two variables were related was conducted and results are presented. The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between procurement planning and accountable local government procurement systems in Uganda. These results are compared to international research findings, and suggestions are offered for management, policy making, future research and efficient accountable local government operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The deindustrialization of North American cities is generally told as a post-World War II narrative, featuring factory closings, highways to the suburbs, and urban renewal programs responding to the loss of jobs and population. Yet, as recent scholarship on industrial suburbanization has shown, the decentralization of manufacturing manifested itself throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some scholars of twentieth-century planning have observed that urban renewal programs hurt cities as much as they helped. This essay argues that some late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century redevelopment programs played a greater causal role in deindustrialization and the shift in Americans' conceptions of cities from places of production to places of consumption. Surveying the complex relationships between urban and industrial restructuring in Philadelphia during the pre-Depression decades, it examines the prehistory of federal urban renewal at the state and local level. </jats:p>",

This paper summarizes a study carried out for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change that takes a broader look at the potential role of a climate-friendly built environment including not only considerations of how buildings are constructed and used, but also how they interface with the electric grid and where they are located in terms of urban densities and access to employment and services. In addition to summarizing mechanisms of change (barriers and drivers) the paper reviews a set of policies that could bring carbon emissions in the building sector in 2025 almost back to 2004 levels. By the middle of the century the combination of green buildings and smart growth could deliver the deeper reductions that many believe are needed to mitigate climate change. </jats:p>",

In this context, the understanding of how to apply SEA effectively in different planning systems is unlikely to improve if the knowledge about those systems is limited. This paper establishes what appears to make SEA effective in two countries with different planning systems: Italy and the UK. Italy is chosen as an example, representing a specific Southern-European planning culture, which to date has not contributed to the SEA literature to any great extent. Based on empirical observations, it is suggested that the SEA effectiveness elements portrayed in the international literature are not fully valid. The UK is chosen as an example, which represents a specific Northern-European planning culture. Countries representing this planning culture have contributed heavily to the international SEA literature and have influenced the development of SEA theory strongly. In this context, the SEA effectiveness elements and benefits portrayed in the international literature appear to be valid.</jats:p><jats:p>As part of a PhD research project, this paper builds on the findings of a content analysis of the international SEA literature (Fischer and Gazzola, 2006).</jats:p>",

It draws from two studies of UK homebuyers, whose lives are entangled in the materiality of housing, the meaning of home, and the mobilisation of money. This mélange is facilitated by a new generation of financial services that render housing wealth interchangeable with the cash economy, turning owned homes into a hybrid of money and materials. In total 150 qualitative narratives are interrogated to document three key trends. First, a shift of households' disposition, from opting for ownership by chance to banking on housing by design. Second, a change of financial orientation as property-holding citizens illapse into asset-accumulating investors. Third, an ethically charged encounter between the governance of housing and the micropolitics of home, which is prompted by the growing tangibility of housing wealth as it inspires new styles of, and imperatives for, consumption. </jats:p>",

In these contexts, the European and modernist meanings of ‘open plan’ are joined by relations between parents and children and identities associated with motherhood and homemaking. Using a feminist and material-culture analysis of the practices of living open plan in this distinctive historical and geographical context, this paper offers a different interpretation of the social significance of the open-planned domestic interior. Drawing on research conducted with residents of new, open-planned houses on the outskirts of Sydney and, in particular, mothers' narratives of the materialities of their home and the place of children and open plan within it, I show how open plan is held together, as a material and imaginative space, by a balancing of aesthetic considerations and the materiality and anxieties produced by children. The processes of living open plan entailed accommodating family ideals and practices to suit the house and/or altering the house to suit the family: banishing children from open-plan areas to maintain their simplicity; embracing children's presence; placing furniture to enclose it; knocking out walls to open it. </jats:p>",

Any attempt of Agricultural Production Planning aimed at characterizing production models requires a method of analysing data and obtaining technicaleconomic results from farms in the different areas. Models based on average statistical data are limited because they represent farms that do not exist in reality. This study develops a methodology to characterize and group dairy farms into different types according to the following basic variables: land use, size classes and production systems. The information used in this study was microdata from the 1999 Census of Agriculture. The methodology developed was also applied to microdata from the 1989 Census of Agriculture, thus obtaining significant information about the evolution of agricultural activity. The tools used in the analysis were Microsoft Access and Excel, and an application that was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic. The methodology presented can be used to analyse the evolution of the sector or to model future trends.</jats:p>"

My argument is that the failure of Liang's vision for Beijing was mainly due to the nostalgic nature of his proposal and its close affiliation with the imperial model, which did not meet the expectation of the revolutionary spirit of the time. Politics did play a central role in the urban transformation of Beijing in the People's Republic of China.

This article describes how one community–university collaboration used GIS for perinatal planning. Objective: The objective was to determine whether utilizing GIS could help a community to identify risk and develop potential interventions to address perinatal health problems. Methods: We tested the use of GIS over a 9-month period, using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. Diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory guided this work. Results: This collaboration resulted in the development of a perinatal GIS model that helped community members to decide where to focus interventions and in continued use of GIS for planning. Conclusion: Close collaboration early in the planning process, coupled with the incorporation of DOI theory, is necessary for communities to use GIS to plan perinatal interventions</jats:p>",

Conclusions and implications are developed to highlight the paradoxical status of planning and time in todayʼs public environment, and to suggest that, for public administrators, serving the public interest, near-term and long-term, is the heart of assuring that time becomes a central strategic and moral concern for public administration today.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A concept of sustainable development is a critical key for regional planning. The article deals with the methodology of sustainable land use system adopted in the documents of regional space planning in Lithuania. The structure of the concept includes determination of problem areas, formation of integrated spatial framework with localised functional priorities and regional regimes and organisation of spatial regional policy. The main spatial axes ‐ urban and nature frames, as well as recreation or conservation belts are the integrated components of sustainable spatial structure of a region. Regional policy making could be organised by constructive, conservative and temperate scenarios, what is the prerogative of regional officials. Santrauka Rengiant šiuolaikinius regioninius teritorijų planus tvaraus vystymo koncepcija pamažu įgauna esminės metodologinės nuostatos vaidmenį. Pagrindinę problemą sudaro visuotinai pripažintų, tačiau gana prieštaringų tvaraus (tausojančio ir subalansuoto) vystymo tikslų realizavimas erdviniuose regionų planuose. Ypač tvaraus vystymo idėjai taikyti trukdo nacionaliniu ir regioniniu lygmenimis išlikęs tradicinio šakinio (sektorinio), o ne integruoto sisteminio mąstymo vyravimas bei daugelio šalių teritorijų planavimui didelę reikšmę daranti strateginio (vadybinio) planavimo metodologija. Lietuvoje, remiantis naujausiu teritorijų planavimo reglamentavimu, stengiamasi įveikti minėtus trūkumus ir sukurti savitą regionų planavimo sistemą, turinčią panašumų į egzistuojančią Suomijoje. Pagrindinės planavimo nuostatos išreiškiamos regionų vystymo koncepcijoje, kurios metodologija apima probleminių arealų išaiškinimą, bendrosios funkcinės erdvinės struktūros nustatymą, funkcinių prioritetų, regioninių teritorijos tvarkymo reglamentų parengimą bei erdvinės regioninės politikos organizavimą. Kuriamos erdvinės struktūros tvarumą teritorijų harmoningos plėtros kontekste užtikrina tinkamas svarbiausių erdvinių ašių – urbanistinio ir gamtinio karkaso – santykių nustatymas, taip pat regionų bioprodukcinio, rekreacinio bei konservacinio vystymo strategijų subalansuotas lokalizavimas. Regioninė teritorijų planavimo politika formuojama pagal tris strateginius scenarijus: konstruktyvųjį, konservatyvųjį ir nuosaikųjį, kurių elementų pasirinkimas yra regionų valdžios prioritetas.</jats:p>",

Through a series of regular articles appearing in the HDB publication Our Home (1972–1989), readers were presented with stories that showed how selected HDB residents decorated their newly acquired highrise flats. The authors detail the relationship between this design advice and the commitment to modernist design principles, the self-conscious pragmatism of the HDB, and the reliance on a limited market logic (‘homeownership’). The HDB's vision of the benefit of its highrise housing programme was, from the outset, complexly entangled with cultivating individual investments in the home by way of interior design and decoration practices. The paper contributes not only to the specific story of Singaporean housing, but also to wider scholarship on modernism, the everyday practices of interior design, and housing consumption.</jats:p>",

The primary objective is to ensure the reliable supply to the demand as economically as possible. In this paper, a new bi‐level linear programming model for transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) with security constraints has been proposed. The modeling improves traditional building style by adding reliability planning into economy planning as constraints, letting optimal planning strategy be more economic and highly reliable. A hybrid algorithm which integrates improved niching genetic algorithm and prime‐dual interior point method is newly proposed to solve the TNEP based on bi‐level programming. The advantages of the new methodology include (1) the highest reliability planning scheme can be acquired as economically as possible; (2) new model avoids the contradictions of conflicting objectives in TNEP, and explores new ideas for TNEP modeling; (3) the proposed hybrid algorithm is able to solve bi‐level programming and fully manifests the merits of two algorithms as well. Simulation results obtained from two well‐known systems and comparison analysis reveal that the proposed methodology is valid. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Software release planning takes place on strategic and operational levels. Strategic release planning aims at assigning features to subsequent releases such that technical, resource, risk and budget constraints are met. Operational release planning focuses on the development of a single software release. Its purpose is to assign resources to feature development tasks such that total release duration is minimized under given process and project constraints. Replanning becomes necessary on the operational level because of addition or deletion of features during release development, due to changes in the workforce, or due to changes in process and project constraints. The allocation of resources to feature development tasks depends on the accurate estimation of planning parameters like task size, developer productivity or dependencies between task types. Risk analysis can help assess the reliability of a chosen release plan due to variation in these dependencies. In this article, we present elements of a simulation‐based methodology to planning, replanning and risk analysis of software releases on an operational level. Even though there exist approaches addressing these three aspects individually, our proposed approach combines all of them into one single package and, hence, offers stronger support to decision makers. The core element of the methodology is the process simulation model REPSIM‐2 (Release Plan Simulator, Version 2). We describe the functionality of REPSIM‐2 and illustrate its usefulness for planning, replanning and risk analysis through application scenarios.

OsiriX® software can assign levels of transparency and color to select tonal values and stack each slice relative to its position during the initial scan to create “3D Reconstructions” that can be manipulated and exported as image files. These 3D Reconstructions improve the understanding of anatomic relationships as they exist in the living body. They may be used to supplement anatomy instruction, provide an adjunct to traditional dissection, and improve surgical planning.</jats:p><jats:p>Traditional dissection often requires the removal, displacement or distortion of superficial anatomy in order to access deeper structures. The non‐destructive and reversible nature of virtual dissections allows a trained user to remove or isolate structures selectively, permitting the visualization of a particular region or tissue. Measurements of distance and volume are also possible. Diagnostic images of both living patients and cadavers destined for dissection can be reconstructed and used to correlate diagnostic images to the actual anatomy of a patient or cadaver.</jats:p><jats:p>Cost and practical concerns of setting up a 3D workstation, usability of the OsiriX® software, as well as patient confidentiality issues will be discussed.

A multi-objective optimisation problem has been formulated for an efficient numerical solution procedure through kinematic and dynamic features of manipulator operation. Computational economy has been obtained by properly using a genetic algorithm to search an optimal solution for path spline-functions. Numerical characteristics of the numerical solving procedure have been outlined through a numerical example applied to Cassino Parallel Manipulator (CaPaMan) both for path planning and design purposes.</jats:p>",

In a systematic review and analysis of all segregation measures proposed to that date, they identified five conceptually distinct dimensions of ethnic segregation—evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering—and ‘best indices’ to measure them. This index-based approach has achieved a ‘canonical’ status and has been employed in numerous studies of segregation patterns. However, it is often overlooked that the structure of ethnic residential segregation uncovered by Massey and Denton is specific to the context in which segregation takes place—that is, the residential segregation of ethnic and racialized groups in US cities. This paper attempts to assess the utility of Massey and Denton's five-dimensional structure of segregation for the study of settlement patterns of Aboriginal people in Canadian metropolitan areas. We find that the application of the Massey and Denton model to the urban Aboriginal population in Canadian cities produces a significantly different structure of segregation. </jats:p>",

Using data from the information technology services industry, we examine whether inertia develops during the relationship between firms in how they plan for contingencies. While attributes of the current exchange do play a role, we find that the prior relationship between the firms has a constricting effect on future contracts. Prior relationships can create what we call interorganizational inertia, which leads firms to use the same level of contingency planning in current exchanges that they used in prior contracts.

Plants of cultivar Caserta were grown in a plastic greenhouse, using spaces of 0.80 x 1.00 among plants and lines, respectively. The following harvest frequencies were studied: fruits harvested daily, (1) at 10:00, (2) at 10:00 and 18:00, (3) at 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00 and 18:00 h and; (4) fruits harvested every other day, at 18:00 h. Twenty-seven harvests were carried out, collecting fruits larger than 0.15 m. Plots were planned with 1, 2, 3, and 6 plants per row. Heterogeneity index was estimated according to Smith's method and, the optimum plot size, according to modified maximum curvature method. Fruit yield per plant gradually increased reaching a maximum at the 15th harvest. Total yield was of 3214, 3124, 3928 and 3248 g plant¹, respectively, at the harvest frequencies 1, 2, 3 and 4, with no significant differences among them. The heterogeneity index in the plastic greenhouse was nearly zero. The use of smaller plots combined with a larger number of replications increased the experimental accuracy. Although optimum plot size to assess total fruit yield varied between one and seven plants, depending on the harvest frequency, plots with three plants per row plots, with six replications, were the most appropriate design, allowing detecting a least significant difference among treatments equal to 76% of the mean.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The ethical dimensions of geography attract attention of academic and applied geographers more and more. Still, in contrast with the planners, applied geographers mostly only deal with ethics in vague terms and ways, not suitable for the evaluative practices of geography applied in spatial planning. In this paper, some principles or criteria explicitly used in planning or implicitly in applied geography are formulated. One can distinguish the normative <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic> evaluation from the <jats:italic>ex post</jats:italic> evaluation of a decision. Both have their own set of criteria, but in practice the <jats:italic>ex post</jats:italic> principles will be used in the <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic> evaluation too and vice versa. The ‘Nota Ruimte’ is the major Dutch planning document, in force since 2006. The <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ex post</jats:italic> evaluations are applied to the parliamentary discussions when deciding to accept the Nota. The final ethical evaluation of the Nota has to be postponed until its elaboration at lower governmental levels has become clear.</jats:p>",

The article focuses on how action research principles can inform and enhance traditional approaches to citizen participation. In particular, we discuss our role as university-based consultants in the local planning process and how drawing from action research principles helped us remain focused on advocating for broad-based citizen participation. Our analysis was based on the application of action research principles and participant observation techniques. During the time that each of us was involved in the planning process for Depew's neighborhood revitalization, reflexive field notes and other data were collected. The article critiques how citizen participation was used to plan for neighborhood revitalization in Depew, and discusses the degree to which action research principles can be applied to future citizen participation efforts. </jats:p>",

This paper (1) describes the current practices within Australian drug treatment services that aim to include consumers in service planning and provision; and (2) determines how much consumers know about the existing opportunities for involvement. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Design and Method</jats:bold>.</jats:italic> Sixty‐four randomly selected service providers (representing 64 separate services) completed interviews about the current arrangements for consumer participation within their services (response rate = 82%). A total of 179 consumers completed interviews assessing their knowledge of the consumer participation activities available at the service they attended. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. Consumer participation activities were not uncommon in drug treatment services, although the existing activities were concerned largely with providing information to or receiving information from consumers. Activities that included consumers in higher forms of involvement, such as those in which consumers took part in decision‐making, were largely uncommon. Consumers had a considerable lack of knowledge about the participation activities available to them, revealing a lack of communication between providers and consumers. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>.</jats:italic> While service providers were making efforts to engage consumers in service planning and provision (despite the general lack of State or Commonwealth policy directives and extra funding to do so), these appear ineffectual because of poor communication between providers and consumers. As a starting point, a critical part of any meaningful consumer participation initiative must include systems to ensure that consumers know about available opportunities.</jats:p>",

Despite recent attempts to make theory use more salient, there remains a dearth of practical frameworks for the development and evaluation of theory-based programs. Without literature documenting how theories have been specifically applied to interventions and their evaluation, health educators may not be well prepared to utilize theory for the design, implementation, or as a focus of the evaluation. Using a case study example of a diabetes prevention program, this article describes how theory was used for the program design and the evaluation and provides a framework for using theory in other programs.

An anthropomorphic model, at least for counting rate characteristics, was used to study this dependence in conditions resembling the ones that can be encountered in the clinical studies. An annular ring of water bags of 3 cm thickness was fitted over an International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) phantom in order to obtain counting rates similar to those found in average patients. The scatter fraction of the modified IEC phantom was similar to the mean scatter fraction measured on patients, with a similar scanner.

Rather less work has sought to explore trust in terms of professional interstakeholder relations in this context. Drawing on a case study for northern England, we consider dimensions of trust amongst those with a ‘professional’ involvement in the arena of environmental hazards and public health. We explore specifically the interrelated themes of scientific uncertainty and expertise, which were central to the shaping of trust relations. Against a background of indeterminacy in the scientific search for causality in environment–health relationships, the empirical work on which the paper is based is also set in a context of change and insecurity in organisational terms. The notion of ‘independence’ was brought into question through aspects of role demarcation while concerns about levels of expertise were superimposed with a sense of exclusion of community groups from ‘official’ environment–health debates. We argue that a simple deficit approach was being adopted on the part of salaried professionals towards community involvement in such debates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Urban planning is a useful method for improving local climate and human health in cities through purposefully modifying urban land surface characteristics. This can reduce the potential risks of elevated city temperatures due to the urban heat island (UHI). Unfortunately, simple tools are not readily available for urban planners to assess the climatological impacts of various urban development scenarios. Urban modelling could be developed into such a tool to achieve this. This study attempts to design and evaluate a suitable tool for application in Melbourne, Australia. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) was chosen to assess the impact of a long‐term urban planning strategy on local climate and the above canopy UHI in Melbourne. Improvements were made to TAPM by increasing the number of urban land‐use classes in the model and creating a higher resolution land cover database focused on housing density. This modified version of TAPM showed a good performance in replicating the surface energy balance compared with an observational flux tower site in suburban Melbourne during summer. TAPM simulated a mean maximum UHI intensity of 3–4 °C at 2 a.m. in January. A future UHI scenario was then examined (year 2030) using an urban land cover database derived from plans in the <jats:italic>Melbourne 2030</jats:italic> urban planning strategy. Results highlighted specific areas where planning intervention would be particularly useful to improve local climates, namely activity centres and growth areas. The appropriateness of the use of TAPM and climate models as a tool in urban planning is also discussed. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society</jats:p>",

Modern speakers only plan utterances in clause-sized units, and it is improbable that protolanguage speakers had more complex abilities. Moreover, the production and comprehension of idioms sheds no light on a putative ‘holistic’ mode of language processing, since idioms are not processed in this way.

Using retrospectively reviewed records and a deformable model algorithm in a research version of a commercial radiation treatment planning system, we calculated 4D dose distributions based on treatment plans for 10 patients with thoracic tumors. Various combinations of organs (total lungs, heart, spinal cord, external body surface) were used to generate the basis set used in the calculations for deformations. The external surface contour did not have a noticeable effect on the dose calculation. Total lung, heart, and spinal cord together provided an adequate set of deformation organs to generate accurate dose deformations. The magnitude of the calculated dose differences had no obvious relationship to tumor parameters, including site, histologic type, disease stage, extent of motion, or degree of centralization.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.55.D‐, 87.55.dk, 87.55.kh</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A commercial Monte Carlo simulation package, NXEGS 1.12 (NumeriX LLC, New York, NY), was commissioned for photon‐beam dose calculations. The same sets of measured data from 6‐MV and 18‐MV beams were used to commission NXEGS and Pinnacle 6.2b (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA). Accuracy and efficiency were compared against the collapsed cone convolution algorithm implemented in Pinnacle 6.2b, together with BEAM simulation (BEAMnrc 2001: National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, ON). We investigated a number of options in NXEGS: the accuracy of fast Monte Carlo, the re‐implementation of EGS4, post‐processing technique (dose de‐noising algorithm), and dose calculation time. Dose distributions were calculated with NXEGS, Pinnacle, and BEAM in water, lung‐slab, and air‐cylinder phantoms and in a lung patient plan. We compared the dose distributions calculated by NXEGS, Pinnacle, and BEAM. In a selected region of interest (7725 voxels) in the lung phantom, all but 1 voxel had a γ (3% and 3 mm thresholds) of 1 or less for the dose difference between the NXEGS re‐implementation of EGS4 and BEAM, and 99% of the voxels had a γ of 1 or less for the dose difference between NXEGS fast Monte Carlo and BEAM. Fast Monte Carlo with post‐processing was up to 100 times faster than the NXEGS re‐implementation of EGS4, while maintaining<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20083-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20083:equation:acm20083-math-0001\"/>statistical uncertainty. With air inhomogeneities larger than 1 cm, post‐processing preserves the dose perturbations from the air cylinder. When 3 or more beams were used, fast Monte Carlo with post‐processing was comparable to or faster than Pinnacle 6.2b collapsed cone convolution.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.18.Bb, 87.53.Wz</jats:p>",

In the western United States, millions of dollars are spent annually to control invasions of<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>spp., introduced small trees or shrubs from Eurasia that have colonized bottomland ecosystems along many rivers. Resource managers seek to control<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>in attempts to meet various objectives, such as increasing water yield and improving wildlife habitat. Often, riparian restoration is an implicit goal, but there has been little emphasis on a process or principles to effectively plan restoration activities, and many<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>removal projects are unsuccessful at restoring native vegetation. We propose and summarize the key steps in a planning process aimed at developing effective restoration projects in<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>‐dominated areas. We discuss in greater detail the biotic and abiotic factors central to the evaluation of potential restoration sites and summarize information about plant communities likely to replace<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>under various conditions. Although many projects begin with implementation, which includes the actual removal of<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>, we stress the importance of pre‐project planning that includes: (1) clearly identifying project goals; (2) developing realistic project objectives based on a detailed evaluation of site conditions; (3) prioritizing and selecting<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>control sites with the best chance of ecological recovery; and (4) developing a detailed tactical plan before<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic>is removed. After removal, monitoring and maintenance as part of an adaptive management approach are crucial for evaluating project success and determining the most effective methods for restoring these challenging sites.</jats:bold></jats:p>",

However, epidemiologic data consistently correlates increased red meat consumption with increased incidence of CVD. Recent trials also have shown beneficial effects of a diet containing moderate protein (PRO) levels (mainly from plant sources). The BOLD (Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet) Study is a randomized, four period, crossover controlled feeding study designed to compare the effects of the average American diet with the DASH diet (50% carbohydrates [CHO], 18% PRO, 38% fat, 2–3oz lean red meat), a heart healthy diet rich in lean red meat (BOLD; 50% CHO, 18% PRO, 28% fat, 5–7oz lean red meat), and a moderate PRO diet also rich in lean red meat (BOLD+; 44% CHO, 28% PRO, 28% fat, 5–7oz lean red meat) on blood lipids, lipoproteins, and emerging risk factors for CVD. Eighty men and women (BMI 18.5–37m/kg<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) will be split into two distinct populations, moderately hypercholesterolemic (LDL‐C between the 50th and 90th percentile) and moderately hypertriglyceridemic (TG&gt;150 mg/dL). We hypothesize that the BOLD and BOLD+ diets will yield changes in LDL‐C similar to that seen during the DASH diet period. We also hypothesize that the BOLD and BOLD+ diet periods will produce better effects on HDL‐C, TG and glucose homeostasis.</jats:p>",

Besides the TOL test, students were administered Raven's Colored Matrices. Results: Results confirmed the findings of previous studies that both age and school type are important predictors of mental planning. Furthermore, results also suggest that the relationship between type of school and mental planning ability cannot be accounted for by differences in students' fluid intelligence. Conclusion: In the present study, the TOL test continued to differentiate public from private school students, even after we controlled for the effect of differences on the Raven test.</jats:p>",

The system consists of three different parts: a visual system, a planning system and a control system. In the visual system, ultra sonic sensor is used to renew small part of environmental map during the transferring taking advantage of quick scanning time. In the planning system, proposed on-line path planning method is used in an artificial potential field based on the solution of the Laplacian differential equation. This path planning method can correspond to minor changes in the transportation environment during transportation. The on-line path planning has been accomplished by regenerating the updated potential field. In the control system, feed-forward controller by means of notch filter is used to achieve the suppression of sway of the transferred object. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments.</jats:p>",
