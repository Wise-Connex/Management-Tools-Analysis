WarGames presented the internet simultaneously as a high-tech toy for teenagers and a weapon for global destruction. In its wake, major news media focused on potential realities of the “ WarGames Scenario.” In response, Congress held hearings, screened WarGames, and produced the first internet-regulating legislation. WarGames engaged a “teenaged technology” discourse, which cast both internet technology itself and its users as rebellious teenagers in need of parental control. This discourse enabled policy makers to equate government internet regulation with parental guidance rather than with suppression of democracy and innovation, a crucial distinction within 1980s cold war context. Thus, this article historicizes the internet as a cultural text, examining how technology and its regulation shaped and were shaped by cultural representations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An enduring problem confronting design science is the question of how to distil design principles and propositions in contexts where only limited evidence has accrued directly in connection with the design problem at hand. This article illustrates how researchers can address this challenge by recourse to well-established bodies of basic theory and research in the wider social and organizational sciences that suggest robust design options. Adopting this approach, we draw upon the insights of social identity theory, self/social categorization theory and the Five Factor Model of human personality from the field of personality and social psychology to distil a series of propositions to inform the design of scenario planning interventions, centred on team composition and the facilitation process. In so doing, our article exemplifies the benefits of adopting a pragmatic science approach to the design of processes that promote organizational change and development, thus adding to the growing design science movement. </jats:p>",

Under riwaj only males could own land; women had no right to inherit land. During the Swat State era (1915-1969), on the whole, the traditional practice remained the law of inheritance and ownership of land under which the women folk were not entitled to inherit. However, during the reign of Miangul Jahanzeb in some cases the women were given the right to inherit and own land. The pattern of land ownership remained the same, in general, after the merger of the state in 1969. In this scenario, The West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 (W. P. Act V of 1962), with exception to the proviso of section 3 and 7, was extended to the area on 15 January 1976. Although extension of The West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962, brought no practical change for the time being, its extension along with the land settlement carried out by the provincial revenue department, in most of the study area, were destined to bring the required change.</jats:p>"
