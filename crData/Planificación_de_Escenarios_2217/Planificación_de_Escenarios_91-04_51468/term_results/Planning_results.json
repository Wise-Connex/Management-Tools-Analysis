The fact that many nations are reviewing and, in some instances, restructuring their national health care systems, has added to the complexity and feeling of continual turbulence experienced by their managers. State run systems like that in the United Kingdom are introducing market forces to increase effectiveness and value for money; while market systems, like that in the United States, are increasing regulatory interventions to achieve the kind of cost control available to countries with large public systems which operate with global budgets.</jats:p><jats:p>Public hospitals in the United States offer examples of public institutions operating in a highly competitive market environment. A decade of management changes undertaken to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), the largest public hospital system in the United States, is presented as a case study of public health services and public management in a market environment.</jats:p>",

Management development programmes are, however, subject to conflicting demands and differing expectations. The situation is confounded by the wide diversity of strategies subsumed under the heading of management development, and the confusing nature of much of the terminology currently in use. This article presents a simple conceptual framework that can guide analysis and help programme planners review the options, opportunities and limitations of management development programmes. The framework presented examines management development from three different perspectives: the approach adopted; the outcomes expected; and the process of expansion, extension and adaptation.</jats:p><jats:p>Our analysis of management development strategies allows us to reach some conclusions in areas where there is a degree of consensus. In countries where there is a mismatch between the strategies of PHC and the organizational structures through which they are to be implemented, management development has a role to play in effecting change. Its potential to do so is limited by powerful social, political, economic and organizational forces. Therefore, the capacity to critically analyse the context in which change is planned, emerges as a key element in programme design. We argue that there is no one best approach to management development, and the design of strategies will be contingent on a variety of factors. We do, however, reaffirm the view that where organizational structures and conditions do not support the implementation of PHC strategies, intervention through training alone is almost certain to be inadequate. To be effective, a more comprehensive programme will be required. Finally, the article points to a number of unresolved issues in areas where there is either controversy, lack of clarity or limited experience.</jats:p>",

The health infrastructure is presented for the year 1986, and the stock of cadres of health worker i.e. doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, is shown in tabular and graphic form, together with changes in the composition of that stock over the last fifteen years. These data are then used to develop trends, and a commentary on progress made. Finally, the level of financing of health care is shown, and movements in the share of the social product (GNP) from 1975 to the present time.

Interest developed after Romanian Independence but the efforts of the early historians like A.D. Xenopol (1847–1920) were greatly extended after the First World War, when the enlargement of frontiers, adding Transylvania (and temporarily Bessarabia) to the Old Kingdom embracing Moldavia and Wallachia, gave Romanian scholars access to the whole of the central Carpathian belt.

The firm knew there was a steady European demand for its products because it received hundreds of calls a year from distributors and retailers who wanted to place orders for its classic, functional clothes. The process of responding to what were usually small orders was becoming unwieldy. The firm knew it would have to devise a strategic approach for full‐scale entry into the European market if it were to profitably serve these potential customers. The prospects of Europe becoming a Single Market in the Nineties also enhanced the firm's interest.</jats:p>",

A brief derivation of this continuum model is presented in terms of its relationship to potential theory, and a method for its solution is outlined. The forms produced by the model are subject to fractional power laws which relate the occupancy of sites and densities to distances. Fractal dimensions can be derived from these fractional powers, and conventional and fast methods of estimation are introduced. A large-scale simulation provides the baseline for comparison and its average fractal dimension is estimated as 1.701 ± 0.025 from thirty aggregates. The effect of constraining the physical limits of the lattice on which such aggregates are grown is explored and the model is then used to generate a continuum of forms determined by a control parameter which distorts the potential field of the model. A series of forms from the linear with fractal dimension close to 1 to the concentric with a fractal dimension near to 2, are grown. The model is then applied to urban development in the town of Cardiff and various simulations are attempted which point the way to further research. </jats:p>",

The results provided clear evidence of the experienced teachers’ superior knowledge base and repertoire of teaching strategies.

We develop optimal solutions for the product-mix planning, lot sizing, and scheduling of such bottleneck facilities. The integrated product-mix planning, lot sizing and scheduling problem yields a nonconvex, mixed-integer nonlinear program which is difficult to solve for global optimality. Our strategy is to characterize the optimal solution and reduce the overall problem to a series of smaller, single variable, constrained optimization problems which can be solved relatively easily. We provide results for the two-product case for both the single-stage and two-stage production systems and for two types of production environments. Optimal solutions are also provided for the single-stage multiproduct case when all products are produced under a common-cycle restriction. Our work represents an extension of classical product-mix models to include the economic lot sizing and scheduling model. </jats:p>",

In this paper are presented theoretical and algorithmic approaches to the analysis of aggregations of quadrats at or above a given density, in which these sets are treated as multifractal regions whose fractal dimension, D, may vary with phenomenon intensity, scale, and location. The technique is illustrated with Matui's quadrat house-count data, which yield measurements consistent with a nonautocorrelated simulated Poisson process but not with an orthogonal unit-step random walk. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of such analysis for multiscale geographic analysis systems. </jats:p>",

Mother plates processed on the 60′′ plate mill are cut, using fairly simple, two-stage guillotine cutting patterns, into a few NW customer plates. Considerably more NW plates can be cut from the much larger mother plates processed on the 160′′ mill, and the number of possible mappings of NW customer plates into mother plates is much larger. Our heuristic procedure was implemented as a module in the plant's production planning and control system, and it is used daily to generate mother-plate dimensions and cutting patterns. </jats:p>",

Multiple resource management and meaningful public involvement in management decision making are the distinguishing characteristics of this approach. This paper examines public participation in the management of public forests by trying to answer three questions; 1. Why involve citizens in resource management at all?, 2. Who may participate?, and 3. How can the public participate? Deciding who may participate is a difficult task, but utilizing the concept of forest constituency may help. We suggest that the public must be involved not only in policy-making decisions, but also in management decisions. Doing so, however, requires the use of computerized decision aids designed specifically for cooperative exploration of management alternatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The external information linkages of industrial firms in two sectors of Buffalo's manufacturing base—medical instruments, and chemicals—are examined. Survey data are presented which indicate a positive role for imported technical services in local product innovation, export activity, and technology diffusion. The data reveal that firms which import a substantial proportion of their external technical inputs hold a competitive advantage over their counterparts which depend solely on local suppliers. The data also reveal that larger manufacturers are more likely to import technical services than smaller firms. Evidence from the sample is then contrasted against recent empirical streams in the literature on producer services, regional growth, and industrial innovation. It is argued that urban centres with weak producer service endowment may in some instances import key inputs from other regions. On a more cautious note, it is suggested that this option may not be feasible for small manufacturers, many of which lack the in-house resources required for nonlocal information search. The paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which interregional trade in producer services can act as an equalising force in regional innovation potential. </jats:p>",

The information needed to develop meaningful and culturally appropriate educational interventions is often difficult to obtain because topics related to the prevention and treatment of AIDS are invariably culturally and/or personally sensitive. This article describes the data collection guidelines of the HIV/AIDS Rapid Anthropological Assessment Procedures developed by the Social and Behavioural Research Unit of the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS. The guidelines apply anthropological methods of observation, participant observation, informal and formal interviews, and focus group interviews to the collection of information on AIDS-related beliefs and behaviors. When researchers focus on specific issues in countries, cultures, and languages with which they are already familiar, relatively rapid assessments can be made with a high degree of validity. This article briefly discusses these methods and their application to AIDS-related topics, together with the validity and reliability of the various methodological tools available to social and behavioral scientists. </jats:p>",

A simplified mathematical model suggests that poor families with truncated social support networks are most vulnerable to housing famine, and explores how the famine may synergistically interact with inadequacy of support, leading to their becoming homeless. This view contrasts with currently popular ideologically driven explanations of homelessness. On the one hand is the assertion that vulnerability to the housing deficit is the ‘cause’ of homelessness. On the other is the claim that simplistic housing strategies, in which the interaction of housing loss with the structure of vulnerability to that loss is not recognized, can end the US crisis of homelessness.

Runoff monitoring methods provide best estimates of existing loads, but cannot be used to predict load changes resulting from runoff controls, or other changes of the urban system. Simulation models require extensive calibration for reliable application. Models with optional formulations of pollutant build up, washoff, and transport can be better calibrated and the selection of options should be based on a statistical analysis of calibration data. Calibrated simulation models can be used for evaluation of control alternatives.</jats:p>",

Movement along the continuum is facilitated by the nurse case manager. Concepts from three theoretical frameworks are integrated to define goals, criteria, and expected outcomes for each level of care along the continuum. They are Neuman's (1982) systems model for nursing practice and education, Caplan's (1961) model for primary prevention of mental disorders in children, and Frances, Clarken and Perry's (1984) differential therapeutics. The continuum provides a guide for nurses and other health care providers to achieve high quality care as economically as possible. It also enhances self‐care and self‐responsibility for families of disturbed children by offering a sequential graded system of care along the health‐illness continuum.</jats:p>",
