Das gilt besonders für die unangenehmen Grenzen, die knappe Ressourcen setzen, und für unterschwellig sich vorbereitende soziale, wirtschaftliche und politische Prozesse, welche namentlich große Regionen negativ betreffen können.

Bei der Landesentwicklungsplanung haben sich die beiden Landesregierungen bereits auf eine Zusammenarbeit durch Staatsverträge geeinigt. Die vereinbarte gemeinsame Landesentwicklungsplanung kann die notwendigen Vorgaben und Aussagen für den engeren Verflechtungsraum Berlin-Brandenburg jedoch nicht mit der erforderlichen Genauigkeit leisten. Die Gründung eines regionalen Planungsverbands für den engeren Verflechtungsraum Berlin-Brandenburg wird vom Land Brandenburg mit nachvollziehbaren Gründen abgelehnt. Demnach kommt als hinreichend konkretes und verbindliches Ordnungsinstrument für den Großraum Berlin nur eine Koordination der Flächennutzungsplanung in Frage. Die Koordinierungsaufgabe sollte nicht durch einen Planungsverband nach § 205 BauGB, sondern durch einen Berlin-brandenburgischen Zweckverband mit beratender Funktion wahrgenommen werden.

Freilich kümmert sich die tatsächlicheEntwicklung wenig um wohlmeinende Ideenkonzepte oder Debatten im Feuilleton. Sie gehorcht ganz anderen Entwicklungsgesetzen: Demographie und Migration, Eigentumsverhältnisse und Mieten, öffentliche Finanzknappheit und Weltmarktkonkurrenz lauten ihre Parameter. Sprich: die Ideen auf dem Papier nehmen sich demgegenüber – ohne Umsetzung in Baurecht und Finanzentscheidungen – oft hilflos aus. Für einen jungfräulich-naiven Glauben an die Gestaltungsspielräume der Landesentwicklung ist kein Raum, wo enge regionalwirtschaftliche, rechtliche und politische Restriktionen den staatlichen Handlungsrahmen einengen.Die Frage lautet deshalb schlicht: Wie realistisch sind die Konzepte? Welche Chancen bestehen – ernsthaft geprüft – sie umzusetzen – selbst bei unterstellter „best practice“? Wie stark engen die nicht steuerbaren Restriktionen gutgemeinte Planungen ein? Auf den folgenden Seiten soll versucht werden, drei in der Planung beliebte Vorstellungen zu hinterfragen und anhand dieser drei Punkte die Illusionen der Landesplanung offenzulegen.</jats:p>"

Dies leistet das Leitbild „Dezentrale Konzentration und ökologische Entwicklung“. Das Leitbild setzt auf Prioritäten bei der Zentren- und Siedlungsentwicklung auf dem sog. Brandenburger Ring. Und es verzahnt das Freiraumkonzept zur Naturraumentwicklung mit dem Konzept zentraler Orte und Verbindungsachsen. Anhand der drei Bausteine: „Freiraum-Konzept – Natur als Entwicklungspotential“, „Polyzentrale Landesentwicklung mit regionalen Entwicklungsschwerpunkten“ und „Verbindungsachsen und umweltverträgliches Verkehrskonzept“ wird das gemeinsame Handlungskonzept von Berlin und Brandenburg näher erläutert. Besondere Strategien für wichtige Teilräume des Landes sollen ein koordiniertes Handeln aller Ressorts unterstützen.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bedingt durch seine zentrale Lage in Europa und im damaligen Deutschen Reich – dessen politisches Zentrum es war – hatte sich Berlin etwa seit der Jahrhundertwende zur deutschen Metropole entwickelt, die in jeder Hinsicht mit London und Paris konkurrieren konnte und deren Einflußbereich auch Nordeuropa und weite Gebiete Osteuropas einschloß. Die Stadt war zudem das Zentrum des mitteleuropäischen Eisenbahnnetzes und verfügte dadurch über die beste Erreichbarkeit aller europäischen Großstädte.Mit dem kriegsbedingten Fortfall dieser extremen geopolitischen Standortgunst, der Aufteilung der Stadt und der Isolierung West-Berlins verlor die Stadt nicht nur ihren Status als Hauptstadt, sondern auch jede Möglichkeit von metropolitanen Ansprüchen; sie wurde insoweit funktionslos. So stellt sich die Frage, ob und inwieweit Berlin in einem wiedervereinigten Deutschland und inmitten eines sich zusammenschließenden Europas seine vormaligen metropolitanen Funktionen zurückgewinnen kann und welche raumstrukturellen Folgen auf andere Schwerpunkträume davon gegebenenfalls zu erwarten sein werden.Dazu wird die These vertreten, daß nicht allein die Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands, sondern ebenso die sich anbahnende Integration Europas – in dessen geographischer und kultureller Mitte Berlin liegt – starke Anschubkräfte und entsprechende Entwicklungspotentiale für das (Wieder‑)Erstehen der Metropole Berlin freisetzen werden, wobei allerdings viel davon abhängen wird, ob und wann die Bundesorgane ihren Sitz in Berlin nehmen werden.</jats:p>"

The entire area is environmentally very sensitive with numerous large, shallow bays, exposed mud flats, wetland areas, and central channels having maximum currents of three to four knots. These features make the area very difficult to protect from an oil spill. Spill response is further complicated because of the many different state, federal, and local jurisdictions with mandated responsibilities in oil spill response and environmental protection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Under the leadership of the U. S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Portland, Oregon, a steering group was established to guide the development of a response plan for the Columbia River Estuary. A concerted effort was made to include representatives from response organizations, natural resource agencies, and resource users from federal, state, and local governments, and commercial sectors in the planning process. The first draft of an operational response plan was completed the summer of 1992 through a combination of technical workshops, field trips, and small working groups meeting with local communities. The Columbia River Estuary Response Plan prioritizes areas to protect; identifies specific response strategies for protecting these areas; and outlines the logistics needed to implement these strategies, including equipment needs, the location of staging areas, and the identification of pre-designated command posts. The local spill response cooperative and oil transportation industry are using the plan to coordinate the purchase of response equipment and the staging of this equipment at numerous locations along the river.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Key to the success of the plan is ensuring that all the groups responding to an event participate in the planning process together. This process has worked well for the Columbia River Estuary and will serve as a model for response planning for other environmentally sensitive areas along the Columbia River and coastal areas of Washington and Oregon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Das zu erwartende Verkehrswachstum wird die Bedeutung der Raumordnung und Stadtentwicklungspolitik in Mittel- und Osteuropa nachdrücklich erhöhen. Entscheidende Wachstumskomponente ist der induzierte Neuverkehr. Da er erst über den Umweg tiefgreifender Wandlungen der Gesellschafts‑, Wirtschafts- und Verkehrsstruktur entsteht, spiegeln unsere heutigen Verkehrsprognosen vor allem Hoffnung wider. Angesichts dieses Nachfragedrucks dürften sich in den nächsten zehn Jahren im Osten wie im Westen vor allem die Strukturschwächen der traditionellen Verkehrsmittel verstärken. Die innovative Beeinflussung der Verkehrsaufteilung auf die Verkehrsträger (Modal split) wird somit zur zentralen Gestaltungsaufgabe der Verkehrspolitik. Zugleich ist nicht mehr zu übersehen, daß die entscheidenden strukturellen Lösungen des Verkehrswachstums außerhalb des Verkehrssektors liegen. „Verkehrsvermeidung“ durch Verkehrsverlagerung muß bei der Nachfragesteuerung beginnen. Deshalb entsteht gegenwärtig ein neues Leitbild umfassender alternativer Verkehrspolitik. Angesichts des tiefgreifenden Wandels unserer Siedlungs- und Produktionsstrukturen ist der Beitrag der Raumordnungs- und Stadtentwicklungspolitik zur Gestaltung des Verkehrs von morgen in den Städten von morgen besonders gefordert. In dieser Phase sind strategische Überlegungen gefragt. Da alle Programme und Pläne wesentlich mehr Zeit brauchen als erwartet, kann die Raumordnung vorziehen und Rahmenbedingungen setzen. Für den Aufbau Osteuropas und die zeitliche Abstimmung von Verkehrs- und Regionalpolitik hält die Entwicklungspolitik der 60er und 70er Jahre wesentliche Lehren parat. Zugleich verfügen die osteuropäischen Länder in dieser Neuorientierung über den großen Vorteil, auf westliche Lösungen als Module zurückgreifen zu können. Insofern entwickelt sich der Strukturwandel Ostdeutschlands bereits heute zu einem innovativen Exportartikel für Osteuropa. Die Marktchancen für eine zukunftsfähige Umgestaltung von Verkehrssystemen liegen gerade dort auf der Hand, wo sich Wirtschafts- und Lebensräume neu organisieren. Dies gilt besonders für konkrete Demostrationsobjekte erfolgreicher Verkehrsentlastung durch Raumordnung und Stadtentwicklung.</jats:p>"

The school was chosen for a variety of reasons: particularly the fact that it does not provide full secondary education to years eleven aud twelve and the community's relative isolation and proximity to larger centres. Westarup is situated approximately three hundred kilometres from Perth aud witIlin a predominantly rural area of Western Australia. The population is approximately 500 (1986 census) - mainly in the 0-14 aud 30-49 age groups. There is the one secondary district high school in the community and students pursuing Tertiary Entrauce Examination subjects must leave the district. Most go to boarding schools in one of the larger coastal centres. Nearly all of the 30 students who completed year ten in 1990 continued to year eleven. Almost all students indicated that they intended to complete their secondary education to year twelve in spite of the fact that this would mean doing so in a school in a larger community. This contrasts with an earlier study in Queensland in which only 11 out of a sample of 30 year ten rural school leavers indicated that they intended to continue their formal education beyond the minimum leaving age. It is likely that reduced career opportunities for young people without full secondary education together with high unemployment have influenced these educational decisions.</jats:p>"

Most of these algorithms address either the issue of response-time constraints or the issue of dynamic environments. We propose a new real-time planning algorithm, DYNORAII, to address both of these issues simultaneously. DYNORAII is structured as a sequence of “partial planning and execution” cycles to avoid obsolescence of planned solutions at the time of execution. DYNORAII uses a stopping criterion to balance planning cost and execution cost to achieve near optimal response times. DYNORAII was used for the routing problem to optimize total cost in both static and dynamic environments. It shows better average-case time complexity than traditional real-time algorithms. </jats:p>",

It has been widely argued that spatial equity has declined since the 1970s, particularly in the context of the ‘north–south divide’. Thus, it may be expected that territorial justice—spatial equity at the local authority level—also declined during the Thatcher years. The general arguments and evidence on spatial equity are critically reviewed, and then the relationship between housing needs and housing provision is analysed empirically. The results indicate that there was less territorial justice in private provision, and there were conflicting trends in public provision: Territorial justice declined in the local authority sector, but increased in the housing association sector. However, in total, Thatcherism was associated with less territorial justice.</jats:p>",

It is assumed that two production sectors (industry and service) and one knowledge production sector (research institutions and university) are located at the CBD. First, a compact framework for analysing dynamic interactions of the three sectors and urban pattern formation is suggested. Then, the existence of stationary urban patterns is guaranteed and the stability conditions provided.

These suggest a synthesis of the explanations for subsequent modeling of the role of services by means of the Sequential Interindustry Model (SIM), developed for examining transient processes. Services are viewed as distributive, servicing, and informative, each group with a successively larger information portion relative to materials in its output.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the role of property development in city revitalization is considered. Case study material is used to analyze the changing organizational nature of property development, especially the interrelationships between property developers and the traditional purveyors of urban policy: Local authorities. It is shown how the property industry is dependent on the development of organizational capacities with public authorities in a manner not anticipated by the rhetoric of central government, a rhetoric which has pushed the property-led approach as an alternative to development by, and through, the public sector. In contrast to this view, illustrative material is presented which indicates how property-led development is highly dependent on the public sector. Also illustrated is how the process of property-led regeneration has the capacity to undermine a range of local, community, interests in areas affected by redevelopment schemes, a situation which has been exacerbated by the prioritization of the shorter-term development goals of the property industry. In conclusion, it is noted that property-led approaches to regeneration, although a necessary component of urban revitalization, are neither a sufficient nor an adequate response to the multiple tasks involved in the revitalization of cities. </jats:p>",

Path analysis results of the four structural equations provided modest support for the hypothesized relations. In addition to the hypothesized relations, the results revealed some significant direct paths that were not hypothesized.

Die UNCED-Umweltkonferenz im Juni 1992 lenkte ein weiteres Mal den Blick auf die Umweltverhältnisse in diesem Land, in erfreulicher Differenzierung: Wurde doch wahrgenommen, daß auch und gerade in den Industrie- und Ballungsregionen des Landes die Umweltqualität bereits derart schlecht geworden ist, daß die Lebens- und Produktionsverhältnisse ernsthaft bedroht sind. Die Situation in São Paulo und in der benachbarten Industrieregion im Vale de Cubatão sind nur ein Beispiel dafür.Weniger bekannt dürfte jedoch sein, daß die Umweltgesetzgebung in Brasilien durchaus dem Standard moderner Industrieländer vergleichbar ist und Brasilien dies auch auf der UNCED-Konferenz durch die Unterschriften unter die verschiedenen Dokumente zu Klima, Biodiversität usw. dokumentiert hat.Dieser Beitrag will am Beispiel der Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung zeigen, wie sich politisches Wollen gesetzgeberische Absicht und verwaltungsmäßige Umsetzung der Vorschriften den Umweltproblemen Brasiliens in der täglichen Praxis stellen.

The main features are (i) the calculation is fast enough to allow interactive three‐dimensional treatment planning, and (ii) irregularly shaped or compensated fields, which are required to fit three‐dimensional dose distributions to target volumes, are adequately taken into consideration. The method is based on the pencil beam convolution technique and shares its features concerning accuracy. A considerable gain in speed is achieved by decomposing the pencil beam kernel into three separated terms, thus reducing the required number of two‐dimensional convolutions. The convolutions are performed in the frequency domain via the fast Hartley transform. Using these techniques, the calculation time for the convolutions is only about 8 s on a DEC VAX station 3100. This is one‐fourth to one‐third of the calculation time for the ray tracing through the three‐dimensional CT data set, which has to be performed in any case. Results of the calculation are compared with measurements in a homogeneous phantom for 15 MV photons. Two irregular fields shaped with a multileaf collimator are considered. The deviations between measured and calculated absolute dose values are smaller than ±2%.</jats:p>",

They are called on to perform numerous advanced practice roles in public health and other community agencies, one of which is program planning. To perform this role effectively, CHN specialists should use conceptual models to guide application of the nursing process in a population‐based practice. One such model developed by a nurse for use in planning community health programs is the McLaughlin model. It was used to address the community diagnosis of risk for childhood lead poisoning, a long‐standing public health problem currently receiving renewed attention from federal public health authorities. Applications of conceptual models in practice settings can test such model's efficacy, enrich the scientific basis of community health nursing practice, and ultimately improve the health of the community.</jats:p>",

The postal survey shows that the new practices have been widely adopted in plants of all nationalities, although rates of adoption are higher for the Far Eastern group. The in-depth interviews reveal, however, that there are important variations in the ways in which these new practices are applied. It is argued that these variations cannot be understood in terms of ‘nationality’. Rather, they are associated with differences in production processes and the segmentation of labour based on gender, age, and skill. In the light of these findings, the significance of the term ‘Japanisation’ for regions and regional policy is considered.</jats:p>",

When applied to new drug development, the assays are used for therapeutic index-based screening (e.g., less myelosuppressive analogues, structure-toxicity studies, new drug leads), interpreting efficacy data from xenotransplant models, and selecting the most accurate animal model for human hematopoietic toxicity. However, other types of assays may be required to identify the mechanism underlying myelosuppression. In clinical trial planning, in vitro colony-forming assays can be used to elucidate schedule dependency of myelotoxicity (which in turn provides clues about mechanism of action), to plan cytokine support, and to estimate dose-escalation effects. The inhibition of colony formation can be measured relative to a compound with known clinical myelotoxicity and schedule dependency to provide some idea of the toxicity expected at particular doses, and the degree of heterogeneity between individuals, during clinical trials. The predictive accuracy of the in vitro data has been proven by validation studies with alkylating agents. </jats:p>",

Some of these techniques, called ‘transformative mediator techniques’, both increase the knowledge base for decisions and enhance the abilities of resource-poor groups to protect and promote their interests. In this paper, elements of transformative and nontransformative mediator techniques are identified and discussed. Examples of mediator techniques are drawn from three cases: A regulatory negotiation to develop emission standards for wood stoves, a policy dialogue concerning a proposal to construct a solid-waste incinerator in New York City, and settlement negotiations in a fishery dispute involving three Native American tribes, the State of Michigan, and two federal agencies. </jats:p>",

This disaster mythology clearly does not make for effective planning for or managing of such crisis occasions. </jats:p>",

Despite their demonstrated efficacy, as well as frequent calls for their implementation, these assessment methods have failed to progress from model to typical special education practice due to feasibility problems. In this article, we describe a research program conducted over the past 8 years to address how technology can be used to surmount these implementation difficulties. The research program focused on one variety of objective, ongoing assessment known as curriculum-based measurement, in the areas of reading, spelling, and math. First, we discuss research on the use of computers to assume the mechanical aspects of measurement. Then, we discuss research on the use of computers to help teachers translate the assessment information into feasible instructional adaptations, even within the context of large instructional group size. Implications for the fields of special education, technology, and assessment are drawn. </jats:p>",

Tactical adjustments to the mix of farm enterprises can capitalize on good growing conditions and minimise losses under poor growing conditions. In this paper, a discrete stochastic programming model of dryland wheat‐sheep farms in Western Australia is used to identify optimal tactical adjustments to climate and to calculate the value of these tactical adjustments. The model, MUDAS, includes nine discrete season types with a wide range of options for tactical adjustments in each. In the standard model, optimal tactical responses increase expected net cash surplus by approximately 22% relative to a fixed or inflexible strategy. In most season types, changes to the long term farm strategy are made on less than 10% of the farm area, although in some seasons over 25% of the farm can require adjustments to the enterprise selected. The benefits of flexibility are not evenly distributed across different season types but occur predominantly in the best and worst seasons. The magnitude of benefits is affected differently by different commodity prices. Benefits of flexibility are due to capitalizing on knowledge about the greater volatility of profits from cropping than from livestock production. Deterministic models and even stochastic models which don't include activities for tactical adjustments miss this key feature of the system.</jats:p>",

In spite of its proximity to Western Europe and the European Community (EC) it has received a very modest amount of attention from English-speaking geographers compared with that from German-speaking and French-speaking colleagues. Studies of political and economic geography of the ECE are also hampered by the lack of appropriate methodology and theory. Some of the most important issues involved lie in the economic sphere of transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. In the current paper, an attempt is made to survey and evaluate the size and character of existing debt stocks owed to the West by ECE and then to assess their likely impact on the political and economic geography of Europe and the EC. It is concluded that the international financial community is making it politically difficult for the countries in the region to persist with their structural reforms and stabilization policies. The future political and economic geography of ECE and EC depends, to a large extent, on the ability of the Western financial system to respond to the long-term needs of the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The continuing high fertility rate in Kenya is of considerable concern as the resulting high rate of population growth makes improvements in living standards difficult, if not impossible. In this paper, the determinants of fertility in urban and rural areas of Kenya are examined through estimation of a probit model which includes variables in three categories: economic, biological, and social or cultural. Also simulated is the effect of increasing the levels of female education on the total fertility rate and the total number of births. Results show that improvements in female education can result in a substantial decrease in the number of births in Kenya, thereby suggesting that formulation of government policy in this area is desirable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Channel Tunnel case exemplifies both the present tendency towards a greater involvement of the private sector in the delivery of public infrastructures, and the new possibilities for funding that are a result of the internationalisation of finance markets and banking activities. But it shows also the limits of this change. As a private venture, the Channel Tunnel is heavily dependent on a series of public-sector decisions which have had a great influence on its funding. The profitability of the investment is dependent upon huge, public investments in which spending on the Channel Tunnel is only a small part. The finance had to be helped by various political interventions which make the possibility of a nonguaranty commitment for both the French and the UK government doubtful. On the other hand, the banks proved unable to secure a tight control on the costs, which will have almost doubled when the Tunnel is in operation. The division between the governments and the concessionaires makes unclear the division of responsibilities with regard to the contractors; the division between the concessionaires and the contractors makes it unclear where government responsibility lies for the work. </jats:p>",

A critique of a paper by Jarman et al leads to the formulation of an improved conceptual and statistical framework for analyses of uptake. Within this framework, the possibility of explaining immunisation uptake by using readily available data at the District Health Authority scale is reevaluated. Results suggest that analyses solely at this highly aggregate scale are plagued by the statistical problem of overdispersion, and cannot provide reliable explanations of uptake. Rather, it is argued, disaggregate or, preferably, multilevel analyses are required. Such analyses form the subject matter of the second paper. </jats:p>",
