In part, this is because the organization of these efforts embodies an inherent tension between an ideology of associational action and local democracy on the one hand and an adherence to essentially rational-bureaucratic approaches to planning and implementation on the other. This article conceptualizes this tension and examines its unfolding and implications in comprehensive community initiatives through an in-depth case study of one such effort. </jats:p>",

Using data from case studies of Greenpoint-Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Long Island City in Queens, this article finds that adherence on the part of officials to the principle of highest and best use, together with an incremental approach to planning and land use regulation, has contributed to opportunistic development and industrial displacement in these areas. The question of whether this trajectory is in the interests of the public at large remains the subject of fierce debate in the city's planning community and beyond. The article contributes to the literature on property-led economic development in central cities by exploring the complex task of planners charged with regulating areas that not only are logical sites for commercial and residential expansion but also serve as niches for loweryielding land uses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the ‘Go West’ policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality. </jats:p>",

Continuing advances in geographic information science, location-aware technologies, and geosimulation methods offer great potential for observational and simulation studies of human activities at high levels of spatiotemporal resolution. The author contributes by developing rigorous statements of the necessary space–time conditions for human interaction by extending a measurement theory for time geography. The extended measurement theory identifies necessary conditions both for physical and for virtual interaction. The theory suggests elegant and tractable solutions that can be derived from data available from location-aware technologies or geosimulation methods. These conditions and their solutions could be used to infer the possibilities for human interaction from detailed space–time trajectories and prisms generated from observation or simulation studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The fewest-line axial map, often simply referred to as the ‘axial map’, is one of the primary tools of space syntax. Its natural language definition has allowed researchers to draw consistent maps that present a concise description of architectural space; it has been established that graph measures obtained from the map are useful for the analysis of pedestrian movement patterns and activities related to such movement: for example, the location of services or of crime. However, the definition has proved difficult to translate into formal language by mathematicians and algorithmic implementers alike. This has meant that space syntax has been criticised for a lack of rigour in the definition of one of its fundamental representations. Here we clarify the original definition of the fewest-line axial map and show that it can be implemented algorithmically. We show that the original definition leads to maps similar to those currently drawn by hand, and we demonstrate that the differences between the two may be accounted for in terms of the detail of the algorithm used. We propose that the analytical power of the axial map in empirical studies derives from the efficient representation of key properties of the spatial configuration that it captures. </jats:p>",

It is necessary to develop reproducibleand reliable criteria for identifying the distinctive qualities of cross-disciplinary research and training programs, especially in the field of urban and regional planning. The current study provides an exploratory first step toward that goal. A composite scale designed to measure the transdisciplinary qualities of doctoral dissertations as an important product of one's intellectual development and graduate training was constructed and administered in the present study. Dissertations completed over a twenty-five-year period by Ph.D. candidates within an interdisciplinary doctoral training program were rated by two independent reviewers across multiple dimensions of transdisciplinary integration and scope. Departmental as well as gender differences were found on several dimensions of transdisciplinarity. </jats:p>",

We then apply the Lacanian concepts of desire and jouissance, followed by an exploration of the Lacanian four discourses and the speech acts, or language games, of the planner and the ‘planned’.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Toxic sites worldwide expose millions to environmental and health risks. In response, public agencies in Western Europe and the United States have begun to identify and remediate contaminated sites. Public participation in cleanup decisions is a critical part of this process. US agencies increasingly rely on Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to facilitate long-term participation. CABs are intended to inform and consult the public and integrate citizens' input in cleanup decisions. Recent research, however, finds that participatory processes often fall short of their objectives. This paper examines the performance of CABs in involving the public in toxic sites cleanup decisions in the United States. The research (1) develops a conceptual framework and a quantitative methodology to assess CABs; and (2) uses this methodology to assess whether CABs achieve successful participation. The analysis targets CABs at five toxic sites in Tucson, Arizona, and builds on the content analysis of eighty-one CAB meeting minutes, twenty-seven interviews with CAB members, and a survey of eighty residents around three of the sites. The key findings are that, although CABs successfully diffuse information from agencies to CAB members and (to a lesser degree) gather feedback from CAB members, they fail to inform the general public and provide community feedback to the agency. </jats:p>",

Shape grammars are the formalism proposed to systematize the design rules required for such a system. A shape grammar for Alvaro Siza's patio houses at Malagueira, a 1200-unit development still being designed and constructed today, is presented. The grammar is based on the corpus of thirty-five houses designed between 1977 and 1996. The generation of houses in the grammar proceeds by the recursive dissection of rectangles locating four different functional zones (patio, living, services, and sleeping) and the key placement of the staircase. The schematic generations of two existing houses and the detailed generation of a novel one illustrate the grammar. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it reviews case studies in the implementation of environmentally protected area (APA) policy at the local level in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The state created various APAs with the expectation that local actors would support the policy enforcement regimes, thereby reducing the need for a dramatic increase in state institutional capacity. As it turned out, local actors provided varying levels of support for the range of enforcement responsibilities. Based on empirical research conducted in seven APAs, this article identifies three principal factors that explain higher engagement by local actors: (1) the objective of the policy intervention at the local level, (2) the number of different localities involved in the same project or program, and (3) the timing of the involvement of local actors in the policy-making and implementation processes. </jats:p>",

Collaborative decisionmaking approaches tackle these problems by creating a shared understanding of the problems faced and of ways to address them. The authors explore how the combined application of two techniques, a decision-support tool and a simulation game, can support decisionmaking for sustainable urban development. The techniques are applied in decision-making for real and in fictional sustainable urban renewal projects. Benefits and challenges of this combined approach are discussed based on experiences in seven applications. The main finding is that the use of the decision-support tool combined with the simulation–gaming procedure can support agenda setting and help create a shared understanding of problems and potential solutions in the field of sustainable urban renewal. </jats:p>",

The CFR and most of the Succulent Karoo lie within South Africa. South Africa has ratified the Biodiversity Convention, and must accordingly safeguard its biodiversity. Environmental assessment (EA) can help to achieve this end. Environmental legislation in South Africa requires EA for activities at project, not strategic level. However, strategic environmental assessment has been mandatory since 2000 for preparing municipal spatial development frameworks (SDFs). By setting targets for ecosystem conservation and providing thresholds of significance, systematic conservation planning can make a significant contribution to the sound preparation of SDFs, and effective EA at planning and project levels. In South Africa, the integration of systematic conservation planning with spatial planning and EA is recent. Based on examples, the main challenges for the future are identified. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article, written by Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper SPE 90557, \"Deepwater DST Planning and Operations From a DP Vessel,\" by Robert J. Stomp, SPE, ConocoPhillips Co.; Graham J. Fraser, The Expro Group; and Stephen C. Actis, SPE, Luke F. Eaton, SPE, and Kerry C. Freedman, ConocoPhillips Co., prepared for the 2004 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Houston, 26-29 September.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>ConocoPhillips is developing the Magnolia field with a tension-leg platform (TLP) in 4,674 ft of water in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The field was discovered in 1999, and appraisal wells were drilled in 2000 and 2001. The precompletion and drillstem-test (DST) operations overcame several challenges, including frac packing a thick, fine-grained interval and well testing from a dynamically positioned (DP) semisubmersible drilling rig while simultaneously transferring produced hydrocarbons to a transportation barge moored to the rig.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Magnolia asset team was formed in 2001 before drilling the last appraisal well. Front end loading leading up to field sanction in December 2001 included concept selection and field development plans. The Magnolia field would be developed from a TLP to provide direct vertical access for recompletions, future sidetrack drilling, flow assurance, and cost-effective remediation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Magnolia development wells were predrilled (i.e., drilled from a mobile offshore drilling unit while the TLP was being built). The advantages of predrilling included minimizing capital exposure risks until shallow water-flow sands were isolated, allowing TLP well operations to be conducted with a lighter, lower-cost completion rig, which would further reduce the size and cost of the TLP hull; additional reservoir characterization before TLP installation; accelerating plateau production; and testing completion techniques in the precompleted well before “batch” completions of the remaining wells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The B-25 reservoir, the primary pay horizon at the Magnolia field, was the zone selected for a DST. Zone B-25 is characterized throughout the field by its highly laminated sequences and large gross thicknesses. Whole-core data and fluid samples were obtained from the GB783-2ST2 appraisal well. Evaluation of the appraisal-well data classified the reservoir-rock matrix as a coarse siltstone with the average mean grain-size diameter of 41 µm. Overall, the mean grain-size diameters ranged from 25 to 71 µm in Well GB783-2ST2.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Test Objectives</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The objective of performing a precompletion DST was to obtain critical information regarding completion design and reservoir issues. This information would be needed before the planned batch-completion program scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2004.</jats:p>",

The application of these methods is more complex in the offshore environment, as space and weight restrictions, as well as the need for high reliability and the challenging economics of such projects, impose constraints not present in onshore applications.All EOR processes are reservoir- and reservoir fluid-specific; thus it is necessary to identify the appropriate EOR technology for use in a reservoir, design the project to achieve the required economic incremental recovery within the constraints imposed by the offshore environment, and manage the project to meet or exceed expectations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will focus on the impact of the offshore environment on the planning, design and management of an EOR project.</jats:p>",

The goal is to provide insight into the ERP functionality with respect to production and thus the selection of an actual business case proves how the enterprise successfully implemented and integrated such a system, highlighting the processes used, the obstacles faced and how they were overcome, as well as the gains achieved. Finally, it provides useful information and practical suggestions that may help production managers and users to get a better understanding of how to deploy such systems.</jats:p>",

This separation creates difficulties for safety engineers to analyse what, when, why and where safety measures are needed for preventing accidents. Another problem occurs due to the conventional practice of representing project designs using two‐dimensional (2D) drawings. In this practice, an engineer has to convert the 2D drawings into three‐dimensional (3D) mental pictures which is a tedious task. Since this conversion is already difficult, combining these 2D drawings with safety plans increases the difficulty. In order to address the problems, 4DCAD‐Safety is proposed. This paper discusses the design and development of 4DCAD‐Safety application and testing its usefulness in terms of assisting users in analysing what, when, where and why safety measures are needed.</jats:p>",

A characterization of the solution is derived analytically under general distributional assumptions for serially independent risky returns. The solution displays risk taking under shortfall, as well as a specific form of time diversification. Also, for a representative stock-return distribution, risk taking increases monotonically with the number of decision moments given a fixed horizon. This is related to the well-known casino effect arising in a downside-risk and expected return framework. As a robustness check, we provide results for a modified objective with a quadratic penalty on shortfall. An analytical solution for a single-stage setup is derived, and numerical results for the two-period model and time diversification are provided. </jats:p>",

This system, <jats:italic>Ballista</jats:italic>, uses anatomy‐based MLC fields as aperture. It is an alternative for beamlet‐based IMRT. The aim of this study is to include the photon energy in the optimization process. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> <jats:italic>Ballista</jats:italic> uses a fast simulated annealing algorithm to select the optimal configuration of beams with respect to the objectives specified by the planner. To include the energy as a free parameter in the existing overall optimization system, this variable is interpreted by the algorithm as an angle. That is, each eligible energy is assigned to a circular section of the space of all possible solutions. In addition to varying the energy of the individual beams, an option was added to the process which allows associating a combination of energies to various segments of a single field. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The effectiveness of energy optimization has been tested on several sites. The lung cancer has provided good results. The value of V<jats:sub>20</jats:sub>(29.6%vs.35%) is reduced as well as the mean dose to the heart(14.5%vs.21.5%). Also, a better tumor coverage (V95%=97.8%vs.96.6% and IH=1.07vs.1.10) is obtained in the case of a non‐coplanar plan realized with this new approach in comparison with a standard plan (23MV only). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The inclusion of energy gives the optimization process an additional advantage over standard planning, and better close the gap between the optimized approach and the clinical treatment methods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The widespread use of spatial planning tools in conjunction with increases in the availability of geographic information systems and associated data has led to the rapid growth in the exploration and application of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou <jats:italic>Rangifer tarandus caribou</jats:italic> was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the remarkable congruence between the proliferation of community forestry initiatives in North America in recent years and the ascendance of particular forms of neoliberalism. In it I argue that, in the United States in particular, such initiatives are best understood as hybrids between ‘rollout’ neoliberalism and contemporaneous trends in the management of protected areas and state-owned forests. This interpretation contributes to recent arguments that the environment has been understudied as an arena through which neoliberalism has been actively constituted, rather than simply a passive recipient of ‘impacts’. Moreover, surprisingly little academic work has explored the imbrications of specific changes in environmental governance and evolving neoliberalism in the latter's ‘First World’ geographic hearths, such as the USA and the United Kingdom. In this paper I undertake such an investigation with respect to community forestry in the United States. The paper traces the major antecedents, introduction, and institutionalizations of community forestry in the United States, and shows how their conceptualizations and enactments of ‘community’ are structured by hegemonic neoliberal ideas, making community forestry in this context supplementary, rather than oppositional, to neoliberal restructurings. Exploration of the current Bush administration's enthusiastic adoption of central elements of community forestry bolsters this interpretation. Finally, the conclusion draws implications from this case for debates in political ecology. </jats:p>",

This paper investigates the case of France, where water management has been based on a distinctive form of “participatory democracy” for over 40 years. It first analyses how public participation and expert opinion fit into the water-management planning procedure and compares this to what occurs elsewhere in Europe and the United States. It then proposes an operational method for initiating the participatory process with an analysis of the stakeholders' viewpoint at the watershed level. The method, which relies on interviews, is applied to two watersheds located in southern France. The results of the two case studies illustrate how the stakeholders' viewpoint analysis can give access to practical knowledge and experience and to a wider range of perspectives and options. The case studies highlight the idea that the mobilisation of non-scientific (or lay) knowledge, values and preferences can improve the quality of the identification of the issues at stake, the formulation of a generally complex and unstructured problem and the identification of a large panel of alternative solutions. The paper then proposes some recommendations for implementing the provisions of the WFD.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In what ways did Sydney's Gay Games reinvent the Australian nation? In this paper I set out to examine this question by drawing upon the idea that sports and parades of athletes during opening ceremonies have been definitive moments for the Australian nation. I investigate the social terrains or bodyscapes invoked by sporting gay pride during the participants' parade at the opening ceremony and sports venues of the Sydney 2002 Gay Games. This enables insights into whether these spaces subverted the heteronormativity of sporting bodies that are metaphors for Australian national space. I centre my argument within a post-Foucauldian performance theory to consider both lived experience and textual representations of queer sports spaces. This approach advocates a recursive relationship between power, discourse, and critically reflexive, geographically embedded subjects. The ethnographic basis of my findings is participant observation and a time series of in-depth interviews with over forty self-identifying gay and queer males living in Sydney. I extract two overarching themes from the bodyscapes of the games: transcendence and imprisonment. For those actively involved in the making of camp bodyscapes, mimicking the monopoly of the dominant order through the authority of national signification provided by the parade of athletes at opening ceremonies and by sporting bodies offered a transgressive vehicle. However, the pillar of hetero-normative sporting bodies in defining Australian national boundaries survived unchallenged. Sporting gay pride also worked to close rather than to open up a space for discourses about sexuality and national identity to occur. Closure from a mainstream audience occurred by jettisoning the shame that links sport, sex, and bodies. Closure also occurred amongst certain respondents who shunned the games, regarding it as disciplining bodies into ‘normalcy’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For step and shoot IMRT, the combination of high dose rate, multiple beam segments and low dose per segment can lead to significant differences between the planned and delivered dose to the patient. This problem, known as an “overshoot” effect, is the result of current dose servo limitations and is demonstrated by over‐ and under‐dose in the first and the last segment respectively. Segment dose inaccuracy in the range of 10 to 60% of the both segments for 1 monitor unit (MU) per segment irradiated with dose rate (DR) of 100 to 600 MU/min was measured. The object of this study was to find a method for segment dose correction when small MU and high DR are used, and specify the prostate IMRT planning limits for MU/segment and the DR. The reported results were obtained using Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>‐V6 and Varian Clinac 2100 EX linear accelerator equipped with a 120‐leaf millennium MLC. The methodology for correcting dose employs small field segment dose ratio. The segment dose error after correction was measured to be less than 5 % for all dose rates. For prostate step and shoot IMRT a low limit of 1 MU per segment and DR with upper limit of 600 MU/min can be used. The results of this work relate to the agreement between planned and delivered doses of the prostate IMRT.</jats:p>",

The strategy of economy development should follow not only the criteria of economical effectiveness, but also the indexes of ecological stability of the territory.The extent of ecological polarization (measure of landscape stability) is conditioned by the combination of (1) landscape geochemical sensitivity and (2) technogeochemical pressure defined in respective territorial units. With respect to self-cleaning features of landscapes 7 levels of geosystem sensitivity were distinguished and mapped in Lithuania territory. The largest part of the territory is occupied by averagely and more than averagely sensitive geosystems, the least area is taken by relatively insensitive and extremely sensitive geosystems. The technogeochemical pressure was evaluated through the detailed analysis of landscape technomorphological structure. Using the GIS data bases, in the technotopes distinguished the technogeochemical pressure was evaluated according to the area of industrial and built-up territories, agricultural lands, road net density (adjusted by traffic intensity), and dosmestic pollution (assessed according to the population density). Each of the agents was given different weitcoefficients in regard to its pollution emissions. The layer superposition of the geosystem sensitivity and technogeochemical pressure gave the emergence of cartoscheme revealing the distribution of areas with different ecological polarization, divided into 5 tension levels. In order to distinguish the priority territories of land management and optimization the polarization area net and the natural frame of Lithuania were superposed.Knowledge of the ecological polarization areas allows the rendering of recommendations to economy units for their economical activity organization that should be developed considering the means of landscape ecological stability maintenance like increase of forest percentage, formation of geochemical barriers, proper distribution of land use.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore the efficacy of applying Neil Smith's theory of the rent gap to rural gentrification in New York State's Adirondack Park, making three central claims. In the first place, although the underlying impetus for both rural and urban gentrification (namely, the maximization of profit on the part of a variety of gentrifying agents from individual owner-occupants to large-scale developers) is essentially the same, some fundamental differences between the determination of what constitutes ‘undercapitalized’ ground rent in the city and the wilderness leads to subsequent differences in the geographical expression of gentrification in each area. In the second, the unique land-management practices instituted by the State of New York in this region have set up the conditions for a singular type of disinvestment not typically found in the city, rendering disinvestment a central aspect of Adirondack gentrification but in a different way than the disinvestment which anchors Smith's argument. Finally, I argue that the ‘postproductivist’ theories which have recently gained currency in the extant rural gentrification literature are not applicable to the empirical realities of Adirondack land use, suggesting that rural areas themselves may be sufficiently differentiated to render the idea of an overarching, homogeneous ‘rural gentrification’ suspect and pointing to the need for a more refined and specific set of labels to indicate a variety of landscape-specific gentrification models in the hinterlands. </jats:p>",

The DfVHs themselves may also be used to estimate radiobiological metrics such as the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) or probability of tumor control and normal tissue damage. As the concepts of the DfVH and its utility in computing radiobiological metrics are still in development, the purpose of this work was to investigate the interpretation and sensitivities of DfVH curves and subsequently deduced radiobiological estimates by using mathematically defined and perturbed functional image data sets. Factors such as the signal to noise ratio of the functional image, the relationship between signal intensity of the functional image to the number of functional sub‐units in the voxel, and the extent of mis‐alignment of the functional image to the dose distribution all may affect the shape of the DfVH. As a consequence radiobiological metrics, such as the EUD, are also sensitive to these factors and caution is recommended when using these functions as a predictive measure of outcome. Despite this, the simplicity and relative robustness of the DfVH provides an efficient means of ranking the quality of competing treatment plans.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The monochrome paintings of the British Op artist Bridget Riley produced between 1960 and 1965, in common with a number of experimental arts and media practices of the 1960s, were characterised by a drift away from traditional representational techniques towards what are now described as nonrepresentational practices. The dynamics of the Op Art aesthetic and the critical writings that surround it bear striking similarities to much recent work on nonrepresentational thought. Based upon an engagement with Riley's early work, and specifically with the perception and understanding of nature it engendered, an argument can be made that suggests that, despite claims to the contrary, Riley was engaged in a form of representational practice that rendered a new and fashionable understanding of cosmic nature. The multidimensional nature evoked in her aesthetic was designed to be experienced by the viewer in a precognitive, embodied fashion. In this there are strong echoes with the call made by nonrepresentational theorists who operationalise the same kind of cosmology to develop an evocative, creative account of the world. Both Op Art and nonrepresentational thought seem to build upon a shift in the representational register that occurred during the immediate postwar period, one which prompted representational practices which attempted to subjectify rather than objectify, to evoke instability and multidimensionality, and to exercise not only visual, oral, and cognitive ways of knowing, but also the precognitive and the haptic. The complex corelations between representation and nonrepresentation are apparent here, suggesting that it is problematic to emphasise one side of the duality over the other. </jats:p>",

The crux of the issue is; coconut growers who are aware and have the knowledge of the technologies, also seem to be reticent about adopting the package. The question therefore is; why does this happen? This research paper summons the identification of social and ecological elements that surround adoption of innovative technologies in improving coconut production and the kind of strategies for a best fit for a need-based programme of knowledge transfer, facilitating picking up a few technologies for possible adoption. A methodological prime-mover viz., Participatory Rural Appraisal, Planning and Action among coconut growers was used to walk the ‘reality-led’ and ‘technology-driven’ choices that are really acceptable and usable. Yet the farmers/neighbours appeared to be reluctant even to “talk” the “walk”. On the other hand, absence of dependable and sustainable model, lack of confidence, inadequate infrastructure and support systems, including sufficient and timely credit and constant exposure through IT seem to accelerate ‘vagaries’ on coconut for sustainable adoption. The need must, therefore be to polarize the two contrasting positions-appropriate tech-choice vs vagaries of adoption-by a suitable ‘model’ that would serve as a guide to coconut farmers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To improve the total product development process, engineering and production planning processes have to be integrated into one overall workflow. These processes are performed in different application systems, partially with workflow support (e.g. Enovia Workflow) and partially without (e.g. Manufacturing Hub). In order to achieve higher process reliability and performance as well as continuous information flow, the overall workflow shall be controlled by a general-purpose workflow management system (WfMS). Thus, the overall workflow may serve as a base for monitoring, reporting, and process visualization with the goal of managing the workflow execution. In this paper, we present a general approach that realizes the control of the overall workflow in conjunction with the execution of local workflow fragments by heterogeneous application systems. This approach is used to integrate the Dassault Systemes products Enovia V5 and Manufacturing Hub into an overall workflow controlled by the IBM WBI Workflow component. The paper describes how such an integration can be realized for these systems. </jats:p>",

The result is an inevitable march toward privatization of resources abstractly understood and their utilization by individuals as capital. The Third World is allowed to diverge from this inevitability because of its inherent characteristics of subject and space read as fisheries-based community and territory. These different imaginaries of subject and space produce very different prescriptions for economic development; the First World must choose capitalism whereas the Third World might explore other options, albeit at a local scale. Producing alternative forms of fisheries management in the First World, then, requires both a strategy of valuing that which has been relegated to the periphery (for example, community, cooperation, and participation) as well as a blurring of binary categories generally. Undermining the presence of capitalism in the First World and making space for that which has been excluded (for example, community-based and territorial fisheries) requires a new economic and spatial imaginary. </jats:p>",

In parallel, scientific knowledge is expanding and uncovering the interconnectedness of the various processes that support these values. We thus have many wishes and much knowledge but we have to ensure that we have the decision support tools that will pull them together to promote SFM. After a broad review of the evolution of decision support tools in forest management, this paper presents a case for more holistic numerical planning tools. To illustrate that such tools can be designed, we propose a simple decentralized approach. In this approach, a landscape management strategy evolves based on local decisions, integrating spatial and aspatial, multi-period and period-specific goals. Such tools could become a useful platform for sustainable forest management planning. Key words: decision support tools, sustainable forest management, evolution, holistic planning, complexity, cellular automata </jats:p>",

This fact has implications for forest policy, as suggested by an international convention on temperate and boreal forests, commonly known as the Montréal Process. Three canons of law provide a legal basis for subsistence activities by designated social groups in Alaska and Hawaii and by American Indians with treaty rights in the coterminous forty-eight states. A literature review also presents evidence of such practices by people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds throughout the nation. Teleological notions of development espoused by both neoliberal and Marxist scholars suggest that subsistence activities should not persist in a First World setting except as failures of the officially sanctioned economic system. However, alternative economic perspectives from peasant studies and economic geography offer a conceptual framework for viewing at least some subsistence activities as having a logic and values outside of, if articulated with, market structures. Meeting the Montréal Process goal of providing for subsistence use of forests will require research focused on local practices and terms of access to resources as well as their relationship to state and capital processes. We outline the basics of a research agenda on subsistence for an emerging First World political ecology. </jats:p>",

Despite bringing benefits to the nation as a whole, and to the individual local governments, devolution has also had some negative consequences. Although regional disparities were present in the country prior to devolution, their recent rise has coincided with the implementation of devolution. Regional disparities are analyzed in relation to general macroeconomic policies and trends, such as industrial policy and increased trade, and particular socioeconomic features of the Philippines, such as the significance of investments and migration. These policies and trends, coupled with faulty transfer systems and differing levels of efficiency and capacity, suggest that devolution is hampering the pursuit of regional equity. Hence it is concluded that, although many factors are resonsible for the spatial inequities, devolution in its present form plays a direct and interactive part in preserving and/or promoting regional disparities in the country. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because of the excellent soft‐tissue detail provided by MR images, it is the optimum imaging modality for treatment planning target delineation. While the structure of a tumor can be seen in great detail on MR images, the geometric accuracy of the images is limited by the homogeneity of the background field, the linearity of the applied gradients, and the magnetic susceptibility of the imaged tissues. As such, MR images cannot be used alone for novel treatment planning purposes (i.e. MR simulation), or in conjunction with CT because of geometric distortion. Our research seeks to quantify the amount of distortion in 3T MR images due to both background inhomogeneities and gradient nonlinearities on a sequence by sequence basis by using a specialized grid phantom and an in‐house developed software program. The matlab‐based program accurately determines the 3D coordinates of over 9000 control points distributed throughout the phantom's volume. Three dimensional distortion maps can be generated by comparing the control point coordinates determined from an MR scan to the control point coordinates determined from a CT scan. Control point locations can be determined to an accuracy of 0.2 mm and distortions as large as 13 mm have been measured. With appropriate post‐processing correction factors derived from the 3D distortion maps, MR images can be undistorted and either combined or used individually for new treatment planning methods that benefit from the superior soft‐tissue information that magnetic resonance techniques provide.</jats:p>",

The program is consistent with the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 53 guidelines and balances the cost‐versus‐benefit equation confronted by the clinical physicist in a community cancer center environment. Fundamental reproducibility tests are presented as required for a community cancer center environment using conventional and 3D treatment planning. A series of nondosimetric tests, including digitizer accuracy, image acquisition and display, and hardcopy output, is presented. Dosimetric tests include verification of monitor units (MUs), standard isodoses, and clinical cases. The tests are outlined for the Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> TPS but can be generalized to any TPS currently in use.

The purpose of this paper is to describe our recent advances in developing the potential for Cobalt‐60 as a modality for tomotherapy. In particular, we have been advancing forward and inverse planning designed especially for our benchtop delivery configuration, on‐line image reconstruction for Cobalt‐60 CT, and approaches to dose reconstruction. Treatment planning is performed by dose optimization under implicit dose‐volume constraints for a slice using a gradient based inverse algorithm. Although a least‐squares framework is maintained in the explicit objective function for rapid convergence, regional weightings evolve over time to attempt to accommodate dose‐volume constraints. The selection of the appropriate relative region weightings in the objective function is handled internally to improve ease‐of‐use. Simulated plans under a variety of dose‐volume constraints reach reasonable solutions in a matter of minutes. The second area of focus has been in the creation of a CT method that is amenable to the deficiencies of image reconstruction under the inherently limited set of treatment data, while maintaining a high speed of reconstruction necessary for on‐line registration. A one‐step reconstruction method belonging to the class of algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) is being tested and has shown promise in providing a compromise between the limited‐view qualities of iterative ART and the high reconstruction speed of filtered back‐projection.</jats:p>",

Our results indicate that with respect to past processes Quebec's current approach allows certain stakeholders, but not the general public, to have more access to FMP. Comparatively, Ontario and Newfoundland have implemented different, clearly stated, approaches that involve the general public at numerous stages of FMP. Future research should concentrate on how these participatory requirements are implemented and on the public satisfaction with regard to this implementation.

Empirical research is the only means by which to determine the relevance of the bailout problem in each situation. To demonstrate this argument, the author describes an exhaustive analysis of the Spanish case.

This research focuses on the disruption of state boundaries through migration and identity construction. In this paper we utilize elements of transnational theory and stories of First Nations migrants to explore the ways that First Nations urbanization also disrupts boundaries. Colonial perspectives and practices that confined First Nations cultural practices and identities within the physical boundaries of reserves and defined all other spaces as settler spaces created a framework for the construction of the contemporary Canadian nation-state. We present the results of eighteen in-depth interviews conducted with urban First Nations migrants. The interviews focused on understanding how migration to cities shapes relationships to the land (an important element of indigenous identity), the challenges cities present to maintaining connections to the land, and the strategies First Nations migrants use to preserve those connections. By resisting the assignment of First Nations cultures and identities to reserves, First Nations migration to cities challenges the identity of the modern state by disrupting its internal borders and boundaries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The governance of waste in Ireland is highly contentious, with conflicts over many issues ranging from landfill expansion to charges for municipal waste collection. One of the most intense conflicts surrounds plans to introduce, over the forthcoming decade, incineration for municipal solid waste for the first time in the Republic. Such conflicts over waste incineration, and particularly over the siting of waste-incineration facilities, are not new phenomena and they have been examined empirically and theoretically through a range of disciplinary lenses and in different geographical contexts. These studies, although useful and interesting, rarely give close attention to the geographical strategies involved in such conflicts. The author's empirical investigation of incineration conflicts in Ireland reveals the centrality of a dynamic and evolving spatial dimension, both in the governing strategies adopted by the state in support of a system of waste management that involves a commitment to incineration, and in the transnational advocacy coalition approach adopted by antiincineration campaigners seeking alternatives to incineration. The author concludes that the scalar strategies surrounding incineration reveal the need for a more intricate analysis of power, politics, and place in the analysis of conflicts over waste governance, both in Ireland and beyond—an approach that may be more clearly articulated through a geographically informed understanding of governmentality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Neighborhood involvement in urban governance remains a pressing goal in an era of globalization. Cities have instituted a variety of structures to facilitate this involvement, including quasi-formal neighborhood or district councils. At the same time, urban populations are changing rapidly because of multiple dynamics operating at multiple scales. Immigration, for example, continues to transform inner-city neighborhoods despite the emergence of suburban immigrant enclaves. Existing research inadequately addresses the interaction between efforts to organize neighborhood political involvement and the dynamic nature of urban populations. We examine St Paul, Minnesota—a locale with a well-established neighborhood district-council system and a vibrant and rapidly growing immigrant community. Indeed, immigrants from Southeast Asia and East Africa are moving into neighborhoods that up until the early 1990s were predominantly white. Using a multimethod empirical analysis, we argue that the district-council system, while recognizing and empowering local-level organization, fails to provide adequate resources for neighborhoods to address social dynamics that operate at much broader scales. An index of ethnic and racial diversity computed with census data shows that St Paul experienced a significant overall increase in diversity during the 1990s. Although inner-city neighborhoods remained the most diverse, residential areas developed after World War 2 also diversified considerably. Interviews with neighborhood organizers based in part on tabular and cartographic displays revealed a wide variety of strategies and responses to changing ethnic and racial diversity. Predominant, however, was a mismatch between the scale at which demographic change occurs, and the scale of ‘neighborhood’ action embedded within the district-council system. </jats:p>",

This paper traces the institutional evolution of Zhongguancun (ZGC), China's most prominent science and technology park, in the northwestern part of Beijing, in its pursuit of becoming China's own ‘Silicon Valley’. Created during the planned economy, ZGC has traveled a radically different trajectory compared with most high-tech regions in advanced countries. Since the mid-1980s, the area has been able to transform itself from a quiet Beijing suburb designated for scientific research and higher education into a bustling hub of global high-tech business. In this paper I examine the changing patterns of behavior and interaction among the Chinese state, Chinese technology firms, and multinational technology corporations during three different stages of ZGC's development, illustrating the possibility of alternative institutional arrangements and the intricacy of institutional transformation. The paper then compares the formal and informal institutional characteristics of ZGC with those of California's Silicon Valley, signifying its strengths and weaknesses for fostering an innovative environment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Respiratory gating is one way to compensate for organs and/or tumours that are affected by respiratory motion. One approach to respiratory gating is to use the Real‐Time Position Management (RPM) Respiratory Gating System, by Varian Medical Systems, which records the cyclic motion of the chest or abdomen using fiducial skin markers while patients breathe freely. There is conflicting evidence, however, regarding the prediction of internal organ motion with external motion. Moreover, treatment planning is typically based on helical CT scans that are also acquired while patients breathe freely. Consequently, the relative position of the exterior body, the target, and the critical organs at any one phase of a breathing cycle cannot be determined accurately, and the choice of the “beam on” time could lead to error. We have developed a method in acquiring a 4‐D CT data set without the aid of external markers. Instead, the method registers images based on internal correlation at tissue interfaces between two successive respiratory phases. The 3‐D motion of the exterior body and internal organs/tumours can be derived and correlated with the RPM signal if acquired simultaneously. If strong correlation exists, then the set of images can be used for detailed treatment planning to determine the optimal treatment phase of the breathing cycle. Eighteen patients have been imaged with 4‐D CT, and one has been treated with 4‐D CT based respiratory gating. We present our results in the context of the first lung cancer patient in our clinic that was treated with this method.</jats:p>",

To describe the proportion of youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) who are receiving services for medical transitions and to describe which sociodemographic and health care-related factors are associated with receiving transition services.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods. We analyzed responses to questions about medical transitions from the 2001 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN). Parents or guardians of youth aged 13 to 17 years who screened positive for the survey were asked (1) whether they had discussed with health care providers how their child's health care needs might change in adulthood, (2) if they had a plan to address these changing needs, and (3) if their child's health care providers had discussed having their child eventually see a doctor who treats adults. Bivariate and multivariate associations were estimated to identify sociodemographic and health care factors related to receiving medical-transition services.</jats:p><jats:p>Results. Overall, 50% of respondents had discussed their child's changing health care needs with their physicians, although significantly fewer Hispanic youth compared with other youth reported these discussions. Youth who met criteria for a medical home were more likely to have discussed changing needs and to have a plan addressing these needs. Of those who had discussed changing needs, 59% had a plan to address these needs and ∼42% had reported discussing shifting care to adult-oriented providers. Younger teens and non-Hispanic black children were less likely to have discussed changing providers. Fifteen percent of YSHCN met the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's core outcome for medical transitions. A multivariate logistic-regression model found that older age and having a medical home were significantly associated with increased odds of meeting the outcome measure.</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusion. The proportion of YSHCN meeting the medical-transition outcome measure is quite low, particularly for youth from ethnic minorities. Higher rates are seen for older teens and those receiving care within a medical home. Significant efforts will be required to meet the proposed goal of all YSHCN receiving the services necessary to transition to adult health care.</jats:p>",

The study considered implementation and commissioning, dose optimization, and plan assessment. Both systems were commissioned for the same 6 MV photon beam equipped with a high‐resolution multileaf collimator (Varian Millennium 120 leaf). The software was applied to three test plans having identical imaging and contour data. Analysis considered 3D axial dose distributions, dose‐volume histograms, and monitor unit calculations. Each system requires somewhat different input data to characterize the beam prior to use, so the same data cannot be used for commissioning. In addition, whereas measured beam data was entered directly into Helios with minimal data processing, the BrainSCAN system required configured beam data to be sent to BrainLAB before clinical use. One key difference with respect to system commissioning was that BrainSCAN required high resolution data, which necessitated the use of detectors with small active volumes. This difference was found to impact on the ability of the systems to accurately calculate dose for highly modulated fields, with BrainSCAN being more successful than Helios. In terms of functionality, the BrainSCAN system uses a dynamically penalized likelihood inverse planning algorithm and calculates four plans at once with various relative weighting of the planning target and organ‐at‐risk volumes. Helios uses a gradient algorithm that allows the user to make changes to some of the input parameters during optimization. An analysis of the dosimetry output shows that, although the systems are different in many respects, they are each capable of producing substantially equivalent dose plans in terms of target coverage and normal tissue sparing.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

This case study provides a discussion of what a relational construction of the identity of place means in practice. Focusing on country foods—foods that people catch from the land, water, and sky—I describe how the getting of these foods affects Inuit notions of place and constructions of identity and community. Sharing country foods is required in order to ensure future success in hunting and fishing. Such sharing and the social capital it generates were prerequisites for survival in the days when Inuit were living on the land in communities that were constantly changing as people traveled from one location to another in search of food. The move to settlements has brought about changes in Inuit notions of sharing food and ideas about identity. By using a particular event in one Inuit community, I explore the ways in which Inuit have developed a relational sense of identity as a result of the changing places and scales in which they live as occupants of fixed settlements who retain the mores of life on the land. As they call upon different identities, Inuit are invisibly shifting between places. I argue that there is a distinction between a settlement and a community, and that as people adjust to life in settlements they learn to manage their shifting places and shifting identities strategically so that they are able to benefit maximally from the conventions appropriate to both life on the land and life within settlements. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Japan, critical geography has been practised for eight decades: since the 1920s when poverty and the miserable condition of labour and peasants instigated Japanese social scientists to adopt Marxism. The critical heritage began with importing works by German Marxist and soviet scholars, followed by criticism of the geopolitical ideologies that supported the militarist regime and the war of aggression. Besides them, the general orientation of critical geography before World War 2 remained mainly exceptionalist. Critical geographers gained momentum in the course of the democratisation process after World War 2, and they consolidated themselves by forming one of the earliest alternative organisations of geography, the Japan Association of Economic Geographers. Although the trend of exceptionalism persisted, some attempts to theorise critical geography emerged in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Noboru Ueno's work Chishigaku no Genten (The ultimate origin of chorography) (1972, Taimeido, Tokyo), for example, integrated the tenets of Marxism and phenomenology into a theoretical body of Marxist chorography that dealt with alienation of the indigenous fishers from the neighbouring sea, which was polluted with mercury from industrial waste. Yet, the advent of Toshifumi Yada's chiiki kozo ron (theory of regional structure) in 1973 (see Yada, 1990 Chiiki Kozo no Riron [The theory of regional structure] Mineruba Shobo, Kyoto) and its subsequent domination in the circle of once-critical geographers of a younger generation shattered further development of the critical heritage. The general orientation of geographers in Japan has become much more conservative and lost the intellectual power to come to terms with the growing critical trend among international geographers. At the same time, Japanese social scientists outside geography started to adopt the conceptions of critical geography developed abroad, bypassing the Japanese geographers' circle. It was not until the early 1990s that a group of critically minded geographers set out their endeavour to revitalise the critical heritage of geography afresh, to create their own conceptions of critical geography in close association with an international group of critical geographers. </jats:p>",

We maintain that devolution has set in train a series of far-reaching organisational and institutional changes in the various UK territories. Although devolution in the United Kingdom can be described, following Jessop, as an aspect of the ‘hollowing out’ of the state, we argue conversely that the various UK territories are being ‘filled in’ in a number of important ways. The notion of ‘filling in’, we argue, draws attention to the spatially contingent impact of devolution on the various UK territories. We examine this process of ‘filling in’ specifically in the context of the economic governance of Wales. In particular, we focus on the creation of Education and Learning Wales (ELWa) the body charged with improving the education and skills of the Welsh workforce, as well as with encouraging entrepreneurship within Wales. It highlights the need to consider: in an organisational context, the territorial and scalar structure of ELWa and its role in collaborating with other organisations of economic governance; and in an institutional context, the development of a new working culture within the organisation. Given the close associations between devolution and economic governance, we suggest that the success or otherwise of ELWa in overcoming these challenges has the potential to affect the future trajectories, and public and political evaluations, of devolution in Wales. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary </jats:bold> Over the last two decades, recovery plans have emerged as one of the most widespread policy and management responses for endangered species. Often these plans include public and private lands, and the associated government departments and private landholders. Toolibin Lake, in the West Australian (WA) wheatbelt, is a case in point, with a recovery plan focused on an internationally recognized wetland on public land within a predominantly privately owned, agricultural catchment. This paper draws on recent questionnaire and interview‐based research with landholders, to evaluate the influence of the recovery plan on conservation activities. Almost all landholders in the Catchment (93%) are involved in revegetation activities, with the availability of subsidies from the WA Government playing a strong role in adoption and its extent. The main constraints to adopting conservation actions, such as revegetation and fencing remnant vegetation, were cost and logistics. Correspondingly, the greatest incentive was financial inducement. Strengths of the recovery plan were identified as increasing awareness, demonstrating government effectiveness, and making funding available to landholders. The communication efforts by the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), the agency leading the recovery process, were lauded while at the same time the need for improved liaison was noted. Weaknesses were the lack of information and direction from CALM, bureaucracy, limited funding for CALM, and variable adoption across the Catchment. Recovery planning in this Catchment and other similar settings could be improved by a continuing commitment to two‐way communication between all those involved, ongoing recognition of the complexities of the government–community interface in recovery planning, and continuing subsidies for conservation actions on private lands where high biodiversity values are at stake.</jats:p>",

According to urban models which include amenities, environmental quality may influence land rents and location by income in the city. In order to test these relations, average land rents and mean income per district are regressed on distance to the centre and several environmental characteristics, using the instrumental variables method in order to take account of endogeneity. Fourteen environmental variables, representing socioeconomic facilities and natural attributes are obtained from aerial photographs, satellite images, and ancillary data. Their spatial representations are constructed using GIS functions. The empirical results confirm the impact of greenery on location choice and the existence of a higher environmental quality at the periphery than near the centre of the two cities. They also reveal that the impact of environmental quality components on residential location depends on the shape and history of the cities and on the relative scarcity of the environmental attributes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research has shown that Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) has good prospects for cancer detection and staging. Recent advancements in hardware in the form of RF coils and gradient sets have resulted in a good outlook for MRSI to be used in detection, localization, and classification of the lesions. Work done by other groups has shown that merging molecular imaging information from MRSI with anatomic scans used for treatment planning proved beneficial in delineating the tumor volume. MRSI involves defining an MR image volume which can be divided into a matrix of 3‐D sub‐volumes. Spectroscopic data is then acquired for all these sub‐volumes simultaneously. This leads to the quantification and localization of different levels of metabolites such as Choline, Creatine and N‐ acetylaspartate that are highly useful in detecting and possibly staging lesions. We focused on performing MRSI on the brain using a head transmit/receive (T/R) coil. Utilizing a reduced 2‐Dimensional Point Resolved Spectroscopy (2‐D PRESS) Turbo Spectroscopic Imaging (TSI) sequence to improve the spectral resolution of different metabolite peaks and the spatial resolution of the spectroscopic scan, good spectral/spatial information can be acquired revealing more accurate bio‐chemical imaging. Thus, an MRSI study could be easily used for improved treatment planning. Using 3T MRI we have improved the spatial resolution of the MRSI scans to 5×5×10mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/voxel, meanwhile maintaining a good signal to noise ratio. This would increase the spatial relevance of the spectra acquired in the scan and in turn provide more information in the treatment planning phase.</jats:p>",

I argue throughout that conflict in Northern Ireland is underwritten and informed by the imaginative geographies of rival, antagonistic, and sterile forms of sectarian nationalism, and that it is therefore necessary to seek alternative means of conceptualising social space and ‘the city’ which do not rely on narrow cultural categories and arbiters of difference. The text articulates an imaginative reinvention of the city of Belfast which goes beyond the traditional (and problematic) narratives of sectarianism, suggesting that place identity and the urban geographical experience are characterised by fluidity, hybridity, and changing perspectives. </jats:p>",

Chang and Fitzpatrick (IEEE Trans Med Imaging 1992;11:319–329) proposed a distortion correction method (termed the CF method) based on the magnitude images from two SE acquisitions that differ only in the polarity of the frequency‐encoding and slice‐selection gradients. In the present study we solved some problems with the CF method, primarily by modeling the field inhomogeneities as a single 3D displacement field built by 3D cubic B‐splines. The 3D displacement field was applied in the actual distortion direction in the slice/frequency‐encoding plane. To account for patient head motion, a 3D rigid body motion correction was also incorporated in the model. Experiments on a phantom containing an aneurysm clip showed that the knot spacing between the B‐splines is a very important factor in both the final image quality and the processing speed. Depending on the knot spacing and the image volume size, the number of unknowns range from a few thousands to over 100,000, leading to processing times ranging from minutes to days. Optimal knot spacing, a means of increasing the processing speed, and other parameters are investigated and discussed. Magn Reson Med 54:169–181, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Correlations between the PASS scores and achievement were similar for Blacks (median of .70) and Whites (median of .64).

It is shown that NSSDs go well beyond former environmental policy plans, not just in terms of their thematic scope, but foremost because they resemble evolving rather than static strategy processes. Finally, we explore what model of strategy formation may be adequate for the public sector in general. Based on the empirical evidence presented here and by drawing on strategic management theory, strategic public management is proposed as an ideal pattern for strategy formation, which reconciles planning and incremental learning. </jats:p>",

Over a two-year period seventy-nine services adopting a programme of innovative management in local government were studied.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author analyses the performance of the United Kingdom's ‘Renewables Obligation’ (RO) in the context of other renewable energy procurement regimes. Prevailing wisdom suggests that market-based procurement regimes for renewable energy are more cost-effective than fixed-price (‘feed-in tariff’) arrangements. In addition, market-based regimes are thought to favour corporate, rather than locally owned, schemes. However, the analysis in this paper disputes these strands of conventional wisdom. An analysis of the returns to wind-power developers under the British market-based RO and the German ‘renewable energy feed-tariff’ (REFIT) reveals that financial returns per MW of installed capacity are much higher in the case of the market-based British RO than in the German REFIT. On the other hand, there is evidence that cultural factors are a bigger influence on the patterns of ownership of wind-power schemes than whether procurement systems are market based or fixed price. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with modelling variations in the use of health-care services between small geographic areas. A range of potential explanatory variables are identified from a review of previous literature, ranging from social, economic, and demographic factors through access to services, and practitioner characteristics, to new measures of behaviour and lifestyle. Real admissions data for the city of Leeds relating to a variety of services over a three-year period are introduced to calibrate a series of utilisation models. It is argued that the strength of the goodness of fit makes these models potentially useful in the evaluation of resource allocation between service providers. By providing better global models of usage it is possible to examine small-area outliers to highlight areas where revealed demand, or usage, is not reflecting need as much as it should. In particular, this paper demonstrates the importance of lifestyle preferences in modelling the utilisation of health-care services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, various linear source models, for example, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20023-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20023:acm20023-math-0002\" /> RadioCoil™, have been introduced to overcome the shortcomings of traditional “seed” type interstitial prostate brachytherapy implants, such as migration and clumping of the seeds. However, the existing prostate treatment‐planning systems have not been updated to perform dose calculation for implants with linear sources greater than 1.0 cm in length. In these investigations, two new models are developed for 3D dose calculation for a prostate implant with linear brachytherapy sources using the commercially available treatment‐planning systems. The proposed models are referred to as the linear‐segmented source (LSS) model and the point‐segmented source (PSS) model. The calculated dose distributions obtained by these models for a single linear source have been validated by their comparison with the Monte Carlo–simulated data. Moreover, these models were used to calculate the dose distributions for a multilinear source prostate implant, and the results were compared to “seed” type implants. The results of these investigations show that the LSS model better approximates the linear sources than the PSS model. Moreover, these models have shown a better approximation of the dose distribution from a linear source for 0.5 cm source segments as compared to 1.0 cm source segments. However, for the points close to the longitudinal axis of the source located outside the region bounded by the active length, both models show differences of approximately <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20023-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20023:acm20023-math-0003\" />. These deficiencies are attributed to the limitations of the TG43 formalism for elongated sources.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.‐j</jats:p>",
