Each facility produces a single good for a unique market area and demand for the good varies inversely with distance to the nearest facility and increases uniformly over time. Production and transportation cost functions are not assumed to be linear, and it is assumed that market areas are chosen so as to minimise the average cost of producing and transporting unit amount of the good. Conditions relating the demand function to the transportation cost function are given which are necessary and/or sufficient for the size of the market area to decrease over time. It is shown that if the market area has constant size, ‘balanced growth’ occurs if and only if the demand function is of the Pareto type. Finally, the relevance to this analysis of economies of scale is discussed. </jats:p>",

In this light, the Wagner and Whitin forward algorithm with a planning horizon procedure for the dynamic lot size model goes far beyond computational savings. Building on additional results due to Zabel, we develop new planning horizon procedures and near planning horizon procedures. (A brief sketch of how to develop similar results for the production smoothing problem suggests that the basic methodology developed possesses some generality.) We present an extensive empirical study that reports that Wagner-Whitin planning horizons were found for a reasonably small subset of problems within 500 periods, while planning horizons, or at least near planning horizons, were found universally by the modified procedure. (The Zabel procedure was intermediate in power.) The number of periods until a “near” horizon seems to be given empirically by [Formula: see text] for the linear stationary case, where K is the setup cost, h the holding cost, and D the average demand rate. Extensions useful for a broad subset of the general concave cost case are also given. </jats:p>",

This leads to an adaptive spatial-distributed-lag policy model which is applied to the North-west region. The resulting representation is shown to be capable of capturing the temporal and spatial multipliers which govern regional economic evolution. The conditions under which the structure can be identified and its parameters estimated are also discussed. </jats:p>",

It examines, first, a general economic-policy model, and second, existing data sources for the North-west region. The restrictions on the availability of data necessitate the specification of a more limited model of spatio–temporal economic structure. Five equations can be specified: for unemployment, employment, population, migration, and industrial movement, although policy variables are also included. Using the identification criteria and diagnostics discussed in the first part of this series, the lag structure of the model is then specified, and the parameters estimated by a two-stage least-squares procedure. The estimates from this model are then used to comment on patterns of regional dynamics and spatial policy. </jats:p>",

For the epidemiologic study, a two‐examiner system was developed to help overcome the special problems of examining subnormal adults. The data collected in the study had to be flexible enough to allow the analysis of several alternative treatment strategies. Once these alternative treatment strategies were defined, the data from the Experimental Dental Care Project were applied to analyze the effects of using dental teams of varying composition to carry out the treatment. It was found that to meet the dental needs of the group, a team consisting of one dentist, three New Cross auxiliaries and one dental surgery assistant would be 30 % less expensive than a traditional team of one dentist and one assistant. This larger team would also be able to complete the necessary initial treatment in less than half the time that the traditional team would require.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The United States 1972 ‘Pure Water’ legislation (PL-92-500) requires a national effluent standard such that major industries must apply the “Best Available Treatment” to central waste discharges by 1978, and must reduce their waste discharges to zero by 1983. To meet these standards, industries will require increased capital investments and increased operations and maintenance costs for central equipment for pollution. Since these costs are not distributed evenly among all industries, they will have a differential impact on a regional economy. Furthermore, since technological coefficients in the short-run remain fixed, increased costs attributable to improved environmental quality legislation will affect the consumer in the form of inflated prices. A new approach to the tracing through of these inflationary trends in a regional input-output economy is specified, and applied to the regional economy of Corpus Christi, Texas. Results suggest that if environmental policies, even strict ones, are applied on a regional basis, their inflationary impacts are relatively small. </jats:p>",

This data is geographically stored in relation to the state plane coordinate system. For decision making, all pertinent hydrologic, topographic, engineering, cadastral, and other information from separate sources can be automatically mapped as a combined overlay to one of three chosen scales. Land‐use patterns are the input data for iterative analyses of present conditions and simulated future human activities for assessing the environmental impact of proposed multiple‐purpose water resource developments.</jats:p>",
