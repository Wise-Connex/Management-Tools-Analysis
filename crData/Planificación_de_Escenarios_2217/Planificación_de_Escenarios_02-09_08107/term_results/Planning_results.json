This continuum is incomplete because it does not elucidate how local people plan for social transformation within highly restrictive political environments where responses to social activism encompass real physical and social harm. The article draws on historical and contemporary analysis of social change in Indonesia and Malaysia together with a case study from Indonesia to demonstrate that social transformation does occur within environments where overt radical action is dangerous. In these circumstances, it takes a more subtle and nuanced form of collective action, here referred to as covert planning. </jats:p>",

Interest in institutions and general norms in the social and behavioral sciences has led to interdisciplinary cross-pollination. Theories of planning and law occupy a special position because they are rooted in practice. In practice, the main concerns are how institutions are validated in daily policies and how the meaning of institutional norms may change in the course of action. This article addresses how institutions evolve in the practice of planning and law. General norms are evoked, and may be given new meanings, when problems and social conflicts arise. The author investigates how this process plays out in various systems of planning and law.

While there have been a number of reports about transitions in China, the host country, rarely can we find information about Chinese urban planners, the hosts. Rapid economic and social changes left Chinese planners unprepared to confront new issues from day-to-day work to more fundamental problems such as the value of planning in a market economy. This article analyzes challenges facing Chinese planners in the transitional period and provides up-dated information about the planning profession in China. It also adds new materials in a comprehensive sense to the much broader topic, “What do planners do?” </jats:p>",

The sisterhood method is applied to the data collected in a human development survey that covered all rural areas of India in 1994, while the latter method is applied to the data on mortality and fertility rates from India's Sample Registration System. The level of maternal mortality for the early 1980s implied by the sisterhood method is found to be about 15 percent lower than the estimate for the same period derived from the method that uses the data on sex differentials in adult mortality. The estimate for the 1990s from the latter method is consistent, however, with the direct estimates available from the National Family Health Survey and the Sample Registration System. The study also discusses the socioeconomic differentials in maternal mortality implied by the sisterhood data, and spatial and temporal variations in maternal mortality derived from the regression method.</jats:p>",

Results suggest a high prevalence of abortion during adolescence and early adulthood (35 percent of all pregnancies reported). Although most clandestine abortions were performed by a physician or a nurse, the prevalence of abortion performed by nonmedical personnel or using unsafe methods is still high, and postabortion health complications are reported for about one‐fourth of all abortions. Logistic regression models are used to examine the effect of women's, partners', and relationships' characteristics at the time of pregnancy on the odds that a pregnancy will be terminated through abortion. The analysis shows a significant effect of school enrollment, parity, and stability and social acknowledgment of the sexual relationship on the risk of having an abortion. Young men's involvement in decisions and their motivations concerning abortion are also examined.</jats:p>",

The challenge for planning educators is to design a core curriculum that responds to the skills and competencies demanded in practice and to adjust teaching practices and policies to recognize and reward the types of personal qualities sought by employers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Soviet legacy of widespread reliance on induced abortion is of critical importance to reproductive trends and policies in post‐Soviet nations, especially as they strive to substitute contraception for abortion. Using data from two Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 1995 and 1999, this study analyzes and compares trends in abortion and contraception, women's attitudes toward abortion, and their perceptions of problems associated with abortion and contraception in Kazakhstan. Despite an overall decline in abortion and an increase in contraceptive use since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991, abortion has remained a prominent part of the country's reproductive culture and practices. This study shows how abortion‐related views reflect the long‐standing ethnocultural differences between the indigenous Kazakhs and Kazakhstan's residents of European roots, as the latter continue to have significantly higher levels of abortion. The study, however, also reveals the internal diversity among Kazakhs with respect to abortion experiences and views, stemming from decades of the Soviet sociocultural influence in Kazakhstan. In addition, the analysis points to some generational differences in views concerning abortion and contraception. Finally, the study demonstrates parallels in attitudes toward abortion and toward contraception, thereby questioning straightforward assumptions about the replacement of abortion with contraception.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As part of a community‐based reproductive morbidity survey in rural Gambia, the prevalence and association of menstrual disorders with sociodemographic characteristics and other reproductive morbidities, and with knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs concerning menstrual problems were assessed. A questionnaire was administered by a field‐worker and by a gynecologist, who also examined the women. Semistructured interviews were conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in a subsample. Of 607 menstruating women not using hormonal contraceptives, 16 percent complained to the gynecologist of irregular cycles, 14 percent of dysmenorrhea, 8 percent of spotting, and 4 percent of heavy or prolonged bleeding. Each complaint was associated with other reproductive morbidities. A minority of women with menstrual problems had sought health care, and menstruation was revealed to be a highly personal and secretive topic in this population. Menstrual disorders constitute an important unaddressed area of reproductive health service needs in developing countries for which relatively simple and inexpensive therapies are often available. Information, education, and support combined with clinical management of menstrual problems should be core elements of reproductive health programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using a rich panel of data on welfare recipients in Alameda County, California, this article examines the importance of transportation policy variables in explaining the ability of some individuals to find gainful employment. A multinomial logit model predicts the probability that someone found a job as a function of car ownership, transit service quality, regional job accessibility by different transportation modes, human-capital factors, and various control variables. Results show that car ownership and educational attainment significantly increased the odds that someone switched from welfare to work, while transit service quality variables were largely insignificant. Nor was regional accessibility important in explaining employment outcomes, a finding that casts doubt on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Concentration of housing near bus and rail routes appeared most important in stimulating employment. However, improved automobility had far stronger effects on employment outcomes than improvements in transit mobility.</jats:p>",

Incomplete knowledge of geological factors and the performance of equipment and operators gives rise to uncertainty with respect to operational outcomes throughout the construction, installation and operation phases, which in turn influence the project cash flows and eventually the overall profitability of the well project. The aim for high production rates promotes technologically ambitious well designs, i.e. penetration of a high number of reservoir zones or an otherwise challenging section trajectory. Efforts for obtaining smooth and safe operations, on the other hand, motivate simpler concepts. Complicated causal relations and lack of methods for quantifying uncertainty makes risk-based optimisation in the well planning process difficult. This paper describes a modelling approach aiming at improving the basis for decision-making by analysis of the uncertainty involved. Risks identified in a review of experiences from a field on the Norwegian continental shelf are presented. Objectives for a risk-based decision tool are discussed and a modelling framework outlined. Examples of detailed modelling for analysis of selected phenomena, depending on proper pressure control in the well construction phase, are described.</jats:p>",

The prevalence of such infections was moderate, with the majority being endogenous. Few cases of cervical infection were identified, and no clinical or sociodemographic variables proved to be good predictors of such infection. Most vaginal infections could be identified through simple, clinic‐based diagnostic tests, although further research into the cost‐effectiveness of establishing and maintaining these services would be useful. Comparison of the results from laboratory tests and the presumptive diagnosis of the clinician indicate that the current practice of presumptive treatment is leading to significant overtreatment. Use of the World Health Organization flowcharts would reduce the overtreatment of vaginal infection but not of cervical infection. The importance of adapting the flowcharts to local epidemiology is highlighted.</jats:p>",

Using a simple but powerful technique of memetic analysis, it is shown how marketers can unpack how brands are actually positioned in the minds of consumers in terms of their component memes, that is, their “genes of meaning”. A demonstration of the validity and reliability of memetic analysis is given through an investigation of how the notion of “healthy living” is positioned in the minds of consumers. The practical utility of memetic analysis in brand positioning is discussed, and the possibility is raised of using the analytical tool to increase profitability by “memetically modifying” brands with true, unique and compelling consumer values.</jats:p>",

This practice has led to technical successes that may or may not have met all of the operator's desired well objectives. These projects have often been regarded as less than successful from an economic point of view. This regard is partly due to the way that junction construction has been viewed. Junctions are presently classified by looking at the technical differences in how they are constructed, such as TAML levels (Technology Advancement – Multi Laterals)1. Although this method is suitable for looking at junction construction complexity, it does not address directly what the junction does in service. Another approach would be to drive the design using information about reservoir/production requirements. Looking at functional groups of junction features will allow the drilling or completions engineer to make sense of the myriad of available junction systems. This technique can help optimize the multilateral junction type selection for a given project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The process of planning multilateral projects from conception through well design will be discussed with a focus on using a functional classification map to clarify the junction requirements. The Functional Classification Method will assist engineers in comparing equipment options. This comparison is accomplished by, first, defining the reservoir and economic drivers, and, then, by selecting the appropriate junction attributes. Furthermore, the method will provide a process for assembling the data required to prepare the final well design and to prepare precise tender documents. To illustrate this method, recent examples from the Middle East will be presented.</jats:p>",

In this survey, the author examined whether libraries are changing their services in response to these declines. A survey was conducted of ARL heads of reference services. Results show that reference services are responding to changes in statistics and resources by reorganizing, changing staffing levels, adding new services, and eliminating some services that are no longer useful. Librarians are performing more than reference activities, including collection development, and instruction. In addition, services for distant users are becoming more prevalent. Finally, libraries are conducting needs assessments to discover whether their users are satisfied with the current services and collections in their libraries. Areas for further research are explored.</jats:p>",

This paper describes the application of openhole horizontal gravel packing to extended reach wells in a North Sea field. Openhole horizontal gravel packed sections in this field range from 1,200 ft to almost 7,000 ft in length. The key to successfully gravel packing these ultra-long horizontal wells is proper planning and field execution. The initial planning process requires identification of the risk factors associated with horizontal gravel packing. These risk factors are discussed in the paper, as well as techniques available to reduce risk. In addition, this paper describes the extensive well planning process required to design and execute long horizontal gravel packs. Issues such as well path selection, workstring selection, drill-in fluids, well displacement, service tool configurations, rig-site logistics and contingency planning are discussed in detail. Finally, a summary of the gravel packing results achieved to date in the subject North Sea field is presented.</jats:p>",

Planning often fails because of implementation problems often associated with SMEs’ lack of capability to determine and overcome potential barriers to strategic planning. This paper examines the concept of formal strategic planning, presents the findings of a critical analysis of the suitability of formal planning for SMEs, and identifies some of the barriers which prevent effective implementation of strategic plans. Suggests that SMEs that engage in formal strategic planning experience fewer barriers to implementation than those that do not and that subsidiary firms tend to place a greater emphasis on formal planning than independent firms. Indicates that the eight barriers to deployment examined are experienced to a lesser degree by subsidiary firms compared with independent firms. However, the differences are not statistically significant. Suggests that apart from the preparation of written strategic plans by subsidiary firms, there is little transferability from the parent firm of influences that impact on the reduction or elimination of barriers to the deployment of strategic plans. Parent firms may wish to encourage their subsidiary firms to think and act as part of a larger group and to make greater use of the more significant resources of the parent firm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s business, political, and academic situations, people often misunderstand the role of communication. There are many forms of media and advertising. We, architects, architectural companies, or schools of architecture, need to think about how to be seen and known in an over-communicated society and marketplace. We need to create a “position” in the prospect’s mind to grip with the problems of communicating. “Positioning” is all about understanding the psychology of the mind and how we can manipulate perceptions to make whatever we are selling more attractive and unique. It is how we differentiate our product in the minds of our customers and prospects. It is not too hard to get into the mind. The answer is to be the first. If we cannot be the first, we need to find a way to cope with the product or the person who did get there first. Then, we must find the way to maintain leadership by searching for what we do not need and what we do need to do. Also, there are many strategies for staying on the top such as covering all bets, understanding the power of product, establishing multibrands, etc. Nevertheless, the truth is that if we cannot get to the top rung, we should have to admit and we subsequently have to let it go. Then, if we cannot be a leader, how can we position ourselves as a follower. It’s different between being a leader and being a follower. There are many ways to find specific positions not being occupied by anyone else such as size, price strategies, or technology. Finally, how can we play the positioning game; it needs to be carefully justified. To be successful at positioning, we must have the right mental attitude. We need to become an outside-in thinker rather than an inside-out thinker, which requires patience, courage, and strength of character.</jats:p>"

First, an industry perspective matrix is developed to assess the opportunities and threats in the operating environment. Next, a competitive position matrix is constructed, to determine the strength and weakness of the strategic business unit. Then, the two are combined to produce a market situation matrix. Any firm can locate its strategic business unit into these matrices, and thereby assess its current and predicted future position in a given marketplace. This approach is very easy to implement in practice, and provides a clearer assessment of strategic options than any single decision matrix alone.</jats:p>",

FM draws on theories and principles of “people”, “processes”, and “places” of organizations rather than serving cost-cutting competencies and downsizing of organizations only. Considering the national crisis, Facility Management is a valid and sustainable remedy as a tool not as the ultimatum. It would be better recognized and gradually accepted to Thai style of working. Through collective reviews and analyzing some concepts of resource management, the requirement of Facility Management within today’s social contexts, and the principles of Facility Management are introduced in this article. A view of rapidly developing professional field of Facility Management is introduced and referred to its related aspects focusing on the concept of today’s workplace and tomorrow’s workspace to arouse public awareness to become more conscious about what is really happening around individuals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe effects of the process of EU enlargement will be felt in particular in Germany's “new states”, since here the price levels for electricity of industry are on average 11 % higher than in the “old states” (the former West Germany). Once the Czech Republic joins the EU, and following the ending of the so-called “brown-coal clause” (governing the use of brown coal in energy generation), imports of cheap electricity from the Czech Republic will increase and contribute to a fall in electricity prices in eastern Germany. This will in turn be a boon to competitiveness, particularly in such electricity-intensive sectors as the chemical industry. At the latest after 2008, when prices for district heating will also fall following the final depreciation of combined heat/ power units, there will be significant savings affecting the extra costs facing home-owners and tenants, making inner-city housing once again more attractive. This in turn is likely to have an impact on town-to-country (or centre-to-periphery) migration patterns. A fall in the price of electric heating will also favour low-energy construction since electric heating is the most costeffective means of meeting the low heating requirements of such buildings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This paper deals with the problems of forecasting the condition of sewers in a network from a small sample of inspected sewers. Transition functions from one into the next poorer condition class, which were empirically derived from this sample, are used to forecast the condition of sewers. By the same procedure, transition functions were subsequently calibrated for sub-samples of different types of sewers. With these transition functions, the most probable date of entering a critical condition class can be forecast from sewer characteristics, such as material, period of construction, location, use for waste and/or storm water, profile, diameter and gradient. Results are shown for the estimates about the actual condition of the Dresden sewer network and its deterioration in case of doing nothing about it. A procedure is proposed for scheduling the inspection dates for sewers which have not yet been inspected and for those which have been inspected before.</jats:p>",

The overall findings give support to the proposed model and to the role of project planning as a mediator between project uncertainty and project success. However, the results challenge the traditional conception by past IT implementation research regarding the direct negative role of uncertainty in IT projects. This finding may be understood in light of the different manifestations that uncertainty may have for IT projects in developing countries.

Second, the article identifies those research issues in forecasting that must be addressed to better understand the managerial side of forecasting. Managers can improve resource planning by understanding the limitations of forecasts. These limitations are exemplified through several strategic forecasting paradoxes that managers must recognize. The paradoxes suggested here are: first, the most important managerial decisions a company can make are based on the least accurate forecasts; second, the most useful forecast information for resource planning is the least accurate; and, third, the organizations that need the most accurate forecast have the largest forecast error. By recognizing these paradoxes managers can devote their attention to improving the use and implementation of the forecast for better resource decisions. At the same time, future research should focus on broadening the understanding of the role of forecasts in strategic decision making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When one faces the need to plan a climatic test (temperature, temperature-humidity, rain, solar radiation etc.), several options are available. The most frequently implemented option is the use of standards. Often, the use of standards leads to testing programs that do not reflect the system's life cycle, or that prevent differentiating between systems with different life cycles. This is true even for standards that implement the tailoring philosophy. How can climatic tests be tailored to reflect true life time such as 10,000 hours or 100,000 hours? A methodology that makes use of physics-of-failure principles and empirical models provides a more realistic solution to this problem. Using empirical models to describe the environmental loads, and damage accumulation models under different loads, the effects of real life can be simulated and compared with the effects of the simulated testing conditions. The paper describes the use of this methodology. Empirical models are used to describe diurnal thermal and humidity cycles. An empirical model of temperature distribution is applied to determine the duration of exposure to varying temperature during a given life cycle. Several damage accumulation models under cyclic thermal loads are compared. One is a general power model with changing exponents for different materials. An additional model relates to the behavior of solder joints. The application of the models is compared for two different conditions, one for which the different daily temperature changes are considered, and one for which monthly average temperature changes are used to describe the daily conditions for a certain month. To evaluate temperature-humidity tests, models that describe corrosion damage under temperature-humidity and humidity penetration models are implemented to evaluate the effects of the testing conditions, relative to the real life. The advantages and problems in the implementation of the methodology are discussed in the summary of the paper.</jats:p>",

Year 2000 Census data indicate an urban population of 456 million; this is 36% of the total population and is increasing much more rapidly than the overall population. Several factors drive this rapid urbanization and growth of cities and towns: continuing, although diminishing, population growth; migration of rural people, as regulations on rural and urban household registration change; rapid structural shift in employment activities and the decline of farm employment; foreign trade and foreign investment, especially in coastal areas; restructuring of state-owned enterprises and growth of private enterprises and activities; and allocation of domestic funds in fixed assets for urban infrastructure, also concentrated in coastal areas. Key issues for continuing urbanization focus on the capacity of the emerging private sector in parallel with the state and collective sectors to generate new jobs, and the willingness of the central state to reconcile the subsidies and privileges of state-sector urban employees with other recent migrants in cities and towns who do not enjoy the state-sector subsidies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnder the heading “Infill Management”, Berlin now details inner-city building land on the Internet. Since July 2002, information on over 800 publicly and privately owned development sites, covering a total of some 200 hectares, has been available worldwide in interactive form at one single website. A project group set up at the Senate Department of Urban Development has taken on responsibility for the organisational, legal and technical groundwork and for implementing this instrument — referred to as “BLM” (Baulückenmanagement). What has become apparent is that viable solutions are possible, even within a complex administrative structure, if the focus is placed on achieving win-win solutions. In order to ensure that BLM continues in the future to find acceptance among users, it needs to be subjected to continuous evaluation. Moreover, everyone involved in this procedure must receive the necessary training. At a time of a general falling-off in demand for apartment-block construction, the underlying intention is to increase market transparency and to raise interest in Berlin as a place to locate to. An additional purpose of this approach is to support the sale of publicly owned real estate. The cadastral register of building land — introduced in 1998 in the Federal Building Code as an instrument of planning — represents one component of the inner-city development strategy currently being pursued in Berlin. The effective management of building land can, however, only be achieved by joining up housing, business, land and financial policies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Agencies' policies regarding domestic violence and child protection are critical in determining the dimensions of practitioner intervention, including safety planning for women and children. This paper explores the issues identified in research around safety planning where there are domestic violence and child protection concerns which was conducted with practitioners in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in 2001. In particular, the paper focuses on three of the factors that influence practitioner intervention with women and children. These are: definitional understandings of domestic violence and child abuse; child protection legislative changes, including mandatory reporting and domestic violence as a child‐at‐risk category; and the NSW child protection statutory authority's response to domestic violence. The interplay between these factors results in complexities of practice for practitioners as they attempt to maximize women's strengths and minimize risks to children's safety. The resultant inconsistent response to domestic violence and child protection by government and non‐ government agencies suggests the need for domestic violence interagency guidelines.

IT planning effectiveness will depend a great deal on harnessing the knowledge and skills of knowledge workers. This paper looks at a critical variable in determining the extent of utilization of such knowledge and skills, namely the formal reward system in the organization. Four attributes of the reward system; fairness, competency, group performance, and openness were tested for their indirect effect on IT planning effectiveness. Except for competency where the scale did not achieve external validity, the three other attributes of the reward system were found to have a significant impact on IT planning effectiveness by increasing the level of utilization of knowledge workers' knowledge and skills. Implications for the management of knowledge workers are provided in light of the results of the study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> If a project is to be successfully completed, both planning and execution must be properly implemented. Poor planning will not allow appropriate execution and control processes or achievement of the project's targets. The objective of the study reported in this paper is to evaluate the impact of the project manager on the quality of project planning processes within the nine knowledge areas defined by A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) and to determine ways of increasing the effectiveness of the manager's intervention. Participants in the study evaluated their use of the 21 processes that relate to planning, out of the 39 processes required for proper project management. The results of the study reveal risk management and communications as the processes with the lowest planning quality. Poor quality in these areas results when project managers lack the formal tools and techniques for dealing with communications and the functional managers are not equipped with the tools and techniques that will allow them to effectively contribute to the risk management process. Improving quality planning processes requires the development of new tools in areas such as communications, as well as organizational training programs designed for the functional managers. </jats:p>",

After the required multiple reviews, and with some changes, the Standing Committee of the NPC passed the Law on Population and Birth Planning on 29 December 2001, and on the same day President Jiang Zemin signed and promulgated the Law.

The reproductive pattern is shaped by a late onset of childbearing, associated with a rather short reproductive span and large birth intervals. Environmental conditions could explain the particularly late age at menarche of rural girls compared with their urban counterparts, whereas the age at first birth is likely to be under cultural control. The short reproductive span appears to result from a large mean interval between last birth and menopause, which is essentially determined by cultural decisions. The birth intervals, which are longer than in many traditional societies, could be the result of a slower restoration of postpartum fecundability induced by the hard way of life inherent in the Altiplano (including poor sanitary and nutritional conditions and high workload), perhaps aggravated by hypoxia. However, a secular trend in fertility is perceptible, towards earlier menarche, earlier age at first birth, increasing reproductive span and a slight increase in live births and surviving offspring, which is probably the result of a slow improvement in living conditions. The existence of birth control on the one hand, and a total fertility rate averaging six live births among the couples who do not practise contraception on the other, are other arguments against the hypothesis of a low natural fecundity in these Aymara groups.</jats:p>",

Frequently, the buildings of non-Christian religious communities have been portrayed as `alien' and incommensurate with surrounding urban landscapes, and there are numerous cases in which such opposition has had a decisive bearing on the success or failure of plans to develop such sites of worship. However, beyond this geography of exclusion, we have begun to detect a changing attitude in the ways such buildings are positioned in relation to their local urban landscapes. In several cases, new sites of worship have been represented as welcome contributions to the production of multicultural, ethnically diverse cities. In these instances, public bodies and institutions have co-opted such buildings into broader urban policy agendas. Local religious communities have themselves played a defining role in this shift, having become astute actors in the political sphere, adapting to the processes involved in gaining planning permission and financial support. Evidence of this changing geography is provided through case study material from the town of Preston in Lancashire and the city of Leicester in the East Midlands, both in England. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Market-oriented economic reform has led to an increase in social stratification in urban China. The reform of state-owned enterprises has meant that millions of workers have been ‘laid-off’, while the emergence of a private sector is creating thousands of ‘new rich’. Little is known about the spatial implications of the reform. The huge contrast between commercially developed housing estates and dilapidated inner-city areas is easily seen. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of the extent to which urban space is differentiated in postreform China. The main obstacle to this understanding is the lack of small-area demographic data. Moreover, spatial data at a high resolution often remain confidential and hence underutilised. The author uses data from Shanghai's real estate market to examine the spatial differentiation of housing prices, so as to shed light on the transformation of urban space. The pattern identified by the analysis of price distribution and the contribution of the environment to property price is remarkably similar to the mental images of ‘upper end’ and ‘lower end’ that are commonly used in Shanghai dialect. Based on this research, three implications are suggested. First, the foremost impact of housing commodification is the revitalisation of the presocialist spatial division, because the socialist transformation of the built environment is never complete. Second, further sociospatial differentiation brought about by commercial development will be built upon the continuation of urban fabric. Third, privatisation of real estate itself becomes a source of sociospatial differentiation, because through the real estate market households are able to capitalise properties that were not distributed equally during the socialist period. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, architectural design emphasizes high-standard buildings with sophisticated daylighting systems, because harnessing daylight provides both energy savings on lighting and psycho-physical comfort in room space. Daylighting design is a hard problem since its properties—such as lighting intensity and distribution, colors and radiant energy—vary over time. Most problem-solving techniques are forward method and are typically “trial and error” process, attacking problems on the front end first. On the other hand, a problem-solving technique called the inverse method, which seems to be efficient, has been applied in this paper. The paper emphasizes the use of scientific-knowledge computational tools in the later stages of design in an effort to provide optimum choices of design. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for optimal design strategies. A new design process has been created and implemented to increase design process efficiency. In addition to the architectural representation, this paper presents a structured method for defining and evaluating multiple objectives. Lightshelf and its daylighting system parameters are under investigation. Moreover, this work investigated several design problems, GA parameters and processes for improving design results. Results show that a new model using basic genetic algorithm techniques results in shorter design times and greater diversity of solutions.</jats:p>"

Several cantonal spatial planning authorities are working on concepts for controlling mechanisms for cantonal guiding plans which correspond in content and scale to the German regional plans. The present article highlights the case study of the recently developed concept of controlling mechanisms for the guiding plan of the canton of Lucerne.

Based on the 1992 Survey on China's Support Systems for the Elderly, the author uses three levels of economic development as proxies for developmental stages in a study carried out from a geodevelopmental perspective. It is found that intergenerational support in urban China is persistent as far as instrumental support is concerned, and that the level of support follows a U-shaped pattern along the axis of economic development. It is in the mid-developed urban areas that intergenerational support seems the weakest. If the pattern from the less-developed to the developed urban areas reflects a time path, then the suggested trajectory will not lead to a convergence with the old-age support system found in the West. The author concludes that, although some aspects of economic support for the elderly will likely be consistent with modernization theory, the old-age support system in China is, on the whole, likely to diverge from the path seen in the West. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether auditors' identification of risk factors and planning of audit tests is affected by decision aid orientation, i.e., a “negative” focus wherein client risk and its consequences are emphasized, or a “positive” focus where such factors are not emphasized. Specifically, we expect that auditors will identify more risk factors using a negatively oriented risk identification decision aid, but only when engagement risk is relatively high. We address this issue in the context of auditors' knowledge of actual clients, manipulating decision aid orientation as negative or positive in a matched-pair design. Results show that auditors using the negative decision aid orientation identify more risk factors than do those using a positive orientation, for their higher-risk clients. We also find that decisions to apply substantive tests are more directly linked to specific risk factors identified than to direct risk assessments. Further, our results show that auditors with repeat engagement experience with the client identify more risk factors. The findings of this study imply that audit firms may improve their risk management strategies through simple changes in the design of decision aids used to support audit planning.</jats:p>",

Historically, stringent exchange controls prevented profits to emigrate from South Africa. Trade liberalisation necessitates the introduction of transfer pricing legislation to protect the national tax base. Application of transfer pricing in practice is complex, information constraints compel the use of foreign comparables in determining a reward consistent with the arm's length standard, challenging objectiveness and risk adjustment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Through a review of the literature, the author identifies the achievements as well as the deficiencies in the study of China's urbanization and urbanism in the second half of the 20th century. A number of issues that merit scholarly research are suggested and the need for theorization is emphasized. During the last half century, Chinese cities underwent dramatic transformations as a consequence of two major systemic changes. During the first three decades after the socialist revolution of 1949, sustained low levels of urbanization and a brief episode of antiurbanism accompanied centralized planning and city-based industrialization. Since the economic reforms of 1978 Chinese cities have witnessed major economic and spatial shifts away from the socialist patterns. Among the many facets of urban transformation since 1978 are a more heterogeneous urban population, rural – urban migration, spatial reorganization through urban land-use change, new housing development, globalization, suburbanization, polycentric restructuring of urban form, and changes in the spatial/administrative systems of cities. It is argued that, as the Chinese economy is inherently political, political economy perspectives should be foregrounded to enrich our understanding of the complexity of China's economic and urban transformation. In this regard, the continuously powerful and multiple roles of the Party-state as the ultimate decisionmaker, regulator, and participant in the urban economy should be emphasized, despite globalization and decentralization of administrative and fiscal powers from the central to local levels. The Chinese trajectory of urban development is seen as more different from than similar to the experiences of other economies undergoing structural change away from socialism, and context-based country-specific theorization of urban change is called for. More general theories of urban transformation which are applicable to a number of former socialist nations, and which transcend the idiosyncrasies of individual countries, should be developed where possible. A closer engagement among scholars working on the urban development of China and those working on other former socialist countries is necessary if ‘the socialist city’ is to become a firm typology of cities. </jats:p>",

Such a perspective can be effectively pursued through the development of interactive learning environments linking system dynamics (SD) and accounting models, which provide two complementary views of business phenomena. In order to properly support the drawing up of business plans and the evaluation of results associated with their implementation, the use of financial SD models embodying the accounting perspective is recommended. This is likely to enhance a shift in SME key actors' minds, as they will be able to analyse under the feedback view financial variables they are used to frame only through the accounting ‘lens’. The article remarks how the specific features that sharply differentiate SMEs from larger firms discourage any systematic replication of the approaches commonly adopted in bigger companies practice, where SD has been more widely utilised.

Building practice is a complex and collective endeavor, which involves a large number of different parties (knowledge experts, manufacturers, and suppliers), specialized design, and a variety of types of contracts. These collaborative efforts, however, do not necessarily produce a technologically innovative building due to other forces such as economics, preferences, and constructability. Nonetheless, it is clear that some buildings are more innovative while others maintain the traditional conventions. The investigation finds that team competency or ‘relational competence’ of team members to achieve Energy Efficient Innovation (EEI) in buildings depends largely on the commitment of project participants and their collaborative climate, which, in turn, is a function of five interrelated factors: Green alliance and criteria formulation; value-based relationship; feedback cycle; green driver and leadership; and the prospect of future collaboration.</jats:p>"

Using three ‘Western’ media sources, an inventory of news items directly or indirectly related to the ‘downside’ of the economic reforms was generated. A simultaneous analysis of mainland newspapers finds that many of the same themes were reported, although the coverage tends to be thinner and less detailed. Some China scholars have suggested that the Party/state is losing control of the communications system in contemporary China, and the results of this study support such arguments; city-level newspapers are now publishing what is most interesting to their consumers and likely to win them a larger share of the market. The regime still manages the dissemination of sensitive political information, but the parallel dictates of commercialization result in the disorderly and unpredictable circulation of communications messages. Mainland newspapers still steer clear of stories considered too politically ‘sensitive’, but the margins of acceptability have been expanded to include news items that only a few years ago would have been excised. The state maintains control over what is included in the daily news as well as what is excluded, although it is unclear to what extent publishing decisions result from a process of state cooptation and self-censorship, as opposed to specific directives from Beijing. </jats:p>",

The configuration space of such systems is a real algebraic variety whose structure is fully determined using techniques from algebraic geometry and differential topology. This structure is then exploited to design a complete path planning algorithm that produces a sequence of compliant moves, each of which monotonically increases the number of links in their goal configurations. The average running time of this algorithm is proportional to n<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> . While less efficient than the O (n ) algorithm of Lenhart and Whitesides, our algorithm produces paths that are considerably smoother. More importantly, our analysis serves as a demonstration of how to apply advanced mathematical techniques to path planning problems. </jats:p><jats:p> Theoretically, our results can be extended to produce collision-free paths, paths avoiding both link—obstacle and link—link collisions. An approach to such an extension is sketched in Section 4.5, but the details are beyond the scope of this paper. Practically, link— obstacle collision avoidance will impact the complexity of our algorithm, forcing us to allow only small numbers of obstacles with “nice” geometry, such as spheres. Link—link collision avoidance appears to be considerably more complex. Despite these concerns, the global structural information obtained in this paper is fundamental to closed kinematic chains with spherical joints and can easily be incorporated into probabilistic planning algorithms that plan collision-free motions. This is also described in Section 4.5. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We develop a particular approach to the analysis of retailing, one in which the importance of retailers' talk/practice and the connections between talk/practice and its displacement within retail organisations is emphasised. Displacement means that executive talk is not necessarily powerful, but must be reworked, forged anew, in the specifics of particular stores. Retail (executive) talk/practices have to be translated, and this is the source of their potential instability. We use a particular example to illustrate this argument: that of charity retailing. The authors examine how charity retailing has been reimagined and reworked in head offices, and how this is displaced through charity retail chains. We show the instabilities of charity retailers' (head office) talk, particularly with respect to implementation, and argue that charity retailers' ability to effect the changes they seek to make are limited by the copresence in charity shops of multiple understandings of charity which, themselves, map into particular in-store zones: back rooms, front sales areas, and shop windows. These are: charity as gift; acting charitably (towards other deserving cases or causes); and charity as fundrasing. We also reflect on the likely implications of these findings for the charity retail project; the significance of these findings with respect to future analyses of conventional retailing, its talk and practice; and on the complex intersections between talk/practice, discourse, and space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Turin has always been peculiar among Italian cities, because of the long–standing dominance of the Left in municipal politics and because of the massive presence there of the biggest Italian industrial group — the vehicle manufacturer, FIAT. <jats:italic>Torino Internazionale</jats:italic> is a strategic plan currently being implemented by the present Centre–Left majority on the City Council, which is largely representative of local civil society. The plan has the potential to transform traditional governance in the city. This article begins by analysing difference and complentarity between the two notions of ‘government’ and ‘governance’ and attempting the theoretical integration of an institutionalist perspective into analysis of the governance processes; it then goes on to demonstrate that the proper logic of urban government in a governance process is to strengthen and increase the number of exchanges and interactions within policy processes and to integrate them through institutionalization of the urban territory as a setting for such interactions. In the governance of Turin, political regulation seems to be creating linkages between an exchangist–aggregative perspective and an institutional–integrative perspective. These two aspects of governance seem to reinforce each other. The exchangist processes involved in micro–projects tend to consolidate the urban network of actors and the city as a cohesive society, while the institutional aspect of the meta–project tends to structure the setting for, and give meaning to, interactions between urban actors. Thus, the apparent fragmentation of the strategic planning process is strengthening Turin as a collective actor and giving the municipal institution a new, nodal role.</jats:p><jats:p>La ville italienne de Turin a toujours été particulière, à cause de la longue domination de la Gauche dans la politique municipale et de la présence incontournable du plus gros groupe industriel italien: le fabricant automobile FIAT. <jats:italic>Torino Internazionale</jats:italic> est un plan stratégique actuellement mis en œuvre par la majorité de centre–gauche au conseil municipal, laquelle reflète largement la société civile locale. Ce plan a la capacité de transformer la gouvernance traditionnelle de la ville. L’article analyse d’abord la différence et la complémentarité entre les notions de ‘gouvernement’ et ‘gouvernance’ en tentant l’intégration théorique d’une perspective institutionnaliste dans l’analyse des processus de gouvernance; il démontre ensuite que la logique adéquate d’un gouvernement urbain dans un processus de gouvernance consiste à renforcer et accroître le nombre d’échanges et interactions dans les processus politiques, puis de les intégrer grâce à l’institutionnalisation du territoire urbain en tant que cadre de ces interactions. Dans la gouvernance de Turin, la régulation politique semble créer des liens entre une perspective échangiste–aggrégative et une perspective institutionnelle–intégrative, ces deux aspects de la gouvernance se renfor??ant l’un l’autre. Les processus échangistes impliqués dans les micro–projets ont tendance à consolider le réseau urbain d’acteurs et la ville en tant que société cohérente, alors que l’aspect institutionnel du méta–projet structure plutôt le cadre des interactions entre acteurs urbains, en donnant à celles–ci une signification.

To understand the different regional and local strategies of foreign car producers better, the author introduces a classification of FDI in the passenger car industry based on the degree of embeddedness in local economies and relationships to path dependency in the 1990s. The effects of FDI on selective peripheral integration of parts of CEE into the European car production system, as well as the role of Central Europe in the division of labour in the European passenger car industry, are also considered. </jats:p>",

Within this approach, the group Delphi method is employed to help groups of managers undertake SWOT analysis. Fuzzy logic is applied to fuzzify the results of SWOT analysis. Expert systems are utilised to formulate marketing strategies based upon the fuzzified strategic inputs. In addition, guidelines are also provided to help users link the hybrid approach with managerial judgement and intuition. The effectiveness of the hybrid approach has been validated with MBA and MA marketing students. It is concluded that the hybrid approach is more effective in terms of decision confidence, group consensus, helping to understand strategic factors, helping strategic thinking, and coupling analysis with judgement, etc.</jats:p>",

We define ERP competence as a portfolio of managerial, technical and organizational skills and expertise posited as antecedents to improved business performance occurring after an ERP system is operational and functionally stable. To improve responses to changes in markets and products, manufacturers are increasingly adopting ERP systems. However, anecdotal accounts indicate that the realization of ERP's potential benefits is rare. Because of its pervasive influence on manufacturing and business performance, the need for scientifically developed and tested multi‐item scales pertaining to ERP competence is highly relevant to manufacturing strategy research. We follow a two‐stage normative process of scale development. First, we identify a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi‐item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, we further refine and validate the multi‐item scales using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents the results from a pilot study of individualised transition planning (from school to adulthood) for students with learning disabilities in Québec, Canada, an area in which there is currently no requirement to undertake individual transition planning. The authors, Georgette Goupil, of the Université du Québec à Montréal, Marc J. Tassé, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Nathalie Garcin, of Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario and Catherine Doré, of the Université du Québec à Montréal, discuss the content of the plans; the process of preparing them; and the perceptions of parents and school personnel who participated in the study. The results, based on the preparation of 21 individualised transition plans (ITP), indicate that while students had limited participation in their own ITP, parents were pleased with the ITP process. Parents, however, reported several concerns about their child’s transition towards the assumption of adult roles and responsibilities. Analyses of the ITP objectives revealed that few ITP objectives focused on work and leisure skills. Parents and school personnel reported having little knowledge of community options available for the students with respect to residential settings. Finally, parents acknowledged that they had little knowledge and understanding of potential employers’ expectations in relation to work for adults with disabilities. These results are discussed with respect to factors that may facilitate the transition from school to adulthood for students with learning disabilities and will provide interesting points of comparison for those involved in transition planning in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In order to support these comparisons, the authors have used the term ‘learning disabilities’ throughout this article to describe those students who would be identified in the United States as having ‘mental retardation’.</jats:p>",

At the same time, new polarised development patterns are emerging. If we disregard a small number of islands of stability in a demographic landscape otherwise characterised by shrinkage, the pattern emerging is one of spatial clusters with above-average levels of population depletion, attributable both to natural wastage (more deaths than births) and to the absence of major migration streams. In the context of current developments, the losers are in particular the towns and cities. In view of the prevailing economic climate in eastern Germany, disurbanisation processes can be expected to continue unabated over large areas of the territory, with exceptions to this trend only in a few islands of reubanisation, such as the Leipzig and Dresden regions and the city-axis found in Thuringia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n</jats:p>"

Using extensive shop floor data from a medium‐sized commercial firm, we discovered that the ‘messy’ data (i.e. high level of data variance) at the detailed levels often lead to reduced decision maker confidence in the estimates of the learning rates. However, we also found that by applying simple aggregation methods, we could better determine the accuracy of the predicted learning curve rates. Increased confidence in the learning curve estimates is made possible by comparison of regression estimates made at the detailed data level to those made at various aggregated data levels.

The average difference between the two methods of forecasting fees was $466, and a regression line (y=0.43x+407) with an r‐value of 0.54 indicated the strength of the relationship. The differences between methods increased as the cost of treatment increased, due largely to disagreements about the need to restore or replace weak or missing teeth. There is reasonable agreement between TxDENT and the collaborative treatment plans of clinical instructors with their students, which suggests that this computer‐based decision‐support system for screening patients in a standardized way could be a helpful predictor of treatment provided in a dental school clinic.</jats:p>",

Following change detection, pilots had the opportunity to revise these plans. In nearly one-third of trials, pilots failed to revise flight plans, thereby committing a plan continuation error, and were more likely to do so when plan monitoring was inadequate. Overall, more than half of changes went undetected, though detection response times were improved when changes were relevant to the flight planning task or when traffic aircraft were changed rather than weather systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Gliomas are infiltrative lesions that typically have poorly defined margins on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. This presents a considerable challenge for planning radiation and other forms of focal therapy, and introduces the possibility of both under‐treating macroscopic tumor, and over‐treating regions of normal brain tissue. New therapy systems are able to deliver radiation more precisely and accurately to irregular three‐dimensional target volumes, and have placed a premium on definition of the spatial extent of the lesion. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H‐MRSI) has been proposed as an in vivo molecular imaging technique that assists in targeting and predicts response to radiation therapy for patients with gliomas. The evidence that supports the use of H‐MRSI for planning radiation treatment is reviewed, together with the technical requirements for implementing data acquisition and analysis procedures in a clinical setting. Although there is room for improvement in the spatial resolution and chemical specificity obtained at the conventional field strength of 1.5 T, there are clear benefits to integrating H‐MRSI into treatment planning and follow‐up examinations. Further work is required to integrate the results of the H‐MRSI examination into the treatment planning workstation, and to improve the quality of the data using more sensitive phased array coils and higher field strength magnets.

Although AP224 has been accepted as an international standard, there is a surprising lack of compatible software packages in the market. The developed prototype STEP-enabled manufacturing planning system (SMPS) can generate process plans and associated documents from AP224 files automatically, without any user interaction. The system consists of decision logic stored in an external database that makes it generic and compatible with any manufacturing application. A graphical tool is provided for knowledge/logic capture. The system can also accept a feature tree generated using the feature model editor (FME), which has been developed as an add-on to the system. The FME is intended to be a tool for conceptual design of simple components. The FME feature tree is used in the early design stage while the AP224 file generated from the detailed design model is used in the later stages. The prototype system is intended for single-piece machined (prismatic) parts and has been tested with case studies provided by the project collaborators. </jats:p>",

For simple geometries the mean difference was 1% and was as high as 3% for more complicated geometries.

This included integrating spatial information on the radar screen with discrete information (planned sequences of air traffic). Previous research reported improved planning performance and decreased workload in the planning aid condition. The purpose of this paper was to determine the source of these performance improvements. Analysis of computer interactions using loglinear modeling showed that the planning interface led to less repetitive - but more integrated - information retrieval compared with the traditional planning environment. Ecological interface design principles helped explain how the integrated information retrieval gave rise to the performance improvements. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design and evaluation of interface automation that keeps users in active control by modification of perceptual task characteristics. </jats:p>",

The accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy was also assessed when these studies were available. Eight dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma underwent radiographic and MRI of affected limbs. In addition, bone scintigraphy was performed in six dogs and CT examination was performed in five dogs. Two observers jointly measured tumor length on all imaging studies. Correlative gross and histologic evaluation of all affected limbs was performed to determine tumor extent as measured from the nearest articular surface. Results from imaging studies were compared to gross and microscopic morphometry findings to determine the accuracy of each modality for determining tumor boundaries. MRI images were accurate with a mean overestimation of actual tumor length of 3 ± 13%. T1‐weighted non‐contrast images were superior in identifying intramedullary tumor margins in most instances whereas contrast‐enhanced images provided supplemental information in two dogs. Lateromedial and craniocaudal radiographs overestimated tumor length by 17 ± 28% and 4 ± 26%, respectively. Scintigraphy and CT overestimated tumor margins by 14 ±. 28% and 27 ±36%, respectively. MRI appears to be an accurate diagnostic imaging modality in determining intramedullary osteosarcoma boundaries.

        "[40] I think, Council, that I have given adequate proof that I am not to blame for what happened. But my attitude to quarrels over matters like this is such that, though I have suffered a great many other outrages from Simon and had my head split open by him, I could not bring myself to take legal action against him. I thought it preposterous that just because we had been in competition with each other for a lover one should try to have people exiled from their homeland. [41] Then again, I did not think that intent applied to a wound unless the person inflicting it wanted to kill. For who is so foolish as to spend a long time planning to wound one of his enemies? [42] Clearly our legislators did not see fit, just because people happened to injure each other’s heads in a fight, to punish them with exile from their fatherland. In that case they would have exiled a good many people. No, it was for those who having planned to kill people wounded them and failed to kill that they made the penalties so severe. They believed that they should be punished for acts which were planned and intended; if they failed, the deed had still been done as far as their action was concerned. [43] This is a decision you have often reached before now in the matter of intent. For it would be bizarre if, whenever people received a wound as a result of drunken rivalry or horseplay or an insult or a fight over a mistress, for incidents which everyone regrets when they come to their senses, you are to make the penalties so severe and awful that you exile some of the citizen body from their homeland. [44] One thing especially amazes me about his character. I don’t think that the same nature is capable of both love and malicious litigation; the former belongs to simpler souls, the latter to the most unscrupulous. I wish it was possible for me to give proof of this man’s criminality in your court from the rest of his conduct, so that you would realize that it would be far more just for him to be on trial for his life than to place others in danger of losing their homeland. [45] Most of it I shall omit. But I shall mention a fact which you should hear and which will be an indication of his audacity and impudence. In Corinth, after arriving too late for the battle against the enemy and the expedition to Koroneia, he fought with Laches the taxiarch and struck him; and though the whole citizen body took part in the expedition, he was deemed thoroughly undisciplined and wicked and alone of the Athenians he was formally dismissed by the generals. [46] There are many other tales I could tell about him, but since it is not"
