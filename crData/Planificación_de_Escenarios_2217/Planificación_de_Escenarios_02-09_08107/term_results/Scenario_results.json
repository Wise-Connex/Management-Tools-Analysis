      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Well control has always been a very important issue in the oil and gas exploitation business, since it involves money savings, people safety and environment threatening. The advancement of the exploration frontiers from onshore to offshore fields, particularly, deep and ultra-deep waters, has increased even more the relevance of kick control and blowout prevention during drilling operations. Widely used drilling practices have been optimized and re-evaluated, so have new technologies been developed to handle specific issues related to deepwater drilling operations, such as reliable and efficient well control practices. This effort has great importance to some countries like Brazil, which have most part of their oil and gas production (close to 75%) concentrated on offshore wells, about 70% of those reserves are located in deep waters. Regarding such scenario, this article presents a comprehensive and discussed literature review about well control in deep and ultra-deep waters, covering the evolution of the analytical and numerical kick models. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the pressure behavior inside the annulus during a gas-kick circulation out of the well in deep water scenarios. Considerations regarding the effects of wellbore geometry, frictional pressure losses, influx expansion, and two-phase flow models have been implemented in the present model. The analysis of the effect of some important parameters in well control in the surface pressure, such as the pit gain, water depth, mud density and pump flow rate are presented.</jats:p>",

In Mexico, the introduction of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) achieved very good results. Unfortunately, renal disease still affected as much as 95% of chronic renal failure patients and it became a disaster with an annual mortality rate higher than 60%. This was known as the Mexican Model which failed in establishing peritoneal dialysis as the only procedure for treating patients. In order to avoid a similar scenario with the 2 replacement therapies, we created the Official Norm for hemodialysis, and now we are experimenting with an increase from 5% to 20% of hemodialysis patients who are receiving therapy, principally in private units that attend Social Security patients. In addition, the government has established a Council for Transplantation that acts as a regulatory board. In other words, we are in the process of making chronic renal diseases a priority within the National Program.</jats:p>",

A scenario planning approach was incorporated into a new telecommunications service development process in order to understand the uncertainties shaping the future economic, business and technological environments. Understanding the major drivers for uncertainties helped in gaining insight and thereby generated new strategies for reducing risks and taking advantage of opportunities from uncertainty. In order to demonstrate the process and value of the approach, it was applied to a new telecommunications service concept, the Phoneweb service, which allows Internet access through telephones rather than a computer interface. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In order to examine the applicability of ground‐shaking mapping techniques to a near‐field earthquake, a peak ground velocity map of the 1995 Hyogo‐ken Nanbu, Japan earthquake computed from seismic zoning methods that consider the effects of geological conditions is compared with the actual observed intensity map. When computing the ground‐shaking map, the site amplification at each site is calculated in terms of the average shear‐wave velocity of the ground estimated from the corresponding geomorphological conditions. This map shows a relatively good agreement with the observed intensity map. However, the computations provide smaller values for certain disastrous areas of the earthquake, where the effects on ground motion of a deep, irregular underground structure have been reported. The effect of such structures on site response is examined implementing 2D FEM analyses, thereby being also incorporated into the method. Results considering the effect of the irregular underground structure show better agreement with the observed intensity map. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Explicit links are made between particular aspects of the DSS and specific cognitive and collaborative demands they are intended to support. The effectiveness of the DSS in supporting performance can then be systematically probed by creating scenarios that are informed by an understanding of individual and team cognitive processing factors, fundamental relationships within the domain, and known complicating factors that can arise in the domain to challenge cognitive and collaborative performance. This paper introduces a set of explicit artifacts to systematically create such scenarios to provide feedback on the viability of the DSS design concepts (e.g., are the hypothesized positive impacts of the DSS realized?), as well as feedback on additional unanticipated requirements for support. </jats:p>",
