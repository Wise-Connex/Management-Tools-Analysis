Our method will be illustrated with examples.

With the standardisation, comes the promise of the reuse of successful designs for the pedagogical scenarios. However, the uptake of this approach relies on a sound support of the users both at the design phase and at the execution phase and the level to which successful design can be adapted for reuse in both phases. This chapter covers the whole lifecycle of pedagogical scenarios and shows the current level of support one can find in existing Learning Management Systems and tools. It presents also the way to enhance this support through the use of Model Driven Engineering for the design and deployment phase and</jats:p>"

Not only does the design team have to deal with various building blocks, such as hardware, software, service, infrastructure, and policy, but there are communication challenges among team members with different domain-expertise. This research begins with the observation that, at the onset of an amorphous system-oriented project, design teams struggle because they are limited to knowledge of less than 4 W’s of the 6 W’s (Where, What, Who, When, Why, How) rather than detailed functional or structural specifications. The proposed scenario-based approaches enable design teams to effectively deal with ambiguity and to communicate their ideas among the team as well as with customers and managers through a common language. The framework is based on conventional dfX (Design for X), but new methods such as the Scenario Graph, the Scenario Menu, and Dynamic-Customer Value Chain Analysis (D-CVCA) help design teams through the exploration stage of a new system development. The integrated framework guides the design teams in visualizing scenarios, making decisions, and building a sound business model for an amorphous system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern day business, management of uncertainty in the environment has become a vital part in building success. The increasing speed of changes in the field of business and shortening product lifecycles are being discussed right up to the point where these concepts are becoming clichés (e.g., Teece, Pisano, &amp; Shuen, 1997; Wiggins &amp; Ruefli, 2005). The problem of uncertain conditions boils down to the question: how can a business develop reasonable strategies for steering the company in the long run (Mintzberg, 1994)? Strategic planning and decision making in some form or another is seen as an important part of modern corporate management. Traditional techniques and tools have been criticized for being too rigid from the perspective of managing the environment (Mintzberg, 1994; Schoemaker, 1995). In many instances, the analysis that fuels the development of corporate strategies is a snapshot of the surrounding world and does not perceive possible anomalies in the development of situations. In the traditional sense, management is all about knowing the relevant decision parameters and forecasting the result of each decision. In contrast, scenario planning has gained attention as a structured method for interfacing strategic planning with the evolving operating conditions (e.g., Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, &amp; Lampel, 1998; Walsh, 2005). Scenarios are not a single point prediction of a defined time-space in some point of future, and multiple scenarios have conventionally been used to map the borders of plausible futures (Schwartz, 1996; Schoemaker, 1995; van der Heijden, Bradfield, George, Cairns, &amp; Wright, 2002), which aims at avoiding problems that arise if carefully conducted forecast of future business proves to be faulty.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of globalization and internationalization, offshoring processes in the ICT Industry have increased considerably in the software and service sector in recent years due to the cost saving strategies and market entry policies of ICT organizations. Through the heterogeneity of the European ICT sector a regionalization trend regarding host country selection for ICT offshore is, nevertheless, observable. Historical and cultural ties between host and home countries as well as related national stereotypes play an important role in the regionalization process. Moreover, due to favorable EU policies and regulations, off- and nearshoring within the European Union acquire an additional attractive character for some major European producers, such as, for example, Germany. Thus the Eastern European Member States, which already build out certain sectoral specialization in regard to ICT service provision, have benefited from direct foreign investments. Off- and nearshoring also imply risks and hidden costs linked to structural aspects in host countries as well as to the overestimation of cultural and historical nearness. In our chapter we discuss the trends of the internationalization process in the European ICT sector taking into account related risks in off- and nearshore processes. We argue, furthermore, that long-term cooperation and intercultural training, with the support of local and European institutions, should be considered to confrontin a better way the challenges of the internationalization of ICT in Europe.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>The scenario-based reservoir modelling method places a strong emphasis on the deterministic control of the model design, contrasting with strongly probabilistic approaches in which effort is focused on the ‘richness’ of a geostatistical algorithm to derive multiple stochastic realizations. Scenario-based approaches also differ from traditional ‘rationalist’ modelling, which often involves the construction of only a single, best-guess or base-case model. The advantage of scenario modelling is that there is no requirement to anchor on a preferred, base-case model, and it is argued here that selection of a base case is detrimental to achieving appropriately wide uncertainty ranges. Multiple-deterministic scenario modelling also carries the advantage of maintaining explicit dependency between model parameters and the ultimate model outcome, such as a development plan. The approach has been applied widely to new fields, where multiple deterministic reservoir simulations of a suite of static models can be easily handled. The approach has also been extended to mature fields, in which practical approaches to multiple-history matching are required. Mature field scenario modelling, in particular, illustrates the weaknesses of base-case modelling, and delivers a strong statement on the non-uniqueness of modelling in general. Current issues are the need to develop better methodologies for multiple-history matching, and for linking discrete, deterministic, scenario-based outcomes to probabilistic reporting. Experimental design methods offer a solution to the latter issue, and a simple, practical workflow for its application is described.</jats:p>",

The current situation, in which conventional technologies meet the energy needs, is compared to a hypothetical scenario where clean energy vectors, namely hydrogen and electricity, are utilized together with traditional primary energy supply.

In underdeveloped countries, this is particularly important due to the absence of safety precautions. The study was undertaken to increase the public awareness of the need to reduce the morbidity related to this sport. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; This was a prospective study in which all the children &lt;18 years who had sustained head injury due to cricket balls were enrolled. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; The study included 27 children, 26 males and 1 female. Out of these 21 cases of head injury were due to hard plastic cricket balls and the rest were due to conventional cricket balls. In 25 patients, CT scan was done, which revealed a lesion in 21 of them. Six patients required surgery, 3 for extradural hematoma, 1 for acute subdural hematoma, 1 for contusion and 1 for compound depressed fracture. One death occurred in our series. There was no significant difference in the nature of injury sustained by either plastic or conventional cricket balls. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; Head injury due to cricket balls can lead to serious consequences even if an innocuous plastic ball is used in place of a conventional cricket ball. Public awareness apart from safety measures is required so that helmets are worn during playing. Change in the nature of the balls may bring a reduction in the severity of head injury.</jats:p>"

Integral effect tests on the reflood period of a large break LOCA were performed by using the ATLAS facility to help understand the thermal-hydraulic phenomena during the reflood period of a large-break LOCA for APR1400 and for resolving the current safety issues for the APR1400 licensing on the downcomer boiling phenomenon. The present ATLAS Test No. 9 is one of the integral effect reflood tests for investigating the thermal-hydraulic characteristics during an entire reflood period to provide reliable data to help validate the LBLOCA analysis methodology for APR1400.</jats:p>",

Crops are able to cross-pollinate with a number of wild related species and exchange chromosome segments through homoeologous recombination. In this paper, we review a set of cytogenetic techniques that are appropriate to document the different steps required for the stable introgression of a chromosome segment from a donor species (i.e., the crop) into a recipient species (i.e., the wild). Several examples in hybrids and derivatives are given to illustrate how these approaches may be used to evaluate the potential for gene transfer between crops and wild relatives. Different techniques, from classical chromosome staining methods to recent developments in molecular cytogenetics, can be used to differentiate genomes and identify the chromosome regions eventually involved in genetic exchanges. Some clues are also given for the study of fertility restoration in the interspecific hybrid forms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Processing biomass through a distributed network of fast pyrolyzers may be a sustainable platform for producing energy from biomass. Fast pyrolyzers thermally transform biomass into bio‐oil, syngas, and charcoal. The syngas could provide the energy needs of the pyrolyzer. Bio‐oil is an energy raw material (∼17 MJ kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) that can be burned to generate heat or shipped to a refinery for processing into transportation fuels. Charcoal could also be used to generate energy; however, application of the charcoal co‐product to soils may be key to sustainability. Application of charcoal to soils is hypothesized to increase bioavailable water, build soil organic matter, enhance nutrient cycling, lower bulk density, act as a liming agent, and reduce leaching of pesticides and nutrients to surface and ground water. The half‐life of C in soil charcoal is in excess of 1000 yr. Hence, soil‐applied charcoal will make both a lasting contribution to soil quality and C in the charcoal will be removed from the atmosphere and sequestered for millennia. Assuming the United States can annually produce 1.1 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> Mg of biomass from harvestable forest and crop lands, national implementation of The Charcoal Vision would generate enough bio‐oil to displace 1.91 billion barrels of fossil fuel oil per year or about 25% of the current U.S. annual oil consumption. The combined C credit for fossil fuel displacement and permanent sequestration, 363 Tg per year, is 10% of the average annual U.S. emissions of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>–C.</jats:p>",

Four hundred and thirty‐nine samples obtained from 378 meningitis patients were processed by standard procedures. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fluconazole and amphotericin B for the isolates was tested by broth micro dilution and by E‐strip method. Molecular analysis by random amplified polymorphic DNA‐PCR of eight isolates was performed using M13 primer. Cryptococcosis was diagnosed in 35 patients [HIV‐1 seropositive (19) and apparently immunocompetent (16)]. <jats:italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>neoformans</jats:italic> (serotype A and D) was the predominant isolate on phenotypic identification. Three <jats:italic>C. neoformans</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>gattii</jats:italic> were isolated from HIV‐1 seropositive (2) and apparently immunocompetent (1) patients. MIC 90 for amphotericin B and fluconazole were 1 and 8 μg ml<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> respectively. On RAPD‐PCR, less diversity was seen among Indian isolates. AIDS remains the single most important risk factor for cryptococcosis. Rising MIC of the available induction and maintenance drugs is of grave concern.

Routine surveillance and application of molecular typing methods are crucial to know the baseline and existing pattern of cryptococcosis.</jats:p>",

As it is recognized that the regulation governing the loss-of-coolant accident analyses was originally developed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a description of its evolution is presented. When using a realistic evaluation model to analyze the loss-of-coolant accident, different approaches have been used in the licensing arena. The Brazilian regulatory body has concluded that, in the current environment, the independent regulatory calculation is recognized as a relevant support for the staff decision within the licensing framework of a realistic analysis.</jats:p>"

A predicted consequence of climate change is increased pressure on these higher-altitude faunal communities by invasion of lower-altitude species more suited to warmer conditions. The distribution of two such species, the broad-toothed rat (Mastacomys fuscus) and swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) (with the former generally occurring at higher altitude except in Tasmania), were examined using BIOCLIM. Modelled climate change with a 20% reduction in precipitation and a warming of 2.9°C at latitude 36°S (Snowy Mountains) and 3.4°C at 42°S (central Tasmania) suggests that M. fuscus will retreat to higher altitudes. The core areas of R. lutreolus will also contract, but significantly they will also move so that they overlap current core areas of M. fuscus on the mainland. Barrington Tops is the northernmost known location for M. fuscus and is climatically marginal. The recent invasion of Barrington Tops by R. lutreolus and decline of M. fuscus raises the question as to whether the modelled broader range changes will result in greater competition between the invading R. lutreolus and the cool-climate specialist M. fuscus, resulting in the further loss of the latter.\n</jats:p>"

In its role on the team, the University of Virginia conducted research to support the development of detailed regional incident scenarios to provide content for the computer-based simulation tool. The method created to develop the incident scenarios is presented, with clear examples.

Data from actual procedures was also reviewed to analyze the safety of performing plateletpheresis in donors with low hemoglobin and platelet values. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Four hundred sixteen donors were deferred for various reasons among 1,515 screened (27.5%), of which 69.7% deferrals were because of low platelet count (55.8%) and less hemoglobin levels. Among the low platelet count donor group, 20.3% had a count between 141 and 149 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>/L and 41.8% below 120 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>/L. Of the 14% donors deferred for low hemoglobin, 62.1% had values in the range of 11.5–12.4 g/dL with normal mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in most (86.2%) of them. Expected blood loss in each procedure varied between 20 and 30 mL, whereas RBC contamination in the product varied from 0 to 1.6 mL in 538 procedures. There were 176 donations with predonation platelet count &lt;180 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>/L (32.7%). None of the 14 procedures performed on donors with platelet count of 150 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>/L showed evidence of thrombocytopenia or donor reaction. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: Lowering the cut‐off value for plateletpheresis from 12.5 g/dL to 11.5 g/dL has no deleterious effect on donor safety as the blood loss is minimal. One‐fifth deferrals can be reconsidered if the criteria of plateletpheresis donor selection are relaxed for hemoglobin and platelet count. J. Clin. Apheresis, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transportation and land use planning are generally poorly coordinated, and the preferences of the general public are not well integrated into either activity. Appropriate land use patterns that meet the needs and desires of the public and the public sector are difficult to develop because of their extreme complexity and potential for disproportionate impacts on citizens. A structured public involvement protocol was developed to allow large groups of citizens to participate efficiently and effectively in the comprehensive planning process for a moderate-sized town in Indiana and to help in partially overcoming this problem. CommunityViz was used as the visualization tool to help residents understand better the differences between potential land development patterns. Fuzzy set modeling was used to derive the complex interplay of development pattern properties that were most and least preferred by citizens. The development patterns varied by percentage mixture of housing types, percentage mixture of land use types, percentage given over to greenspace, ratio of sidewalk to total paved area, and connectivity of the road network. These five parameters were chosen as the most useful and fundamental measures of differences between development patterns. Citizens’ preferences were derived on that basis. Public input for this town was successfully modeled. Resulting preference patterns were made available to city planners for use in updating their comprehensive plan. This research demonstrates a practical way to involve citizens in an orderly, useful manner in questions of joint transportation and land use planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a fast reactor safety analysis determination of the molten core conditions when it reaches the core catcher plate is one of the main factors after a postulated MFCI event. If large fragmentation and quenching is accomplished in the coolant column no major problems for main vessel attack would occur. If instead, a significant amount of melt would remain as a solid molten cake, potential for lower head penetration would exist. In the present study towards development of a model for core melting and debris settling on to a core catcher plate, early phase of liquid stream fragmentation progression due to hydrodynamic consideration was investigated with woods metal melt water system. The system selected simulates the hydrodynamic physical properties more closely that of liquid UO2-sodium system. Assessment of debris-bed forming characteristics was carried out with different coolant column and different melt temperatures with melt inventories up to 20 kg released from a nozzle of 8 mm diameter. Bed height, debris spread area, jet break up length and repose angle obtained are presented for a melt release rate of ∼ 600 g/s. Only solidified debris constituted the bed for a melt temperature of 100°C and water temperature of 29 °C, with 720 mm water height. The estimated average bed height, bed porosity and heap repose angle were 15 cm, ∼0.6 and 43° respectively. Solidified central columnar lump of height 30 cm was seen for a water column of 360 mm. Relative bed forming characteristics for melt temperatures of 120 °C and 220 °C are also presented. High speed video imaging was taken to assess the stream break up distance and heap formation dynamics. Bulk coolant temperatures close to the melt stream were also monitored. Dependence of particulate debris and bed characteristics on melt temperature, interaction height and melt inventory have been brought out.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Intelligent agents are increasingly being exploited as synthetic role players (e.g., teammates, coaches, and opponents) in scenario-based training (SBT). However, the introduction of intelligent agents into training applications comes with its share of challenges given the unique requirements of each role. In particular, the required level of intelligence depends on the requirements of a particular role. For example, agents performing as \"extras\" in a scene require little or no intelligence, whereas an in situ remediation agent requires the ability to diagnose student deficiencies relative to, for example, the school solution and provide appropriate instruction to remedy the deficiencies. To perform some functions, agents require an understanding of the problem domain; for others, they merely need to understand their own tasks. In some cases, agents need the ability to plan, whereas in other cases they merely need the ability to react. A pedagogical agent that typically interacts with the learner stands to benefit from having a human persona (an avatar) and an instructor-like personality. In light of the foregoing, the implementation of these agents for scenario-based training (SBT) can take a variety of forms and vary in their level of sophistication. This paper presents the various roles that intelligent agents can play in SBT to dramatically lower training costs without compromising training effectiveness. </jats:p>",
