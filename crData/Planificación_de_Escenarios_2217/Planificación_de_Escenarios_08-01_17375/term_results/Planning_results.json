      "abstract": "<jats:p> The modern growth management movement in the United States solidly emerged with the 1972 decision of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, in Golden v. Planning Board of Town of Ramapo. Here, the court upheld a phased development timing ordinance in which the approval of a special permit for residential development was linked to the provision of public infrastructure in accordance with an 18-year capital improvement program. This article examines how the Ramapo officials proceeded, the circumstances in which they operated, the resulting litigation, and the aftermath. It contends that, despite its influence on planning law and practice, the Ramapo system still had significant problems as an instrument of modern planning policy, creating a sprawling development pattern that is often viewed as exclusionary in places with few development options. </jats:p>",

An intellectual movement that romanticized nature as distinct from social processes and a changing political economy made it possible for open space to serve an interventionist role in addressing social concerns. Consequently, open space has been used to address urban concerns of health and sanitation, suburban concerns of exclusionary zoning, and more recently, to protect ecological functions and guide urban development. This has prevented a more thorough examination of the relationship between nature and society. </jats:p>",

However, whether or not an OS-ERP package is the right software for a given organization is a little researched question. Building on the current real options thinking about platform acquisitions, this chapter proposes the five most critical factors to consider when evaluating an OS-ERP package. To adequately do this, a great deal of detail about the current offerings in OS-ERP software is presented, followed by a review of the real options theory and thinking behind using these factors to evaluate OS-ERP options. The international implications of OS-ERP are presented in the “Future Trends” section.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper ventures an examination of the linkages among three worlds—those of land-use theorizing and modeling, and that of policy making and planning—which, despite historical and recent advances, remain comparatively poor and haunted by defective communication and problematic translation between them. It is motivated by shifts that have taken place since the late 1980s in all three worlds, away from ‘classical’ thinking (positivism, reductionism, and linear and static worldviews) and towards complex systems (CS) thinking (alternative epistemologies, holism, and nonlinear and dynamic worldviews). The principal question is whether or not CS thinking, compared to classical thinking, addresses more satisfactorily key policy and planning issues, thus holding the potential to improve communication and bridge the gaps between the three worlds. The issues examined are the representation of the sociospatial system, the land-use change process, and policy and planning intervention. After delimiting each world and the diffusion of CS thinking, the paper investigates how the classical approach and the CS approach fare in handling these issues. The analysis suggests that it is not yet possible to determine which approach is superior. The main points are summarized and CS specific and more general future research directions are indicated. </jats:p>",

Sydney’s high knowledge industry concentration is seen as the product of the city’s commercial leadership, its high share of transnational corporations associated with Sydney’s global economy role, and its high proportion of skilled immigration. Such factors have resulted in a knowledge sector that is concentrated around central and near northern Sydney, and in the formation of several distinct clusters of knowledge-based industries. Case studies of the information technology and telecommunication industry and the multimedia industry suggest that Sydney’s concentration of corporate headquarters has been a key driver of growth in these industries, while the presence of a large pool of computer-based skills has stimulated and fed multimedia development. Metropolitan planning strategies have lacked firm principles for the development of knowledge-based industries. Instead, planning for these industries focused on a series of ad hoc place-specific initiatives that have been much less significant than market forces in supporting knowledge-based development in Sydney.</jats:p>"

With increasing pressure across all sectors, BCM has become an integral part of any effective corporate governance framework. Boardroom executives and senior management are thus now expected to provide an appropriate level of business continuity preparedness to better protect shareholder, investor and other stakeholder interests. The purpose of this paper is to build a link across the 'chasm' that separates the auditee from the auditor. The paper attempts to illuminate understanding about the process undertaken by an auditor when reviewing the BCM process. It details the steps the BCM auditor typically undertakes, and provides practical guidance as to the types of documentation and other supporting evidence required during the process. Additionally, the paper attempts to dispel commonly-held misconceptions about the BCM audit process. Executives, senior management and BCM practitioners will all benefit from the practical guidance offered in this paper, to assist in planning for and surviving a BCM audit.</jats:p>"

Central to our approach is a heuristic algorithm based on a goal-programming/reference-point approach. The algorithm is tested on a small region in the Netherlands. To demonstrate the potential use of the algorithm, a planning problem is defined for this region. An interactive session with a land-use planner is then simulated, to show how feedback from the planner is used to generate a plan in a number of rounds. It is concluded that the approach has potential for the support of land-use problems especially in the first rounds of policy design as long as maps are used to interface between planner and algorithm. It is also shown that computational problems still hinder the achievement of realistic detail in the representation of the plan area. </jats:p>",

This attempt hinges critically upon seven theoretical propositions developed on the basis of seven law and policy relevant determining variables that are manifestations of ways of ‘assignment of rights and liabilities’ for the application of CIT (COTE). This is preceded by an examination of the meaning of seven allocative outcomes or determined variables pertaining to the theorem component ‘resource allocation would (under CIT not) be identical’. A 7 × 7 matrix (with forty-nine cells, each defining a specific research arena) is constructed, and relevant literature is surveyed to map the landscape of Coasian planning research as a step to building a transaction-cost-based research agenda. An example of empirically refutable planning hypotheses is given to demonstrate the usefulness of the propositions and to obtain a glimpse of the applicability of the agenda. </jats:p>",

One of the direct outcomes is the rapid expansion of large cities and the recurring birth of new cities from small towns and rural villages. Clustered construction cranes are popular scenes in many Chinese cities. One of the noticeable city landmarks is the specialized economic development district, such as a hi-tech park, industrial park, commerce park, high-standard apartment complex, and designated port district. Along with the development of these new types of urban blocks, the Chinese policies and practices of urban planning and city design have been dramatically reshaped. This paper, on the basis of our participatory observation of the planning process of the Shenzhen Silicon Peak Software Ecological Park, examines site planning and design of hi-tech parks in China. The paper discusses the seven principles guiding the development of hi-tech parks, and the four implementation strategies directing planning and design practices. It also illustrates the adoption of GIS techniques, the new eco-community planning approach, and the classic Chinese cosmology—harmonious wind and water ( feng shui)—through the case study. The paper concludes with discussion of the changes of Chinese values and practices of urban planning in the context of hi-tech parks in the transitional period. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we investigate a forwardchaining approach to adversarial planning based on the AO*algorithm. The exploration of the underlying AND/OR graph is guided by a heuristic evaluation function, inspired by the relaxed planning graph heuristic used in the FF planner. Unlike FF, our heuristic uses an adversarial planning graph with distinct proposition and action layers for the protagonist and antagonist. First results suggest that in certain planning domains, our approach yields results competitive with the state of the art.</jats:p>"

The paper presents an application of a specific ecological footprinting development, the REAP (Resource and Energy Analysis Programme) tool, to a current policy issue, the promotion of sustainable construction. Using the London Plan of the Greater London Authority as a case study, it considers the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and how it can contribute to policy development. </jats:p>",

First, we start with the optimal planning-graph-based approach, we do a thorough review of the general methods, algorithms and planners and finish with heuristic state-based approaches, both optimal and suboptimal. Second, we discuss the inclusion of time features into a Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) approach. In such an approach, we analyse the possibility of mixing planning with Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), formulating the planning problem as a CSP and leaving the temporal features to a CSP solver. The ultimate objective here is to come up with an advanced, combined model of planning and scheduling. Third, we outline some techniques used in hybrid approaches that combine different techniques. Finally, we provide a synthesis of many well-known temporal planners and present their main techniques.</jats:p>"

However, the bias toward evaluating the process and its social outcomes has resulted in a gap in knowledge of the impact collaborative environmental planning and management has on changing environmental conditions. This article attempts to reduce this gap by presenting a new performance evaluation framework that assesses collaborative environmental planning outputs and outcomes: both social and environmental. The case study of the Habitat Workgroup of the New York—New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program highlights the utility of this evaluation framework in assessing the quality of key outputs; the presence of outcomes (i.e., changes in social and environmental conditions); and observed relationships between process, outputs, and outcomes.</jats:p>",

Many see planning support systems capable of improving the handling of knowledge and information in planning processes. Better handling of knowledge and information could help those involved in planning to handle the ever-increasing complexity of planning tasks. In spite of these potential benefits, planning support systems have not yet become widely used in planning practice. A major problem contributing to the arrear in planning support systems use is the profound miscommunication that exists between planners, planning support systems developers, and researchers. Currently there exists little insight in how to solve this problem and enhance the use of planning support systems. This chapter provides practiceoriented lessons about PSS use. Those willing to apply planning support systems in planning practice may use these lessons to enhance the successful use of planning support systems and the handling of knowledge and information in planning.</jats:p>"

Koolhaas and Mau (1995) argue that planners and, in fact, urbanism are outdated, and that both failed to keep pace with the rapid modernization of urban space. Many studies show that ‘proactive’ planning initiatives related to information and communication technologies tend to appeal to the ill-grounded utopianism of technological deterministic approaches. This chapter aims to explain what has been changing in the world of spatial and urban studies as a response to new patterns of communication supported by information and communication technologies, as well as to shed some light on the challenges posed to planning and governance. This will be done together with the observation of real case scenarios in medium and well-developed cities in Brazil.</jats:p>"

Various software industry studies indicate that over the next five to seven years, interenterprise business relationships, information structures, and processes will evolve dramatically. Enterprises will blend internal production and supply chain processes with those of their external trading partners. Currently, organizations are finding creative ways to mitigate supply chain costs while maintaining operational efficiency. New approaches, technologies, and methodologies are aiding with these cost-cutting measures to drastically reduce supply chain costs and increase customer satisfaction. This chapter discusses the background of supply chain planning and execution systems, their role in an organization, and how they are aiding in collaboration. The chapter concludes with a case study on how a supply chain management system could help an organization be more effective.</jats:p>"

Some of the existing planners use domain-independent search heuristics, and some others depend on intensively-engineered domain-specific knowledge to guide the planning process. In this paper, we describe an approach to combine ideas from both of the above schools of thought. We present Duet, our planning system that incorporates the ability of using hierarchical domain knowledge in the form of Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) as in SHOP2 [14] and using domain-independent local search techniques as in LPG [8]. In our experiments, Duet was able to solve much larger problems than LPG could solve, with only minimal domain knowledge encoded in HTNs (much less domain knowledge than SHOP2 needed to solve those problems by itself).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Distance constraint is a major concern in many spatial analyses. Buffering is one of the proximity techniques in GIS most commonly used to address this constraint. I introduce shape-based point buffering, an anisotropic and variable-distance buffer generation method conformal to the original polygons. In contrast with isotropic fixed-distance buffering, shape-based buffering is defined using a relative distance (percentage) instead of a real unit (for example, meters), and it allows all buffered boundaries to be formed at the same time. The construction and implementation of the buffering method are described below. Three emergency-response scenarios are designed to demonstrate potential applications of this buffering method, including a shape-based fixed-percentage buffer calculation and space distribution, a shape-based variable-percentage buffer region, and a reverse calculation of the task schedule from a probability surface constructed from shape-based buffers. Limitations of the method are discussed. The method has potential applications in emergency preparedness and planning to better address fairness issues when a geographic area must be zoned arbitrarily. </jats:p>",

It is separating itself from related fields such as emergency management, IT, disaster recovery and risk management. But can it attain the status of an independent discipline? And if so, what is, and is not, included in this new discipline? What are the core competencies that should be required of its practitioners? This paper offers an approach to founding BCP as a discipline, but with a narrower demarcation than traditionally accepted. It presents three criteria by which to delineate and ground BCP. It discusses the difference between BCP and the more encompassing 'business resilience', and emphasises the need to clearly choose one or the other of these contexts when discussing certifications, standards and other continuity practices. Finally, the paper outlines areas for future research with an eye to proving the efficacy of BCP, especially to executives and stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public health initiatives have made important but relatively modest gains through individual-level and nonecological health-promotion efforts aimed at increasing physical activity. The previously overlooked built environment is now being considered as facilitating or hindering one's ability to be active. The multiuse greenway is an example of a facility that can support physical activity, but its level of use may be influenced by the accessibility characteristics of the areas surrounding the greenway. In this study, an unobtrusive methodology using GPS and GIS technology was employed to test whether two variables used to measure accessibility, proximity (population density) and opportunities (land-use mixture), predicted the use of greenway segments. The results presented here allow us to confirm that smaller walking and bicycling scales of analysis are better predictors of physical-activity behavior. The results also suggest that solely bringing environmental support for physical activity closer to concentrated areas of population does not necessarily equate to more use. It is important that areas with increased population density have correspondingly increased levels of land-use mixture if increasing physical activity is the goal. </jats:p>",

While providing many useful concepts and insights, previous work tends to treat individuals as atomised decision-making units. This paper argues that it is imperative to think of persons coping with uncertainty about the duration of activities and trips as agents in wider sociomaterial networks or assemblages, at least in studies of how working parents collect their children from school or day care. A framework for understanding this way of coping with uncertainty is proposed, which foregrounds the practical, material, and situational aspects of space–time behaviour. Aspects of the framework are demonstrated through a small-scale study among dual-earner families in the Utrecht region of the Netherlands. </jats:p>",

This analysis focuses on the implications of the choices planners make when they construct projections. Specifically, it examines the impact of length of base period, analyzes the error structure of projection techniques for counties in the aggregate and by size and growth rates, investigates the role of averaging, and compares the performance of trend extrapolation and cohort—component methods. The article concludes by discussing forecast complexity, data quality, the role of assumptions, and other considerations of forecasting in a planning context. </jats:p>",

We describe a method for using property-parcel polygons and property-appraiser tax-roll data to analyze the effects of changes in land use on the exposure of people and property to hurricane flooding in coastal communities in Florida. This method allows us to test the conformity of local government growth-management practices to a state mandate which calls for the limiting of development in hurricane hazard zones. We apply this method to analyze hurricane hazard exposure in Okaloosa County, which is a coastal county located in the Panhandle of Florida. </jats:p>",

The paper distinguishes between three types of forecast: group 1—quantitative analyses which predict that global oil production will reach a resource-limited peak in the near term, and certainly before the year 2020; group 2—forecasts that use quantitative methods, but which see no production peak within the forecast's time horizon (typically 2020 or 2030); group 3—nonquantitative analyses that rule out a resource-limited oil peak within the foreseeable future. The paper analyses these forecast types and suggests that group 1 forecasts are the most realistic. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter is presented especially for the use of practicing planners. Practicing planners, as intended here, are broadly defined and inclusive as a set of local stakeholders. Given the widespread need to develop an active civil society, it is important that representative local actors, and diverse urban and regional stakeholders engage in developing their communities intelligently over sustained long-term futures. Practicing planners in this context include, but are not limited to professional urban and regional planners. Citizens and other professionals, such as business persons, bureaucrats from all levels of government, employees from nongovernmental public organizations and their volunteers, and other individuals all have stakes in, and contributions to make to the development of their city-region in the relatively new context of a globalizing and increasingly knowledge-based world economy and networked society. The chapter, therefore, presents the background to these new development dynamics and it introduces the ALERT model. In the form of a conceptual framework, the model is a planning support system designed for the use of the diverse and wide-ranging stakeholder-planning practitioners who seek to engage planning in the steering of these new technology-enabled and knowledge-based development forces to attained desired outcomes. The ALERT model is not so much directly prescriptive, rather it is directional and relational with the intention that engaged planning practitioners will design and tailor their own planning processes to be responsive to local demand and need. At its best, the model can catalyze and stimulate the stakeholders to invent their own strategies that capitalize on the unique assets and development potential of the locality’s communities.</jats:p>"

The analysis identifies seven main historic patterns of urban form and nine types created in the 1980-2005 period. This recent period was characterized by a proliferation and fragmentation of built landscape types, rapid spatial expansion, and falling densities. These trends raise the question of whether the public sector should more proactively shape urban form. Rural sprawl accounts for much of the land now being urbanized, representing a new planning challenge. The Portland Urban Growth Boundary is found to be effective at limiting this type of development. The New Urbanist neighborhood form is still extremely rare. </jats:p>",

This article offers some starting points for grappling with the difficult task of assessing performance in the area of public service.

In this paper we (a) propose a computational model for the generation of a hierarchy of one of these elements of the city—landmarks—and (b) demonstrate that a set of filter rules applied on this hierarchy derives distinguishing route descriptions from spatial context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The cities that administrators administer, planners plan, and scholars examine are perceptions that represent the absolute city ‘that is out there’. This paper narrates how a new perception of the city based on British town planning, modified within the Empire, was established in Colombo, the former capital of Sri Lanka. It focuses on the interpretation and representation of physical realities in Colombo using the norms imported through the Housing Ordinance of 1915 and later the town planning discourse. The ordinance problematic the living environments of the poor residents, requiring solutions that were not available in Colombo. Instead of solving these, the colonial/imperial planner Patrick Geddes, and the others who followed him, carried town planning to Colombo and kept rewriting its history. The new perception of the city focused the attention of the authorities on a capitalist city, which was lain over the colonial city, marginalizing the poor. In this way the colonial planners taught the Ceylonese urban authorities and planners how to perceive and act on the city from a town planning vantage point. The discourse was not directly imposed or imported, but negotiated between many agencies including the (British) municipal authorities of Colombo, the colonial government, colonial/imperial planners, the newspapers, and other stakeholders. Many changes to this perception were introduced in Sri Lanka after independence, but they do not represent any substantial cultural questioning of this discourse. This is the contribution of this study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The UK's House of Commons Public Services Committee has described the state of performance measurement across the public sector as being data rich and information poor. This reflects the fact that the performance of most public services is extremely complex to measure, and as a result, performance measurement is often limited to those aspects that can easily and expediently be measured. Examining this conundrum, and in particular the processes, impact, and future of performance measurement in planning, provided the basis for research reported in this paper. The research drew from and relates to a profound and complex discussion about how the quality of the planning process per se can be reliably and usefully measured. The paper begins by summarising the results of a wide-ranging literature review in the form of a series of conceptual dilemmas. The objectives and methods of the research are then established, before the key research tool—the analytical framework—is presented. Space does not permit a full examination of the empirical phases of the research, although the results from this work is summarised before the research objectives are once again revisited. These lead, finally, to a suggested new model for measuring performance in planning. </jats:p>",

The measures and indices used are derived from various research disciplines, such as urban research, ecological research, and fractal geometry. The examination was based on an urban land-use survey performed in seventy-eight urban settlements in Israel over the course of fifteen years. Measures of sprawl were calculated at each settlement and were then weighted into one integrated sprawl index through factor analysis, thus enabling a description of sprawl rates and their dynamics over a time period of approximately two decades. The results reveal that urban sprawl is a multidimensional phenomenon that is best quantified by various measures. </jats:p>",

The same distribution was also found in newspaper pages.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two measures of floorplate shape, a measure of universal metric distance and a measure of convex fragmentation, are developed to study the effect of building shells upon the spatial structure of office layouts. Layouts are represented according to the fewest-lines map typically used in syntactic studies, with particular emphasis upon integration, a measure of the minimum directional distance from each line to all others. Integration is of special interest because previous case studies indicate that it has important effects upon space use, behaviors, and organizational functions. The study is not limited to examining how actual layouts relate to actual shells, because of the variety of programmatic and contextual factors that most likely influence such a relationship. To control for other variables, the effect of floorplate shape is assessed by inserting consistently generated theoretical layouts into theoretical, as well as actual, floorplates. The study concludes by showing that the integration of unbiased grids and fishbone layouts is affected by floorplate shape in opposite ways. Thus, the interaction between the spatial structure of layouts and the characteristics of shape is mediated by the principles used to generate the layouts. These findings can be used to evaluate building portfolios. They can also help designers to implement particular organizational programs by working around the constraints imposed by the floorplate shapes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid development of information and communication technologies had a significant effect on contemporary urban and regional planning. Ever since Mitchell (1999) envisaged a vision of ‘E-topia’, a development of robust delivery system for the digital network into knowledge-based urban development has been rigorously challenged. Information and communication technologies are evolving cities from virtual city, which reproduces urban elements inside the virtual computer world, to ubiquitous city, where the ubiquitous computing amongst urban elements such as people, buildings, infrastructure and urban space is available. Nevertheless a strategic ubiquitous city planning is yet to be addressed in an integrated manner by planners and regional analysts because the technologies and applications still need to be fully developed. The Republic of Korea has recently had some experience in developing the ubiquitous city concept and planning principals as a means of knowledge-based urban development. This chapter introduces key ubiquitous technologies, and discusses implications of the ubiquitous city concept into planning and design schemes for knowledge-based urban development in the Republic of Korea.</jats:p>"

In Canada, however, practice in using climate responsive design principles tends to be the exception. Using a case study methodology, this paper explores the application of climate responsive design principles in the commercial redevelopment process in Prince George, British Columbia. Findings indicate that, despite expressed interest in winter city development, professionals and decision makers involved in the development permit process do not possess sufficient knowledge about climate responsive design to apply these principles to everyday practice. More importantly, knowledge about climate responsive design did not appear to be a major consideration in creating or evaluating commercial redevelopment projects. A range of educational, attitudinal, regulatory, structural, and political barriers impede the development of an institutional framework to support the implementation of climate responsive design. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that transition-space-centred organization is the underlying spatial structure for 20th-century Ankara apartments. Diachronic examination of the sample in terms of sectoral differentiation—that is, clustering of spaces based on functional and social requirements, and in relation to the exterior— has identified three groups: (a) the houses from the 1920s with no sector differentiation and one entrance; (b) the houses from the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s with different sectors and multiple entrances; (c) the houses from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with different sectors and one entrance. Viewing these results in relation to an analysis of the history of domestic culture demonstrates that there exists a schism between the historical periods representing social changes and the spatial periods representing the transformation of the Ankara house genotype. </jats:p>",

The proposal of a mass immunization programme against HPV also presents some important ethical dilemmas. This paper discusses these questions within the current context of cervical cancer prevention programmes considering issues of efficacy and the impact of immunization on women and the implications for the current cervical screening programme. We argue that despite the JCVI recommendation to implement a national vaccination programme in the UK, which will undoubtedly save lives, further consideration needs to be given to key concerns about the efficacy of the delivery programme and potential risks associated with this, the additional costs of delivery of such a programme, the challenge of ensuring continued vaccination coverage among the highest risk population, the goals of the vaccination programme and the need to continue cervical cancer screening despite a vaccination programme.

We found that local knowledge was conditioned by a complexity of factors, including the dynamic of actions that develop around the tool and the way of looking imposed by map-based representation. The suggestion being made is that visualization tools, although bringing people closer to the planning process, also disconnect them from their local knowledge base. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a quasi-3D cellular automaton (CA) simulation model of cities. A 2D CA model includes a cell attribute that represents building height information. Dynamic processes are depicted using four parameters: initial building coverage, interaction with adjacent neighborhood, inertia, and noise. These parameters can assume simple economic interpretation. Some combinations of values of the parameters result in cities that experience paths of convergent growth. Some values lead to cities that experience phase transitions. We suggest a typology of resulting urban patterns and note the emergence of spatial clusters of high-rise buildings. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Automakers are now developing alternatives to internal combustion engines (ICE), including hydrogen fuel cells and ICE-electric hybrids. Adoption dynamics for alternative vehicles are complex, owing to the size and importance of the auto industry and vehicle installed base. Diffusion of alternative vehicles is both enabled and constrained by powerful positive feedbacks arising from scale and scope economies, research and development, learning by doing, driver experience, word of mouth, and complementary resources such as fueling infrastructure. We describe a dynamic model of the diffusion of and competition among alternative fuel vehicles, including coevolution of the fleet technology, behavior, and complementary resources. Here we focus on the generation of consumer awareness of alternatives through feedback from consumers' experience, word of mouth, and marketing, with a reduced-form treatment of network effects and other positive feedbacks (which we treat in other papers). We demonstrate the existence of a critical threshold for sustained adoption of alternative technologies, and show how the threshold depends on economic and behavioral parameters. We show that word of mouth from those not driving an alternative vehicle is important in stimulating diffusion. Expanding the model boundary to include learning, technological spillovers, and spatial coevolution of fueling infrastructure adds additional feedbacks that condition the diffusion of alternative vehicles. Results show scenarios for successful diffusion of alternative vehicles, but also suggest that marketing programs and subsidies for alternatives must remain in place for long periods for diffusion to become self-sustaining. </jats:p>",

The approaches meld at local and regional geographical scales. Since the strong community in all three is susceptible to community determinism, I privilege the weak community. The approaches put a renewed emphasis on public and civic spaces, which are moral, social, and physical spaces for the weak community. </jats:p>",

These changes have greatly affected Chinese urban planning, which was initiated in the centrally planned economy. In this paper I attempt an exploration of the underlying concepts of Chinese planning and its approaches for coping with uncertainties within the new social and economic contexts in practice. Xiamen, one of the special economic zones in China, first confronted the concepts of the market economy in development. I select Xiamen as a case study to assess and to illustrate existing Chinese planning to aid the market economy learning process. I find that different planning approaches have been applied by local politicians and planners to cope with the changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Regional planning agencies often project future income at the neighborhood level to determine future needs for transportation, jobs, social services, and amenities. Despite a decade of methodological advances regarding the importance of spatial autocorrelation in altering or reducing the reliability of regression estimates, few forecasters have tried to include such spatial relationships in their neighborhood-level projections. Part of the reason is that controlling for spatial autocorrelation is complex and can require expensive software. The authors use a free and user-friendly software package to estimate spatial effects in forecasting and then show how to develop and utilize proxy variables that can mitigate such autocorrelation. They illustrate how the failure to include such controls in Southern California could lead to overestimates of income in poor areas and hence a tendency to underserve needy areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recognition of the value of landscapes, environmentally, economically, and to quality of life—and, importantly, the embedding of these concepts in legislation such as the European Landscape Convention—has led to the need for an ‘objective’ assessment of these values and the potential impact of changes to them. But studies relating preference information to metric analysis of planimetric viewsheds have so far provided only limited explanation of preference. It has been suggested that this is due to the effect of perspective on the visual topology of the view generating different metrics in perspective from those on the flat map. The completion of the Pan European Study under the EU Framework 5 Visulands project provided a large sample of preference responses to a limited number of computer-generated simple landscape scenarios. As such this is an ideal opportunity to test the significance of perspective on metric correlation with preference. This paper considers the degree to which metrics are altered by a panoramic or viewshed analysis, and the significance of this for any correlation with the preference scores. The implications for the role of the respective media in planning are considered, including that of 3D visualisation as a means for eliciting opinion on landscape preference. </jats:p>",

However, actual implementation often depends on local governments that control land use. How, if at all, did two Atlanta Regional Development Plans (RDPs) influence local government policies? Interviews and comparisons of regional and local policies reveal that the RDP planning process clearly and causally influenced voluntary local comprehensive plans, but not subsequent local land-use regulations. However, the RDPs served other functions, such as data provision. Thus, it is useful to incorporate a communicative evaluation approach to examine the broader functions of the planning process, rather than strictly examining the conformance outcomes of the plan policies. </jats:p>",

In order to help to develop urban growth strategies based on coherent empirical results, this paper presents a ‘commuting spectrum’ approach as an alternative to existing job–housing relationship measures. With this approach, two hypothetical and extreme commuting possibilities are conceptualized as measures for job–housing relationship and location-choice sets. Simulation in a stylized region and empirical results for Boston and Atlanta indicate that the proposed method can track local and regional aspects of job – housing relationship changes. The revealed association between commuting length and the job–housing relationship is consistent from the perspectives of neighborhood-level comparison, multiyear comparison, and interregion comparison. </jats:p>",

We propose the use of entropy as a function of the diversity of solutions that can be generated within a design space. This work demonstrates that the potential of design systems to generate novel solutions can be estimated using complexity measures. This principle is implemented in an evolutionary system for the design of automotive instrument panels that display situation-relevant information in configurations that adapt to traffic conditions and driving actions. This sample application shows that the application of complexity maximization as a selection criterion in evolutionary design systems yields a large variety of solutions of high fitness. We also present guidelines for future developments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We argue that the social networks and activity-travel patterns of people interact and coevolve over time. Through social interaction, people exchange information about activity-travel choice alternatives and adapt their latent and overt preferences for alternatives to each other. At the same time, social networks are not static: new social links emerge and existing social links may dissolve in time, depending on activity-travel schedules and the attributes of persons. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework to incorporate these dynamics in microsimulations of activity-travel patterns. A core assumption of the proposed theory is that the utility that a person derives from social interaction is a function of dynamic social and information needs, on the one hand, and of similarity between the relevant characteristics of the persons involved, on the other. Furthermore, persons tend to adapt their preferences so as to increase the utility they derive from their social networks. We derive the theory and models from basic principles and discuss results of a first round of simulations conducted to examine the behavior of the model. We argue that the model is consistent with existing theories and findings in social network analysis. </jats:p>",

Utility-maximizing models have been prominently used, but these models may be misspecified owing to their unrealistic assumptions. As an alternative, this paper proposes cut-off models based on the satisficing heuristic founded in bounded rationality theory. The go-home decision of pedestrians in Wang Fujing Street, Beijing, is taken as an example. Results of a multinomial logit model and three cut-off models with increasing complexity are compared. The results show that the cut-off models can fit the data equally as well as the multinomial logit model, suggesting that satisficing heuristics not only have theoretical advantages but also statistical power. Introducing a decision engagement module before the satisficing decision module significantly improves the cut-off model and supports the hypothesis of a hierarchical decision process. </jats:p>",

Urban renewal project selection means the identification of the most cost-beneficial projects (the projects that will produce most cost benefit) in order to maximize the net benefit to the public and to allocate resources most efficiently. In order to evaluate different urban renewal projects, a hierarchical network model based on various factors and the interactions of factors is presented. By incorporating experts' opinion, a priority index can be calculated for each urban renewal project studied, and a performance ranking of urban projects renewal can be generated. In this paper an improved urban renewal project selection methodology, which reflects interdependencies among evaluation criteria and candidate project using an integrated approach, is suggested. Finally, we introduce a method of solution through an empirical real-world urban renewal project selection example on an ongoing decision-making project in Taichung City, Taiwan using ANP – ZOGP. The results provide guidance to the government regarding strategies for accepting orders for redeveloping urban environments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Corridor planning problems are challenging because their solution often requires the participation of multiple stakeholders with different interests and emphases. Though such problems fall into the domain of multiobjective evaluation, existing corridor location models often search for a single global optimum by collapsing multiple objectives into a single one using a weighting method. In multiobjective problems with competing objectives, however, optimality will often have different interpretations among decision makers, and, as a consequence, no single optimal solution will satisfy all participants. This paper describes the design and implementation of a multiobjective genetic algorithm for corridor selection problems (MOGADOR). This new approach generates a large set of Pareto-optimal and near-optimal solutions that can be evaluated with respect to the untargeted or imprecisely modeled characteristics of ill-structured corridor location problems. Experimental results suggest that the MOGADOR approach outperforms traditional shortest-path methods in both computation time and solution quality. An analytical and visualization tool is provided to help decision makers identify good candidates and evaluate trade-offs among alternatives. </jats:p>",

We consider a model in which an agent's choice is directly influenced by the percentages of the agent's neighbors and socioeconomic peers that make each choice. The model also accounts for shared unobserved attributes of the choice alternatives in the error structure. We address nonglobal interactions explicitly within different social and spatial network structures, combining advanced econometric estimation with computational techniques from multiagent-based simulation, and we present an empirical application of the model using pseudo-panel microdata collected by the Amsterdam Agency for Traffic, Transport and Infrastructure. Additional heterogeneity is introduced in the model through different mechanisms, such as individual-specific sociodemographic characteristics of the agents, individual-specific attributes of the choice alternatives, and the availability of alternatives. We conclude by highlighting limitations of our present study and recommendations for future work. </jats:p>",

Activity logs from trip surveys combined with transit-route and land-use information are used to fit discrete-choice models of how riders choose among multiple paths to downtown destinations. The work illustrates (1) how the quality of pedestrian environments along transit egress paths affects transfers inside a transit system, and (2) how the impedance of transferring affects egress walking path choices. The use of GIS techniques for path-based spatial analysis is key to understanding the impact of pedestrian environments on walking behavior at the street level. The results show that desirable pedestrian environments encourage transit riders to choose paths that are ‘friendlier’, even if they involve more walking after leaving transit. Policy implications for land-use planning and transit service planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>E-planning is the e-government concept applied to urban and regional planning. It is the widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially the Internet, in the planning system. A planning portal is the access point in the Internet, frequently in the context of a public digital city project. E-planning allows the municipality to carry out a new set of activities or to implement traditional procedures in a new form, due to geographical information systems, computer aided design and database systems, among other tools mentioned, for example, in Mohamed, Meng, and Abdullah (2003), Budthimedhee, Li, and George (2002), Campagna and Deplano (2004), and Harrison and Haklay (2002). E-planning corresponds, therefore, to the passage from a paper-based urban management system to one based primarily on electronic means of information and communication. But it must be seen as more than a simple transfer to a computer system of the traditional paper based routines (Mohamed et al., 2003; Parsol, 2004), requiring also the re-engineering of procedures, the development of a fully integrated ICT back office and, as Harrison et al. (2002) suggest, changes in the nature of the planning process itself. The aims of e-planning, such as more generally all the other components of e-government (for example, OECD, 2003; Pascual, 2003), are to provide better public services, more efficiently, with lower costs and, at the same time, to do that through more participative, transparent and more accountable decision-making processes. In its more basic level, the e-planning system only offers information and is, therefore, easier to implement. In its more advanced versions, where all or most of the planning services are delivered electronically, its implementation and daily management is not only a more complex task but it also involves more investment, as Couclelis (2004) notes for digital cities. According to the standards of e-Europe, the European Union (EU) initiative for the information society (CEC, 2000, 2002), the availability of public services online can be measured in relation to a framework of four levels of e-government maturity (CEC, 2004). Applying this scheme to the planning sector, we can consider that the first level—information—consists only in the publication of digital information through the Internet, with few or no capacities to interact. In the second level of maturity—interaction—users of the system can communicate directly with the planning department by electronic mail (one-way interaction); it is possible to download planning applications, for example. In the third level—transaction—users and the planning department communicate electronically with each other (two-way interaction); it is possible to process planning applications and to authenticate them. In the fourth level—integration—there is a full electronic handling of all planning functions.</jats:p>"

Models of this type are applied extensively to the study of travel behavior, residential location, and employment decisions, among other topics of interest. A notable characteristic of the underlying economic theory is the assumption that individuals seek to maximize utility on the basis of their personal attributes and the attributes of the alternatives available to them. This approach ignores the interrelated nature of decision making in social situations—in other words, the role that social structures play in shaping behavior. In this paper we describe a multinomial discrete choice approach to analyzing individual behavior in social situations where position in a social network may encourage or discourage different courses of action. By means of a simulation example, we explore some properties of the model, in particular the effect of network topology. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Access coverage is important in public transit planning, as this is the means by which service is provided to riders. In fact the proximity of demand (population and employment) to stops or stations on the network to a great extent explains its greater or lesser usage by potential users. Coverage of service areas can be delineated by GIS through the creation of buffers around transit facilities based on Euclidean (straight-line) distance. A second method is based on calculations of distances along a street network (network distance). The choice of the distance calculation method affects significantly the final results in terms of population covered. This paper assesses the overestimation of the straight-line-distance method, which is the most widely used in coverage analysis, by comparing it with that of network distances. It investigates systematically the factors influencing this overestimation, such as the density of stops or stations, the coverage distance thresholds and the characteristics of the area analysed (street-network design, barriers, and population distribution in the neighbourhood of the bus stop or station). Finally, it concludes that the network-distance method provides systematically better estimates of transit ridership than the Euclidean distance method. </jats:p>",

After two decades of neoliberal economic policy, it is possible to examine how political-economic actors in subnational spaces have responded to vastly new conditions. I provide an account on how regional economic-development policy and planning has reappeared in Auckland in the postrestructuring period. By deploying relational – institutional and poststructural perspectives in the examination of key policy initiatives that coconstituted an emerging regional economic intervention trajectory, I discuss how economic governance has been assembled, assess its structural coherence and directionality, and analyse the role of the state. I argue that regional governance processes are characterised by contingencies, patterns of institutional experimentation, and, increasingly, the work of central state actors. What is not known to date, however, is whether new regulatory structures are having any major material effects on the course of New Zealand's largest regional economy. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, it has seldom been an essential part of performance measures for policy evaluation from the viewpoint of individuals' quality of life (QoL). The objective of this study is to develop an integrated evaluation method of accessibility, QoL, and social interaction which contributes to the evaluation of land-use and transport policies for livable and sustainable urban development. In this paper, based on quantification of the weights of multielements of QoL, we develop a QoL-based accessibility measure and a QoL performance measure to address appropriate policies of land-use transport coordination and integration by disentangling the mismatch between real urban structures and people's demand for QoL. Furthermore, we explore embryonic ideas for the development of a generalised framework of QoL evaluation, incorporating social interactions and institutional design which link the QoL concept with quality of space and quality of procedure. </jats:p>",

An empirical case of Erie County, New York tests the hypothesis that people belonging to different racial groups have access to different neighborhood food destinations. Using multiple methods—Gini coefficients and Poisson regression—we show that contrary to studies elsewhere in the country there are no food deserts in Erie County. However, like other studies, we find an absence of supermarkets in neighborhoods of color when compared to white neighborhoods. Nonetheless, our study reveals an extensive network of small grocery stores in neighborhoods of color. Rather than soliciting supermarkets, supporting small, high-quality grocery stores may be a more efficient strategy for ensuring access to healthful foods in minority neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Construction initiation (CI) of floor area is an important socioeconomic and physical characteristic of urban structure and its evolution. Despite its importance and the availability of CI data, it has not attracted significant attention until now. Since the 1970s, the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality and Israel Central Bureau of Statistics have collected annual CI data pertaining to residential and nonresidential categories for subquarters. This paper presents an analysis of the spatial evolution of the city of Tel Aviv in the years 1976–2003, from the CI perspective. Novel aspects of this research are related to autocorrelation analysis CI patterns in individual years versus annually accumulated construction and in core versus noncore build up categories. It is shown that floor-area additions form relatively complex spatiotemporal patterns that are not referred to explicitly in existing urban studies of Tel Aviv. Autocorrelation results suggest the superimposition of current almost homogeneous or random spread over earlier phases of core area domination: the formation of uniform choice space. These random patterns represent primarily spontaneous residential regeneration processes since 1990, and major diffusion of the commercial and public activities beyond the central business district areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cellular automata (CA) can reproduce global patterns and behavior from local interactions of cells and they are used increasingly to simulate complex natural and human systems. Among their attributes are their computational simplicity and their explicit representation of space and time. However, the classic definition of CA limits their application to problems that involve a discrete space, and similar rules and neighborhoods for all cells. In addition, the standard raster-based CA model is sensitive to spatial scale. This paper presents a new vector-based geographic cellular automata model, called the VecGCA model, which defines space as a collection of irregular geographic objects. Each object has a geometric representation (a polygon) that evolves through time according to a transition function that depends on the influence of neighboring polygons. In this model, the neighborhood is defined as the region of influence on each geographic object, and the neighbors are all geographic objects located within the region of influence. An innovative aspect of the VecGCA model is that the procedure allows geometric transformation of objects. The area of a polygon (representing an object) is reduced in the region that is nearest to the neighbor that exerts an influence on it, and the area of that neighbor is increased accordingly. The proposed model was tested with real data and compared with a raster-based CA model to simulate land-use changes in an agroforested area in southern Quebec, Canada. The model was validated using two land-use maps, produced from satellite Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, which were acquired in 1999 and 2002. The results obtained show that VecGCA can represent well the dynamics in the study area through an adequate evolution of the geometry of the geographic objects which are independent of the cell size, whereas, to generate similar outcomes in the raster-based CA model, a sensitivity analysis must be conducted to determine which cell size is needed. The geometric transformation procedure introduced in the VecGCA model executes the change of shape of a geographic object by changing its state in a portion of its surface, allowing a more realistic representation of the evolution of the landscape. </jats:p>",

Assessment in the form of criticism is carried out in the design studio, where students acquire skills and knowledge, forge judgments about their design outcomes, and get feedback from their instructors. This study focuses on the assessment of creativity in design problem solving. The major objective of this research was to test to what extent architects and design students share the same conceptions of creativity, and how similar they are. Contrasting differences were found between the two groups. While architects focused on innovation aspects, students paid more attention to operational aspects, such as dealing with design requirements. It is maintained that handling these differences by means of intervention programs in the design studio may promote the acquisition of design processes and procedures by the students, and also that, it will contribute to bridging the gap between the way teachers and students perceive and evaluate design creativity. </jats:p>",

There is a growing need for compatibility between datasets to map, evaluate, and monitor areas in a consistent manner. The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) Land Cover Classification system (LCCS) is a proposed method to enable interoperability for land-cover data and an attempt to open the classification black box for scrutiny. The FAO LCCS is used to demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of feature-based classification methods and how some important improvements, based on theoretical developments in geographic information science, can extend LCCS to become a ‘boundary object’ that supports representation, negotiation, and analysis of dynamic and heterogeneous classification systems. The suggested improvements also include an outline of how future classification activities could be developed into a distributed web-based ontology infrastructure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities grow—their shape and size—will have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growth—that is, transportation routes, land use, and topography—were directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study site—St Louis, Missouri—to predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naïve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naïve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the models' performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth. </jats:p>",

The main hypothesis of the data collection effort is that individuals' travel behavior is conditional upon their social networks; that is, a key cause of travel behavior is the social dimension represented by social networks. With this hypothesis in mind, and using survey and interview instruments, the respondents' social networks are collected using an egocentric approach that is constituted by the interplay between their individual social structures and their social activity behavior. More explicitly, individuals' networks are a context within which to elicit social activity-travel generation, spatial distribution, and information communication and technology use. The resultant dataset links aspects, in novel ways, that have been rarely studied together, and provides a sound base of theory and method to study and potentially give new insights about social activity-travel behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new modelling framework for the study of the dynamics of urban systems is proposed. We generalize the notion of cellular automaton, using continuous variables to describe the state of a cell. The time evolution is given by Poisson-distributed stochastic jumps corresponding to urban interactions, with intensities depending on the configuration of the system in a suitable set of neighbourhoods. These interactions result from decision processes of populations of cognitive agents modelled in the framework of fuzzy decision theory. The behaviour of agents is driven by goals and constraints, partially defined using a fuzzy logic formalization of a real estate appraisal method based on the evaluation of the attractiveness of a terrain for different land uses. Randomness of the dynamics is a consequence of the fuzziness of these decisions. Hence the model can be seen as a multiagent system with sound mathematical foundation. For example, the use of a continuum-valued state space enables us to prove that the expectation of state variables verify a system of differential equations, and thus to study the system from a dynamical systems theory perspective. In this paper we present the theoretical setting, leaving the applications to a second paper. </jats:p>",

The study compares ‐ for lecturers and students ‐ nine variables of organisational effectiveness. These nine dimensions are derived from Cameron (1978; 1981; 1986). Factor analysis was used to validate the scale developed by the researcher. For internal consistency and reliability, the Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient and item total correlation were applied. A questionnaire was administered to a total of 207 people in health management departments in Turkey. In analysis of the data, descriptive statistics and the <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐test were used. According to our research findings, at individual university level, <jats:bold>lecturers</jats:bold> found their departments more effective than did their <jats:bold>students</jats:bold>. The highest effectiveness was perceived at Baskent University, a private university. The best outcome was achieved for ‘organisational health’, and ‘the ability to acquire resources’ achieved the lowest outcome. Effectiveness overall was found to be moderate.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Children's school travel mode is changing, especially away from walking and bicycling and towards private automobiles. Simultaneously we see warning signs from a public health standpoint as children are becoming less active. It has been suggested that walking and bicycling to or from school could help shift this trend, moving it towards greater activity, and researchers are therefore exploring choices of school-trip mode in relation to the pedestrian friendliness of the built environment. Mode-choice models are generally framed as multinomial logit (MNL) models. However, the limitations of MNL models can cause unrealistic effects when walking and bicycling are included with motorized modes. In this paper the focus is on accounting for individual-specific heterogeneity, since different children or families may have very different tastes or tolerances, such as travel time, when it comes to choosing between driving a private automobile, taking the school bus, bicycling, or walking to or from school. The results show that such heterogeneity exists, and that it is more important for nonmotorized modes than for the motorized modes. The results show that accounting for correlation across modes leads to more realistic marginal rates of substitution (cross-elasticities) across modes—in particular, an increase in the walking distance negatively affects the probability both of walking and of bicycling.</jats:p>",

Minimizing the travel cost and keeping spatial continuity with capability constraint are the convergent objectives of this algorithm. The algorithm partitions an entire residential area into a number of spatial units to handle the unevenness of demand, and employs a shift insertion mechanism to reduce travel cost and to improve the spatial continuity of service areas. A series of experiments and scenarios has been conducted for the city of Memphis, USA, to validate the proposed algorithm. Comparative experiments under different constraints show that the proposed algorithm is a feasible solution for delineating service areas. Various application circumstances (for example, travel-cost calculation methods and the granularity of available demographic data) are discussed to evaluate the algorithm's feasibility. The proposed algorithm can be applied not only to delineating service areas of existing shelters but also to optimizing location allocation of new shelters or other facilities with similar characteristics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops and applies neural network (NN) models to forecast regional employment patterns in Germany. Computer-aided optimization tools that imitate natural biological evolution to find the solution that best fits the given case (namely, genetic algorithms, GAs) are also used to detect the best NN structure. GA techniques are compared with more ‘traditional’ techniques which require the supervision of experienced analysts. We test the performance of these techniques on a panel of 439 districts in West and East Germany. Since the West and East datasets have different time spans, the models are estimated separately for West and East Germany. The results show that the West and East NN models perform with different degrees of precision, mainly because of the different time spans of the two datasets. Automatic techniques for the choice of the NN architecture do not seem to outperform selection procedures based on the supervision of expert analysts. </jats:p>",

Taking advantage of AB simulation, an individual space–time activity-based model (ISTAM) is presented which integrates the infectious-disease evolution process, individual activity patterns, and stochastic infection model.

A cross-sectional survey of 142 occupational therapists who provide short-term rehabilitation in five northeastern states was undertaken.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS. Most occupational therapists (n = 137, 96.5%) fell into one of four clusters, with the largest cluster (n = 86, 60.6%) having positive perceptions about ethics and independent professional judgment but negative perceptions about economic issues. Smaller clusters of occupational therapists were more positive about economic issues or less positive about ethics and independent professional judgment. Negative perceptions about the ability to implement evidence-based practice spanned all clusters.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSION. American Occupational Therapy Association's efforts to educate occupational therapists about ethics appear to be effective. Most occupational therapists exercise independent professional judgment but perceive economic limitations when developing intervention plans. Practicing occupational therapists need additional research to support evidence-based practice and help in accessing and using research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Understanding the stop-making behavior of commuters is important for planners and policy makers in their efforts to improve travel demand models and to develop transportation demand management strategies. Previous studies have identified various determinants of commuters' stop generation. However, the way in which accessibility affects stop-making decisions is not clear. Further, few studies have considered the impacts of attitudes and predispositions, which extensively influence travel behavior. Using 1256 commuters in Northern California, this study investigates the influences of accessibility and attitudes on evening commute stop-making behavior. Based on a bivariate selection model, we found that the propensity of workers to make stops is dependent on their attitudes, work-related attributes, neighborhood accessibility, and sociodemographic characteristics, whereas the frequency of trip chaining is primarily determined by sociodemographic characteristics. Accordingly, if we offer commuters opportunities to stop through land-use and transportation policies, they may tend to do so, but the intensity of chaining behavior depends on household needs, the individual's role in the household, and personal time constraints. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid progress in information technology (IT) has moved computing and the Internet to the mainstream. Today’s personal laptop computer has computational power and performance equal to 10 times that of the mainframe computer. Information technology has become essential to numerous fields, including city and regional planning engineering. Moreover, IT and computing are no longer exclusive to computer scientists/engineers. There are many new disciplines that have been initiated recently based on the cross fertilization of IT and traditional fields. Examples include geographical information systems (GIS), computer simulation, e-commerce, and e-business. The arrival of affordable and powerful computer systems over the past few decades has facilitated the growth of pioneering software applications for the storage, analysis, and display of geographic data and information. The majority of these belong to GIS (Batty et al., 1994; Burrough et al., 1980; Choi &amp; Usery, 2004; Clapp et al., 1997; GIS@Purdue, 2003; Golay et al., 2000; Goodchild et al., 1999; IFFD, 1998; Jankowski, 1995; Joerin et al., 2001; Kohsaka, 2001; Korte, 2001; McDonnell &amp; Kemp, 1995; Mohan, 2001; Ralston, 2004; Sadoun, 2003; Saleh &amp; Sadoun, 2004). GIS is used for a wide variety of tasks, including planning store locations, managing land use, planning and designing good transportation systems, and aiding law enforcement agencies. GIS systems are basically ubiquitous computerized mapping programs that help corporations, private groups, and governments to make decisions in an economical manner. A GIS program works by connecting information/data stored in a computer database system to points on a map. Information is displayed in layers, with each succeeding layer laid over the preceding ones. The resulting maps and diagrams can reveal trends or patterns that might be missed if the same information was presented in a traditional spreadsheet or plot. A GIS is a computer system capable of capturing, managing, integrating, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced information. GIS deals with spatial information that uses location within a coordinate system as its reference base (see Figure 1). It integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities distinguish GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events, predicting outcomes, and planning strategies (Batty et al., 1994; Burrough et al, 1980; Choi &amp; Usery, 2004; Clapp et al., 1997; GIS@Purdue, 2003; Golay et al., 2000; Goodchild et al., 1999; IFFD, 1998; Jankowski, 1995; Joerin et al., 2001; Kohsaka, 2001; Korte, 2001; McDonnell &amp; Kemp, 1995; Mohan, 2001; Ralston, 2004; Sadoun, 2003; Saleh &amp; Sadoun, 2004). </jats:p>"

Because parameter estimates are updated sequentially, this approach seems very promising in user-centred design and data collection systems. The application of such networks however poses several questions, related to speed of learning, sample heterogeneity and discretionalisation of the parameter space. This paper reports the results of a series of numerical simulations which were conducted to gain more insights into these operational decisions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The aviation industry has faced significant economic and environmental challenges over the past 20 years. Increased public concern regarding protection of the environment from the impacts of transportation has prompted governments to seek voluntary and regulatory measures to manage the various modes of transportation. Canada, as a global partner, has responded to the challenges of airport environmental management with a balanced approach between voluntary and regulatory measures. Through the development of environmental management plans and procedures, airports and carriers have been able to reduce negative impacts on air, water and soil and respond to challenges concerning aircraft de-icing fluids, greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions. This paper provides an overview of environmental issues facing the Canadian Government and aviation industry, management procedures utilised to manage these issues, and environmental management challenges of the future. It will focus on examples of a water quality issue through the management of de-icing fluids. It will also provide an overview of the management of GHGs and air pollutants through a voluntary agreement.</jats:p>"

Many problems can be defined in terms of a basic state space model, but more general problems require an expressive language for talking about the topology and connectivity of the system, which are outside the scope of standard planning languages. In this work we introduce a general framework for defining planning languages for networked systems, with capability to express properties of connectivity and topology of such systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> So far, the literature on Internet adoption by retailers has paid little attention to spatial variables. Using data on approximately 12 000 independent retailers, we investigate the geographical diffusion of Internet strategies in the Netherlands. In particular, we examine to what extent Internet adoption differs among shopping centers, cities, and regions, while accounting for organizational variables. Results suggest that independent retailers at city and village centers are more likely to adopt information-only and online sales strategies than independents located at shopping centers at the bottom of the retail hierarchy. Furthermore, independent retailers in large(r) cities have a higher probability of adopting the Internet than their counterparts in small(er) cities. On the regional level, the likelihood of Internet adoption is higher for independent retailers in core regions than for independents in the periphery. Thus, geography seems to matter for Internet adoption by independent retailers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Human spatial behavior and experience cannot be investigated independently from the shape and configuration of environments. Therefore, comparative studies in architectural psychology and spatial cognition would clearly benefit from operationalizations of space that provide a common denominator for capturing its behavioral and psychologically relevant properties. This paper presents theoretical and methodological issues arising from the practical application of isovist-based graphs for the analysis of architectural spaces. Based on recent studies exploring the influence of spatial form and structure on behavior and experience in virtual environments, the following topics are discussed: (1) the derivation and empirical verification of meaningful descriptor variables on the basis of classic qualitative theories of environmental psychology relating behavior and experience to spatial properties; (2) methods to select reference points for the analysis of architectural spaces at a local level; furthermore, based on two experiments exploring the phenomenal conception of the spatial structure of architectural environments, formalized strategies for (3) the selection of reference points at a global level, and for (4), their integration into a sparse yet plausible comprehensive graph structure, are proposed. Taken together, a well formalized and psychologically oriented methodology for the efficient description of spatial properties of environments at the architectural scale level is outlined. This method appears useful for a wide range of applications, ranging from abstract architectural analysis over behavioral experiments to studies on mental representations in cognitive science. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We use remote sensing and GIS to map changes in land cover and to identify systematic land-cover transitions in Southwestern Ghana. Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery of 1990 and 2000 is used to create two land-cover classifications, and the two maps are then compared to produce transition matrices both for protected and for unprotected areas. These matrices are analyzed according to their various components to identify systematic landscape transitions based on deviations between the transitions observed and the transitions expected owing to random processes of change. The results show that closed forest regions inside the protected area transition systematically to bare ground or bush fire, but closed forest outside the protected area transitions systematically to open cultivated woodland. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that logging is the main cause of the loss of closed forest inside the protected areas whereas farming is the main cause of the loss of closed forest outside the protected areas. The research highlights the need for the implementation of this methodological approach to landscape change. Identification of strong signals of forest transformation is particularly important in the light of efforts by policy makers to curb deforestation in Ghana. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We study a problem of path planning for a group of robots in this paper. The problem is stated as a finding of spatial-temporal paths through which the robots can go from their initial locations to the given goal locations in a certain environment. The robots must subordinate to a variety of physical constraints. The most important constraints from our point of view are that the robots must avoid obstacles and they must avoid each other. Both of these two constraints can be captured by a model where the environment is modeled as an undirected graph. Vertices of this graph represent possible locations for the robots and edges represent possible transitions between locations. The robots are located in the vertices of the graph. Each vertex can be occupied by at most one robot. A robot can move to the neighboring unoccupied vertex. The main result of the paper is the description of a class of the problem for which a polynomial time solving algorithm exists. We also present an experimental evaluation in which we tested the ability of several state-of-the-art planners to solve the problem.</jats:p>"

The main functionalities of ERPs are explained: the enterprise resource functionality and the planning functionality, as well as to what extent organizations need these functionalities and should pay its high prices. The expectations that have not yet been sufficiently satisfied by current systems, such as the ERP for SMEs, the transfer of “best practices,” the interconnection of supply chains via ERP, and the ERP for global organizations, are discussed.</jats:p>"

Bousquet’s presentation in 2004 of a comprehensive philological study of the literary evidence. This preliminary study serves to reassess the administrative role and function of amphoda as attested in the well-known Astynomoi Law from Pergamon. In this text, the meaning of amphodon is still debated. Indeed a few scholars, in the past and still today, interpret local amphoda as streets. Through the analysis of the available comparanda, along with the relevant literary sources, and internal data in the Astynomoi Law, I formulate the hypothesis that, in Pergamon, the term amphodon </jats:p>\n     <jats:p>describes an urban space, which does not correspond exactly to either our blocks or streets. Rather, I return to the original meaning of the term, which had been translated previously as ‘ group of houses’. This is one possible interpretation. However, I firmly believe that, in Pergamon, amphoda, whatever they were, were not streets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Location-specific costs are of major significance for a private household's location decisions. The paper estimates the additional transport costs a household has to face as a consequence of residential suburbanisation. The major components of these costs are changes in household motorisation and travel distances covered by specific modes. The results indicate significant increases in transport costs as an effect of suburbanisation. The increase is particularly strong for employees and households purchasing (an) additional automobile(s). A household composed of one employee and one non-employed individual who purchases one additional car has to expect additional transport costs ranging between 350 and 400 € per month, depending on the chosen location.</jats:p>"

Consisting of different ATM node types with respect to switching capability, the proposed architecture is adapted to current 2G and evolving 3G systems as well as future 4G wireless systems, as a common and shared backbone transmission network interconnecting core and access nodes between each other and Internet or PLMN/PSTN. Moreover, facing the huge expansion of transmission interconnection network that will support current and future generation mobile communications, a modification of the standard ATM cell structure is introduced in order to efficiently support user mobility functional procedures. The proposed ATM architecture is integrated over a suitable, with respect to region and capacity, physical interface, consisting of SDH or SONET for wide area topologies, wireless links for outdoor areas and LED-POF combination for indoor areas. Being an interesting alternative over copper or traditional fiber, POF characteristics and performance issues are analyzed. </jats:p>"

Inspections are a key issue in ensuring the safety of an older installation, and the inspection intervals, inspection methods and its reliability are clearly influencing the safety of the installations. Different approaches for updating inspection plans for older installations are considered in order to achieve decreased inspection intervals as the structure are ageing. The most promising method consists in increasing the rate of defects / crack initiation at the end of the expected lifetime. Different system aspects are considered incl. assessment of the acceptable annual probability of failure for one component dependent on the number of critical components. Information obtained from inspection of one component can be used not only to update the inspection plan for that component, but also for other nearby components. An example indicates that a high degree of correlation between the uncertain parameters in different components is needed in order to obtain substantial information which can be used in inspection planning. Fatigue failure of one (or more) components does not necessary imply total collapse of the structure. The importance of each component can be measured by the RIF (Residual Influence Factor) for each component and is illustrated by examples. When an installation becomes older then the number of fatigue critical components can be expected to increase. If the maximum acceptable annual system probability of failure is the same as for a new installation, this implies that the acceptable annual fatigue probability of failure decrease, which again implies more inspections.</jats:p>",

The MEICS plan that was developed interfaces with national response plans to ensure effective communication and coordination between our institution and local, state, and federal agencies to establish a common language and communication structure. The MEICS plan addresses multiple aspects of dealing with resource needs during a crisis, including the need for blood and transfusion medicine services. The MEICS plan was developed to supplement our current local emergency preparedness procedures and provide a mechanism for responding to the escalating severity of an emergency to deal with situations of a magnitude that is outside the normal experience. A plan was developed to interface the existing Transfusion Medicine disaster plan standard operating procedures (SOP) with the institutional and Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLMP) MEICS plans. The first step in developing this interface was defining MEICS. Other major steps were defining the chain of command, developing a method for visually indicating who is “in charge,” planning communication, defining the actions to be taken, assessing resource needs, developing flowcharts and updating SOPs, and developing a blood rationing team to deal with anticipated blood shortages. Several key features of the interface and updated disaster plan that were developed are calling trees for response personnel, plans for relocating leadership to alternative command centers, and action sheets to assist with resource assessment. The action sheets also provide documentation of key actions by response personnel. <jats:bold>\n                     <jats:italic>Immunohematology</jats:italic>\n                  </jats:bold>\n                  <jats:bold>2008;24:93–101</jats:bold>.</jats:p>",

The basic assumptions were verified by an airline survey at Frankfurt Airport. Finally, the paper outlines a planning procedure implementing three planning steps: a linear calculation scheme, followed by a terminal layout phase and a detailed simulation of the newly designed check-in hall.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Much has been written about e-business and how this concept will transform industries into virtual networks of customers and suppliers working together to create value-added processes (Fahey, Srivastava, Sharon, &amp; Smith, 2001). Typically, successful organisations will have embraced enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to integrate e-business processes within the organisation and to underpin the creation of integrated interorganisational systems. This frequently results in new business processes, organisational structures, human resource skill requirements, management roles, and knowledge management systems (Robey et al., 2002). To be successful in this new climate, however, organisations have to learn new approaches to strategy and planning for collaborative systems and to manage e-business enabled cycles of innovation (Wheeler, 2002; Zahra &amp; George, 2002). Few studies have explored the dynamics of e-business strategic planning and little information is available on how to implement new paradigms successfully and how to ensure more effective e-business performance as a result (Damanpour, 2001; Kallio, Saarinen, &amp; Tannila, 2002). This article reports on the findings from multiple case studies of e-business projects in ERP-enabled organisations. Each organisation was investigated in a three stage study over 4 years, using three theoretical models of e-business implementations to assess success. The key findings from each case study were captured into a staged model for e-business transformation and related to a dynamic planning model that can be applied across all stages of growth of the extended enterprise. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continuity of operations (COOP) planning, sometimes referred to as disaster recovery planning, business continuity planning, or business resumption planning, is a segment of contingency planning that refers to the internal effort of an organization, such as a branch of government, department, agency, or office, to assure that the capability exists to continue essential operations in response to a comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions. In government, COOP planning is critical because much of the response to an incident might include the maintenance of civil authority and infrastructure repair, among other potential recovery activities. All such efforts presume the existence of an ongoing, functional government to mobilize, fund, support, and oversee recovery efforts. In an emergency, government is likely to need to ensure the ability to communicate with internal and external constituencies. This function is becoming associated with electronic government. For example, many people in the United States and elsewhere, when searching for information and guidance following the September 11, 2001 attacks, turned to government agency Web sites. Beyond such extraordinary examples, the growing public expectations of e-government has put additional pressure on the need to reconstitute systems quickly after an interruption to minimize any disruptions and financial costs associated with a major infrastructure failure. Government COOP planning may be regarded as a “good business practice,” and part of the fundamental mission of agencies as responsible and reliable public institutions. Comprehensive contingency plans, perhaps once viewed, at the least, as optional and, at the most, as a prudent measure, are now seen as an integral part of developing and maintaining an agency’s capacity to carry out its essential functions. Continuity planning professionals assert that the perception of a changing threat environment and the potential for no-notice emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attack-related incidents, have increased the need for COOP capabilities and plans that enable agencies to continue their essential functions across a broad range of potential emergencies. COOP planning can be viewed as a continuation of basic emergency preparedness planning, including evacuation planning, and serves as a bridge between that planning and efforts to maintain continuity of government in the event of a significant disruption to government activity or institutions. In the aftermath of an incident, initial efforts typically focus on safeguarding personnel and securing the incident scene. Subsequently, attention focuses on reestablishing critical agency operations according to a COOP plan. Because the number and types of potential interruptions are essentially infinite, effective COOP planning must provide, in advance of an incident, a variety of means to assure contingent operations. In the context of e-government, the heavy reliance upon information technology to carry out mission critical tasks and provide other citizen services highlights the need to ensure these assets are robust, protected, backed up, and resilient to interruption. COOP is not a new idea. While contingency planning has gained considerable attention in recent years due to heightened security concerns and increased dependence on information technology, modern government continuity planning has been practiced, in one form or another, for several decades. What may now be emerging is a recognition that all organizational assets, in the case of government, this would include leaders, civil servants, and information infrastructures, must be incorporated into organization-wide contingency planning. </jats:p>"

The author argues that ICT not only affects the very understanding of planning, its role and its attributes, but also changes the planning's scope, and the character of its performance. The challenges to the ICT alternative are highlighted in the last section, and debated vis-?-vis observed benefits.

This paper will discuss new work currently being done by HDR to provide more reliable analysis of local conditions. This capability is of growing importance given the emergence of national carbon regulations which will require solid waste managers to develop greenhouse gas reduction strategies for their local systems.</jats:p>",

MDPs, while an otherwise expressive model, allow only for sequential, non-durative actions. This poses severe restrictions in modeling and solving a real world planning problem. We extend the MDP model to incorporate  1) simultaneous action execution, 2) durative actions, and 3) stochastic durations. We develop several algorithms to combat the computational explosion introduced by these features. The key theoretical ideas used in building these algorithms are -- modeling a complex problem as an MDP in extended state/action space, pruning of irrelevant actions, sampling of relevant actions, using informed heuristics to guide the search, hybridizing different planners to achieve benefits of both, approximating the problem and replanning. Our empirical evaluation illuminates the different merits in using various algorithms, viz., optimality, empirical closeness to optimality, theoretical error bounds, and speed.</jats:p>"

The recognition and discussion of these differences can provide a stimulus for identifying and modifying the limitations of technological implementation and use policies to improve the benefits generated by the technology. Topics of explicit concern to ERP implementation in global organizational economies related to organizational and societal culture are discussed, and suggestions for managerial mechanisms for overcoming major obstacles in this process are proposed.</jats:p>"

By coordinating preparation mechanisms through investment and collaboration before disasters hit, companies not only show confidence in the economy, encouraging regional cooperation and fostering economic growth, but also raise awareness of impending threats. Natural disasters affect all areas of life and livelihood; it is therefore beneficial for everyone to work together in advance to improve mitigation strategies and facilitate management processes in disaster recovery.</jats:p>"

Therefore, there are a myriad of reasons why teachers use these resources both as a teaching tool and a teaching resource. Several strategies can be implemented so that teachers have opportunities to become skillful in attaining technological fluency. This chapter reviews the trends and issues of today’s multimedia education, and attempts to provide strategies and guidelines for planning multimedia instruction.

Analysis of the knowledge-based economy suggests that competitive advantage is increasingly derived from investment in intangibles, particularly information and knowledge-based competencies. The film industry is chosen as a microcosm level of analysis to examine the state of the creative economy as the latest phase in Singapore’s economic development as technology and information are increasingly used to navigate and mediate its people, resources and capital. The objective of this research is to examine the types of competencies that enable firms in the industry to stay competitive in the contemporary knowledge-based economy in the light of technological development in the industry. In so doing, it seeks to shed light on what matters for the industry and the role that government has in shaping the creative economy.</jats:p>"

What drives the degree of resource utilisation and which resources show efficient utilisation and which do not? How many passengers will there be next year? With which airlines and on which routes? What resources will be needed in order to meet the demand and what cost impact will this have? The system also responds to ‘what if’ scenarios, such as a new airline entering the Stuttgart market, an airline ceasing operations, a particular destination performing well or poorly etc. The system considers both airport operations as well as ground handling.</jats:p>"

We implement a planner similar to FF except that it uses relaxed plans obtained from the additive heuristic rather than those obtained from the relaxed planning graph. We then evaluate the resulting planner in problems where action costs are not uniform and plans with smaller overall cost (as opposed to length) are preferred, where it is shown to compare well with cost-sensitive planners such as SGPlan, Sapa, and LPG. We also consider a further variation of the additive heuristic, where symbolic labels representing action sets are propagated rather than numbers, and show that this scheme can be further developed to construct heuristics that can take delete-information into account.</jats:p>"

Powerful tobacco merchants mainly from the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires built a considerable number of tobacco warehouses thus redefining the center of the city, its character, as well as its borders. I argue that the architecture of those warehouses deeply configured the identities of tobacco workers and provided the means to tobacco merchants to publicly present themselves and their achievements. At the same time those early industrial buildings subverted the boundaries between the city and the factory, shedding light on the work culture and every day lives of Greece’s tobacco workers.</jats:p>"

One of the two key issues to understand early on is whether the well can be drilled statically overbalanced or needs to be drilled with a statically underbalanced fluid. The second issue to comprehend is the level of service needed to avoid compromising safety and well objectives. Answering these two questions defines the path to be followed for adequate planning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Detailed planning aspects, such as flow modeling, crew training, operational procedures, process flow diagrams and HAZID / HAZOPs meetings are also described in this paper. By asking the ‘what if’ questions prior to operations, it should become apparent what additional surface equipment is required to safely and efficiently drill in MPD mode. Control of the ‘what if's should help to keep the planning and rig up both reasonable and cost effective.</jats:p>",

Er wordt ingegaan op de volgende onderwerpen:   - de beloften en verwachtingen bij het ontstaan van ERPpakketten begin jaren negentig,  - ontwikkelingen die zich nadien voordeden, zoals extended-ERP,  - wat deze ontwikkelingen feitelijk hebben opgeleverd,  - wat de beloften nu zijn en wat we er verder van mogen  verwachten,  - en, niet onbelangrijk: de rol van de ERP-gebruikende organisatie, want feitelijk bepaalt die de trends in ERP.  ERP biedt onbegrensde en grensverleggende mogelijkheden. Maar software alleen zal het niet waarmaken. Dat zal de gebruikende organisatie zelf moeten doen.

This chapter offers a conceptualization of the role of academic knowledge and, by extension, the university in processes of urban development through the lenses of theory, policy, and practice. A distinction between knowledge-based urban development as process-, product- or acquisition-driven is developed. It then assesses the relative balance of these roles in policy and practice through a case study of Manchester, North West England, and, in so doing, distinguishes between the rhetoric and the realities of attempts to do knowledge-based urban development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, obtaining field information in traditional pipeline design workflows rely on the use of conventional aerial photography, mapping and field visits. As a Designer, Engineer or Project Manager, a field visit can answer many questions and perhaps be the key to achieving a sound, successful design and installation. While conventional aerial orthophotography and mapping is invaluable during the design, it lacks a dimension that allows you to visualize the right-of-way the way you would if you were there. The use of Airborne Video and Oblique Imagery is not intended to replace conventional aerial orthophotography or mapping, but augment its use by providing a rich visualization that, in conjunction with the planimetric data sets, can aid the project team immensely during the design and permitting phase of a project. Currently, there are Airborne Data services available serving the pipeline industry that contain custom tools that either integrate into GIS platforms or operate as stand-alone proprietary software. These tools aid designers, engineers and constructors navigate through the video without having to sit and watch the whole video. In addition, video can be geocoded to specific pipeline or right-of-way features, such as a valve sites or stream crossings. Some tools even allow you to take rough measurements from visible features like fences or roads. Having such a dataset enables project team members to revisit any location along the right-of-way as many times as required to get information to finalize a design, permit application or to estimate the cost of construction. As Project Managers, we regularly face having new team members join the project at all stages of the project. Having a video to hand to new team members reduces the time they will take to get on board and familiarize themselves with the right-of-way. It also reduces the amount of field trips required just for this purpose. Another great use of Airborne Datasets is to use it during a pre-bid conference and provide it to the contractors bidding on the job. On large pipeline projects, it is unfeasible and impractical to have the project management team tour the entire right-of-way during a job walk, and there is likely areas along the right-of-way that are not very accessible thus requiring a flyover to review it with others.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the authors show how most plans ignore or downplay the essential requirement for the organization to preserve its critical knowledge resources in the event the possessors of that knowledge are killed. Most proponents of Knowledge Management have neglected this important facet of the field. At the same time, the risk management and disaster recovery fields have ignored the important contributions of Knowledge Management to a viable business continuity plan. </jats:p>"

On the contrary, Middle Eastern cities are building technologically isolated entities with the hope that they are promoting the knowledge city concept. An analysis of projects like Egypt’s Smart Village, Dubai’s Internet City and Knowledge Village, and Qatar’s Educational City and Science and Technology Oasis is insightful in the evaluation of emerging Middle Eastern Knowledge Cities. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the knowledge city concept in depth to relate it to the ongoing processes of creating knowledge-based economy developments in major Middle Eastern cities, particularly in Arab Gulf Cities. It discusses the principles of a knowledge city, and portrays its distinguishing characteristics and processes. In addition, the chapter introduces the concept of ‘urban creativity engines’ in the context of Middle East, and present examples of various types of creativity engines. Although this concept and its related terminologies are relatively new, the chapter proves that there are many historical examples of ‘knowledge cities’ and ‘creativity engines’ both regionally and internationally. A focus on the traditional built environment of the Middle Eastern cities is included to support the main argument of the chapter.</jats:p>"

From an urban planner’s perspective, however, it seems that the knowledge we talk about is out there in so-called knowledge industries. Knowledge-based urban development refers to development of city regions that are more or less driven by the knowledge economy, or to opportunities to attract knowledge workers in order to fuel economic growth in specific areas. The aim of this chapter is conceptualizing what knowledge and learning mean to, and in, contemporary planning praxis. The chapter discusses the key concepts of knowing and their relation to doing. By mooting a theory of assemblages, the chapter further provides a foundation for the analysis and the enforcement of learning in urban development praxis. Drawing on research on learning organizations, this chapter provides a basis for the contribution of urban planning to knowledge-based urban development.</jats:p>"

Two divisions, Sylhet and Chittagong, remain the most disadvantaged in terms of health and population outcomes and access to services, compounded by poor utilization of facilities in these areas. Moreover, the current health and population sector programs are beset with human resources and infrastructural problems. The Population Council organized a workshop to find answers to a key question: how can service delivery be improved in low-performing and hard-to-reach areas. This report shows that the workshop’s objectives were to: review current and emerging health and family planning issues particularly in low-performing and hard-to-reach areas; identify areas of deficiency in service delivery; and develop strategies for improving the performance of the health and population sectors in low-performing and hard-to-reach areas. Discussions were centered on human resources and infrastructure; behavior change communication and advocacy; and supplies and logistics.</jats:p>"

Composing such SWS is similar to planning. A key obstacle in doing so effectively is handling the ontology axioms, which act as state constraints. Computing the outcome of an action involves the frame and ramification problems, and corresponds to belief update. The complexity of such updates motivates the search for tractable classes. Herein we investigate a class that is of practical relevance because it deals with many commonly used ontology axioms, in particular with attribute cardinality upper bounds which are not handled by other known tractable classes. We present an update computation that is exponential only in a comparatively uncritical parameter; we present an approximate update which is polynomial in that parameter as well.</jats:p>"

We prove that the well-known truthful VCG mechanism is not always truthful in the context of optimal planning, and present a modification to fix this. Finally, we present some (domain-dependent) poly-time planning algorithms using this fix that maintain truthfulness in spite of their non-optimality.</jats:p>"

Therefore, there are a myriad of reasons why teachers use these resources both as a teaching tool and a teaching resource. Several strategies can be implemented so that teachers have opportunities to become skillful in attaining technological fluency. This chapter reviews the trends and issues of today’s multimedia education, and attempts to provide strategies and guidelines for planning multimedia instruction. The effective use of pedagogical design principles with appropriate multimedia can permit greater individualization, which in turn fosters improved learning, greater learner satisfaction, and higher retention rates.</jats:p>"

The issue concerning World Wide Web technologies is important to today’s businesses. Decision making in this area is complex and needs to consider carefully the characteristics and needs of the entities employing these technologies. It has furthermore become clear that the Internet, in particular the World Wide Web, is playing an increasingly larger role in how people communicate. Through this research, technologies used to serve dynamic Web content are compared. This comparison includes performance as well as cost issues, the things that professionals in the business world face when deciding the best implementation of Web server technologies. Existing studies cover a limited scope of the overall picture, and research has thus been focused into very narrow aspects of the global entity. However, the continuing developments in Web technologies dictate the need for a broad scope approach to comparative studies in this field. Such a scope is pursued in this research.</jats:p>"

The main critical framework conditions regards to Impediments on a Local level connected with different structures which led to different experiences, successes and problems; Accuracy and relevance of data and information; Institutional competence; Consideration of horizontal and vertical relations of local community which neglect their required active role in the development process; Financial restrictions as a considerable bottleneck for successful development planning upon unstable resource flow; Political culture norms and values; and The role of external experts and improvement of the above mentioned aspects which will enhance the situation of development planning at the local level in a sustainable manner. It is concluded that the various aspects are strongly interrelated and are forming a spider net with the object of the development process, the municipality, the town or the city. It is also concluded that the success of development efforts of the subordinated administrative levels depends to a high degree on adequate framework-conditions, which have to be formed and fostered at the superior level. .</jats:p>"

Indeed, the biotechnology industry is a potent engine for knowledge-based urban development around the globe. While the most famous example of biotechnology-driven knowledge-based urban development is Biopolis in Singapore, the National Capitol region of the United States is home to an emerging biotechnopole known as DNA Valley. Using a case study approach to compare and contrast DNA Valley with past examples of knowledge-based urban development in the United States, this chapter highlights the challenges for sustainable knowledge-based urban development in the global biotechnology industry and the practical steps public and private stakeholders can adopt to sustain knowledge-based urban development based on biotechnology.</jats:p>"

Rooted in the area of Knowledge Representation &amp; Reasoning, action languages like K allow the formalization of complex planning problems involving non-determinism and incomplete knowledge in a very flexible manner. By giving an overview of existing planning languages and comparing these against our language, we aim on further promoting the applicability and usefulness of high-level action languages in the area of planning. As opposed to previously existing languages for modeling actions and change, K adopts a logic programming view where fluents representing the epistemic state of an agent might be true, false or undefined in each state. We will show that this view of knowledge states can be fruitfully applied to several well-known planning domains from the literature as well as novel planning domains. Remarkably, K often allows to model problems more concisely than previous action languages. All the examples given can be tested in an available implementation, the DLVK planning system. </jats:p>"

People will better understand the resource implications as well as the direct costs of their lifestyles—and perhaps they will actually travel less.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper discusses experience, methodology and recommendations for successful business continuity and disaster recovery planning for health care organisations. Hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters are a regular occurrence in Florida. Low-lying coastal areas are at increased risk, with populations in inland areas as far as 200–300 miles with potential to suffer heavy damage. This case study shows how one institution, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, provides and maintains emergency response plans for critical functions, services or processes before, during and after a disaster, in support of its 8.3 million customers, its stakeholders and colleagues such as providers and vendors. Even though modern tracking gives fair warning regarding hurricanes, the use of specific and tested emergency response planning is critical to allow business continuity decision-making well before disaster strikes. This study examines how functional units within a health care organisation can plan and prepare to protect the public who depend on their services and resources, as well as minimise the risk to employees and business stakeholders. Coordination of a Contingency Response Team (within the functional units) and an Enterprise Operations Centre must be well managed to minimise adverse customer service disruptions and at the same time minimise impact to the company. Decision making and communications are strictly organised to protect stakeholders, make temporary business rule changes, allow for alternative business processes and handle benefit decisions, following methodology known, tested and used in past scenarios. In summary, the paper explores key points to achieve active and engaged business continuity in the face of natural disasters — (1) planning &amp; coordination, (2) monitoring, (3) response/activation and (4) recovery.</jats:p>"

Just like the previous systems (material requirements planning and accounting information systems among others) became ERPs, it is highly probable that ERPs will keep evolving towards a different and more comprehensive system. Logically, this evolution will be driven by the unsatisfied expectations of the current markets. One of these expectations is to lower the emphasis on the mid- and long-term planning functionality in favor of some kind of short-term, more dynamic planning functionality. In this sense, the chapter glimpses at a system that could be called ERM, where the “M” stands for management instead of the “P” for planning. The chapter also discusses the potential effects of the Open Source Initiative on ERPs. Other outstanding expectations examined are: (1) lower cost and duration of the implementation process, (2) less dependency on external consultants for the implementation, and (3) improved and standardized interaction functionality?or middleware?between different ERPs.</jats:p>"

The approach takes market scenarios, as well as actual status and performance of plant components into account. A supervisor algorithm provides the operating parameters needed to establish each plant loading.

It aims to evaluate the effectiveness of normative urban/regional planning practice applied locally to create a regional knowledge hub. The evaluation process surveys key stakeholders’ perceptions about the town’s development using traditional methods (e.g.: SWOT) and alternative methods from the Futures Studies field (Causal Layered Analysis). The case study shows that a regional governance framework with collaborative partnerships focused on place management and infrastructure delivery is needed to realise Sippy Downs’ vision as a knowledge hub. It also demonstrates that a holistic policy framework for the town’s development is also needed to leverage the drivers of successful knowledge-based urban development.</jats:p>"

An overview of the quantitative preconditions shows that many German cities dispose of favorite preconditions for such a knowledge city strategy. An analysis of the policy arena comes to the result that the political actors are confronted with the task of a complex multi-level-policy where networking skills become essential. A comparison with the policy conditions in the U.S. makes it quite clear that especially the German universities have the status of semi-autonomous actors complicating negotiating and coordinating activities between city and science representatives. First examples of deregulation show that these hurdles can be overcome in the future.</jats:p>"

By that time, the so-called “Barcelona Model” was not only about urban planning and new economic strategies, but about urban culture and social participation as well. After a period of stagnation, the new orientation of the municipal policy points to a more entrepreneurial logic. The growing role of private initiatives and the inclusion of information and communication technology in local policies are questions that affect the definition and shape of the new city, as well as the theory and practice of its governance. The “22@bcn Plan” is one of the highlights of Barcelona’s change into a “city of knowledge”. This chapter asks whether and how this specific plan challenges the well-known Barcelona Model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper the effectiveness of an optimal reference manoeuvre is analysed w.r.t. the complexity of the vehicle model used within the optimal control algorithm. The optimal reference manoeuvre is computed by means of a Nonlinear Receding Horizon planning (NRHP) strategy which is based on a simplified vehicle model. The reference manoeuvre is tracked by a controller implemented on a low level faster loop. The system is able to perform autonomously lane change and obstacle avoidance manoeuvres by tracking the computed reference one. The quality of the performed manoeuvres depends on the reference manoeuvre and consequently on the vehicle model used by the NRHP. For manoeuvres with low or mild lateral accelerations reduced order models might yield realistic and reliable reference manoeuvres. However, critical conditions (e.g. evasive manoeuvre) require a manoeuvre planner able to catch highly non-linear vehicle dynamics that characterizes such situations. On the other hand, being the NRHP computational cost generally high and related to the number of equations of the mathematical model, a trade-off between computational efficiency and model complexity is required. The work analyses the reference manoeuvres produced by two vehicle models of increasing complexity used as reference within the NRHP. Optimal planner performance evaluation on evasive manoeuvre in critical conditions will be presented with simulations results.</jats:p>",

Collaborative integration of multiple forms of knowledge is one approach used to develop meaningful solutions to complex problems. In this regard, spatial data and knowledge about the environment have been managed extensively with Web geographic information systems (Web GIS). However, past Web GIS research has focused mostly on using spatial tools to manage explicit (codified) knowledge. This has reduced the complementary contribution that tacit (experiential) knowledge can provide to environmental solutiodragns. In this study, Web GIS and knowledge management technologies are used to integrate multiple forms of spatial knowledge in support of collaborative community planning. The system design included a customized end-user interface for data entry, georeferencing tools for asynchronous collection of local data, and protocols for knowledge management dealing with species location, ecological habitats, and environmentally sensitive areas among others. The system enabled access, query, sharing, and updating of environmental knowledge using visual map-based tools. The utility of the integrated system design is discussed. </jats:p>"

A critical issue of the SMS is the planning and the scheduling of mechanical integrity inspections on pressure equipment. This is due to high number of components — including pipes, unfired and fired vessels, pumps and valves, — which could require different technical and organization procedures for testing or inspection. Usually, mechanical integrity inspections may request higher resource use than other safety related activities. The paper presents a model for inspection planning and scheduling, in order to integrate safety issues with other technical and economical issues.</jats:p>",

In a knowledge economy information and communication technology is extensively seen as a potentially beneficial set of instruments, which may improve the welfare and competitiveness of nations and cities. At present both public and private actors aim to exploit the expected benefits of information and communication technology developments. These technologies offer unprecedented promise for social and economic development on all global, national, regional, urban, and local levels. Therefore this chapter seeks to investigate the potential of information and communication technology policy at both regional and urban levels, and in particular to shed light on various factors that influence urban information technology policies in the public domain. The chapter sets out to explain the knowledge based urban development processes and challenges and opportunities in information acceptance and use in urban policy making in Queensland, Australia. This chapter draws on providing a clear understanding on policy frameworks and relevant technology applications of the Queensland ‘Smart State’ experience.</jats:p>"

The standard he has set promises well for future contributions the profession may expect from him. The text is clearly the current benchmark for analysis and description of air transport networks. Every researcher in the area ought to be familiar with it. Whether you agree with his approach and interpretations or not, it constitutes a ‘must-read’ reference. The text is full of interesting analyses that others may want to emulate. It offers a most interesting discussion of the recent historic evolution (from 1990 to 2003) of airline networks in Europe as they worked their way through the first decade of airline deregulation and intra-European “open skies”.</jats:p>"

The paper also includes a discussion of the manner in which ICT impact is handled by urban planning. The literature review points to insufficient attention to the dynamics between ICT and urban planning and increasing gap between physical and economic development implications of ICT. It is the role of urban planners to balance the consideration of the physical and economic aspects against the prospects and opportunities offered by ICT. .</jats:p>"

The mold's re‐configurability is based on the concept of using an array of discrete pins. By positioning the pins, the reconfigurable molding process allows forming the mold cavity directly from the object's 3D design model, without any human intervention. After a segment of the part is molded using the reconfigurable molding process, a multi‐axis machining operation is used to create accurate parts with better surface finish. Geometric algorithms are developed to decompose the design model into segments based on the part's moldability and machinability. The decomposed features are used for planning the reconfigurable molding and the multi‐axis machining operations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Computer implementation and illustrative examples are also presented in this paper.

The paper examines how spatial planning and particularly regional planning focuses on natural hazards and vulnerability. Based on the example of flooding and preventive flood protection it shows that the current focus in planning lies mainly on the hazard rather than on the vulnerability. This is problematic due to the fact that climate change implies changes within the frequency and intensity of flood events. Thus the static focus on a 100 years flood event is misleading. Therefore it is essential to shift the focus and to take into account the vulnerability of society and that of different land uses. The paper discusses fundamentals and key terms. It shows how the concept of vulnerability can be made more concrete for spatial planning.</jats:p>"

It reveals a substantial degree of completion of SOX requirements by these organizations, often facilitated by consultants, and often accomplished as part of broader systems, processes, and strategic management improvement initiatives. It also highlights some significant technical and cultural implementation challenges, such as systems inflexibility and diversity, systems security weaknesses, and resistance to change, as well as some benefits upon completion, such as improved process efficiency and systems security, and potential intangible long-term benefits.</jats:p>"

What is more, Delft’s considerable knowledge base has not been sufficient to promote a sustainable type of urban development that could benefit all of its citizens. This case-study analyses Delft’s current business and people climates with the purpose to indicate directions for the adjustment of Delft’s local development strategy to improve its sustainability. The results point out that Delft has placed very much emphasis on improving its business climate, but not so much attention has been paid to its people climate. Delft Knowledge City strategy still has little to offer to creative and foreign knowledge workers and students. In terms of people climate, shortages in housing and cultural amenities diminish Delft’s capacity to attract creative people. Further, the strategy still remains divorced from the worries of common citizens and the non-knowledge economic sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Planning of an upstream design process that includes creative and concurrent activities has become more important for product development in a competitive market. A significant characteristic of upstream planning is that the design process is one of knowledge creation. During this process, a designer makes progress toward a more advanced knowledge level that corresponds to a more advanced design achievement. In most cases of a creative and concurrent design process, however, a designer has to compromise design achievement because of constraints such as delivery time, cost, and another designer’s intention. Therefore, in planning a design process, it is more essential to set an acceptable level of design achievement and to predict whether or not a planned design process can ensure this level, than to predict the design time needed to totally achieve the design goals. This paper proposes a new method of design process planning that focuses on quantitative prediction of knowledge level achieved in a creative and concurrent design process. A growth curve model using fuzzy numbers is introduced to predict the final achievement of each task and final achievement of consistency between tasks after running a planned design process. The reliability model of a serial system is used to calculate the total acceptability of the design achievement. An experimental system that supports design process planning based on the proposed method is developed. This paper demonstrates its application to a student design project in order to show the power of the method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> After nearly 450 years of colonial administration, Portugal returned the territory of Macao to the People's Republic of China in 1999. Following the handover, Macao's postcolonial government dismantled the forty-year-old local gambling monopoly and opened Macao to investment by gaming companies from North America, Australia, and Hong Kong. These companies are collectively spending $25 billion to tap the increasingly affluent and mobile market of tourists just across the border in mainland China. This investment has prompted remarkable economic development in the tiny city as well as a phantasmagoric transformation of the cityscape and a concomitant transmutation of Macao's social landscape. Understanding contemporary Macao requires attending to how the legacies of Portuguese colonialism and fascism and Chinese communism and market socialism merge in the spaces of the city today. Drawing inspiration from Walter Benjamin's dialectical analysis of the obsolete commodities of mass culture, this paper meditates through text and photographs on four copresent moments of Macao—socialist fossil, colonial ruin, capitalist dream, and Utopian wish. A form of physiognomic urban ‘dream analysis’ rescues these multiple contradictory meanings of Macau and investigates the city's crucial role in both China's economic reforms and its Utopian desires. </jats:p>",

To UKAEA’s knowledge this is the most advanced project in the UK for new LLW disposal facilities. Experience has been gained in progressing the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) Study, working with regulators in unfamiliar areas, and undertaking groundbreaking stakeholder consultation. Key lessons learnt are that stakeholders should be engaged in dialogue on the project as early as possible, documentation must be high quality and tailored to its audience, and internationally respected and credible consultants must be involved.</jats:p>"

This article seeks to identify the critical factors of ERP implementation and uses statistical analysis to further delineate the patterns of adoption of the various concepts. A cross-sectional mail survey was mailed to business executives who have experience in the implementation of ERP systems. The results of this study provide empirical evidence that the theoretical constructs of ERP implementation are followed at varying levels. It offers some fresh insights into the current practice of ERP implementation. In addition, this study fills the need for ERP implementation constructs that can be utilized for further study of this important topic.</p>",

In such times, local community-based MRC units would work with existing public health and emergency management resources to create programmes to organise and recruit volunteers to support community needs. Now over five years old, the MRC programme has grown from 166 units as part of a demonstration project to almost 700 local units with more than 127,000 volunteers. In addition, the programme has evolved into a community health response resource that is used throughout the year, not just during times of great need. This paper will discuss the background and concept of the MRC programme, as well as describe how interested individuals and communities can get involved. The paper will also highlight the types of activities in which MRC units are involved and lessons learned.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is to determine what organisations in Namibia use as basis for investing in IT. In interviews with six organisations in Namibia, it was determined how they define and manage their investment in IT. Some conclusions can be drawn, the first being that organisations need to look at their definition of IT to include all aspects of IT like communication systems, maintenance, etc. the second implication is that somebody must be appointed to take responsibility for managing the IT investment. </jats:p>"

In the economic appraisals of such projects, which are often of massive scale and impact, it is presumed that travel time is wasted, dead, or empty, and therefore should be minimised. However, in this paper we show how travel time is filled with activities and fantasies. We show that there are multiple travel times and places, and not just a single measured clock time that has to be minimised in getting from point A to point B. Travel time is situated in the sociomaterial practices of travel, which include engaging with other passengers, interacting with wireless networks, views out of the window, things packed in one's bag, and so on. We describe and evaluate various ‘moving methods’ for researching places on-the-move, from survey to ethnography. Finally, we consider how to disrupt the assumption in transport appraisal that such time is empty and should be minimised, and suggest new approaches for presencing the richness of passenger travel time in transport modelling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This and a previous paper review systematically a new and fast-growing geographical research literature about ‘neoliberalising nature’. This literature, authored by critical geographers for the most part, is largely case study based and focuses on a range of biophysical phenomena in different parts of the contemporary world. In an attempt to take stock of what has been learnt and what is left to do, the two papers survey the literature theoretically and empirically, cognitively and normatively. Specifically, they aim to parse the critical literature on nature's neoliberalisation with a view to answering four key questions: (1) what are the reasons why all manner of qualitatively different nonhuman phenomena in different parts of the world are being ‘neoliberalised’? (2) what are the principal ways in which nature is neoliberalised in practice? (3) what are the effects of nature's neoliberalisation? and (4) how should these effects be evaluated? Without such an effort of synthesis, this literature could remain a collection of substantively disparate, theoretically informed case studies unified only in name (by virtue of their common focus on ‘neoliberal’ policies). This paper addresses questions 2, 3, and 4, while the previous paper concentrated on the first. It is argued that some unresolved issues in the published literature make it very difficult for readers and future researchers in this area to draw ‘wider’ lessons about process, effects, and evaluations. This is not so much a ‘failing’ of the literature as a reflection of its newness and the way its constituent parts have evolved. It is argued that these issues require careful attention in future so that the ‘general’ lessons of the literature published to date on nature's neoliberalisation can be made clear. Where the previous paper detected some ‘signals in the noise’ viz question 1, this paper suggests that more work needs to be done viz questions 2 to 4 for any signals to be detected. </jats:p>",

However, the cost of changing manufacturing facilities to produce new product families can outweigh the benefits obtained from increased revenue. Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMSs) have been proposed as a cost effective strategy for manufacturing product families. Although methods for measuring RMS scalability and convertibility exist, there is a lack of methods for obtaining reconfiguration plans for assembly systems.

For many companies, satisfying auditors is the primary goal of technology recovery testing. Identifying ways to expand testing to improve the chances of recovering critical functions during an actual event is difficult if stakeholders are complacent with the current status. This report describes how to expand technology recovery testing for organisations and identify/address roadblocks that prevent many organisations reaching the next level of 'maturity'. How an organisation approaches technology recovery testing depends on the type of business and the overall culture within the organisation; for example, IT management in non-profit organisations has a completely different focus from that in organisations with a more independent IT area or in companies where the business areas directly fund IT. Expanding technology recovery requires the involvement of auditors, the business client and IT. Knowing what motivates each group and identifying how improving resiliency helps each of the areas (and the overall company) are the keys to real change. This paper will look at techniques to improve the IT recovery process while expanding the people involved in it.</jats:p>"

Furthermore the meaning of human-social and organizational aspects becomes more crucial, because of the linkage of different processes (e.g. product development and oder processing). A new type of lean production system (LPS), that is currently implemented in many european enterprises, offers a holistic approach to arrange enterprise-specifically methods in order to design the production in a comprehensive and consistent way. Now, the challenge of factory planning is to configure the elements of the factory in a way, that they support the fulfilment of the purposes of the production system in the best possible way. Based on the described challenges for factory planning, this paper offers a methodology to identify and illustrate the influences of the elements of an LPS on the elements of a factory. These influences are structured in a matrix. Therefore the interdependencies between the requirement areas (methods/tools of an LPS) and the scopes for design (elements of a factory) are structured hierarchically by various levels.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is essential to reduce the maintenance costs for economic reasons. Furthermore, since the hot gas path parts have cooling structures with advanced design and coated with various types of coatings, the prices of parts are usually very high. Therefore, using the parts efficiently and extending the service life of the parts are needed to significantly reduce the maintenance costs. In such a situation, a platform free system of “Gas Turbine Hot Gas Path Parts Maintenance Planning Support System” has been developed. This system can be used to decrease parts disposal loss by optimizing parts rotation plans. In this paper, main functions of this system and the results of some case studies by this system are described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This is an essay on the ‘conditions of possibility’ (Kant) for thinking about the seemingly bizarre spaces of a grandly chaotic city. It is concerned with the possibility of distinctively different, contradictory (therefore incompatible) yet coexisting general modes of thinking—epistemes or discursive formations (Foucault)—and with the possible processes of their production. I begin with those spaces themselves and with their contested social production (Lefebvre), what they appear to show and what they seem to mask. Then, in the second part of the paper, the task is to explore the conditions that might underlie the remembering of many things and the forgetting of many things (Anderson), in the myriad decisions and actions that account for the production of such spaces. The third part is concerned with what these spaces might themselves tell us about deeper origins, the society itself, and its possible trajectory. A brief final part addresses the most problematic of issues: how is self-aware, self-critical discourse to arise in (against?) an episteme that eschews the articulation of criticism? </jats:p>",

The algorithm generates a collision free path for mobile robots running between two tracks or moving towards a known way point. This approach can negotiate tracks and avoid obstacles which may be initially unknown but are later perceived by the robot, and hence is suitable for use with onboard sensors which provides local information. The approach involves dividing the whole terrain into two different classes, classifying any new point obtained from sensors into either of the classes, and generating a track between both the classes as a path of the robot. SVM generates a non-linear class boundary on the principle of maximizing the margin. The boundary generated by this method is smooth, free of obstacles, and safe for a robot to navigate. The paper presents various case studies and simulation results. Future possibility to integrate this technique with other path planning techniques is also discussed.</jats:p>",

As a result, there are still a large number of information technology (IT) organizations that have not yet implemented any object-oriented (OO) process. For them, the transition to a new work environment and the adoption and utilization of a software process implies a number of problems, commonly including necessary human and organizational resistance to the ensuing cultural change. This chapter provides IT organizations and professionals with insights into the most important key success factors that may promote the entire process of organizational change. We investigate the effect of various human factors on the adoption and diffusion of an object-oriented software development process. Some of the human factors include motivation, leadership, resistance to culture change, and willingness and readiness to change. In addition, this chapter explores the significant role of these factors in controlling the entire process of implementing an OO process in practice, emphasizing the significance of planning and managing these “soft” factors to achieve clear advantages and gain enviable results. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper aims at a rewriting of the concept of meaning as a connection between the social and the material, a multiple connection, perhaps the only possible intrinsic connection between things as different as ‘practice’ and ‘space’, and a major condition of what has been recently addressed as ‘inherent relatedness’. Drawing mainly on Niklas Luhmann's theory of self-referentiality, I propose a reinterpretation of relatedness as a property of meaning. That property is defined as a duality of meaning—ie meaning as an event in our experience, yet in itself an experience of reference to acts, places, and other meanings. It implies that the very definition of meaning is referential—it is never self-contained or centred; it, rather, alludes always already to other meanings, acts, and spaces, referentially crossing boundaries while reasserting sensual and perceptive qualities. This renewed concept of meaning is proposed as a way to unveil relationality while actively keeping the subject's experience of identities and different materialities at work in the relation between practice and space. The paper places this key ontological problem and the quest for a relation between the social and the material into a particular, overlooked aspect of the society–space relation: the moment of sociation of practice and its informational, linguistic, and material conditions—a turn to communication and a ‘referential approach’ to the materiality of the social world. </jats:p>",

I argue that in the ‘informal’ and marginal spaces inhabited, utilised, and created by these traders, they produce forms of nonelite cosmopolitanism through which livelihoods are sustained, social bonds are strengthened, and fluid, diasporic identities are produced. These are enabled by the development and maintenance of globalised networks and allegiances that are negotiated in highly localised ways and are often based on religion, ethnicity, and nationality. Thus, mobile and abiding cultural characteristics coexist as peddlers’ experiences of travelling and their encounters in place challenge conventional notions of cosmopolitanism and parochialism, and their apparent dualism. The paper introduces the notion of a strategic cosmopolitanism that emerges out of the need for vulnerable individuals and groups to make a living in an environment characterised by insecurity, and concludes by enquiring whether there are temporal dimensions to their cosmopolitanism. </jats:p>",

To support that work, a new piece of informal guidance, the 'Ten-Step Cycle', was published in June 2007 by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, in conjunction with the National Steering Committee for Warning and Informing the Public. Designed to provide responding agencies with a 'route map' to help implement the duty of communicating with the public, this paper will give readers an insight into how this new initiative works, explaining the steps that local resilience forums need to take.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Discussions of cosmopolitanism in Bombay often focus on the rubrics of communal tension, tolerance, and violence, and frequently report the decline of a once cosmopolitan city, especially as a result of the communal riots and bombings that occurred in the early 1990s. However, claims that the city has undergone a general social transformation since the 1990s need to be tempered by the multiple forms of cosmopolitan imaginations and practices that exist in the city. There is a wide variety of alternative cosmopolitan formations—not all of them progressive—reflected in civil society organizations and lifestyle changes for different groups, and often vividly reflected in film. This paper will chart two examples of contemporary cosmopolitanism. The first part of the paper explores the cautious optimism of film in the promise of cosmopolitan Bombay during the early years of Independence, before briefly discussing how cinema later attempted to reflect the destabilizing of the postcolonial vision of urban national development. The second part of the paper begins with discussion of the contemporary cinematic portrayal of elite-oriented global cosmopolitan modernity, and then contrasts this with a different form of global cosmopolitan modernity articulated through the work of the Slum/Shack Dwellers International network. This discussion conceives of cosmopolitanism as social, marking a counterpoint to the tendency in discourses of liberal cosmopolitanism that emphasizes the agency of the globally aware individual. Methodologically, the paper seeks to demonstrate that relating often analytically separate realms such as film and civil society can provide a wider politicocultural lens through which to examine urban change. </jats:p>",

In establishing the Delhi Improvement Trust in the 1930s, Arthur Parke Hume had to battle against governmental cost cutting in an attempt to secure the rehousing of slum evictees. The refusal of the government to accept this welfarist commitment to investment led to the stalling of the improvement projects and great emotional disquiet for Hume. This is traced through his personal correspondence with his parents. In interweaving these insights with the imperial archive, three biographical approaches are adopted. A traditional chronology is used to order the events, an analytical approach is used to outline the discursive regularities of Hume's observations, and a genealogical approach is used to suggest the influences on Hume's writings and the broader governmental rationalities that he had to negotiate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay seeks to reframe recent debates on sociospatial theory through the introduction of an approach that can grasp the inherently polymorphic, multidimensional character of sociospatial relations. As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated ‘turns’ within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphy—the organization of sociospatial relations in multiple forms—within sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the ‘TPSN framework’ to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;em&gt;Abstract.&lt;/em&gt;—Coastal ecosystems sustain the livelihoods of coastal communities around the world and fisheries-dependent communities in particular. But these ecosystems are subject to intense and growing population and development pressure. Future prospects are bleak for many of these ecosystems and the communities that depend upon them. Moreover, with relentless development intensification, these communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to coastal hazards, especially in the face of global warming and sea-level rise. The consequences of living in hazard-prone coastal areas has been exposed by graphic television coverage of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the hurricanes that devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005. It is imperative that we learn to mitigate hazard impacts and build more sustainable and hazard-resilient coastal communities. This chapter presents case studies of recovery experiences in Indonesia and the Maldives in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami and recovery experiences related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Particular attention is focused on how fishing communities were impacted, are recovering, and what is being done to build the resilience of these communities. More specifically, what should and can be done to mitigate future hazard impacts? Personal observations and interviews with planners, academics, and others involved in recovery efforts inform this analysis. Notwithstanding significant cultural and contextual differences between these case studies, lessons can be learned from these experiences to improve future coastal policy, planning, and decision-making processes. These lessons, together with insights from diverse literatures, including coastal management, natural hazards planning, collaborative planning, sustainable communities, sustainable livelihoods, ecological economics, and comanagement, are synthesized to develop a conceptual framework and outline principles and operational imperatives to guide action for mitigating hazard impacts and building sustainable, hazard-resilient communities. Such communities are founded upon robust critical infrastructure that is secured by planning and decision-making processes that enable these communities to build layers of resilience to overcome waves of adversity. Sustainability and resilience will remain elusive unless unsustainable practices and community vulnerabilities are confronted by a transformational process of developmental planning.</jats:p>"

This research is an exploratory study on how information and communications technologies have been adopted in master planned communities of South East Queensland, Australia. It examines the four roles of information and communications technologies in the master planned communities: (1) teleworking; (2) creating a sense of community; (3) promoting integrated office and businesses; and (4) developing learning communities. More recent master planned communities in South East Queensland such as Varsity Lakes, North Lakes and Greater Springfield have integrated information and communications technologies for activities such as community internet portals, local business development, and for use in community learning centers and education facilities. There is a potential to attract knowledge workers in master planned communities through the inclusion of cultural amenities, information and communications technologies and learning infrastructure. It is important that information and communications technologies and learning infrastructure not only benefit the housing estate but also the surrounding region thus putting a foundation for a knowledge-based urban region.</jats:p>"

The  results may, however, depend on the methods used. In this study, values  of residents of Hyrynsalmi municipality concerning the nearby forests  owned by UPM-Kymmene Ltd. were evaluated with a questionnaire consisting  of general value questions and mapping of social values of forests. The  data was collected from a public meeting and from a mailed survey from  randomly sampled people and from members of municipal council. The aims  of the study were to 1) test the social value mapping method in  commercial forests in a rural-urban interface as well as to examine the  benefits and drawbacks 2) in place-specific and non-specific data  collection, and 3) in different data collection methods, from the  viewpoint of forest management planning. We noted that while all  respondents can claim to represent local values, different data  collection methods produced statistically significantly different local  values. This needs to be accounted for when planning a participatory  process. In operational forest planning, place-specific information is  more useful than questions concerning the general values, while the  latter may help in defining forest policy goals. The social values  mapping method is also relatively easy for the participants. However, in  the studied case about one fifth of the area was delineated by the  participants per each positive value. The answers were quite scattered,  suggesting that most of the area had some social values for local  people. This indicates that utilising a social values mapping method in  planning needs further development in rural areas, where distinctive  patches can not be easily detected.</ja:p>"

Memorial trees have been used as a seemingly blank canvas, to be coloured by the paintbox of memory. The ability of such trees to carry significant memories of past events into the present involves myriad slippages and all kinds of untidiness: the settings in which memorial trees are asked to perform are subject to significant and often transformative cultural change; the trees themselves are active organic components in the changing coconstitution of place and place meanings; and tree places can afford emotional responses and serve as spaces of much more immediate and prereflexive practice and performance. These dynamics suggest rather different connections between trees and memorialisation, which we term treescape memories. </jats:p>",

There are several methods currently used to identify and quantify these mistakes. However, these methods typically do not provide a useful context within which to quantitatively incorporate mistakes into the design process in a beneficial way. This paper presents an approach to determine when it is appropriate to perform error checking to eliminate a potential mistake. The proposed approach is intended to be used when time is a limited design resource and design goals are technically attainable. It is proposed that the cost of a mistake can be quantified as the amount of time a mistake adds or subtracts from the overall time required to achieve the design’s objectives. To determine this, an optimization problem is formulated which minimizes time spent in the design process. In this optimization problem the design variables are the binary choice whether or not to perform an error check. The approach is demonstrated in two case studies, one a simple theoretical design problem and the other the design of an I-beam. The results of these case studies demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness, and present several avenues for future work.</jats:p>",

In this paper I present a theoretical classification of organisational archetypes for housing associations, based on a distinction between prospectors and defenders, and between housing associations with a relatively strong social orientation and those with a more business-like, commercial, orientation. The four resulting organisational archetypes are worked out on the basis of their range of activities, innovations, organisational structure, available expertise (human resources), strategic management systems, and their approach towards local accountability. Furthermore, the archetypes are illustrated and tested by case studies. It is concluded that the distinction between prospectors and defenders is applicable to the housing associations, but that the distinction between social and commercial orientation is harder to apply to practice. </jats:p>",

The risk of introducing disease pathogens into a country and the spread of the agent within a country depends on a number of factors including import controls, movement of animals and animal products and the biosecurity applied by livestock producers. An adequate contingency plan is an important instrument in the preparation for and the handling of an epidemic. The legislation of the European Union requires that all Member States draw up a contingency plan which specifies the national measures required to maintain a high level of awareness and preparedness and is to be implemented in the event of disease outbreak. This paper describes the main elements to be included in the contingency plans submitted by Member States to the European Commission for approval.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This and a companion paper examine a new and fast-growing geographical research literature about neoliberal approaches to governing human interactions with the physical environment. This literature, authored by critical geographers for the most part, is largely case study based and focuses on a range of biophysical phenomena in different parts of the contemporary world. In an attempt to take stock of what has been learnt and what is left to do, the two papers survey the literature theoretically and empirically, cognitively and normatively. They are written for the benefit of readers trying to make some sense of this growing literature and for future researchers of the topic. Specifically, they aim to parse the critical studies of nature's neoliberalisation with a view to answering four key questions posed, variously, in many or most of them: what are the main reasons why all manner of qualitatively different nonhuman phenomena in different parts of the world are being ‘neoliberalised’? what are the principal ways in which nature is neoliberalised in practice? what are the effects of nature's neoliberalisation? and how should these effects be evaluated? Without such an effort of synthesis, this literature could remain a collection of substantively disparate, theoretically informed case studies unified only in name (by virtue of their common focus on ‘neoliberal’ policies). Though all four questions posed are answerable in principle, in practice the existing research literature makes questions two, three, and four difficult to address substantively and coherently between case studies. While the first question can, from one well-established theoretical perspective, be answered with reference to four ‘logics’ at work in diverse contexts (the focus of this paper), the issues of process, effects, and evaluations are currently less tractable (and are the focus of the next paper). Together, the two pieces conclude that critical geographers interrogating nature's neoliberalisation will, in future, need to define their objects of analysis more rigorously and/or explicitly, as well as their evaluative Schemas. If the new research into neoliberalism and the nonhuman world is to realise its full potential in the years to come, then some fundamental cognitive and normative issues must be addressed. These issues are not exclusive to the literature surveyed and speak to the ‘wider’ lessons that can be drawn from any body of case study research that focuses on an ostensibly ‘general’ phenomena like neoliberalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1996, Srinivasan surveyed the use of the Web as a dissemination tool by Indian government agencies and found that there was little Web-based participation by either government or non-government agencies. By 2002, there was at least one Indian city that offered citizens the opportunity to pay property taxes on the Web (http://www.esevaonline.com). Clearly, even in a developing country like India, e-government has come a long way in a very short time. In this chapter, the authors survey the use of this facility in Hyderabad, a rapidly growing city in India. They look in particular at the implications of e-Seva for local planning agencies. The authors also suggest a geographical information systemsbased framework whereby virtual agencies could create data ‘portals’ that allow for inter-agency data sharing. The study relies on interviews with the users of e-Seva and other government officials who are interested in its use for planning at the metropolitan and regional levels. While the study focuses on Hyderabad, India, as its case study, the implications to planning in other cities in India are also an important aspect of the research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When considering the intersection between geographical knowledge and geopolitical practice, emphasis generally falls on the state and the state's self-serving calculations. This paper, instead, focuses on geopolitical civil society, emphasizing the role that rationalized norms and emotive care-ethics play in molding and facilitating certain forms of geographical knowledge and subsequent foreign interventions. The case to illuminate this theoretical focus centers on American evangelical actors and their specific geopolitical vision, which is largely based on the perceived universal authority of the Bible. The case illustrates how the religious normative imperative to evangelize the world has led to geographically blunt imaginaries that present spaces of alterity as being in urgent need of spiritual and also geopolitical intervention. Opposed to such imaginaries, however, this paper also traces the emergence of an ethics of care that has developed within evangelical circles regarding the people of southern Sudan. This more specific and immediately felt ethical impulse is shown to maintain a more nuanced understanding of heterotopic place. It is argued that there is a frequent clash between such universalist ethical impulses, which tend to code global space according to a particular normative paradigm, and particularist ethical impulses, which are based on a care-ethics that is rooted in an attachment too and an understanding of a particular place. This paper makes the case that, given the right communication channels, these varying ethical impulses can lead to a transformative communication in which universalist geopolitical visions are adapted to place-specific heterotopic geographical realities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">On 18th January, 2003, one of the worst bushfires in the history of Australia hit the capital city, Canberra. By the time it was under control, four people were dead and more than 500 homes were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the Mount Stromlo campus of the Australian National University, the location of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics. In response to the fires, the University initiated its emergency management strategy and business continuity plans. These allowed the School to recommence limited operations within two weeks of the disaster. This paper details a case study of the impact of the fire (in part using personal recollections of staff and students), and the emergency response implemented by the University. It describes the development of the University's emergency management strategy, with its emphasis on the key elements of clear chain of command and flexibility in developing an incident-specific response. The paper also provides an assessment of how the plan worked during an actual incident and some of the lessons learned, including the importance of the early response, managing the impact on people, media management, insurance and communications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of hybridity has been discussed chiefly in relation to cultural issues and interpreted as a challenge to dominant power. It is equally relevant to the interpretation of economic and social change (for example, in the field of international development), while its political significance is properly a subject of investigation. Hybridity was common under colonialism: in domestic and work settings (mines, plantations), in the organisation of urban areas, and in the organisation of colonial administration. It became more common in the British territories once Britain began to promote colonial development in the late 19th century. The evolution of colonial housing and urban housing policy after 1929 indicates that colonisers tolerated and then endorsed hybridity. Usually, it was accepted as a step towards modernity; occasionally, it was viewed as a local adaptation that embodied local practices that had intrinsic merit. In any event, the concept of hybridity has broad application to our understanding of colonialism and development. </jats:p>",

The adoption of a mediation lens helps identify how global and local skills have been combined in ERP projects, and how these different arrangements have affected the project results. Underlying our analysis were two main questions: (1) How do patterns of mediation emerge, and what kinds of elements influence their emergence? and (2) What kind of association can be established between patterns of mediation and project results? Our conclusions point towards certain drivers. The local firm’s position regarding the head office and the meaning attached to each project have directly influenced the way external consultants are perceived by the local firm’s members, and these perceptions influence team members’ and consultants’ roles. Team members’ and consultants’ roles, in turn, contribute to reinforcement or transformation of established mediation patterns.</jats:p>"

However, at any given time it represents a snapshot of a geographic area that is diverse economically, ethnically, and racially, and in terms of its built environment. I use the notion of ‘patchwork’ first as a literal interpretation based on a quilting project I facilitated with children from an after-school program in this location. Second, ‘patchwork’ is used as a metaphor capturing results of neighborhood explorations led by the children over three years (2003–06). Specifically, as I explore children's perceptions of ‘neighborhood’, the notion of ‘patchwork’ seems to accommodate their varied understandings, views, and perspectives of their neighborhoods well. Simultaneously, the notion also contributes to the fluid and active construction of the term in urban geography. </jats:p>",

Shifting planning capabilities to the machine level enables consideration of direct machine feedback. In this paper a method for feature decomposition and tool path planning for pocket milling on a 3 axis milling machine is presented. Based on standard computerized numerical control (CNC) technology, G-code is transferred to the fabrication machine whereat adaptation of processing parameters can take place within a feature. In order to enable a feedback loop from the processing to the planning stage, subfeature elements are defined. Interrelations between subsequent elements are identified and standardized with regard to the manufacturing needs to realize fully machined features. For each element a tool path is generated and translated into valid G-code. After fabrication of each subfeature element processing parameters can be improved. The presented method is implemented in a prototype software tool based on an open source CAD/CAM/CAE kernel and extends an existing open source CAM software framework.</jats:p>",

These variables have an impact on implementation success during global HRMS implementation. Further analyses on specific success factors faced with global implementations were evaluated using semi-structured interviews. The authors prepared a questionnaire to further explore the data. Respondents rated questions related to management support the highest overall. An interesting find was that the semi-structured interview results indicated that the software chosen was not a perfect fit for the global community. The mean for questions related to global HRMS success was higher for respondents located in the United States than those located in other locations.</jats:p>"

The Slum Sanitation Programme (SSP) is premised upon ‘partnership’, ‘participation’, and ‘cost recovery’ in the delivery of large toilet blocks as a practical solution to the stark lack and inadequacy of sanitation, and offers an opportunity to interrogate a growing consensus on sanitation provision among mainstream development agencies. In the paper, I argue for a more flexible approach to policy infrastructure, technical infrastructure, and cost recovery in urban sanitation interventions. I also consider whether the SSP, as the largest city project of its nature in Indian history, marks a shift in the relationship between the state and the ‘slum’ in Mumbai. I suggest that, despite constituting a change from ad hoc sanitation provision to a more sustained and universal policy, informal settlements in the SSP remain populations outside the sphere of citizenship and notions of the clean, ordered modern city. </jats:p>",

It’s suggested strongly to conduct urban building energy planning in urban planning system in China. There are two main characteristics of urban building energy system. That is, firstly, the terminal building energy demand is dynamic timely, such as the heating, cooling, gas and electricity load of 8760 hours a year with peak and valley load. Secondly, the energy demand, energy sources supply, energy equipments and networks of heating, cooling, gas and electricity are distributed in urban space. It’s meaningful to conduct an innovative urban energy planning with space distribution and time dynamic simulation. In this paper, the energy planning method with space and time characteristics is presented and analyzed briefly. In the meanwhile, to meet the same energy demand in buildings, such as heating, air conditioning, gas and electricity, different energy equipments such as boiler, CHP, CCHP and heat pump based on different energy sources such as coal, gas and electricity can be planned and should be alternative among those energy sources and equipments. Thus, a well alternative urban energy system with high energy efficiency and low environmental emission should be simulated. Therefore, an urban building energy planning (UBEP) simulation tool developed by our research group is introduced. And finally, a case of energy planning in Beijing City in 2010 for heating and air conditioning system is simulated dynamically and analyzed.</jats:p>",

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are a crucial factor in developing such a system. Despite the attention this has attracted in practice, little academic research has focused on this area. This chapter addresses the question: How are ERP systems implicated in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance? It aims to show how SOX requirements regarding assessment and improvement of internal controls are related to the functionalities of an ERP system both in local and global implementations. It examines a solution (mySAP ERP) offered by one specific vendor (SAP) and what functionalities are relevant to global SOX compliance. Based on this, the chapter discusses likely developments regarding compliance functionalities in future releases of ERP systems.</jats:p>"

This part of the book argues that the defeat of the conservation department was due less to the weakened power of the Roosevelt administration than to the indefinite status of the conservation movement during the late 1930s. To illustrate this, Chapter Six examines how the national debate over CCC work projects forced Roosevelt to embrace a more holistic, ecological approach to federal planning best exemplified by the National Planning Board, as well as a more cooperative and integrated conservation agenda through programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority. And while these new notions of “ecological planning” and “total conservation” never became institutionalized in a new Department of Conservation, Chapter Six concludes that the failure of Franklin Roosevelt's reorganization plan forced these two beliefs into the public sphere. The result was a new form of special interest politics expressed in movements such as grassroots environmentalism.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we describe an automatic tool based on a new method, integrating assembly design, sequence optimization, and advanced rigid body path planning. First, we introduce a greedy algorithm for assembling a product, part by part, based on state-of-the-art path planning. We exploit all the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body to search for collision-free paths, instead of limited motions. Then, we use assembly design in order to limit the search for an optimal assembling sequence and to guarantee geometrical quality among the sequences examined. Disassembly path planning is used here to further cut the state space and to give a quality measure to the sequences. Eventually, we present results for an industrial test case, which has been successfully solved by applying our method.</jats:p>",

Recently, the concept of path planning inside corridors has been introduced and a novel approach under the name Corridor Map Method (CMM) has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the original CMM by creating alternative paths that a character can follow within a corridor. This not only presents a more challenging and less predictable opponent for the player, but also enhances the realism of the gaming and/or training experience. We also discuss how variation in the speed of the animated characters can be integrated into our extended framework, leading to convincing characters that exhibit human like path planning.

The rigid body undergoes a four-rotation fully-reversed (FR) sequence of rotations which consists of a series of initial two rotations about the axes of a coordinate frame attached to the rigid body and subsequent two rotations that undo the proceeding rotations. Due to the insufficient degrees of freedom of four-rotation FR sequences required to achieve all possible orientations, the rigid body cannot achieve some orientations. In order to best approximate these infeasible orientations, the Jacobian-based algorithm is implemented in the sense of least squares. As some orientations can never be attained by a single four-rotation FR sequence, two different four-rotation FR sequences are exploited alternately to ensure the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Assuming the orientation is supposed to be manipulated using three input-rotations, the switching-Jacobian algorithm proposed in this paper has significant practical importance for motion planning for aerospace and underwater vehicles maneuvered using only two input-rotations due to the failure of one of torque-generation mechanisms.</jats:p>",

While scientists can contribute to a technically defensible basis for water resource planning, this framework must be cast in a broader societal and environmental context. Given the complexity and often contentious nature of resource allocation, success requires a process for inclusive and transparent sharing of ideas complemented by tools to structure, quantify, and visualize the collective understanding and data, providing an informed basis of dialogue, exploration, and decision making. Ideally, a process that promotes shared learning leading to cooperative and adaptive planning decisions. While variously named, mediated modeling, group modeling, cooperative modeling, shared vision planning, or computer‐mediated collaborative decision making are similar approaches aimed at meeting these objectives. In this paper, we frame “cooperative modeling” in the context of ground water planning and illustrate the process with two brief examples.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ultimate aim of cryosurgery is to exactly kill all tumor cells within a closely defined region. For this purpose, we recently proposed an effective approach to perform conformal cryosurgical treatment of tumors by adjuvant use of nano-particles. Such a nanoparticle-enabled cryosurgical modality is termed as nano-cryosurgery. In this study, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues in nano-cryosurgery due to approximate parameters were investigated. Contributions of uncertainties from the tissue area permeated with nanoparticles, the concentration of nanoparticles, and the thermal parameters of tissues were respectively analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this study is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe nano-cryosurgical treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Production planning in Manufacturing-to-Order environments producing complex items must manage the execution of fabrication and/or assembling activities. In case of activities executed by workers, the committed effort can vary over time. To model this behavior, the Variable Intensity formulation has been proposed in the literature. In addition, the activities to be scheduled often represent whole production phases made of distinct production operations. Hence, the utilization of simple finish-to-start precedence relations does not correctly represent the real production process. In such cases Generalized Precedence Relations are used to allow overlapping among activities. However, since in Variable Intensity formulations the percentage execution of the activities is no more univocally related to their time execution, Generalized Precedence Relations cannot completely describe the constraints among activities. In this paper two mathematical formulations of precedence relations based on processing execution are presented to model overlapping between activities. The formulations are applied to an industrial case of production of machining centers and compared in terms of computational efficiency.</jats:p>",

How, though, do their hidden logics work in detail? What are their respective imaginative effects and functions? And, in view of their involvement in discourses of discrimination, are they dispensable? By using the press coverage of the German reunification as a case study, I discuss the social embeddedness and maintenance of fairly traditional spatial concepts in general, and the Euclidean ‘container concept’ in particular on a theoretical level. In everyday social practice, it is argued, these concepts have both constraining and enabling implications. Their constitutive dimension, however, is often neglected in recent critical discourse animated by ‘new’ spatial imaginations such as flows, networks, folds, or rhizomes. In this respect, I argue that everyday ‘containerization’ surely (over)simplifies contingency and complexity. Yet, the ‘closed spaces’ still remain reasonable and to a certain extent, indispensable tools for making the world intelligible by identifying, organizing, and structuring complex phenomena. Hence, instead of only searching for new and ‘more adequate’ spatial representations, the everyday use of the ‘old’ ones should also remain a subject of thorough sociogeographic inquiry. </jats:p>",

This article contains background information on why utilities need an emergency response plan (ERP), and summarizes legislative directives that relate to utility emergency planning. Utility resiliency can be best achieved when an ERP is part of an overarching preparedness program that includes business continuity planning, training and exercises, and plans updates to keep the program current. In this article, the phases of emergency management are explained, along with the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System, both required for use by utilities because utility staff are considered “first responders” under the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5. Development of an ERP is discussed, and an example table of contents for a NIMS compliant ERP is included. Sections of an ERP are described and include communications, suggestions for use with staff, external agencies, the public, and critical customers.</jats:p>",

The effect of these events was the exclusion of those who are seen as outsiders and the reification of narrowly defined ideas of neighbors and neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

During this time, the Court—including the Court of First Instance—issued about one decision per week. The majority of cases concerned nature conservation issues, followed by waste and air-climate change matters. About two thirds of all cases were submitted to the Court by the European Commission. Preliminary cases (Article 234 EC Treaty) took, on average, a time of 19 months, cases under Article 230 21 months, and cases under Article 226 EC Treaty 18 months. However, if one includes in the cases under Article 226 the compulsory pre-judicial period, the average duration of procedures was 47 months, thus almost four years. A closer analysis of the data reveals that this long duration is mainly attributable to the EC Commission.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ghosts, spectres, and spirits and the stories told about them have long been a source of intellectual inquiry; they appear to be everywhere in scholarly discourse yet are largely absent from many recent debates about enchantment and modernity. This paper speculates on what happens to cultural politics when enchanted modernities are seen to encompass ghosts and ghost stories, and considers the political possibilities of specifically modern enchantments that have the power to enchant and disenchant simultaneously. The paper first examines the ways in which understandings of both enchantment and modernity have changed over time and, in particular, the impact of postcolonial theory on reconceptualising the relationship between the two. It then uses a ghost story encountered in fieldwork in South Africa to illustrate how the figures of ghosts and spirits can cast light on the lived experiences of postcolonial modernities. The paper contends that while ghost stories do not necessarily fit with more optimistic politics of enchantment, in the South African context they can represent active political engagement and produce positive political effect, rather than simply disenchanting those modernities that produce them. The paper concludes that an alternative approach is required to navigate between an overly cynical politics that works to disenchant the world and more optimistic accounts that focus on the ethical possibilities of enchantment. This necessitates a close reading of how modernities are enchanted in particular places and to what political effect. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores what is meant by ‘being European’ in contemporary Bosnia. Over the past two decades, Western politicians have justified interventions in Bosnia through recourse to an Orientalist binary between a rational and progressive ‘Europe’, and an irrational and retrogressive ‘Balkans’. Current efforts to incorporate Bosnia into European structures reproduce this imaginary, in this instance though replacing space with time, suggesting that Bosnia needs to move from a ‘Balkan’ past to a ‘European’ future. In this paper I explore the political effects of such imaginaries through two levels of analysis. In the first, I critically examine the ongoing implications of the geopolitical framing of Bosnia as Europe's ‘Other’. In the second, I explore how nationalist politicians have deployed European rhetoric in order to stake claims to resources and establish respect. I conclude by arguing that a sovereignty paradox underpins both ‘geopolitical’ and ‘nationalist’ European rubrics in Bosnia: while idealising forms of solidarity based on broad social and cultural affiliations, such discourses simultaneously seek to promote the state as the primary territorialisation of political life. </jats:p>",

Within this context, students actively construct musical meanings themselves, rather than acquiring those meanings by taking part in musical activities constructed by teachers. An example of this approach is provided in the unit “Sound Escapes,” wherein teacher and students explore their musical environment from the stance of inquiry. Although the academic terminology around inquiry-based learning may be new, music teachers already incorporate the educational principles underlying these strategies by engaging students in their learning through questioning and problem solving. Through this unit, we see how teachers might encourage students' inquiries in music around a schoolwide inquiry project. These ideas are also appropriate for an inquiry stance to planning and instruction within a music program where connections are not related to schoolwide events as they are in the example depicted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The design process of top-down collaborative assembly design is high parallel. There are complex task relationships not only in a task group but also among different task groups, which we call them as inside and outside relationships. A dynamic model of process planning based on hierarchical object-oriented Petri-net (HOOPN) is constructed for top-down collaborative assembly design. The dynamic model represents the outside and inside task relationships including parallel, sequential and coupling relationships. Based on the dynamic model, the dynamic supervising, analysis and decision-making for the states of the design process are implemented. The fuzzy overall evaluation model (FOEM) is utilized for risk evaluation of the design process. The task execution is influenced by local and global risk level from FOEM. Finally, the whole process planning is adjusted and controlled dynamically by the special risk decision-making mechanism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper adopts a perspective which views all cities as unique combinations of social, political, and economic configurations-which sees all cities as ‘ordinary’, and which resists attempts to determine hierarchical relations amongst cities as potentially damaging to rich and poor cities alike. While current urban theories tend to draw attention to the dynamism of globalising economic sectors, much urban policy directed at poorer countries is preoccupied with the delivery of basic services. Both urban theory and urban policy need to be reframed to address the diversity of activities and interests in cities, and to support a more inclusive and hopefully redistributive form of urban development. In the process of formulating citywide visions, urban managers in the two cities discussed here, although drawn to compete with other cities in a global arena, have also had to find ways to address diverse economies and unequal societies. This paper draws on the examples of city visioning processes in Johannesburg and Durban in South Africa to illustrate how developmental and growth-oriented urban policy agendas have been brought together in the complex political environments of these cities. These case studies suggest that the process of formulating a citywide strategy, and of thinking about the future of the city as a whole, required that policy makers attend to the many different and often competing demands in the locality. For urban theorists, this generates new kinds of research agendas-for example, considering how urban improvements can be spread across the different areas and constituencies of a city without sacrificing economic growth. Here, the benefits of supporting the generalised agglomerations economies of a city as opposed to specialised globalising clusters emerge as important. This paper suggests that urban theory can learn from the process of city visioning, despite the various problems associated with these exercises. In turn, theories which approach all cities as ordinary could reinforce policies which address both economic growth and inequality.</jats:p>",

The tortuous flow of water through contemporary Mumbai presents one of the most striking indicators of persistent social inequalities within the postcolonial metropolis. We find that the city's dysfunctional water infrastructure has its roots within the colonial era but these incipient weaknesses have been exacerbated in recent years by rapid urban growth, authoritarian forms of political mobilization, and the dominance of middle-class interests within a denuded public realm. It is argued that the water and sanitation crisis facing Mumbai needs to be understood in relation to the particularities of capitalist urbanization and state formation in an Indian context. </jats:p>",

Inadequate reserves or cost provisions of a poorly planned O&amp;M budget can compromise project operability and trigger significant revenue losses of even a well-designed project. O&amp;M is therefore to be considered as a key element to help ensure component longevity and project success. Though advances in wind turbine technology have lessened the burden of O&amp;M on projects, wind farms still require a sound O&amp;M programme to achieve expected levels of performance and consistent revenues. This paper will highlight the main elements to be considered in developing an O&amp;M plan, while showing the evolution of various O&amp;M budget costs as a function of advances in technology. Hélimax's findings are mostly based on publicly available O&amp;M history in Europe, though relevant parameters relative to harsh climate will also be discussed. </jats:p>",

This paper explores a case of such resistance by the New South Wales political system: the decision to disband the Hawkesbury–Nepean Catchment Management Trust. This discontinuation of the administrative coordination and community engagement aimed at restoring the health of Sydney's major river system is herein characterised as a deliberative truncation. Discussion of what would constitute constructive ecological institutional and policy settings was cut short by intolerant notions of efficacy sustained by political/administrative routines. Analysis of this truncation is progressed through a nexus between three mutually informative theories of modernity dealing with the policy challenges facing liberal democratic societies today. </jats:p>",

Bourdieu's relational concepts are reviewed with reference to evidence from in-depth interviews with business actors in London and Frankfurt at the time of European Economic Monetary Union.

As a metaphor for a bounded and stable identity, the ideal of home is regarded as dangerous by theorists who oppose a politics based on nostalgic appeals to unity and privilege. Home is criticised as an exclusionary and depoliticising space. Scholars such as Iris Marion Young and Geraldine Pratt argue, however, that we should be wary of rejecting home, since the material space of home provides valuable support for individual and collective narratives of identity. In this paper I reflect on these debates in the light of my father's experience of dementia and the move from his own home into residential care. I examine alternatives to the account of identity on which critiques of home as exclusionary space are based, such as narrative identities and Jessica Benjamin's intersubjective approach to the self and the concrete other. </jats:p>",

Current models of urban homelessness emphasise both the strategies by which spaces of homelessness are disciplined and contained, and the tactics deployed by homeless people to negotiate this containment. Whilst recognising the value of such work, we argue that there is a need to move beyond this ‘rationalist’ reading of the homeless city to recognise the importance of emotion and affect in the lives of homeless people, and the traces such emotions leave on the homeless city. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we chart the journeys and pauses made by homeless people in the city of Bristol, UK. We show how the geography of homelessness thus described moves beyond current accounts of the homeless city rooted in an understanding of the strategic or tactical use of space and allows for a more nuanced reading of urban space able to take proper account of the less visible, more ‘transient’ reinscriptions of place that mark the presence of homeless people in the city. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers and others have become increasingly interested in the intersections between globalization, disease, and security, particularly in relation to ‘short-wave’ public health threats such as SARS and pandemic influenza, but ‘long-wave’ epidemics such as HIV/AIDS are also often said to raise questions of security. While a literature is emerging to analyze the politics of security in relation to global HIV/AIDS relief, in this paper I argue that it is also important analytically and politically to connect and contrast this with the ways that HIV/AIDS is politicized as a security issue in relation to immigration and asylum within Western states themselves. Drawing on literatures in governmentality, biopolitics, and security, I examine the politics of HIV/AIDS, immigration, and asylum in the UK from 1997 to 2007 with particular reference to the reactionary press coverage that influenced policy formation and judicial rulings in this period. Following the work of William Walters, I trace the emergence of a ‘domopolitical’ rationality in press reporting around HIV/AIDS in terms of a number of imaginative geographies, and suggest that these imaginative geographies are both biopolitical in a classical sense and connected with the colonial dimensions of the present. The circulation of these imaginative geographies through policy and legal developments, the dilemmas they have raised, and resistance to them from medical, civil society, and parliamentary groups are then outlined. Reflecting on the disjuncture in approaches to HIV/AIDS between the global and national spheres, I argue that while the association of HIV/AIDS and security is enhancing life chances for many it is also reducing them for people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. </jats:p>",

In Israel, following this shift, a new claim for biased allocation has been voiced by the ethnonational majority, politicians, and administrators, which is based on multiculturalism and recognition. According to this claim, land allocation should serve the communal needs of the majority by limiting the access of minority groups to the majority group's residential areas. In this paper I argue that, despite the decline of ethnonationalism, the discourse of multiculturalism remains a substitute discourse that rationalizes the interests of the majority group, hence contributing to the stratification of societies on the basis of ethnicity. Through an analysis of three case studies of land allocation in Israel, the paper explores the material and cultural weaknesses of a multiculturalism that has been imported from societies with a strong liberal-democratic tradition into societies with a profound ethnonational legacy. </jats:p>",

However this growth has also led to an increase in emissions which contribute to climate change. The exclusion of international aviation emissions from the targets under the Kyoto Protocol means that little action has been taken to address this impact. In 2005, the European Commission set out its comprehensive approach for addressing aviation's impact on climate change and in December 2006 made a legislative proposal for the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Both the Council and the European Parliament broadly support the Commission's proposal but have proposed detailed amendments to the proposed legislation. This Article analyses the position adopted by each institution so far and the next steps for the adoption of the legislation.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an optimization-based method to solve the smooth trajectory planning problem where the user knows only the start and end points of the end-effector or the via point plus the start and end target points. For the start and end target points, we use an optimization approach to determine the manipulator configurations. Having obtained the desired minimum jerk path in the Cartesian space using the minimum jerk theory and having represented each joint motion by the third-degree B-spline curve with unknown parameters (i.e., control points), an optimization approach, rather than the pseudoinverse technique for inverse kinematics, is used to calculate the control points of each joint spline curve. The objective function includes several parts: (a) dynamic effort; (b) the inconsistency function, which is the joint rate change (first derivative) and predicted overall trend from the initial point to the end point; and (c) the nonsmoothness function of the trajectory, which is the second derivative of the joint trajectory. This method can be used for robotic manipulators with any number of degrees of freedom. Minimum jerk trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint movements, for their amenability to limit robot vibrations, and for their control (i.e., enhancement of control performance). Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the method.</jats:p>",

Responses to these ‘wicked’ problems include the development of postnormal science in the early 1990s. In subsequent literature on postnormal sustainability technologies, multiactor approaches to decision making are beginning to emerge. I examine an example: the development in New Zealand of a 100-year vision: the Auckland Sustainability Framework. Developed over fifteen months through ‘messy’ consultation across stakeholders, it has provided a clumsy’ outcome, namely one which enabled multiple viewpoints to be expressed and responded to by others. The process adopted offers evidence in support of the development of sustainability frameworks over much longer timescales than the current norm in local authorities, and indications of how such processes may unfold. </jats:p>",

Two different implementation criteria are being tested in an ongoing series of trials providing further considerations. One prototype uses MAXON's CINEMA4D XPRESSO ® visual scripting environment to set up a semi-automated design environment which allows users to edit one feature-based 3D model of massing alternative at a time. The other prototype uses ILOG's OPL STUDIO ® constraint programming environment to achieve fully automated search and 2D visualization of all possible solution alternatives to separate subdomains of the building massing design problem. </jats:p>",

The changes are traced both in the realm of research and social policy. It is argued that demographic transition theory remained the main explanatory model but that its modified version which gives precedence to ideational vs. structural variables gained the dominant status. In the realm of social policy the ideology of family planning was replaced by population policy ideology. It is further argued that alarming discourses and sharp rhetoric about population problems did not result in formulation of a system of specific measures of population policy. Thus, the author claims, demographic discourses that at the time saturated public spaces were constitutive for - gender and national -identity politics and not inconsequential for social policy.</jats:p>"

In Toronto recent rescaling and restructuring of regional government provide a potential opportunity for new modes of regional governance. Will transportation in the Toronto region remain bifurcated into a premium network of transport infrastructure systems, on the one hand, and underserved community-based systems, on the other hand? We argue that the existing transportation situation has become a bottleneck for the continued globalization of the region, because global and local circuits of mobility are not well coordinated and various scales of decision making do not visibly interact for the regional good. At this point we ask whether there is an emerging collective actor (or collective actors) to remedy the situation, or whether we can instead expect the anarchic governance model of the recent past, with its biases towards suburban road building, to continue. We are particularly interested in casting light on the institutions that have been created (or dismantled) to deal with comprehensive transportation planning in the region. We posit that, in the context of recent institutional reforms, transportation agencies had to adjust, and we pose a series of research questions as a means of exploring and understanding those adjustments. </jats:p>",

Travel to such places is commonly perceived as ‘risky’, and takes young people outside the protective cocoon of UK health and safety legislation. One of the functions played by the providers of gap year projects is to mediate risk. On the basis of analysis of promotional literature, interviews with organisers of gap year projects, and focus groups of returned volunteers, in this paper I argue that the various strategies of risk mediation undertaken by gap year providers serve to reconcile modernising tendencies in UK society toward risk control and structure with postmodern inclinations towards individualisation and uncertainty. </jats:p>",

We used graph theory to characterize multiple aspects of landscape connectivity in a habitat network in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A).<jats:sup>.</jats:sup> We compared this landscape with simulated networks with known topology, resistance to disturbance, and rate of movement. We introduced graph measures such as compartmentalization and clustering, which can be used to identify locations on the landscape that may be especially resilient to human development or areas that may be most suitable for conservation. Our analyses indicated that for songbirds the Piedmont habitat network was well connected. Furthermore, the habitat network had commonalities with planar networks, which exhibit slow movement, and scale‐free networks, which are resistant to random disturbances. These results suggest that connectivity in the habitat network was high enough to prevent the negative consequences of isolation but not so high as to allow rapid spread of disease. Our graph‐theory framework provided insight into regional and emergent global network properties in an intuitive and visual way and allowed us to make inferences about rates and paths of species movements and vulnerability to disturbance. This approach can be applied easily to assessing habitat connectivity in any fragmented or patchy landscape.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

While literatures have examined the extent to which institutions can adapt to management defined by hydrological zones, the significance of other sociotechnical spaces to sustainable water management has been overlooked in these debates. In this paper, having demonstrated the hybridity of the hydrological cycle, we argue that more attention needs to be given to the interaction between regional, network, and fluid spatialities in sustainable water management. More specifically, we examine the fluid work of intermediaries in between regional and network spaces in the translation of regional strategies into local practice. We conclude by looking at the implications of understanding the relationship between regions, networks, and fluids for water governance specifically and environmental governance more generally. </jats:p>",

Function and process orientation serves as a basis for the integration. It is discussed how development projects teams can benefit by generating project plans including resource estimations and predefined interfaces to bordering disciplines along the development process. With the help of semantic parsing methods of natural language requirements and through a generic classification system a requirement based product and process model is generated. This model is then taken as the basis for deriving product and process related information.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Between 1948 and 1959, perceptions of Israeli water resources changed dramatically from a strong belief in water abundance in the prestate period to an equally strong and unequivocal belief in water scarcity after 1959. This paper tells the story of how the water resources of Israel came to be constructed as scarce. On the substantive level, the paper tells the story of the dismantling of a network of water abundance and the emergence, instead, of a network of water scarcity and centralization, which helped to construct all of the following: water resource scarcity as ‘fact’; centralized policy-making institutions as most ‘efficient’; centralized technologies as ‘appropriate’; the national space as the only source of identity; the national scale of water management as ‘necessary’; a strong and centralized state as ‘legitimate’; legal precedents for the use of state apparatus for surveillance, discipline, and control over water resources; and, consequently, a form of citizenship that is seen as at once heroic and disciplined. On the theoretical level, in this paper I argue that the ontological distinction often assumed between scientific (eg water scarcity) and political (eg centralized nation-state) fields of practice is exaggerated, especially in literature on water politics in Israel. I further demonstrate that technoscientific debates about water availability, efficient technologies for its utilization, and appropriate institutions for its management are constitutive of relations of power and government and are themselves implicated in the construction of an Israeli style of government. </jats:p>",

The proposed scheme is guidance based, realtime applicable, and ensures safety and passenger ride comfort. Based on the principles of <jats:italic>Rendezvous Guidance</jats:italic>, the passing vehicle is guided in real-time to match the position and velocity of a <jats:italic>shadow</jats:italic> target (i.e., rendezvous with) during the overtaking manoeuvre. The shadow target’s position and velocity are generated based on real-time sensory information gathered about the slower vehicle ahead of the passing vehicle as well as other vehicles which may be travelling in the passing lane. Namely, the guidance principle is also used to prevent any potential collision with these <jats:italic>obstacle</jats:italic> vehicles. The proposed method can be used as a fully autonomous system or simply as a driver-assistance tool. Extensive simulations and experiments, some of which are presented herein, clearly demonstrate the tangible efficiency of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Like Bergson's philosophy, Lefebvre's urban criticism denounced the spatialization of time and gave priority to lived experience over the abstractions employed by static intellectual or traditionally analytical models of experience. Throughout The Urban Revolution, The Production of Space, The Critique of Everyday Life, Volumes 1–3, and the writings posthumously collected in Rhythmanalysis, Lefebvre's urban philosophical project appropriated the ideas Bergson advanced in his three major works, Time and Free Will, Matter and Memory, and Creative Evolution, through their application to the problems of social life—a de facto collaboration that Bergson never lived to appreciate and that Lefebvre would never recognize. This connection is important not only as a corrective to the scant attention paid to Lefebvre's work by philosophers, but also because it reinforces both thinkers' own emphases on interdisciplinarity and on reconciling theories of knowledge with theories of life. The combined work of the two philosophers suggests a philosophical basis for the current emphasis of theory in both cultural studies and human geography in that it stresses the importance of acknowledging movement, process, and mobilities in approaches to the problems of urban life. The composite of Bergson–Lefebvre provides the basis for articulating a philosophy of the urban.</jats:p>",

More specifically, we describe the concept for a taxi-planning support tool that aims to optimize the routing and scheduling of airport surface traffic in such a way as to deconflict the taxi plans while optimizing delay, total taxi-time, or some other airport efficiency metric. Certain input parameters related to resource demand, such as the expected landing times and the expected pushback times, are rather difficult to predict accurately. Due to uncertainty in the input data driving the taxi-planning process, the taxi-planning tool is designed such that it produces solutions that are robust to uncertainty. The taxi-planning concept presented herein, which is based on mixed-integer linear programming, is designed such that it is able to adapt to perturbations in these input conditions, as well as to account for failure in the actual execution of surface trajectories. The capabilities of the tool are illustrated in a simple hypothetical airport.</jats:p>"

It is also rolling out an internationally accepted framework of bioethics regulation.

Based on a simplified representation of a linear urban economy, a general-equilibrium model is designed and its properties are investigated by using numerical simulations. The model includes a spacious industrial centre, in which agglomeration externalities are differentiated over space, and a residential area that suffers from pollution, which is also differentiated over space. For the sake of simplicity urban environmental externalities are analyzed as being proportional to fossil fuel use, so that energy taxes would be a logical instrument. Environmental technology choice by firms is used as a tool for coping with environmental externalities, and is endogenized. Using this model we are able to generate interesting and sometimes surprising results for the city under consideration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> I explore a contemporary politics of social reproduction among middle-class youth in Silicon Valley during the economic downturn subsequent to the tech boom of the 1990s. Drawing on ethnographic data collected at a public high school serving middle-class and affluent youth, I examine the relationship of the school and community environment to students' styles of self-cultivation and aspiration. In particular, I explore values and notions of success—such as freedom of expression, the pursuit of authentic passions, and conventional markers of academic and social achievement—that shape students' forms of self-discipline, self-definition, and aspiration. While arguing that young people's styles of self-cultivation suggest an entitled orientation toward work and life that may promote class privilege, I suggest that they also reflect a neoliberal politics of citizenship-shaping processes of social reproduction through schooling for middle-class youth. This politics of citizenship obligates middle-class youth to ‘package’ or market authentic personal traits to showcase their exceptional qualities, well-roundedness, and authentic originality, and to frame such acts in terms of personal choice. Linking such processes of subjectification to political–economic and social conditions, I ultimately argue that middle-class youth bear increasing responsibility for middle-class status. Moreover, I suggest that the pressures resulting from this burden and the ways in which young people negotiate them suggest a domestic politics of ‘hyper-vigilance’ that may transform young people's self-perceptions, attitudes towards schooling, and aspirations, while also potentially posing risks to youth. </jats:p>",

The research on ERP has focused on events leading to the selection, evaluation, and implementation of the ERP system. The intent of this updated research effort is to capture new theories that can help practitioners successfully manage ERP systems by performing a post-ERP implementation examination of eight corporations and a pertinent research review.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Retailing in China has become an important engine driving the nation's economy. Along with the rapid expansion in scale, the retail industry has also experienced profound structural changes in cities. The transformation of the retail sector in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai is characterized by a realignment of ownership structure, diversification of retail functions, the emergence of new retail formats, the increasing concentration of retail capital and rapid expansion of retail chains, and spatial restructuring and retail suburbanization. The transformation not only reflects the changing supply and demand relations and the interaction between retailing and consumption but also is intrinsically connected to the shift in government policies. We present a political-economy perspective to explain the dramatic retail changes that have occurred in Chinese cities. In particular, we discuss the role of the state in retail transformation and in urban and economic development in general. We argue that the concept of ‘developmental state’ and its alternate variants such as ‘local state corporatism’ and ‘entrepreneurial state’ provide valuable and illuminating insights to the understanding of how the Chinese state (and especially the local states) acts in developing the economy in the reform era. Nevertheless, these notions need to be revisited to better recognize the complex and dynamic nature of the Chinese state. Instead, we propose that the Chinese state is better understood as a ‘fragmented developmental state’, which displays a strong progrowth orientation but which also suffers from a fragmented administrative structure, an inconsistent regulatory system, and market-distorting activities in the transformation from a socialist state to a developmental state of its own kind. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For impoverished African states the attraction of inward flows of capital is vital and migrants are one such source of finance. Some governments actively encourage this, which brings out tensions between national affiliation and more particularistic forms of identification. This paper examines this in the context of Ghana. Between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s there was largescale out-migration from Ghana, creating what has been termed a ‘neo-diaspora’. The migrants have mainly settled in cities in Western Europe and North America where they have developed institutional networks linking them to other diasporic locations and to Ghana. These migrants have complex identities forged from multiple meetings in numerous places. Some of these are rooted in hometown, clan, and family attachments and the obligations this brings. The current government (in line with many developing countries) is making a major play to ‘harness’ the diaspora for political support and inward investment. Tensions are being played out about dual citizenship and whether the migrants’ economic commitments to Ghana are matched by rights as full citizens. The Ghana government has to tread a careful path between attracting investment and garnering the right sort of political support, since people in the diaspora often have an ambivalent relationship to domestic politics. One of the vehicles through which the Ghanaian state seeks to square this is through encouraging hometown associations in various cities in the global North to fund development at the local level through various local–local partnerships. Hence, the nation, the national good, and development are being promoted through particularistic ethnic and locality-based organisations, which brings to light multiple and overlapping political communities. </jats:p>",

Media attention to high-profile cases of dysfunction has been matched by vigorous government determination to identify and remedy perceived weaknesses in the provision of public services. Research on organizational environments suggests that poor public-service performance may be the result of external pressures. However, few studies have systematically investigated the effects of the environment on public-service failure. We formalize and test a comprehensive model of the impact of environmental constraints on organizational failure across the public sector in England between 2002 and 2004. The results show that the munificence, complexity, and dynamism of organizational environments are significant predictors of the extent of public-service failure. </jats:p>",

The empirical results from a variety of models suggest that the rate of per capita housing-start growth, and to a lesser extent, political liberalism, and the percentage of state land devoted to urban uses are all consistent predictors of state smart-growth-policy adoption. In addition, analyses of associations between policy areas reveals positive associative adoption patterns between urban revitalization and land-preservation policy. Positive associations were also found between growth control and housing-affordability policies. </jats:p>",

In the first section, we present the outcome of three surveys on the process and success factors for ERP projects. The first survey was undertaken in 2003 in Germany, the second in 2004 in the United States, and the third in 2006 in Turkey. The results are discussed in light of Hofstede’s model of cultural factors. In the second section we evaluate common ERP lifecycle models. In spite of the great variety of potential advantages, it is also necessary to illuminate the real effects of standard ERP software in practice. Recent studies have revealed that 81% of German companies interviewed using SAP do not fully exploit the software’s ability to optimize business processes, though 61% stated that SAP offers very good process optimization opportunities (Ploenzke, 2000). Therefore we evaluated popular lifecycle models with respect to their suitability to implement standard software in a process-driven way (Kuehl &amp; Knoell, 2002). In the third section we present a semi-process-oriented approach lifecycle model for the implementation and release changeover of ERP systems. This lifecycle model was developed from the authors’ experience in practice, and its practical relevance was evaluated in real-world projects. This approach is also assessed in light of the criteria presented in the second section.</jats:p>"

Typically cost, quality and time are the indices for manufacturability assessment in generating manufacturing process plans. In this paper, we propose the idea of introducing sustainability to complement cost, quality and time to arrive at alternative sustainable plans in identified manufacturing processes. To be sustainable, it is pertinent that manufacturing firms understand the energy consumption of different manufacturing equipment used to produce products. This will enable industry to implement energy reduction processes in a more effective manner and pave the way for improved and alternate manufacturing solutions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dynamic programming (DP) inherently provides a methodology for evaluating a series of decisions in order to determine an optimal policy or path forward. The methodology basically enumerates and evaluates alternative states over the planning horizon in formulating the optimum strategy. In the present work, the concept of DP has been applied to pipeline long-range facility planning problems, and further extended to allow evaluation of nth optimum pipeline facility deployments based on cost and/or probabilities of constraints. The best four options were further analyzed considering uncertainties in the cost elements and the resulting economic risk associated with each optimum path. This paper presents the theory behind the extension of the DP methodology to pipeline long-range facility-planning problems over a planning horizon that considers inherent uncertainties in gas supply and demand as well as a range of available facility options. Uncertainties in the size and location of the required facilities to handle the forecast volumes, and associated variances in their respective cost to build and operate the various facilities, are all accounted for. The problem is further complicated by the possible changes in the expected flow from that forecast during design and the resulting penalties associated with the under- or over-sizing of facilities. It was demonstrated that it is important that the off-design flow forecast be evaluated to determine the impact of future variability or changes. The value that the organization can derive from being able to quantify the benefit (or penalty) of forecast uncertainty and over- or under-building long-range facilities, is significant.</jats:p>",

Whilst government support is often based on overcoming market failures in the availability or use of supports to SMEs, I argue that successful government intervention is difficult to make effective at realistic cost – benefit ratios. The analysis demonstrates little evidence of market failure in provision or take-up of business support. If a market gap existed in the past, it is no longer apparent. Any systemic market failures that remain can influence only the start-up, very early stage growth, and/or the very smallest single-person businesses. I also find that different modes of delivery by centralised, regionalised, or localised structures have very little influence on market penetration. Decentralisation can increase take-up marginally, but this has been achieved only with tenfold increases in costs and major increases in administrative complexity. There is some marginal but significant benefit of policy delivery being in the hands of market, or near-market, agencies. But for all delivery bodies there is massive variability in use, impact, and satisfaction levels achieved. Finally, a brief analysis of gender differences suggests some significant variations in use of advice from different sources, but that government sources have some of the most adverse use levels for female-headed business, and this particularly applies to Business Link. Over the period 1991 – 2004 there is little to indicate the overwhelming success of government SME support policies, particularly at the level of cost that they now involve. </jats:p>",

This paper uses ethnographic research on student politicians from rich farming backgrounds to reflect on class ‘in the making’. Building on a critical reading of the work of Bourdieu, I document the ability of young men from rich farming families in western Uttar Pradesh to entrench their middle-class standing in the space of university politics. I pay particular attention to the local-level political networks through which upwardly mobile young men from rural middle-caste backgrounds seek to express, legitimate, and secure their power. The paper points to the imaginative and energetic manner in which middle classes in poorer countries may defend their interests within local politics. I stress the importance of studying middle-class formation relationally and with reference to the spatiality of power. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine how cities and towns provide services in the United States and Canada. Comparative analysis focuses on the role of the private sector in service delivery and the factors that affect city managers' decisions to contract out services. Study of the selection of the most effective form of service delivery is particularly instructive at the local level of government because that is where change occurred first and where most research has been focused. Research shows that Canadians have a more coordinated market economy, greater faith in government, and more communitarian values. Thus we hypothesize that Canadian municipalities will offer more services overall but fewer through the private sector than their American counterparts. We provide a comparative view of the forces that motivate city managers to change service-delivery modes. Our data come from the first survey of municipal service delivery in Canadian cities conducted in 2004. We replicated an earlier US survey conducted by the International Cities/Counties Management Association in 2002–03. Privatization plays an important role in the provision of municipal services in both countries. We found support for a view of a more pragmatic city manager than that envisioned in the public choice theory. City managers implement adjustment policies to facilitate restructuring; integrate community voices into the process to accommodate diverse views; and privatize only when contract-monitoring problems can be managed. As expected, Canadian municipalities provided more services than their American counterparts. Contrary to expectations, however, Canadian local governments had higher rates of privatized services and greater numbers of privatization plans. Because of the devolution of services by Canadian provinces to the cities without the necessary funding, it is conceivable that Canadian managers may have been under more pressure to restructure than their American counterparts. There was evidence, for example, that Ontario and Alberta, where pressures have been the highest during the Klein and Harris governments, had significantly higher privatization rates. </jats:p>",

In some systems, however, to reduce the complexity of the planning problem, distinct production operations are aggregated into activities which normally represent production phases. This is the case of some Manufacturing-to-Order and Engineering-to-Order Systems. The lack of a detailed schedule of the manufacturing operations can cause difficulties in providing a proper Material Requirements Planning and can affect the feasibility of the production plan. The paper proposes an approach to extract scheduling information from a production plan, grounding on the knowledge of the production process, to support material procurement. Once a criterion to aggregate operations is chosen and the plan devised, the description of production operations and their precedence relations are used to obtain temporal ranges for production operations and, hence, deadline ranges are provided for the MRP. The proposed approach is applied to an industrial environment producing machining centers.</jats:p>",

A great deal of attention has furthermore been devoted to connect the internal disciplinary debate with the wider discourse of the social sciences that deal with economic development in general and with the role of innovation in particular. In the present paper I argue that the field of the social study of technology (SST) can inspire research in economic geography in important respects: SST research has an explicit focus on the genesis of sociotechnical configurations; it has developed sector-related and technology-related multilevel theories of sociotechnical change; it has a strong emphasis on innovation dynamics and sector transformations; and finally, it has a focus on strategic planning in multiactor settings and thus favors foresight and participatory planning approaches in science, technology, and innovation policy. SST-inspired research could thus be an interesting partner for those approaches within economic geography that share some ontological starting positions with regard to actors, the role of institutions, and a revolutionary and multilevel analysis of sociotechnical transformation processes.</jats:p>",

Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, I use the certification processes of the Forest Stewardship Council as an example, because its processes of verification through embodied and emplaced fieldwork explicitly seek to make abstract standards of environmental management ‘fieldworthy’ in different places and thus enable their implementation on the ground through specific environmental knowledge practices. Hence, it is only through the field as a shared space that certification processes can work (and travel) in the interests of better environmental management. The space of fieldwork thus enables knowledge workers to exploit the uncertainty, heterogeneity, and discretion in environmental science and management more readily than do other spaces, rendering these qualities more beneficial than problematic. </jats:p>",

Successful adaptation requires assessment of hazards from a physical science perspective, and appropriate communication with the communities. Transforming a hazard assessment exercise into an effective plan for adaptation requires an intimate cultural understanding. Hazard assessment involving substantial input from all research, administrative, socio-economic and cultural communities will lead to more appropriate and valuable analyses of risk, sensitivity and vulnerability. Residents and communities can contribute greatly to the identification and assessment of natural hazards. Community-driven communication is essential for meaningful risk analysis, adaptive planning and vulnerability assessment. Developing relationships with local media can be extremely beneficial. Using the practices of participatory community planning allows local environmental changes to be assessed and responded to by the people affected. Establishing effective working partnerships is essential for a true vulnerability assessment. The particularly sensitive nature of hazard assessments indicating increasing risk and vulnerability, and the continuing socio-economic changes in some communities, in the work described here, required consideration of the most appropriate methods of communication for each instance. The relationships that have emerged through the course of work in the communities have differed markedly from those originally envisioned, and also exhibit significant differences between communities.</jats:p>",

The regional development and international-business literatures are used to develop a conceptual framework on the links between autonomy, the use of networks, and domestic sourcing. Data from a survey of German, French, and US FOS in the UK is used to test the model. The results indicate that increased use of networks and increased operational decision-making autonomy are associated with increased domestic sourcing, but that only a minority of FOS are increasing their use of domestic sourcing. The growing importance of global sourcing is considered as a possible explanation for the low proportion of FOS that are increasing their use of domestic sourcing. The implications for regional-development policy of the findings are also assessed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the genealogy of domestic security in the United States through an analysis of post-World War II civil defense. Specifically, we describe the development of an organizational framework and set of techniques for approaching security threats that we call ‘distributed preparedness’. Distributed preparedness was initially articulated in civil defense programs in the early stages of the Cold War, when US government planners began to conceptualize the nation as a possible target of nuclear attack. These planners assumed that the enemy would focus its attacks on urban and industrial centers that were essential to US war-fighting capability. Distributed preparedness provided techniques for mapping national space as a field of potential targets, and grafted this map of vulnerabilities onto the structure of territorial administration in the United States. It presented a new model of coordinated planning for catastrophic threats, one that sought to limit federal intervention in local life and to preserve the characteristic features of American federalism. Over the course of the Cold War, distributed preparedness extended to new domains, and following 9/11 it has moved to the center of security discussions in the US. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1994 special economic zones (SEZs) were introduced in Poland as an instrument supporting regional development. Initially, the idea was to open just a handful of zones located in single-function industrial regions affected by or exposed to structural unemployment. Investor benefits included a full income-tax holiday for a half of the special zone's life (typically ten years) and exemption from real-estate taxation. Subsequently, the initial conditions were considerably modified under the influence of various pressure groups, including the European Commission, the central government, major international investors, and local authorities. The tax benefits were reduced, but the eligibility was extended to new industries and new company types while the overall number of special zones consistently increased. With more than 150 locations enjoying a special status, the SEZs have lost their nature of regional policy tools, almost becoming standard forms of public aid for companies, regardless of their location. This shift in the approach to the special zones had a fundamental impact on the effects generated by the special zones. The investor appeal of areas where state support was essential to overcome a structural economic crisis was further undermined. Indeed, the bulk of investment and jobs was channeled to the zones comfortably located in southwestern Poland near large urban agglomerations with a labor market that was attractive to the investors (the Katowicka, Legnicka, and Wa-brzyska zones). However, few large and middle-sized investments were acquired by single-function industrial areas in crisis (Starachowicka and Tarnobrzeska SEZs) or by peripheral agricultural regions (Warmińsko-Mazurska i Suwalska SEZs). A notable exception to this rule is the first Polish special zone in Mielec: although peripherally located, it achieved success using the first-comer advantage it had over the subsequent zones. </jats:p>",

Explaining the findings with incremental political theory, they serve as the basis for some reflections on the planned recast of the IPPC Directive and the prospects for better regulation. This first part of the article displays the basic shortcomings of the IPPC review process (1.) the concepts of integration under the Directive (2.) and the empirical analysis of the national approaches to integrated permitting (3.1 – 3.3). The second part which will be published in the subsequent JEEPL issue explains and evaluates the findings with regard to the pending revision of the Directive.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

First-year high school students of English in Japan were asked to do an oral story-retelling task with a class partner under one of three conditions: without any prior planning ( n = 17), after 5 minutes of unguided planning ( n = 20), or after 5 minutes of planning with guidance in the form of a grammar handout about English relative clauses ( n = 19). The resulting narratives were analyzed for task essentialness, amount and quality of use of relativization, and global complexity and fluency. It was found that the guided planning group produced more and more accurate relative clauses in their narratives than the other two groups, to both statistically significant and large degrees, while at the same time exhibiting global levels of complexity and fluency that were similar to those of the other two groups. The results show that guided planning can succeed in creating favorable conditions for striking a pedagogical balance between communication and grammar, even with high school learners at incipient levels of proficiency and under conditions that are typical of many foreign language contexts. </jats:p>",

This promise is in keeping with local policy trends in the Vancouver region toward visions of sustainability and with growing attention by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to environmental sustainability concerns. We demonstrate that interests in sustainability at local and international scales may differ markedly, however, resulting in a range of possible legacies for Vancouver and the international Olympic movement from the 2010 Winter Olympics. To move beyond the fruitless search for a universally acceptable definition of sustainability, we investigate different meanings of sustainability using the tool of the ‘language game’, originally devised by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Examining sustainability as a language game in the planning phase of the 2010 Olympics allows us to consider the potential and likely scenarios for sustainability wins and losses, internationally and in the local context. Four possible scenarios are considered. In the most optimistic scenario, sustainability language converges across the international and local language systems, aiding the development of sustainability in Vancouver policy, charting a course for Olympic cities to follow, and creating institutional change within the IOC as well. In the contrasting scenario, the failure to find common ground in sustainability pursuits could doom the concept both for future Olympic cities and for policy practice in Vancouver. Two other mixed outcome scenarios are considered as well. This analysis leads to insight into the boundaries of the meaning of sustainability in the context of a megaevent, in which, more than any particular demonstration project, the communicated message of sustainability may be the most lasting legacy. </jats:p>",

Existing software can generate proxies of the would be reality, but do not accurately simulate the impact of alternative urban regulations. CityZoom is a Decision Support System for urban planning which not only provides CAD tools, but also allows users to evaluate and modify the city model according to different constraints such as solar radiation, luminance, terrain's pervious conditions, etc‥ By simulating specific urban regulations and addressing environmental comfort issues, CityZoom helps architects to simultaneously evaluate the different attributes of a particular design. Coupled with GIS tools, CityZoom allows users to perform multiple analyses over the existing database and use the resultant feedback to optimize proposed solutions. Future developments envisage giving CityZoom a more autonomous role, using artificial intelligence to optimize building shapes and dimensions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper highlights the role played by the specious present or moment, what some call the present of the now, in geographical discussions of social change. Its most explicit treatment as a temporal framing for such change has been in performative approaches, with their stress on the capacity of immersive body practices to produce difference through the ongoing repetition of such practices, a difference that plays on what is habitually or instinctively accessed through each specious present. However, we can also find debates focused on large-scale social practices that have combined various forms of structural or institutional contingency (ie customary practices, past investment cycles, etc) with becoming and which see becoming as rooted in the everyday reiteration of such practices, an interpretation that also privileges the moment as the point when becoming is actualised. Brought together, these different approaches provide the basis for a more broadly based interpretation of change focused on the specious present. This paper explores the case for this broader interpretation. It is divided into four sections. The first reviews those philosophical discussions of the specious present that have attracted most attention from human geographers. The second reviews the ways in which the geographical debate has used the specious present as a framing for change. The third examines how these different geographical treatments fill or extend the specious present, whilst the fourth and final section considers the implications of such thinking for how we interpret change. </jats:p>",

To ensure that these targets are met, the European Commission put forward a set of proposed policy instruments, the Climate and Energy Package, in January 2008. A key element of the adopted Package is the proposed Directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, a technology which can help tackle emissions from energy generation from fossil fuel sources which will otherwise compromise EU climate objectives. This paper lays out policy options to incentivise the deployment of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the EU and presents the proposed Directive.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of confidence intervals.

In general, studies of indicators lack an overall normative framework that allows decision makers or the public to make sense of the many overlapping and partial measures. A statewide urban growth model for California was run iteratively with the California statewide travel model to evaluate major transportation scenarios, such as freeway widening and high-speed rail. In addition, transportation and land use policies intended to provide more affordable housing accessible to jobs, widespread habitat protection, and strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated. This model provides many performance measures for travel, economic welfare and equity, rents paid, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicular air pollution, and habitat loss. A framework for interpreting these data on the basis of recent advances in the theories of well-being for individuals and nations is proposed. This theoretical framework for evaluating the model outputs used in planning also applies to the analysis of the empirical indicators used to track actual outcomes. </jats:p>",

The results demonstrate that the main influence source of ERP adoption is a mix of influence sources for all adopters. Before the millennium, the internal model shows the higher power of explanation. And after the millennium, the main influences become external influence sources. With different diffusion patterns between, before, and after the millennium, the analysis results confirm that the millennium is a critical point.

In the enlarging European Union, migration forecasts are often carried out upon requests from mass-migration-fearing policy makers. Most forecasts are based on key principles and working practices adhered to in neoclassical economics and spatial science—notably, equilibrium and place. Offering apparent numerical certainty, migration forecasts speak to a latent desire for aesthetic sociospatial order. Migration is considered a disequilibrium phenomenon, and linear movements and final destinations are presupposed. However, it is argued that these ‘orderly’ aesthetic assumptions do not correspond with ‘messy’ real East–West migration dynamics in the EU, which are foremost temporary and circulatory in nature. Drawing on evidence from the Netherlands, the paper concludes by suggesting that migration forecasts may indirectly strengthen claims for restrictive migration policy. </jats:p>",

In many US central cities, wider political economic processes have led to the formation of governance coalitions guided by the interests of private sector agents. The case of Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona, demonstrates how political economic conditions were sources of an uneven bargaining context during the process of project negotiations. Because of this unevenness, interests of profiteers were favored at the expense of others. Organized resistance during each phase of stadium building and concentration of increasing revenues in the hands of fewer business operators reflect uneven consequences. These were desired outcomes of the corporate-led coalition's strategy for expansion through the manipulation of state authority and the exclusionary production of space. I expand the application of urban-regime analysis to examine the role of unevenness in local governance. </jats:p>",

We focus specifically on the role of vision in interpersonal relations, including relations between inmates and between inmates and officers, and we attempt to assess the significance of seeing and being seen in the ‘personal projects’ of prisoners working their way through the system. This involves examining the roles of looking and of surveillance in the organization and control of space. In our study, interpersonal relations are not divorced from the material geographies of the prison. Rather, the breeze-block walls and the steel gates are integral elements of the scopic regime as it affects relations between prisoners and their relations with the prison staff. In our account, the complex connections between actors, architecture, and technologies of surveillance are voiced by the inmates. We provide just one perspective on the making of space in the prison but it is one which has been neglected. </jats:p>",

While acknowledging that there are significant problems with scale as it has been conceptualized and operationalized in human geography, we argue that more, rather than less, attention needs to be paid to the political genealogy of scale ontologies, defined here as the historically contextualized analysis of the social production of scaled knowledge. As a first step in this direction, we develop a poststructural reframing using performativity, as an approach that explores the reiterative and citational practices through which scale effects are socially produced. We are especially concerned in this paper to examine the ways in which scale effects are produced and deployed as discursive devices that create timespace conjunctures and ruptures between place and identity. Using sites of memory as our analytical lens, we trace the citational practices that have naturalized and sedimented a series of scale effects in Narva, Estonia, and explore the consequences of these discursive rescalings for the articulation of place and identity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyse the Dutch waste-collection market for 1998–2005. We show that municipalities with unit-based pricing (UBP) or waste collection by private companies have lower costs. However, this cost advantage decreases over time as competition decreases, because of the introduction of the VAT-compensation fund, and because of contamination of waste streams. The cost advantage of private provision is shown to be much larger in the first years, while a longer duration of private production results in lower efficiency. An important conclusion from this study is that UBP, although its effectiveness deteriorates over time, is more effective in reducing cost than is contracting out. Moreover, we show that the effect of contracting out might have been overestimated in the previous literature because there is a correlation between the use of contracting out and UBP. Low incentive UBP systems, based on volume or frequency, are only effective when the municipality does not collect the waste itself. </jats:p>",

This paper offers a rationale for using chains to measure changes in economic welfare in urban and regional contexts. In contrast to the Marshallian surplus, which well describes situations in which price changes generate rents in a single market, chains are especially useful in markets where changes lead to the transmission of demand or supply through a series of markets characterized by sticky prices and markups. This argument is illustrated by reference to chain-driven analyses of local production, labor, and housing markets. The institutional structures that underpin chain models are stressed. </jats:p>",

The number of countries transferring authority and resources to subnational tiers of government has multiplied over the last twenty-five years. Yet the motives behind this trend remain relatively unknown. We explore these motives by analysing changes in the decentralisation discourse across a number of countries. We find that, while arguments about democracy and good governance have been at the heart of the reasoning for decentralisation, identity has progressively been relegated in favour of the economy and the promise of an economic dividend as the other main motivating factor. However, this shift from identity to the economy is highly contingent on who is driving the process. Despite noticeable shifts towards economic arguments in the discourse of nationalist and secessionist movements, identity remains strong in bottom-up discourses. In contrast, it has almost disappeared—if it ever existed—when the process of decentralisation is undertaken by the state or is encouraged by international organisations. </jats:p>",

Insights drawn from this analysis may inform not only the scheme's future operation, but also the establishment of greenhouse gas trading programs outside Europe. This interim analysis finds that Phase I of the EU ETS (2005–2007) has successfully established a carbon price for significant segments of economic activity in Europe, as well as the necessary trading infrastructure and experience; that the price on carbon has so far had limited impact on the industrial competitiveness of European industry; that it has provided an important stimulus to greenhouse gas emission reductions outside of Europe, primarily through the Clean Development Mechanism; and that the EU ETS provides useful lessons for other countries seeking to limit GHG emissions and for future global climate negotiations.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In addition, most notably the EU is proposing an EU wide cap and harmonised allocation rules, in order to exploit the full potential of emissions trading making national allocation plans ghosts of the past. The revised EU ETS gives investors into CDM projects the necessary long time planning security for investments into projects. At the same time it sends out a strong signal to the international negotiations for a post-2012 climate agreement in that it allows the use of more project based generated credits within the EU ETS once an ambitious post 2012 agreement is concluded.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In analyzing a sample of 236 newspaper advertisements, it connects representations of coastal housing to broader concerns about the development of the coastline. Much public anxiety centres on the notion that coastal residential development and escalating property values signal private gain, but public loss. What is lost, it is claimed, is a landscape that is open, physically but also socially: the presence of imposing holiday homes detracts from the experience of going to the beach, and contributes to the unaffordability of staying at the beach. Such notions do not, of course, feature prominently in advertising. We find that views from private property over the coast are often prioritized in advertising, while the coast itself is typically portrayed as devoid of people. This invites viewers to place themselves in the image—as prospective property owners—and appeals to notions of going to the coast to secure privacy and opportunities for passive relaxation. Advertising for coastal real estate, we conclude, promotes a way of seeing the coastal landscape that is consistent with the ideology of enclosure. </jats:p>",

This survey was developed collaboratively by the university and community partners that comprise the PRC/MI and focuses on health and social issues at the heart of the community of Genesee County, Michigan. Survey data were used to calculate and geographically map diabetes-risk scores and mapped diabetes-screening rates. These maps indicated that those areas where the estimated risk of diabetes was the highest had only moderate rates of diabetes screening relative to other areas. It is hoped that these results will reach those involved in local diabetes-intervention programs with the intent that the data will be used in planning local prevention and intervention efforts. </jats:p>",

In spite of this, or indeed because of this, Western philosophy has persistently tried to interpret the community through precisely these metaphysical terms (Nancy, 1986, page 18, La Commonauté désoevrée, Christian Bourgeois, Paris). Some thoughts about Russian and Japanese notions of community and space will show that characteristics pointed out by Nancy and Kant are binding only for societies that function within a Western intellectual framework. I want to introduce and compare the thought of Nishida Kitarō (1870–1945) and Semën L Frank (1877–1950), who develop the notions of basho and sobornost’ as alternative philosophical concepts of space. Both Nishida and Frank attempt to overcome what they consider a typically ‘Western’ idea of individual ‘I's as materialized ‘objects’. Procedures like Einfühlung or intuition are inefficient because all they do is to transform the other, from the point of view of the ‘I’, into an object. Finally, for the Eurasianist, the state organization had at its center a personal god, and the ‘symphonic personality’ of Russia-Eurasia represented a nonegoistic, communal consciousness. </jats:p>",

Considerable research has been conducted by the engineering community to support the development of product families from a product characteristic viewpoint. However, differences in consumable products are not often easily identified so they rely more heavily on the packaging to differentiate to market segments. Metrics, indices and representations have been formulated to support considerations of commonality and differentiation of engineered products. This paper describes the potential for similar approaches to benefit the features of packaging, particularly medication packaging. The potential benefit of such approaches reach beyond marketing and sales. There is a considerable opportunity for improving dispensing of medications because packaging confusion has been recognized as a serious problem, where misidentification can be lethal. With tens of thousands of drug varieties and growing, a packaging metric is necessary. This paper presents a proposed metric along with three supporting case studies.</jats:p>",

Three aspects of the formulation and implementation of the regulations are discussed: the effects to be prevented and encouraged, response to uncertainty and ignorance, and the burden of proof necessary. Norwegian rejections are found to be explicable by the combination of no real benefit to society, lack of scientific knowledge, and involved risks. EU approvals are based upon seeing no reason to believe that there will be any adverse effects on health and the environment. We conclude that problems arise when value conflicts are understood and treated solely as technical issues, as normal in the EU. </jats:p>",

I argue that under hegemonic secularizing states and within the context of ethnonational conflicts minority groups mobilize and articulate a dynamic meaning of sacred sites which allows an elaborate politics of identity. Further, in the context of their national struggle, members of the community emphasize different aspects of the sacred. In the context of the national struggle (and for the duration of the conflict), minority members enhance inclusive nationalistic (Palestinian in this particular case) identity; however, while in a community context they emphasize the religious (Islamic) meaning of the place. Particularly, I examine the dynamic nature of interpreting and constructing the sacred through the analysis of the restoration project of the Hassan Bek mosque by the Arab-Palestinian community of Jaffa, Israel. </jats:p>",

It is a subject that is marked by increasing theoretical sophistication and activity on the part of policy makers and practitioners. We investigate the principal theoretical and policy developments in UK research, and identify issues for future investigation. In relation to theoretical developments, the contribution of a ‘mixed-embeddedness’ perspective is highlighted; this stresses the importance of social, economic, and institutional processes (rather than ‘ethnic culture’). Although the number of initiatives directed at ethnic-minority businesses is growing, their effectiveness in promoting ‘upward mobility’ is still open to question. Further attention needs to be accorded to the rationale and ultimate beneficiaries of such measures. Future research needs to locate ethnic-minority entrepreneurship in its political and economic contexts. Potential new topics for policy and research include: the social contribution of ethnic-minority entrepreneurship, ethnic-minority women in self-employment, and ‘new communities’. </jats:p>",

A relatively new requirement is the need to assess the territorial impacts of a policy as proposed in the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) and promoted by the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) 2006 programme. Territorial impact assessment (TIA) is defined as “a tool for assessing the impact of spatial development against spatial policy objectives or prospects for an area” (European Communities 2000). This paper summarises and further develops basic work on TIA and presents a methodological concept and the first results of such a TIA approach, applying it to EU environmental policy (civil protection, water, biodiversity).</jats:p>"

This spatial context assumes special salience in light of expanding public exposure to and scholarly interest in the potential impacts of spatial concentrations of immigrants. A crucial question is whether immigrants' opportunities are influenced by their neighbours. In this paper we contribute statistical evidence relevant to answering this vital question. We develop multiple measures of the spatial context in which immigrants reside and assess their contribution to the average earnings of immigrant individuals in the three large Swedish metropolitan areas, controlling for individual and regional labour-market characteristics. We use unusually rich longitudinal information about Swedish immigrants during the 1995–2002 period. We find evidence that immigrant men and women paid a substantial penalty during 1999–2002 if in 1999 they resided in areas where a substantial number of their neighbours were members of the same ethnic group. The evidence suggests that own-group concentrations can initially pay dividends for immigrants, but these benefits quickly turn into net disadvantages over time. </jats:p>",

In the fiscal decentralization literature it has been argued that fiscal disparities across the regions are accounted for in the central-government grant distribution. However, some argue that grants are given to localities to increase the reelection chances of the incumbent or to increase the votes at election. To compete with the opposition parties the incumbent party may try to allocate the grants to aligned local governments. In this paper we analyze the grant allocation in Turkey. We test empirically whether central-government's budgetary transfers to the municipalities were made on the basis of economic criteria or in accordance with the political interest of politicians, and hence the coalition government. To test the hypothesis we followed the literature but we used additional variables. Using municipal data in sixty-one provinces, we find that the desire to secure reelection motivates politicians. </jats:p>",

Emerging from the kinds of landscapes and visualities articulated, these spatialities are at odds with the kind of anthropocentrism characteristic of phenomenological narratives of spatial experience that would start from an apparently stable human-subject position. It is argued that his body of literature dismantles the anthropocentric narratives and biographies that would produce in both the space of the world and the ‘phenomenological subject’ an unwarranted depth and naturalism. Importantly, and reflecting the theoretical turn towards the being of language, Robbe-Grillet questions the legitimacy of linguistic subjects to capture the spaces of the visible. As such, it is argued that his literature reflects an experience of the critiques of phenomenology. Importantly, this ‘critique’ goes hand in hand with the kinds of spatialities and landscapes that are rendered in the novels—the indefinite perspectives they open up, the paradoxical visualities they sustain or deny, and the disorientation they inject into the heart of spatial experience. These literary effects produce a nonanthropocentric and nonpersonal spatiality which, although contributing to an erasure of the ‘subject’, at the same time expose and open up a sociospatiality based on singularities, intensities, and finitude. </jats:p>",

Another important and controversial topic was whether privatisation of the water sector would be advantageous or disadvantageous in regard to efficient allocation and sustainable environmental protection. Beyond the conference dealt with the public procurement in the water sector in relation to the directive 2004/17/EC, with the reorganisation of European protection against floods in the course of the EU flood directive 2007/60/EC and the effects of climate change on hydrologic balance.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Following the dispatch of U.S. Marines to Vietnam in March 1965, the PRC proceeded with the construction of provincial Third-Line Defense projects. In the end, the Third-Line Defense project fell victim to Mao Zedong's ideological radicalization in the lead-up to the Cultural Revolution.

Example changes include the addition or removal of features and/or developers, adjustments due to over‐estimated developer productivity, or under‐estimated work volume of feature‐specific tasks, and adjusted degrees of task dependencies. The research presented in this article mainly focuses on phase (iii), in conjunction with phase (ii), of the release planning process, assuming that phase (i) has already been completed. For that purpose, we present a hybrid intelligence decision‐support method PRP (Planning/Re‐planning), and as its integral part a discrete‐event simulation model called DynaReP (Dynamic Re‐planner). The applicability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed method and model are illustrated through a series of typical release planning and re‐planning scenarios on operational level.

The salient features can be summarized as follows; first, destination-choice patterns differed markedly by ethnicity; second, the higher the educational qualification of the immigrants, the greater the attraction of the Tokyo prefecture and the less dispersed the destination-choice pattern; and third, among female immigrants, those with the household status of daughter in law were more prone to go to the Tohoku region, where the maintenance of the traditional stem-family system was a serious concern. Our multivariate analysis has revealed that the destination choices made by the new immigrants were indeed subject to the selective effects of labor-market conditions, the distributions of coethnics, and the spatial patterns of marital opportunities in theoretically meaningful ways, and that labor-market conditions were most important, whereas marital opportunities were least important. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Air transport has become a vital component of the global economy. However, greenhouse-gas emissions from this sector have a significant impact on global climate, being responsible for over 3.5% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing. Also, the accrued visibility of aircraft emissions greatly affects the public image of the industry. In this context, incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or quantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures on demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimal—mainly due to the high willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by the EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or if future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social cost of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as well as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these policies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions in the EU is estimated, both in physical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25, the total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region's GDP. It is concluded that the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air transport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However, the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such as policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is also attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of their own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers. </jats:p>",

The internationalization of US standards forms a major component of US agrofood trade strategies, while the contentious nature of biotechnology within international trade makes standards harmonization an important political battleground within ongoing processes of neoliberalization. Relying on appeals to sound science that posit US regulations as scientific and objective, and therefore superior to other regulatory models, FAS facilitates the rollout of neoliberal institutions within both the US state and in developing and post-Communist countries to harmonize biotechnology and food safety standards in line with US-led neoliberalization and capitalist internationalization. I examine the political and scientific contours of the sound science discourse, and offer two examples through which FAS has incorporated and deployed sound science in undertaking neoliberal rollout—first by creating a new internal Biotechnology Group, and second through focusing aspects of its Cochran Fellowship Program, a longstanding development and training program for foreign regulators, on biotechnology issues. </jats:p>",

While rule making has become an important alternative pathway for making policy, the strategies used to develop a new rule may vary among presidents because of differing values and management styles. Both presidents were adept at framing the planning regulation to reflect dominant values such as preserving ecosystems (Clinton) or administrative efficiency (Bush). Between‐administration differences in regulatory tactics also tended to alter the relative importance of institutional venues and, by extension, the influence exercised by differing political constituencies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bus rapid transit (BRT) is gaining greater interest by transportation planners and decision makers in the United States because of concerns about growing traffic congestion and a desire for improved environmental quality and sustainable land use development patterns. To help planners and decision makers, FTA developed the BRT implementation guidelines based on the 26 case studies located in North America, Australia, Europe, and South America. The FTA guidelines serve as a valuable source for the basic BRT concepts including the main system components and their types, general planning principles, and general design guidelines. However, the detailed implementation process, such as BRT station selection and route alignment determination, as one of the primary and practical concerns by transportation planners and decision makers, has not been studied in detail. A conceptual planning approach used to quickly evaluate potential BRT stations and alignments based on a case study in Placer County, California, is presented. The approach relies on land use development criteria and an analogous station-matching process to determine an initial range of potential ridership for future stations based on existing stations with similar land use development patterns. This information is combined to help gauge station feasibility and alignment options. The criteria used in this planning process were developed from a comprehensive literature review of the relationship between land use development and transit station ridership, as well as a unique database of transit ridership and land use development intensity for more than 80 existing transit stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento, California, region. </jats:p>",

The Court states that by not complying with the formal conditions of Article 5 (1) (b) of the Directive, the Commission exceeded its implementing powers. As the Court finds that the Commission failed to respect these formal conditions, it does not need to address the pleas of the applicants relating to more fundamental questions regarding risk assessment and risk management under comitology.

The main goal of the Convention is protection, planning and management of the landscape as important part of the quality of life for people living everywhere: in urban areas and in countryside, in degraded areas as well as in the areas with high quality and those recognized as being of outstanding beauty. Serbia has singed Convention on 21 of September 2007. Diversity and quality, the cultural and natural values linked to European landscapes are part of Europe's common heritage, and it is important to co-operate towards its protection, management and planning According to explored international experiences, landscape plan, with its known methodology, is recognized as the most suitable tool in the most Countries which have already implemented European Landscape Convention. As to situation in Serbia, landscape planning is not treated in adequate or appropriate way within system of spatial planning. On the basis of the recent European experiences regarding The European Landscape Convention, the paper will underline the inevitability of landscape planning integration into the spatial planning system at the national, regional and city level, in Serbia.</jats:p>"

Intraorganizational communication capabilities of certain information systems can help overcome these barriers. However, the extent to which certain systems are promoted as communication tools depends largely on management's interpretation of their usefulness, which in turn may be largely dependent on operational context and managerial experience. We use a controlled experimental approach to study how these issues interact to impact managerial assessments of resource planning systems. Results show that managers value the communication capabilities of resource planning systems more so in highly task‐interdependent contexts and that these assessments are still more positive among managers with greater supervisory experience. As a result, these findings pose direct implications regarding the management support of technology use. </jats:p>",

Older forms of gated spaces such as traditional and frontier enclaves, characterized by religious–cultural or ethno-national identities, coexist and evolve alongside newer forms of postwelfare-state market-driven enclaves also referred to as neoliberal enclaves. Although gated enclaves share some similar defining features, they differ significantly in reasons for enclosure, developmental mechanisms and gating effects. The diverse landscape of enclaves results from ongoing interactions of macrosocietal processes influenced by global trends, with place-specific institutional and cultural settings. </jats:p>",

By using a political ecology approach, three case studies of natural resource management are analyzed which span industrialized and developing world contexts—agro-ecological zoning in the western Amazon, a social forestry project in the southern Philippines, and a forest plan revision process in southern Utah. We suggest the need for more attention to how communities are defined and how participation is formalized by institutions, as well as to contested meanings of conservation. We find that, despite espousing agendas of community-based conservation, international and state agencies retain authority over key decisions about natural resource management, use, and allocation. </jats:p>",

Underpinning these policies has been an explicit ambition for the UK to achieve similar participation rates as those in the US where it is widely reported that women own nearly half the stock of businesses. The data underlying these objectives are critically evaluated and it is argued that the definitions and measures of female enterprise used in the UK and the US restrict meaningful comparisons between the two. It is suggested that the expansion of female entrepreneurship in the US is historically and culturally specific to that country. UK policy goals should reflect the national socioeconomic context, while drawing upon good practice examples from a range of other countries. The paper concludes by discussing the economic and social viability of encouraging more women in the UK to enter self-employment without fully recognising the intensely competitive sectors in which they are often located. </jats:p>",

Most available evidence considers performance indicators that are too general, there being few studies relating the use of inputs to outcomes. We compare different performance indicators of Madrid's programme with resource endowments in a group of local agencies of social services. In addition to constructing a detailed system of input and performance indicators, an empirical analysis of efficiency for each of the social services agencies is carried out using data envelopment analysis. Results confirm that there is a wide margin for obtaining efficiency gains. The empirical analysis shows that some detected inefficiencies arise from an excessive number of staff in relation to the work to be performed. Agencies with a higher incidence of social problems present higher efficiency scores. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study we investigate the extent to which the integration of psychological mechanisms from attitude theory into conventional analytical approaches can advance our understanding of travel behaviour. Three models, which explain volitions (intentions) in different ways, are specified and discussed: a customary model (CM) that directly links attitude and external variables (eg socio-demographics) to volition; a simplified version of the extended model of goal-directed behaviour (EMGB) that links attitude to volition via behavioural desire; and a hybrid model (HM) that integrates the two former models. Using survey data about the volition to buy media products (books, music, and DVDs, for example) online and in-store collected in four locations in the Utrecht region, the Netherlands, we find that shopping behaviour is reasonably well explained by the simplified EMGB. Past behaviour, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms all have a statistically significant impact on the volition to shop online, while goal desire and perceived behavioural control significantly affect the volition to shop in-store. The results of the HM indicate that it is important to take external variables, such as access to physical stores and gender, into account when explaining shopping behaviour. </jats:p>",

The 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the 3rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP 13 / CMP 3) held in Bali in December 2007 (the Bali conference) could mark the beginning of a rapprochement. Parties agreed on initiating a new “Ad-hoc working group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the Convention” (AWG-LCA) that aims to negotiate a post-2012 agreement with participation of all parties, including the US and developing countries, by the end of 2009 at COP 15 / CMP 5 in Copenhagen. This article examines the outcomes of the Bali conference, focussing on the negotiations regarding post-2012, flexible mechanisms, financial mechanisms, technology transfer and deforestation. Finally, the article concludes that the Bali Conference saw a significant shift in the battle lines, a rearrangement of positions and alliances that might well announce a decisive new era in global climate policy and provides a real chance to agree on an effective and workable post-2012 agreement in Copenhagen.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

A coherent and logical system is relevant, in terms of both an effective dialogue between government and business, and the promotion of competitiveness and productivity. Through interviews and archival evidence, I look at how government has attempted to reform business associations. The main focus is the Heseltine initiatives of the 1990s: I outline the various initiatives taken, reveal the extent to which policy represented continuity or change, and consider whether the initiatives were effective. I show that they had a degree of success but that they would have made greater impact if they had been sustained over a longer period of time. A consideration of the historical context, moreover, suggests there may be limits to the role of government intervention in business association reform. </jats:p>",

The environment of the Mission Management System (MMS) includes the theatre of operations, vehicle sub-systems and the MMS of other UCAV. An MMS architecture, organized around a database, including reactive and deliberative layers is described in detail. The deliberative layer includes a distributed mission planner developed using constraint programming and an agent framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the MMS is able, in a bounded time, to carry out missions, to activate the contingent behaviors, to decide whether to plan or not. Some research directions remain open in this application domain of AI.</jats:p>"

In this research, an integrated optimal product design and process planning approach is developed to satisfy customer requirements considering design and manufacturing constraints. In this work, a hybrid AND-OR graph is introduced to model the variations of design configurations/parameters and manufacturing processes/parameters in generic product family. Since different design configurations and parameters can be created from the same customer requirements, and each design can be further achieved through alternative manufacturing processes and parameters, co-evolutionary genetic programming and numerical optimization are employed to identify the optimal product design configuration/parameters and manufacturing process/parameters. An industrial case study to identify the optimal design configuration/parameters and manufacturing process/parameters of custom window products in a local company is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.</jats:p>",

Dyads of participants played the role of producers, independently setting unit prices for their products in a sequence of trials with feedback. In experimental conditions a subsidy was paid for unsold units, a system which had previously been found to raise prices and reduce the number of units sold. For half of the dyads in each condition the payoffs were individual, in the other half they were split equally to motivate cooperation. Substantiating that the subsidy did not eliminate competition, the prices were set lower and incomes were lower when the payoffs were individual than when they were split equally. The participants also adjusted their prices to increase their own payoff, taking into account the prices set by the others when the payoffs were individual—which they did not when the payoffs were split equally. The results support the claim that the proposed subsidy system is effective in raising prices so that sales and production of environmentally harmful products can be reduced without eliminating competition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public managers and their political overseers can choose from several approaches as they decide how to structure the delivery of goods and services to citizens. The three most common service-delivery modes are: internal service delivery, in which the government produces the entire service; contracts with other governments, private firms, or nonprofit organizations; and joint service-delivery arrangements. Traditionally, governments' decision to ‘make or buy’ has been framed statically: public managers and their political overseers select one delivery mode over alternatives and then remain committed to that delivery approach. Of course, in practice, service-delivery choices can be more fluid: internal service delivery can later change to contracts, and contracts can later be internalized. Changing service-delivery modes is a potentially costly undertaking. Governments that elect to switch typically make changes to existing production systems and management systems. Varying costs associated with the alteration of existing production and management systems make switching from some modes of service delivery easier than others, depending in part on how the service was initially delivered. In general, the costs of changing from direct service delivery to contract service delivery are likely to be high: managers have to dedicate significant time and effort to dismantling existing production and management systems and building new ones. On the other hand, the service-delivery decisions of contracting governments are likely to be more dynamic because they have typically already incurred the costs of changing at a previous date. Sometimes governments internalize services when they have been using joint or contracted service delivery, whereas at other times they remain in the market by switching vendor type. In this paper we examine how governments' previous service-delivery choices structure their future choices. We analyze panel data from the 1992 and 1997 International City/County Manager Association's Alternative Service Delivery surveys along with data from the US Census and other sources. Our results suggest that service-delivery choices exhibit strong inertia, although when change occurs the previous service-delivery mode influences the likelihood of changing to other service-delivery modes in important ways. In general, governments which have already internalized the upfront costs of changing modes of service delivery are more likely to approach service-delivery choices more dynamically in future decision making. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent optimism about sustainability has centred on the opportunities for improvements in environment efficiency through the international diffusion of environmentally beneficial innovations. This paper investigates two claims about the conditions under which countries are most likely to realise these gains. First, ‘dirtier’ economies should improve their environment efficiency faster as they adopt environmentally sound technologies and policies similar to those in ‘cleaner’ countries, resulting in catch-up and convergence over time. Second, transnational linkages accelerate the international spread of environmentally beneficial innovations and, therefore, improvements in environment efficiency. To test these claims, we use econometric techniques to examine the dynamics and determinants of two pollutants—CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>—using a panel comprising up to 114 countries over the period 1980–2000. Our empirical findings broadly support both claims. Applying tests of unconditional convergence, we find robust evidence for convergence in levels of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efficiency, indicating catch-up by less pollution-efficient economies over time. Similarly, confirming claims about transnational linkages, we find that imports from more pollution-efficient countries and telecommunications connectivity are associated with faster improvements in domestic CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efficiency. Results also suggest that inward foreign direct investment is positively associated with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efficiency. Yet we find that exports to countries with high levels of pollution efficiency have no discernable effect on domestic pollution efficiency. </jats:p>",

So-called ‘command and control’ policies are being underemphasised, despite the fact that they may achieve reductions in carbon emissions that are cheaper than those likely to be achieved through emissions (or ‘certificate’) trading regimes.

This entails attempts to extend and/or rework existing understandings of global interconnections and is reflected in ongoing work on policy transfer—the process by which policy models are learned from one setting and deployed in others. This paper uses a case study of the development of an innovative approach to drug policy in Vancouver, British Columbia to deepen our understanding of what I call ‘urban policy mobilities.’ It details the often apparently mundane practices through which Vancouver's ‘four-pillar’ drug strategy—which combines prevention, treatment, enforcement, and harm reduction—was learned from cities outside North America and is now increasingly taught elsewhere. In doing so it draws on a neo-Foucauldian governmentality approach to emphasize the role of expertise (specialized knowledge held by many actors, not just credentialed professionals) and the deployment of certain powerful truths in the development of the policy. The paper concludes by discussing the spatialities of urban policy mobilities and raising questions about the political and conceptual importance of also maintaining a focus on the causes and consequences of policy immobilities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the maximal dynamic expected flows (MDEF) problem, which seeks the paths and associated flows that maximize the expected number of evacuees who successfully egress within a given time bound T, is defined. The MDEF problem is considered in a network, where arc traversal times and capacities are discrete random variables with time-varying distribution functions and capacities are assumed to be recaptured over time (i.e., the network is dynamic). A metaheuristic based on the principles of noisy genetic algorithms is proposed for its solution. Details of a novel approach (using an approximate likelihood measure) for overcoming the difficulties associated with computing state probabilities that require extremely small floating-point arithmetic are provided. Results from numerical experiments run on randomly generated networks with as many as 500 nodes are given. The results indicate that the proposed solution technique and approximate likelihood measure perform well. Solution of the proposed problem formulation results in robust evacuation paths that are likely to save the largest number of people before conditions become untenable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inspection is an essential part of the entire manufacturing chain providing measurement feedback to the process planning system. Fully automated machining requires automatic inspection process planning and real-time inspection results feedback. As inspection process planning is still based on G&amp;M codes containing low-level information or vendor-specific bespoke routines, inspection process planning is mostly isolated from machining process planning. With the development of new data model standards STEP and STEP-NC providing high-level product information for the entire manufacturing chain, it is achievable to combine machining and inspection process planning to generate optimal machining and inspection sequences with real-time measurement results feedback. This paper introduces an integrated process planning system architecture for combined machining and inspection. In order to provide real-time inspection feedback, On-Machine Inspection (OMI) is chosen to carry out inspection operations. Implementation of the proposed architecture has been partially carried out with a newly developed data model and interpreter software. A case study was carried out to test the feasibility of the proposed architecture.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The provision of advisory support to small firms is almost ubiquitous in OECD countries, although it is organised in different ways and is justified on slightly different grounds. In England publicly supported advisory services are provided through the Business Link (BL) network. Here, we consider two questions: what sort of companies receive advisory support from BL; and, what types of firms benefit most from that support? Our analysis is based on a telephone survey of 2000 firms, around half of which had received intensive assistance from BL between April and October 2003. Probit analysis suggests that the probability of receiving assistance was greater among younger businesses, those with larger numbers of directors in the firm, and those with more gender diversity among the firm's leadership team. Our business-growth models suggest that BL intensive assistance was having a positive effect on employment growth in 2003. BL had a positive but insignificant impact on sales growth over the period. Employment growth effects tend to be larger where firms have a management and organisational structure, which is more conducive to absorbing and making use of external advice. The analysis suggests that BL might increase its impact through targeting these larger, more export-orientated, businesses. Employment growth effects differ little, however, depending on either the ethnic or the gender diversity of the leadership team. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the goals achieved in one aspect of the project: the sampling of colors and materials at a scale of 1:1 using Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. We present initial results from the project; the development of an ad-hoc visualization of interactive data on arbitrary surfaces in real-world indoor environments using a mobile hardware setup. With this, it was possible to project the color and material qualities of a design directly onto almost all surfaces within a geometrically corrected, existing building. Initially, a software prototype “Spatial Augmented Reality for Architecture-Colored Architecture” (SAR-CA) was developed and then assessed based on evaluation results from a user study. </jats:p>",

A plan for a particular case is constructed from known plans for similar training examples. In order to evaluate and improve the prediction quality of complex decisions, we use a method for approximation of similarity measure between plans. The method makes it possible to transform the acquired domain knowledge about similarities of plans, expressed by medical experts in natural language, to a low level language understandable by the system. To accomplish this task, we developed a method for approximation of the ontology of concepts expressed by medical experts. We present two applications of the ontology approximation, namely, for approximation of similarity between patient histories and for approximation of compatibility of patient histories with planned therapies. Next, we use these concept approximations to define two measures on which are based two methods for (plan) therapy prediction. The article includes results of experiments with these methods performed on medical data obtained from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, Polish-American Institute of Pediatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krak?ow, Poland. The experiments are pertained to the identification of infants' death risk caused by respiratory failure. </jats:p>",

The originality of the study lies in the territorial unit of analysis chosen: the 784 Italian LLSs. The analysed data show that, in the 1990s, the Italian IDs proved to be the country's most dynamic local systems. Moreover, the shift-and-share analysis demonstrates that the local effect in the IDs was positive enough to more than compensate for the negative industry mix. Conversely, in the LESs the local effect was so negative as to determine a total negative effect, despite the positive industry mix. We conclude with an overview of the present situation and the corresponding policy implications. </jats:p>",

The paper first briefly reviews key tenets of ‘Third Way’ politics and the alternative view proffered by critiques from the governmentality perspective. It then turns to an analysis of how techniques of rights and responsibilities are implicit in the language of sustainable development policy at three levels: global (Agenda 21), national (Australian national policy-Australian national strategy for ecologically sustainable development), and regional (Queensland regional policy—Draft South East Queensland Regional Plan). Finally, we consider some implications of our application of a governmentality perspective for how we understand government, community and community participation, and sustainable development. In doing so, we argue that neither community, nor sustainable development, can be separated from the techniques of rights and responsibilities that enable ‘government at a distance’. </jats:p>",

Existing methods for evaluating bicycle facilities and for prioritizing their construction and maintenance are reviewed. Two components are necessary for such an analysis: one for assessing the quality of the segments that make up the network, and one for assessing the overall network itself. Space syntax analysis is evaluated as a tool for network assessment on the basis of its potential to predict patterns of travel over different network configurations. The theory behind space syntax is evaluated and then tested by using data from the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. A good model for predicting bicycle volumes within a network can be constructed by using only census data and the space syntax measure “choice.” Unlike existing bicycle suitability measures, space syntax describes the importance of segments to the connectivity or completeness of the network. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The U.S. economy is increasingly reliant on freight movement. Unfortunately, freight movement in the United States is constrained to some extent by its lack of exposure and an emphasis by politicians and the public on passengers. Thus freight has taken a backseat in regional planning by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). Metropolitan regions wanting to improve their economies, however, cannot do so without embracing freight, but these regions may not have attempted to plan for freight regionally and thus do not know how to start or what to do. Therefore, if MPOs better understand how to conduct effective freight planning, they can implement successful freight planning programs in their regions. A useful way to do this is to survey existing MPO freight planning processes. Several MPOs have substantial freight components and plan for freight effectively. A nationwide benchmarking and best-practices survey of freight transportation planning of MPOs was conducted. The survey and resulting analysis provide guidelines, ideas, and strategies for MPOs that want to set up or improve current freight transportation planning practices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The integration of wireless and web-based communication technologies in advanced public transport information systems has led to the provision of passenger information services directly to the users. Most of the existing systems provide alternative travel plans either for urban or for single-mode interurban trips. The objective of this paper is to present an online passenger information system for delivering personalized trip-planning services for interurban multimodal trips, including plans for any constituent urban transfer. The proposed system accommodates the provision of critical real-time travel information (e.g., delay or cancelation of flights) to the user throughout the entire life cycle of an interurban trip. The major features of the system are the following: ( a) determination of optimum itineraries in a multimodal public transportation network, ( b) online updates of the departure times throughout the entire life cycle of the trip, and ( c) dissemination of travel information through several communication channels. The proposed system supports two major trip-planning decisions: ( a) itinerary planning for an urban trip through the local public transport network, and ( b) combined urban and interurban trip planning. The focus of the paper is on the presentation of the design and implementation of the proposed system and its application for supporting trip-planning decisions in Greece. An evaluation of the system has indicated that it is user-friendly, is cost-effective, and meets travelers’ requirements. </jats:p>",

Partly, this is a consequence of insufficient attention to the requirements of building a classification system that can serve as a framework. In the spirit of contributing to the conceptual and methodological development of the literature on comparative local government, I set forth criteria for a classification system, review and assess the literature with respect to these criteria, and suggest a possible approach for building an empirically based classification system for local government that can serve as a common framework. </jats:p>",

Several decisions are studied: with whom the activity takes place, location of the activity, the time planning horizon, and modification or deletion of activities during the scheduling process. The results from a multivariate probit model show that several characteristics of the planned schedule and planned activities are most important in explaining the decisions made during the scheduling process. Individual and household characteristics also play an important role. Significant correlations among the planning decisions suggest that the process of activity scheduling occurs with a high degree of endogeneity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Policy makers have an interest in evaluating what government and taxpayers get for their money. In the United Kingdom, central government has developed elaborate oversight mechanisms involving a plethora of indicators, targets, and inspections to assess public sector performance across a wide range of services. The underlying assumption is that auditees are ultimately responsible for the performance on which they are measured. This rationale might neglect the fact that they face external constraints not influenced easily by their decisions. The research presented here scrutinises one such evaluation approach, the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) of local government in England, for the significance of such factors. Using panel-data analysis involving the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 and data from the first three CPA rounds in 2002–04, the research finds that deprivation in education, crime, and living environment had a significant negative effect on local authorities' overall CPA scores, while discretionary expenditure had a positive but not significant effect. However, the effects differ widely across the five types of authorities that exist. The model also reveals that there is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that authorities controlled by a single party perform better than those without, and that, although Conservative councils have higher CPA scores in simple bivariate analysis than those controlled by other parties or with no overall control, these differences disappear in multivariate analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I seek to contribute to the burgeoning literature on cosmopolitanism by drawing on Ulrich Beck's work on the cosmopolitan implications of globalisation. In doing so, I argue that insights gained from Beckian understandings of risk and cosmopolitanism can be ‘ab-used’ to reclaim their potential for scholarship in postcolonial contexts. Drawing on the work of Bob Jessop, I critique Beck's argument via its extension and explore the production of ‘cosmopolitan communities’ which are far from neutrally cosmopolitan. The paper examines how ‘cosmopolitan communities’ can be usefully envisaged not solely as a necessary response to world risks, but also as the contingent outcome of state strategies designed to manage forms of political and economic uncertainty by reconfiguring geopolitical space. The state strategies explored here are ones which have sought to reconfigure social forces by rearticulating discourse on the identity of overseas populations, to harness their boundary crossing, or cosmopolitan, material and representational resources. Rethinking the emergence of ‘cosmopolitan communities’ and identities in this manner allows them to be defined by, and anchored in, different geopolitical orders and geohistorical contexts. The empirical context which substantiates this argument is offered by exploring four key moments in the Indian state's strategic-relational approach to its overseas populations from 1900 to 2003. In this paper, the terms ‘cosmopolitanism’ and ‘cosmopolitan communities’ are, therefore, deployed to refer to a geohistorically deep experience of cultivating geopolitical relations across borders. The paper maintains that ‘cosmopolitan communities’ exist alongside, go beyond, and also existed before political arenas defined by nation-centred accounts of history and geography. </jats:p>",

The author details research undertaken within Greater Merseyside (UK), which has relatively high levels of young NEET and where a ‘culture of worklessness’ has developed within the poorest areas. A focus is placed on the degree to which intergenerational factors influence NEET status, as opposed to peer influence, (low) educational attainment/disaffection, poor labour-market experience, or a lack of (place-specific) employment/education or training opportunities. Through reference to Hodkinson's pragmatic rational decision-making model, it is suggested that the success of policy interventions has been limited because of the diversity of influences on an individual's NEET status. However, a greater emphasis on addressing intergenerational issues through a focus on activities such as positive parenting, raising aspirations, and addressing family breakdown would make a greater impact, in conjunction with addressing disaffection through the provision of alternative forms of education, removing barriers to employment, and subsidising involvement in further/higher education. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographically weighted regression (GWR), as a useful method for exploring spatial non-stationarity of a regression relationship, has been applied to a variety of areas. In this method a spatially varying coefficient model is locally calibrated and the spatial-variation patterns of the locally estimated regression coefficients are taken as the main evidence of spatial nonstationarity for the underlying data-generating processes. Therefore, the validity of the analysis results drawn by GWR is closely dependent on the accuracy between the underlying coefficients and their estimates. Motivated by the local polynomial-modelling technique in statistics, we propose a local linear-based GWR for the spatially varying coefficient models, in which the coefficients are locally expanded as linear functions of the spatial coordinates and then estimated by the weighted least-squares procedure. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with GWR are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve GWR, not only in goodness-of-fit of the whole regression function but also in reducing bias of the coefficient estimates. </jats:p>",

The editors of Verbum et Ecclesia and HTS Theological Studies, the two theological journals associated with the Faculty of Theology at UP, reflect on the journals’ historical roots, editorial focuses, distinctive features, subscription and language statistics and on their’ contribution to support the academic study of theology and related disciplines. The Faculty of Theology was founded in 1917 and celebrated its ninetieth birthday in 2007. The origin of its journals dates back to 1943. This article discusses the challenges that academic journals face in South Africa and undertakes strategic planning for the future. A concluding addendum, consisting of statistical diagrams with regard to the journals’ profile during the last five years, illustrates the argument.</jats:p>"

The application field is the robotic interception of moving objects randomly distributed on a conveyor and detected by a vision system. A motion planning algorithm was developed in order to achieve a satisfactory cycle time and energy consumption. The algorithm is based on the evaluation of the inertial actions arisen in the robot structure during the pick and place motions and it aims to keep constant the rotation velocity of the first joint during the motion, the grasping and the discarding phases. Since the algorithm must be applied run time and the number of the reachable pieces can be high, a particular care was dedicated to the computational burden reduction. Subsequently to an analytic study of the kinematical constraints and the criteria definition for the choice of which piece to grasp, a devoted simulation software was developed. The software allows the control and the evaluation of the effects of all the main parameters on the system behavior and a comparison of the cycle time and the energy consumption between the proposed algorithm and a standard point-to-point motion strategy.</jats:p>",

This demand may gain ground only if dialogue is encouraged among different perspectives, disciplines, and knowledge types. The aim of this paper is to explore new methods to improve flood-mitigation decision processes. A growing body of evidence suggests that the involvement of the local actors is a key aspect in successful decision making. Following this premise, we analyze a recent case of controversy in flood mitigation in Malborghetto-Valbruna (Northern Italy), using social multicriteria evaluation (SMCE) and social actors' narrative analysis. Six alternatives are defined and the different positions adopted by the local actors are described. The different narratives of the actors are also analyzed to allow the identification of improvement routes for a more accurate SMCE of flood-mitigation alternatives. Thus, this case study suggests that the analysis of narratives is a useful tool to complement SMCE. </jats:p>",

By expanding upon David Harvey's understanding of culture as that “special” commodity which can earn monopoly rents based on its extraordinary qualities, I examine, in particular, how professional baseball became a profitable segment of the culture industry. This historical-geographic process, similar to most forms of cultural production, was fraught with contradictions that threatened its survival. In addition to the three contradictions that Harvey identifies, this paper focuses on an additional contradiction, one that is found within the labor processes of cultural production, between productive capital and commodity capital. Scrutiny over the ways in which baseball's premier professional organization—the National League—struggled to overcome this and other contradictions suggests that the culture industry depends upon the production of certain geographies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent UK government policy on climate change, and wider policy movement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, emphasise the building of adaptive capacity. But what are the institutional constraints that shape capacity to build adaptive organisations? The authors synthesise theory from social learning and institutional aspects of multilevel environmental governance to help unpack the patterns of individual and collective action within organisations that can enhance or restrict organisational adaptive capacity in the face of abrupt climate change. Theoretical synthesis is grounded by empirical work with a local dairy farmers group and two supporting public sector bodies that are both local actors in their own rights and which also shape the operating environment for other local actors (the Environment Agency and the Welsh Assembly and Assembly-sponsored public bodies). Providing space within and between local organisations for individuals to develop private as well as officially sanctioned social relationships is supported as a pathway to enable social learning. It is also a resource for adaptation that requires little financial investment but does call for a rethinking of the personal skills and working routines that are incentivised within organisations. </jats:p>",

This paper analyzes the extent to which this result is consequent with observed measures of cross-subsidies in favor of residential consumers. I run a treatment-effects regression on a sample of 133 municipalities in 2000 and 2001. Recent privatization has a positive effect on the weight that the local regulator attaches to industrial users' welfare when deciding water tariffs. I conclude that an increase of industrial customers' group size has a twofold effect on the cross-subsidy in favor of residential customers: a direct positive substitution effect and an indirect negative political support effect through lobbying for service privatization. </jats:p>",

These frameworks are used to analyze policies for the river Scheldt estuary between 1967 and 2005. The estuary of the river Scheldt is situated partly in the Belgian region of Flanders and partly in the Netherlands. Major international policy issues in this estuary are the maritime access to the port of Antwerp, water and sediment pollution, and estuarine rehabilitation. It will be shown that the negotiations on these issues are characterized by complex issue linkages, and that NA does very well in explaining both deadlocks and international policy agreement. However, unlike the ACF, NA does not specify how actors come to define their interests. Moreover, we will argue that learning across the prodevelopment Antwerp coalition and the cross-border environmentalist coalition accounts for a gradual convergence of Dutch and Flemish perceived interests. Finally, PE offers useful complementary insights as Scheldt estuary policies cannot be understood without addressing the interrelations between the processes of negotiation, learning, the creation and enforcement of game rules, which have been going on in different venues simultaneously. </jats:p>",

Most of the fighting occurred between youth who identify as ethnic–racial minorities, like Latinos, African-Americans, and Armenians. Just after one such fight involving several hundred students, which quickly became known as a ‘race riot’ at the school, I conducted a series of interviews with teenage girls asking them what they thought of this outburst of ethnic–racial violence, in their valley school's case between Latinos and Armenians. In the research, girls detailed to me their postracial attitudes (typified by such ideals as ‘race doesn't matter, we are all the same’), but their narratives evidenced extreme racial–ethnic segregation and their own racist sentiments. In this paper, I explore this contradiction and focus on how girls articulate multicultural and humanist ideals to situate themselves as antiracists. However, concurrently, I argue that the girls' racialized resentments of others illustrate their profound and wounded investments in difference. The girls' narratives and identities also indicate why multicultural attempts to foster respect of diversity in this urban high school have failed. </jats:p>",

The results show that the tracts that increased their share of the metropolitan areas' real estate value in one decade tend to lose that share during the next decade. After accounting for the effect of new additions, the main transfer of wealth is from the older suburban ring to both the inner city and the new suburbs. The largest variation in the growth of property value is not between the new suburbs and the inner city but across the inner-city census tracts. The shifts and cycles of investment across broad city sectors predicted by neoclassical and Marxist theory are overwhelmed by local factors. </jats:p>",

The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) in Texas initiated a series of workshops to begin a dialogue with agencies not typically involved in long-range planning. CAMPO brought together resource and regulatory agencies, nontraditional stakeholders such as members of the Save Our Springs Alliance, the state department of transportation, and others for a meaningful dialogue that resulted in greater understanding among all parties. The workshops led to a sharing of data that can be used in developing long-range transportation plans. Areas of environmental sensitivity as well as cultural and historic features are now being mapped and used in preparing a long-range transportation plan. The next steps will build on the efforts of the early workshops to continue the exchange of data and information and work cooperatively to link the planning process with the NEPA process. It is anticipated that this early information exchange will result in improved project delivery. </jats:p>",

In fact, the reliability of travel time estimates on a given corridor may be more important for travelers, shippers, and transport managers than the travel time itself. This paper examines the uses of measured travel time reliability indices for improving real-time transportation management and traveler information with the use of archived intelligent transportation system data. A literature review of travel time reliability and its value as a congestion measure is followed by a description of a content analysis of 20 regional transportation plans from across the nation. Results from the content analysis indicate that travel time reliability is not currently used as a congestion measure and that the most common measures of congestion are the volume-to-capacity ratio, vehicle hours of delay, and mean speed. As a case study using data from Portland, Oregon, several reliability measures are then tested including travel time, 95th percentile travel time, travel time index, buffer index, planning time index, and congestion frequency. The buffer index is used to prioritize freeway corridors according to travel time reliability. Metropolitan planning organizations should use travel time reliability in the following ways: (a) incorporate it as a systemwide goal, (b) evaluate roadway segments according to travel time reliability measures, and (c) prioritize roadway segments using those measures. </jats:p>",

It addresses questions that are central to ongoing theoretical debates about the role of the region in the new member states. Have the powers and resources of the regions been strengthened by their involvement in EU support programmes? Are regions increasingly involved in integrated ‘bottom-up’ responses to regional development challenges? The paper offers a fresh perspective on these issues, with a cross-national analysis of practical experience in the postenlargement period and a detailed assessment of the technical, variable, and complex reality of working with EU Structural Funds. A distinctive approach of the analysis is to disaggregate the stages of Structural Funds programme management and delivery, thereby highlighting the varied nature of regional involvement in Structural Funds. Ultimately, the paper questions the notion that Structural Funds build regional structures and competence, and lead to ‘stronger regions’. Instead, it is argued that there is no guarantee that the Structural Funds will necessarily promote regionalisation in Central and Eastern Europe, at least in the short to medium terms.</jats:p>",

In this data analysis, the potential impact of amino acid PET with 3-O-methyl- 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA ([18F]OMFD) on radiation treatment planning is addressed by the following questions: 1. Was tumour tissue identified with OMFD-PET which was not covered by the conventionally derived planning target volume (PTV)? 2. Would the PTV have been changed incorporating OMFD-PET? Patients, methods: OMFD-PET of 25 patients after subtotal resection of malignant glioma was evaluated. The region of elevated tracer uptake of PET and of contrast enhancing masses on MRI were outlined as separate gross tumour volumes (GTVMRI and GTVOMFD) and reconstructed in the planning CT for comparison with the conventionally drawn GTVconv. A PTVnew based on GTVconv+MRI was calculated. Pairwise differential volumes were calculated to estimate overlap and differential volumes delineation by each image modality and the PTVconv and PTVnew respectively. Results: Differential volume analysis showed &gt; 10 cm3 of GTVOMFD outside GTVconv and GTVMRI in 5/25 patients respectively. From GTVMRI &gt;10 cm3 were found outside GTVOMFD in 8/25 patients. Although all tumour areas indicated by [18F]OMFD were covered by the conventionally derived PTV, based on a GTVOMFD+MRI, the PTVnew would have been enlarged &gt;20% in seven patients. In seven patients the PTVnew would have been reduced. Conclusion: OMFD-PET indicated tumour tissue outside the tumour region identified with MRI, adding valuable information for the delineation of the GTV in radiation treatment planning. OMFD-PET contains the potential to tailor the high dose radiation to the appropriate tumour volume, especially if dose escalation is desired.</jats:p>"

In particular, we unpack the complex relationships between the organizational rationale for, the selected mode of, and future benefits gained by internationalization, as headhunting firms seek and create new geographical markets. We achieve this through an analysis of headhunting firm-specific case study data that detail the evolving way such firms organize their differential strategic growth (organic, merger and acquisition, and alliances/network) and forms (wholly owned, networked, or hybrid). We also highlight how, as elite labour market intermediaries, headhunted are important, yet understudied, actors within the (re)production of a ‘softer’, ‘knowledgeable’ capitalism. Our argument, exemplified through detailed mapping of the changing geographies of headhunting firms between 1992 and 2005, demonstrates the need for complex and blurred typologies of internationalization and similarly complex internationalization theory. </jats:p>",

Having in mind its important economic and social functions, as well as its capability to intensify its other economic branches (agricultural and economic potentials, services of various types, transport and other) in a certain territory, it is necessary to realize a precise valorization of tourist values in the spatial plan of municipality and to conclude at what point and at which places the tourism can represent on of development components of the entire economy of the territory to be planed. The example of the spatial plan of Subotica and main guidelines, concept and planning priorities which can be expected in the forthcoming period are presented in this paper. It is without any doubt that the municipality of Subotica with its geostrategic position, the proximity of the EU and important natural and cultural tourist potentials is a suitable space for application of contemporary principles of the tourism development planning and their correlation with other segments of integral development for the whole municipality.</jats:p>"

The present paper describes a task planning method that takes the uncertain relationships among the product components into consideration in order to reduce the development time in large-scale and complicated product development with uncertainty at the early stage of product development. We developed a probabilistic worth flow analysis to evaluate each product component for task prioritization with an uncertain relationship among product components. The method calculates the probabilistic distribution of worth flow of each product component based on the probabilistic relationship among product components with the Monte Carlo simulation and determines the development sequence of each component so as to minimize the possibility with the highest feedback information across the task groups. The present paper describes an example of a generic hair drier with a simple mechanical structure developed using the proposed method in order to reduce the uncertainty of feedback information across the task groups while maintaining the uncertainty within same task groups in case the uncertainty has an asymmetric distribution.</jats:p>",

Many in Ann Arbor had long wanted a circulator bus route to connect its diverse downtown business districts with the University of Michigan campus. These desires came to fruition in September 2003, with the launching of the Link by the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) with funding from a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant following a comprehensive planning process that engaged local stakeholders. The route suffered from low ridership and operational problems soon after entering service, prompting many to question its future. However, by implementing an ongoing planning process that continued to engage stakeholders, AATA was able to obtain new ideas that ultimately led to the successful redesign of the route: improving its usefulness and encouraging the formation of new partnerships to finance its ongoing operation. </jats:p>",

This is especially true in the area of safety-conscious planning (SCP). Conflicting organizational cultures and limited staff and technical tools are major challenges in SCP efforts for midsized metropolitan areas. Midsized metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) were surveyed, and three case studies of midsized metropolitan areas were prepared to understand better the challenges and opportunities facing SCP in such a context. The national survey and case studies focused on long-range planning, data collection, human resources, technical analysis, and collaboration aspects of SCP as applied today. The majority of midsized MPOs have incorporated safety considerations into their long-range transportation plans, but some midsized MPOs are more proactive than others in the quantitative analysis of project safety outcomes. The institutional and technical issues faced by midsized MPOs can be overcome by identifying a safety champion in the management ranks, encouraging state departments of transportation to provide midsized MPOs with more tools and training in SCP, promoting a stronger relationship between the governor's safety representative and the MPO, and creating a more comprehensive forum for collaboration among safety professionals. </jats:p>",

Results show that the three government agencies assessed in this study did not effectively achieve adequate opportunities for public participation.

Briefly, the concept centers on the ability of an entity, public or private, to gain durable credits for undertaking proactive restoration activities. Once obtained, these credits can be applied to an existing liability, held in the event of a future liability, or traded or sold to others that might have need for the credits. In the case of a natural resource damage claim or response action, possessing or applying the credits does not negate the need for responsible entities to clean up spills or releases of hazardous substances or oil or to address their clean-up requirements under applicable federal and state statutes. Concepts similar to prospective environmental restoration/restoration up front include wetlands mitigation banking, conservation habitat banking, and emissions trading. Much of the concept and details provided herein stem from the practice of natural resource damage assessment, although that is not the sole driver for the concept. The concept could also apply where the credits could be used to offset other environmental liabilities, for example, to provide habitat mitigation where development is being planned. The authors believe that the concept, if widely applied, could reduce the time and costs associated with restoration and perhaps lead to an increase in voluntary restoration and conservation nationally. Currently, there are no state or federal regulations or policies that directly provide for this approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within the UK the levels of female entrepreneurship are considerably lower than in many of its peer countries. As part of a strategy to remedy this apparent shortfall, and to improve the environment for existing female-owned businesses, the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched a ‘Strategic Framework for Women's Enterprise’ in 2003. A central rationale for the development of this strategy is a belief in the inadequacies of current business-advice provision and limited access to informal and formal business networks, mentors, and business support for women. However, there appears to be little evidence, either in this paper or in the body of previous research, to support the view that, within the UK, government agencies need to shape business support to reflect the gender of the business user. Drawing upon a sample of 650 small service sector firms in Scotland, we report the findings of a detailed postal questionnaire concerned with exploring usage and satisfaction of a range of formal and informal sources of business advice amongst male and female business owners. Bivariate analysis shows that amongst formal sources women are more likely to use friends and relatives, the Small Business Gateway, and chambers of commerce but are less likely to use suppliers and consultants. However, multivariate analysis suggests that, within the service sector, neither use of external advice nor impact of advice—either formal or informal—is greatly influenced by gender. Rather, it was the characteristics of service sector firms, most notably the number of employees and exporting activity, that explained the use of external advice. Therefore, a nongendered view of business support by the DTI appears more appropriate within the service sector. Nevertheless, the data do indicate more frequent use of informal family-network contacts amongst women business owners. </jats:p>",

Logistic regression was utilized to examine variables associated with the following main questions: (1) the selection of use or nonuse of contraception; (2) the selection of barrier versus hormonal contraception; and (3) within those who selected hormonal contraception, the preference for injectable versus oral hormonal methods. We found that race, age, school status, and type of health insurance were all associated with contraceptive decision‐making among female adolescents.

We find that income and wealth impact the decision to participate in different ways. Households with more wealth, measured by ownership of assets, were more likely to attend meetings but were less likely to have a voice in decision making. In terms of income, we find that middle-class households had more input into decision making than lower-income households. Household-level measures of social capital positively affected participation both in terms of attending meetings and in the number of decisions in which households were involved. </jats:p>",

This modeling environment can be used in transport and logistics models that deal with a distribution center serving an area with daily variations in demand. The routes are calculated daily on the basis of what freight is available. New approximations and experimental settings are introduced. Average distance traveled is estimated as a function of the number of customers served and the number of routes needed. Approximations are tested in instances with different customer spatial distributions, demand levels, numbers of customers, and time windows. Regression results indicate that the proposed approximations can reasonably predict the average length of VRPs in randomly generated problems and real urban networks. </jats:p>",

With streamlining of the O-D calibration process, it is shown that the proposed model reproduces count and travel-time information collected from the field. Incorporating peak spreading as a result of congestion for long-term scenarios is also shown to yield performance improvements in the models and overcome network gridlock issues common to such applications. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a method of predicting safety for planning alternatives. Although applicable to large road networks, the method predicts crashes at the road facility level (intersections and segments). Thus it is suitable for joint evaluation of modifications of the road network, changes in network traffic flows, and improvements in road geometry considered by planners. A complete set of crash prediction models was developed by the authors for seven types of road segments and four types of road nodes on the basis of crashes reported on Indiana highways from 2003 to 2005. A mainstream research method has been used: negative binomial regression with a stepwise method for variable selection and the Akaike information criterion. The obtained equations are transparent to transportation planners and allow efficient computations for large road networks. The crash prediction equations have been implemented in the GIS-based planning package TransCAD as an add-on tool. The calibration procedure included in the tool allows a planner to search for optimal values of calibration factors if calibration of crash prediction models is needed. </jats:p>",

This focusing event spurred modeling efforts to frame alternatives for managing the reservoir system during prolonged droughts. This paper addresses the management challenges that arise when using modeling tools to manage water scarcity under variable hydroclimatology, shifting use patterns, and institutional complexity. Assumptions specified in modeling simulations are an integral feature of public processes. The policymaking and management implications of assumptions are examined by analyzing four interacting sources of physical and institutional uncertainty: inflow (runoff), depletion (water use), operating rules, and initial reservoir conditions. A review of planning documents and model reports generated during two recent processes to plan for surplus and shortage in the Colorado River demonstrates that modeling tools become useful to stakeholders by clarifying the impacts of modeling assumptions at several temporal and spatial scales. A high reservoir storage‐to‐runoff ratio elevates the importance of assumptions regarding initial reservoir conditions over the three‐year outlook used to assess the likelihood of reaching surplus and shortage triggers. An ensemble of initial condition predictions can provide more robust initial conditions estimates. This paper concludes that water managers require model outputs that encompass a full range of future potential outcomes, including best and worst cases. Further research into methods of representing and communicating about hydrologic and institutional uncertainty in model outputs will help water managers and other stakeholders to assess tradeoffs when planning for water supply variability.</jats:p>",

An overview is given of the steps necessary to create a consistent methodology for habitat assessment. This process was developed in the Pacific Northwest and combines three components for determining the baseline condition for fish and wildlife habitat. Each component captures a portion of the information necessary to assess wildlife habitats across large areas consistently. The first component is a hierarchical wildlife habitat classification scheme that can be mapped at various scales. The second piece is a relational database that ties multiple species–habitat relationships to the hierarchical classification scheme. Finally, the third component necessary is a consistent mapping methodology that can tie together both relational databases and classification schemes at various hierarchical scales. Each component is described, and a broad outline of how to combine these three components to determine the baseline habitat value for wildlife is offered. Examples are used to illustrate several products from this approach that are useful for transportation and conservation planning. Creating a consistent methodology for wildlife habitat assessment can help streamline transportation and conservation projects by enabling resource managers to determine baseline habitat values, focus the discussion on high-value areas, and improve mitigation efforts based on value rather than acreage. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the social programmes of the postwar welfare state have been dramatically cut back and transformed, many have looked to the voluntary nonprofit sector as the ‘beacon of hope’ in terms of delivering support and services to citizens in need of assistance. But at the same time as these organizations have been under mounting pressure to deliver support and services, they have also been subject to forces of change which limit their capacities to play this vital social role. In this paper, we examine how disability organizations in two Canadian provinces have been faring in increasingly harsh neoliberal environments. We look, in particular, at the ways in which these organizations are struggling to negotiate the pressures of diminished and inadequate funding, rising demand for their services, and changing regulatory relations with the state. Drawing on mail surveys of sixty-two disability organizations in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, we discuss the impacts that organizational survival strategies are having on clients, staff, volunteers and volunteerism, and on the operation and structure of such organizations. We show how disability organizations are experiencing significant pressures to change how they deliver services and supports to disabled people in need. These include pressures to diminish levels of service provision to clients, particularly those in greatest need, to reduce staffing levels and institute survival strategies that negatively impact working conditions, to rely even more heavily upon volunteer labour, and to modify their operations and organizations in a struggle to cope with harsh neoliberal conditions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hazardous material transportation poses obvious hazards to environment, general public and response personnel. In this context, risk reduction can be achieved by analyzing and designing correctly the routing of shipments, by proper risk assessment procedure. HazMat transportation risk management must include appropriate emergency response services, limiting accident consequences. This paper presents a quantitative risk assessment approach to HazMat transportation, starting from an historical statistical analysis on road accidents. A methodological approach for the assessment of standard vehicle and dangerous good truck flows was applied to a pilot area in the North of Italy, allowing a statistical reinforced evaluation of route intrinsic enhancing/mitigating parameters. The results evidence the distribution of the risk along the different routes and the localization of high spots, with good accuracy and precision. Preventive and mitigating risk measures are discussed in depth, with particular reference to the optimization of emergency equipment (number of prompt action vehicles) by means of an unambiguous and consistent selection criterion that allows reduction of intervention time. Different risk mitigation options, based on changing route or designing alternative slip roads, in transport corridors or tunnels, are investigated as well. The presented approach can represent a useful tool not only to estimate transport risk, but also to define strategies for the reduction of risk (i.e. distribution and limitation of ADR road traffic, improvement of highway section, design of alternative routes) and emergency management.</jats:p>"

À l'aide des données de la troisième phase de l'Étude sur la santé et le vieillissement au Canada (ESVC-3), nous avons examiné les relations entre les prédicteurs démographiques et en matière de santé, et les trois résultats (à savoir si les participants avaient réfléchi à leurs préférences de fin de vie, s'ils en avaient discuté, ou s'ils les avaient officialisées), et s'il y avait des relations entre les trois résultats. La région de résidence au Canada, le sexe féminin, et davantage d'années de scolarité étaient des facteurs associés à des personnes ayant réfléchi à leurs préférences. La région de résidence, le sexe féminin, et le manque de déficience cognitive étaient associés aux discussions en matière de préférences, et la région de résidence et le fait de ne pas avoir de conjoint étaient associés au dépôt de documents officiels. Les résidents de l'Ontario étaient les plus enclins à avoir réfléchi à leurs préférences, à en avoir discuté, et à les avoir officialisées, tandis que les résidents des Maritimes étaient les moins enclins à y avoir pensé et à avoir agi en conséquence. Enfin, avoir réfléchi à leurs préférences était associé au fait d'en discuter, et y avoir réfléchi et en avoir discuté étaient chacun associés à l'officialisation des préférences. Ces résultats correspondent au postulat que l'exécution du mandat (directive par procuration) est un processus comportant plusieurs étapes. Avoir une meilleure idée de ce processus peut se révéler utile lors de l'élaboration d'interventions visant à promouvoir la planification des soins en fin de vie.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper deals with second-generation Barbadians or ‘Bajan-Brits’, who have decided to ‘return’ to the birthplace of their parents, focusing on their reactions to matters relating to race relations and racialised identities. The importance of race and the operation of the ‘colour-class’ system in the Caribbean are established at the outset. Based on fifty-two qualitative in-depth interviews, the paper initially considers the positive things that the second-generation migrants report about living in a majority black country and the salience of such racial affirmation as part of their migration process. The paper then presents an analysis of the narratives provided by the Bajan-Brits concerning their reactions to issues relating to race relations in Barbadian society. The impressions of the young returnees provide clear commentaries on what are regarded as (i) the ‘acceptance of white hegemony’ within Barbadian society, (ii) the occurrence of de facto ‘racial segregation’, (iii) perceptions of the ‘existence of apartheid’, and (iv) ‘the continuation of slavery’. The account then turns to the contemporary operation of the colour-class system. It is concluded that, despite academic arguments that the colour-class dimension has to be put to one side as the principal dimension of social stratification in the contemporary Caribbean, the second-generation migrants are acutely aware of the continued existence and salience of such gradations within society. Thus, the analysis not only serves to emphasise the continued importance of racial-based stratification in the contemporary Caribbean, but also speaks of the ‘hybrid’ and ‘in-between’ racialised identities of the second-generation migrants. </jats:p>",

Developers and planners need to understand the implications of such large-scale urbanization on the environment. Requirements for sustainable growth within the Thames Gateway region mean that developers are being required to demonstrate that proposals are based on sound scientific information. This has resulted in a growing demand for geo-environmental information to be provided in more accessible, relevant and understandable forms. Advances in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D modelling software mean that there is now far greater opportunity to develop geo-environmental information products for urban development. New and innovative ways of visualizing and communicating geoscience information have been developed. Using this new technology it is possible to predict not only the types of rocks beneath a site, but also the engineering properties (such as rock strength, shrink–swell characteristics or compressibility), hydrogeological properties (such as permeability, porosity and thickness of the unsaturated zone) and geohazard potential. Geoscientific information can then be imported into standard GIS packages and queried along with other complementary ground investigation data, resulting in the creation of a powerful tool to assist in strategic planning and sustainable development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In both the scientific and the professional communities, the need to integrate transport and land use policies to achieve more sustainable mobility patterns is widely recognized. Three challenges to attaining integrated strategies are identified. The first challenge is to find a common language and concepts that stimulate communication between disciplines. The second challenge is to create more explicit links between broader economic, social, and environmental goals and transport policies. The third challenge is to put more emphasis on policy design, the phase in the planning process in which opportunities for policy integration are maximal but which is poorly supported by current transport planning approaches. Accessibility is a concept that can address all three challenges. It relates to features of the transport system (speed, travel costs) as well as the land use system (densities, opportunities) and can be related to wider goals within society (for example, access to jobs). A well-known and well-studied concept within the scientific literature, accessibility is nonetheless not often used. This paper develops a framework to stimulate the joint design of accessibility-enhancing strategies, and the framework is then tested and developed in cooperation with practitioners in two case studies in the Netherlands. </jats:p>",

Through lanes in the middle are separated by landscaped medians from side access lanes for bicycles and slow-moving local traffic. Using a case study from Oregon's Eugene–Springfield metropolitan area, this project considers what could happen if cities built arterials as multiway boulevards. This interdisciplinary study, which included widespread stakeholder and public participation as well as detailed land use and transportation modeling, was instrumental in the Eugene Planning Commission's decision to endorse converting a portion of the arterial into a multiway boulevard. Although the case study arterial, with its existing bus rapid transit lanes, requires an unusually wide right-of-way, the results show that the arterial could better accommodate residential and mixed-use buildings at the edges if reconfigured as a multiway boulevard. Projected benefits include the possibility of supporting 8,400 dwelling units, reducing annual vehicle miles traveled by nearly 100 million miles (161 million km), and reducing annual carbon emissions by nearly 110 million lb (50 million kg). Development along the boulevard can preserve up to 1,680 acres (680 ha) of farmland and lead to an annual transportation savings per household of about $1,500. New residences could generate more than $17 million annually in property tax revenue. This study offers lessons for communities interested in promoting environmental protection, enhancing quality of life, and reducing energy consumption. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In July 2006, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) initiated a Traffic Operations Corridor Sketch-Planning project with the goal of developing a methodology and associated tool that would enable the Bureau of Highway Operations (BHO) to evaluate operational projects in the same manner as traditional infrastructure projects, as well as to integrate operations into the WisDOT planning process. A sketch-planning methodology was developed to achieve these goals with the use of data to drive operations technology recommendations for the WisDOT 2030 multimodal corridor network. This project has resulted in a unique process by which an entire statewide network can be analyzed in terms of operational requirements. These requirements are developed by using not only traditional planning metrics such as safety and traffic volumes and patterns but also operational aspects such as the impacts that special events and weather have on the transportation system. By providing a structured operations data set for integration in long-range planning, the WisDOT BHO has enabled operations strategies to complement, rather than compete with, physical highway improvements. Operations strategies can be a contributing part of the long-range vision for the state through a series of recommendations that are logical and data-driven, as well as communicable and understandable. This report covers the identification of data sources, the development of criteria, the identification of critical thresholds, and the results of the sketch-planning methodology, along with a description of how sketch-planning results are translated into a finalized statewide operations plan. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> San Francisco, California, has two full-featured bus rapid transit (BRT) projects under development that would convert two major auto-oriented arterials into attractive multimodal corridors. BRT on Geary Boulevard, San Francisco's primary east–west thoroughfare, and on Van Ness Avenue, a north–south connector, aims to improve transit, enhance pedestrian access, and install a package of urban design features to improve services for existing riders and attract new riders. Feasibility studies conducted for both corridors include a consistent planning framework for developing BRT on these corridors to meet broad multi-modal goals. This paper describes the approach to developing full-featured BRT alternatives in these two distinct corridors. It also describes the evaluation framework, which is grounded in the project goals, and consists of seven categories, each with methodologies designed to meaningfully capture and compare the effects of BRT alternatives against the broad set of qualitative and quantitative goals. These categories include transit performance, rider experience, pedestrian access, urban design, traffic and parking impacts, and construction impacts. Going beyond the traditional evaluation criteria to include subcriteria like access to employment, landscaping, wayfinding ability, and equity helps to understand the degree to which each alternative achieves project goals and to anticipate opposition to the project by producing a complete impact evaluation. </jats:p>",

In order to identify the suitable prediction methods for Indian rail road rural zones, train‐based measurements were conducted in the northern and western rural zones along rail roads. These were carried out by recording the carriers emitted by the trackside base stations inside the moving train. The observed signal levels converted into path losses were compared initially with various conventional prediction methods. The observed results were also compared with the predicted results of radio planning tool utilizing digital terrain data. The constants of the model incorporated in the radio planning tool were tuned separately for north Indian and west Indian base stations based on the observed results. The suitability of the models has been evaluated in terms of standard statistical parameters.</jats:p>",

Frequent episodes of sedation or general anesthetics were required and the rehabilitation is costly. The aim of our new treatment goal was to allow the patients to wake up after tumor surgery with a functional rehabilitation in place.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold> Stereolithographic models were introduced to produce a model from the three‐dimensional computed tomography (CT). A guide with the proposed resection was fabricated, and the real‐time maxillectomy was performed. From the postoperative CT, a second stereolithographic model was manufactured and in addition, a stent for the optimal position of the implants. Customized zygoma implants were installed (R‐zygoma, Integration AB, Göteborg, Sweden). A fixed construction was fabricated by using a new material based on poly(methylacrylate) reinforced with carbon/graphite fibers and attached to the implants. On the same master cast, a separate obturator was fabricated in permanent soft silicon.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The result of this project showed that it was possible to create a virtual plan preoperatively to apply during surgery in order for the patient to wake up functionally rehabilitated.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> From a quality‐of‐life perspective, it is an advantage to be rehabilitated fast. By using new computer technology, pain and discomfort are less and the total rehabilitation is faster, which in turn reduces days in hospital and thereby total costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyzes a policy-making process and discusses the role of policy process management in a public transit project. There has been no well-organized public transit planning done by local government in Japan, mainly because there is no national program for statutory local public transit planning in Japan. The Toyama light rail transit (LRT) project is one of the exceptional cases in which a local government has tackled local public transit planning. The planning process in this project is unveiled through intensive interviews with local stakeholders. The focus is on the framing recognized by the stakeholders. First, the process is classified into four phases. Next, stakeholder behaviors, the main agenda, the framework recognized by the stakeholders, and meetings in each phase are analyzed. The policy process management of the Toyama city government is examined, and the factors influencing the successful introduction of LRT are discussed from the viewpoint of policy management. In summary, three factors are involved: technology and topography, financial resources, and policy process management. Well-organized policy process management contributes to smooth consensus building; in this case, the process manager made the best use of the technological and topographical and financial factors and consequently guided the stakeholders to a consensus. Finally, the lessons learned from the Toyama LRT case are discussed. The following key factors, each of which influences the policy-making process, are described: appropriate vision setting and strong leadership, meeting management, viewpoint shift under certain constraints, the involvement of experts, and the framing arrangement vis-à-vis individual negotiation. </jats:p>",

In this paper I argue that we should engage with humour and laughter in our research accounts, rather than simply relegate these themes to the brackets in our transcripts. Drawing upon doctoral research carried out with members of specialist visually impaired walking groups, I show how laughter and humour form a temporary sonic element to the landscapes they pass through and how laughter and humour are used to negotiate the relations between sighted guide and walker, relieve nervousness, and subvert stereotypes. I argue that recognition should be given to laughter and humour as both a conscious reflective strategy and a ‘nonrepresentational’ embodied and contagious phenomenon, for laughter and humour are intimately connected both to the subject positions of walkers with visual impairments and to the embodied, muscular practice of walking itself. I note that, while humour is a useful individual coping strategy that gives people with blindness a sense of liberation from a notion of ‘the blind’ as subjects of pity, laughter and humour can also betray a certain pessimism—sometimes used as a way of coping with, rather than actually challenging, some of the subtle prejudices that they face as users of rural space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of emergency evacuation is to move people away from a dangerous place because of a threat or an occurrence of a natural or a human-caused disastrous event. Although research has investigated emergency evacuations during hurricanes and nuclear power plant disasters, there is a lack of comprehensive, interdisciplinary research on urban evacuation planning by the use of surface transportation networks, especially for terrorist-induced emergencies. Recent disasters reveal how different factors hinder emergency evacuations in urban areas. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how these factors should be taken into account in establishing an urban evacuation strategy. To achieve this goal, a framework for an integrated urban emergency evacuation contingency plan (IUE<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>CP) was developed to provide a basis for creating an emergency evaluation preparedness system. Such a system can raise public awareness of the evacuation procedures and provide guidelines for municipal governments. First, the paper presents the components of the IUE<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>CP framework, including the novel concept of the emergency evacuation backbone network. The Beijing Olympic Green serves as a case study of the IUE<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>CP initiative. Second, evacuation network planning objective models are structured, including harm zone and buffer zone traffic control planning objective models. Third, the primary requirements for emergency evacuation communication systems are discussed. Finally, to include human behavior factors in IUE<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>CP, the concepts of situation awareness and distributed situation awareness are introduced, and the framework for their application in the feed-forward and feedback control mechanisms during evacuation is presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well known that maintenance planning affects, in general, the life of the structures, material wear, and quality of service. In particular, the maintenance of rail tracks affects the traffic volume as well, and therefore it is an important issue for the management of a railway system. Accurate maintenance planning is necessary to optimize resources. The condition of railways is checked by special diagnostic trains. Because of the vast amount of data that these trains record, it is necessary to analyze these data through an appropriate decision support system (DSS). However, the most up-to-date DSSs, such as EcoTrack, are based on a binary logic with rigid thresholds and complicated algorithms with a large number of rules that restrict their flexibility in use. In addition, they adopt considerable simplifications in the rail track deterioration model. In this paper, a neurofuzzy inference engine has been implemented for a DSS to overcome these drawbacks. Based on fuzzy logic, it was able to handle thresholds expressed as a range, an approximate number, or even a verbal value. Moreover, through artificial neural networks, it was possible to obtain more precise rail track deterioration models. The results obtained with the proposed model have been clustered through a fuzzy procedure to optimize the maintenance schedule, thus grouping the interventions in space and in time. </jats:p>",

Tara NP was nominated in 2004 within the UNESCO - ROSTE programme, for Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserve status in Serbia as transboundary 'Peace Park' status between Serbia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. Mt. Tara is one of the most important centres of Balkans and European ecosystems and species diversity. They represent a unique example of well preserved forests in south eastern Europe with numerous endemic and relict species of flora and fauna. In this floristic diversity of Mt Tara of the greatest interest is the Serbian (Pancic's) spruce Picea omorika. Mt. Tara NP is characterized by specific geomorphologic, hydrologic, geologic, soil and climatic features. The geographical information system (GIS) that we have created has proved an excellent tool for the spatial planning strategy in assessment and conservation of all natural characteristics of Mt. Tara NP, and is helpful to Park management for sustainable use of landscape resources. GIS of Mt. Tara NP includes data on natural, artificial and management themes.</jats:p>"

The decision variables are the activity level of each hospital medical service and the attributes are the basic indicators that are managed when elaborating the Contract-program: financing, number of discharges, average length of stay and complexity weight. We solve our model by the EXCEL's tool SOLVER. The use of this tool allows simulating several scenarios in an interactive way, which is very useful for the study and discussion of the quantities to contract between the Hospital and the Administration. The paper concludes with a brief presentation of the results obtained when applying our model to a hospital of the Basque Health Service.</jats:p>"

Conditions which ensure the controllability of the overall system are given as a previous requirement for optimization. Three transformations of variables are made on the system equations in order to implement the scheme on an equivalent linear system. This leads to an equivalent representation of the used quadratic performance index that involves the appearance of quadratic weighting terms related to both transformed input and state variables. In this way, a Riccati‐matrix sequence, allowing the synthesis of a standard feedback control law, is obtained. Finally, the proposed control scheme is tested on realistic examples.</jats:p>",
