Strategies of growth management have recommended state preemption of land-use planning traditionally exercised by local government. Thus, a strong bias against local planning has been reinforced in the literature over the last two decades. Based on studies in rural areas of the Northeast, this article questions the prevailing attitudes and underlying assumptions about local planning. The research demonstrates that people in rural areas are concerned about environmental issues, that local planning boards do not reject land control for environmental protection, and that state planning may not protect the rural environment more effectively than local planning. </jats:p>",

Specifically, a case study is presented that documents—over time—the process of decision making, in seeking to close a community hospital against strong, and vocal, local interests. This analysis supports the view that, in the real world of health planning, power is exercised through a process of bargaining between health care providers and government, and between health care providers. Overall, the study illustrates the constraints upon the American health planning agencies to steer a relatively autonomous health care sector.</jats:p>",

The model was designed to compare three approaches: (1) diet modification; (2) fortification of processed foods; and (3) periodic large doses. Health effects projected are rates of specific eye pathologies associated with vitamin A deficiency (xerophthalmia), and mortalities within age cohorts. Effectiveness is calculated as a function of coverage, biological efficacy, and incidence of vitamin A deficiency. The model was applied to data from the Province of West Java in Indonesia. The results of this application suggest that funding level considerations are an important factor in selecting a preferred control strategy. In addition to determining the relative resource requirements of alternative interventions aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality effects of vitamin A deficiencies, the model, using marginal cost and marginal effectiveness information, can serve as a guide to the most efficient allocation of resources for each type of intervention.</jats:p>",

Enormous wealth has not, however, sheltered Kuwait from the contemporary public policy dilemma generally encountered in other countries—how to reconcile fast‐rising public expectations for more and better government services with slower‐growing budgetary revenues. Following a review of some of the more prominent national economic and social characteristics, the structure of the Kuwaiti National Health Service is described against the backdrop of new economic realities precipitated by a decline in oil export earnings and a slowing of economic expansion. Government plans to alleviate the pressure on public spending are described which center on cost sharing with consumers and employers. Finally, the implications of cost containment for the future of private medical practice are discussed.</jats:p>",

Also, the reliability and comparability of data may be poor. This article emphasises that the effects of capitation and fee‐for‐service payment methods on general medical practice should be carefully compared with factual information, especially numerical data. In so doing, it is shown that there are supporting data for the contention that a fee‐for‐service system encourages more consultations, more diagnostic tests, higher drug use, higher surgical rates and higher costs than a capitation system. On the other hand, a capitation system may lead doctors to hastier and less courteous care than a fee‐for‐service system. The geographical distribution of general practitioners (GPs) may be more even, and continuity of care may be better maintained, under a capitation system; but there may be excessive referrals from GPs to specialists under this system of payment. There is no evidence for the contention that a capitation system encourages preventive medicine, but the financial coverage for preventive procedures does encourage such procedures.</jats:p>",

The planning will necessitate a greater depth of thought, but will not involve a significant increase in either capital, or operating cost.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Current design and operating practice pay little attention to the problems of eventual removal and abandonment. By recognising the impact of decisions taken during design, installation, and operation on the eventual costs of removal it is possible to modify the actions taken so that, at no increase in cost, the final cost of removal will be reduced.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To illustrate general lines of argument, specific examples are given. These are drawn from both the northern and southern sectors of the North Sea.</jats:p>",

They know how to eliminate architectural barriers, adapt equipment to maximize independence and functional levels, and use play in facilitating children’s development. By participating in playground planning or adaption, the occupational therapist can present play opportunities for children with disabilities, increase public awareness of occupational therapy, and extend the use of treatment modalities. This paper makes specific suggestions for planning and building to make the idea for a playground a realistic goal. A case example illustrates the planning of a playground in a hospital setting.</jats:p>",

Further, partnerships involving large volumes are much more stable than those involving small volumes.

Case histories include examples of the following: partial penetration and spherical flow; flow influenced by various boundary conditions and geometries, including linear flow; variations in transmissibility; and effects from ocean tides. It is shown how these well-test results can be integrated with the geological framework, and their overall impact on oilfield development planning is discussed.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The success of defining an optimum hydrocarbon-field development plan is crucially dependent on the early knowledge of the reservoir drive mechanisms and heterogeneities that may affect fluid flow in the reservoir. For offshore field developments, decisions related to the possible placement of injectors are of particular concern. As shown in the documented case histories, a greater effort to obtain quality data from extensive well testing may be warranted in such situations to confirm the geological model derived from seismic. petrophysical, and geological considerations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In any development, but particularly of significance in offshore (platform) situations, the three largest reservoir uncertainties commonly found are related to aquifer strength, sealing capacity of faults, and the extent of sand development. This is also true of the situations described here that use floating production facilities kept on location by a single-point mooring system, accommodating a small number of wells. In these more marginal field situations. there is not only a need for technically creative and novel engineering solutions that are robust and cost-effective, but also a need for a more detailed definition of future production and injection expectations and strategies.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Well Testing In Timor Sea Oil Fields</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>One new frontier in oilfield development is the Timor Sea. This offshore area, bordering the northwestern coast of Australia (see Fig. 1), has been explored to a relatively small extent, and to date only two commercial fields have been delineated: the Jabiru and Challis fields, contained in Permit AC/P4.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In the Jabiru field, further described in later sections, it could be ascertained from well-test analysis that the large degree of reservoir faulting would not impede the initially indicated high production rates. A second vital piece of information obtained from well tests in this field relates to the anticipated aquifer response. In this respect, an effective vertical-to-horizontal-permeability ratio could be deduced from partial penetration and hemispherical flow. Although the well tests conducted were not strictly limit tests, they nevertheless indicated the accessibility of large reservoir volumes and the likelihood of a strong bottomwater drive.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In contrast to the Jabiru field, which shows a sand development of considerable thickness, the Challis field comprises relatively thin oil-bearing sands. This field, also further described in the following sections, presented a particular challenge for well-test analysis. Because of the limited sand thickness, the impact of faults led to varied pressure-transient characteristics arising from different flow and boundary conditions. Furthermore, because appraisal wells in this field are to contribute directly to future production (subsea wells), the determination of \"connected oil\" is of great importance, particularly because completion costs, including costly flowlines, exceed the original drilling cost. The confirmation of reasonably sized fault compartments is also a prerequisite for the successful placement of water injectors.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In the Timor Sea fields discovered so far, permeabilities are in the darcy range, requiring certain precautions to be taken during testing i.e., the use of high-accuracy gauges and tide corrections. As previously observed in Australian offshore sedimentary basins, corrections for ocean tide effects are particularly necessary, because these perturbations can be easily misinterpreted as boundary effects when superimposed on a relatively flat pressure-buildup response.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Fertility rates in the more urban and developed parts of China are very low, approximating those of countries with the lowest fertility rates in the world. Family planning in these areas is also very common and widespread. The more rural and interior areas of China, however, are characterized by much higher fertility rates and by much lower family planning rates. Family planning variables are very good predictors of provincial fertility.</jats:p>",

It is based on the idea of comparing the access to the public services in every community, through the use of a statistical treatment in which a set of indicators are aggregated into an indicator of need, which is used to allocate funds in order to reach ‘equal access’. The method is then applied to the case of Spain. </jats:p>",

I begin with a description of the changing structure of the industry nationally, noting particularly the trend towards seller concentration. Differences between these national trends and those pertaining to Wirral are reported, including the increase in the market dominance of local small firms. I then consider local variations in market characteristics and those in production which may account for these differences. I conclude that this divergence is most probably explained by a relative decline in local housing demand and by changes in the local land market, both of which make investment in the area less attractive to large national housebuilding firms. </jats:p>",

Despite these broad principles, health delivery systems in developing countries have access to a very limited set of resources. Health planners are faced with the dilemma of creating cost‐effective programmes while recognizing the need to take into account the broad definition of health and the importance of local participation in planning. This dilemma has led to a division between those planners who put greater emphasis on the use of cost analysis techniques in which the decision‐making process rests more with professional planners (often outside consultants) vs those who emphasize greater local control of the decision‐making process. The purpose of this paper is to present a study in which two alternative approaches to cost utility analysis were used. Consideration was given both to the actual cost analysis strategy and to the integration of the cost variable into the total decision‐making process. Finally, major emphasis was placed on including local decision‐makers in the planning process and providing them with feasible and understandable decision‐making tools.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two basic models of regional unemployment are tested by use of unemployment rates of US metropolitan areas over the period February 1980 through December 1983. In the first model, regional unemployment is suggested to be the region's share of disequilibrium in the national labor market. The functional integration of regions with the national economy is a fundamental requisite for symmetry in this model, and symmetry is required for the model to have any explanatory power. Unfortunately, given the preponderant lack of strong covariance found here between regional and national labor markets, such functional integration does not seem to hold in general. The suggestion in the second model tested here is that regional labor markets should be spatially integrated under neoclassical rules. Here spatial integration, as measured by the spatial autocorrelation of regional unemployment rates, is found to be periodic rather than consistent. It appears that the spatial integration of US regional labor markets is not robust in the face of volatile macroeconomic circumstances. Unfortunately, this lack of robustness results in an asymmetrical system of interregional labor markets. The major problems of the two models result from their ageographical origins. </jats:p>",

In order to understand better such ‘contemporary urban areas’, researchers need land-use models that realistically capture the key features of such areas and that can handle detailed data sets. </jats:p><jats:p> We review the literature on large-scale land-use modeling with this objective in mind. Characterizing the known models along several dimensions describing purpose, conceptual basis, mathematical content, and level of detail, we select models that are representative of the range of approaches taken. Six of these are reviewed in detail, and four others are discussed more briefly. </jats:p><jats:p> We find that the existing literature forces one to choose between tractability and suitability for contemporary urban areas. The key omission in the tractable models is economies of agglomeration that would help explain the emergence of subcenters. Most tractable models also lack a dynamic structure suitable for handling rapid disequilibrium growth. Models that contain these two features are suitable for broad-brush computer simulation, but they cannot be calibrated with real disaggregated land-use data. This conclusion leads to some brief suggestions on directions for future work. </jats:p>",

In the ‘scattering’ phase of this approach, dots denoting the mass centre of each functional block are ‘scattered’ in 2‐D space using FDR (force‐directed relaxation), UCG (unconstrained cluster growth) or CCG (constrained cluster growth) techniques.</jats:p><jats:p>The ‘gathering’ phase is modelled as a computational geometrical problem called MBE (minimal box embedding), for which two practical solution techniques, GBS (growing box scheme) and RBS (reducing box scheme) are described. the 2‐D MBE problem is to find the orientation, shape and size of a rectangle which has the smallest area among those rectangles which stay within the specified aspect ratio range and include (gather), at least, the specified fraction of dots scattered in 2‐D space. Several speed‐up techniques such as incremental transform/sorting and quadrant folding are also explained. It is shown through experiment that the UCG has advantages over FDR in terms of CPU time and the degree of correlation between the area of the minimum embedding box and the routing length.</jats:p><jats:p>The proposed MBE algorithm has been extended to the layer assignment of circuit modules in truly three‐dimensional package planning where the circuit modules are placed on multiple layers and inter‐layer connections are allowed in the interior of each layer plane. Experimental results on 2‐D and 3‐D examples have shown that the MBE algorithm is at least 20 times faster than simulated annealing (SA) in the 2‐D case, and min‐cut‐based layering plus force‐cut placement in the 3‐D case. On the other hand, the routeing length overhead of the MBE algorithm was about 30‐40 per cent in the 2‐D case compared to SA, and only 10 per cent in the 3‐D case compared to min‐cut layering followed by the force‐cut placement technique.</jats:p>",
