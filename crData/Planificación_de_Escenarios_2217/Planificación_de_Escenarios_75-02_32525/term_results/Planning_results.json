Four classifications of trip makers are considered—age, sex and marital status, socioeconomic group, occupational classification, and standard industrial classification. A trip-distribution model is calibrated for each of the categories mentioned above. Calibration methods are discussed and a new method whereby the significance of the differences in the values in the trip-distribution model parameters between categories may be examined. It is concluded that it is not worth running separate distribution models for each distinct category of trip maker since the improvement, at least in descriptive ability, is only marginally better than the fit shown by a single trip-distribution model. </jats:p>",

It may happen that a particular region may suffer pollution caused by the production of inputs and outputs which are consumed outside the region. This is also further complicated by the diffusion of pollutants over space. Within the framework of a balanced regional input–output model, a scheme for subsidy/tax has been presented so that interregional equity is maintained. Pollution control strategies must result in regional unemployment, migration, capital movements over space, changes in interregional competitive position, etc. A dynamic scheme is suggested so that, given some exogenous policy decisions and technological constraints, the activity levels of production in different regions are determined so that the system is in equilibrium. </jats:p>",

To reduce the effect of these uncertainties, the authors have developed a sophisticated human resources forecasting system using computer-based modeling and simulation techniques. This model was designed and developed for use in a large branch banking system operating statewide. It is, however, applicable for use in other industries having different organizational structures.

A series of hypotheses are set up and tested for Greater London concerning the interrelationships between linkage flows, spatial patterns, and locational evaluation. In general it is found that the volume of freight moving to and from firms in linkage flows is a poor predictor of spatial patterns and locational evaluation, despite the fact that London firms perceive linkages as important, not only in themselves but also in their strong relationship both to the degree to which firms concentrate on local markets and to their rates of decentralisation. Possible reasons for this paradox are suggested and, finally, some practical implications of the findings are indicated. </jats:p>",

Input data from research and marketing are processed through logical programs to provide the discounted payoffs, probabilities (Bayesian, parallel strategies), subjective nonmonetary multiple criteria weights, and the matrix for the mathematical programming model. The multiperiod portfolio is revised sequentially for resources exhaustion throughout the planning horizon by the staged introduction of additional projects. Marginal payoff function (additional investments vs. expected payoff) is a by‐product for the support of additional resources justification. Mathematical and heuristic techniques used to overcome common difficulties confronted by previously discussed models are presented. Experience with model introduction to management is also discussed.</jats:p>",

It mainly covers the ongoing activities of the Business Unit and the work which can be seen as a natural evolution of its present activity. What it does not cover is the identification by both the Planning and Technical Functions of the longer term developments of a company or its Business Units, and also possibly the fields for still wider diversification. These will be dealt with in Part II.</jats:p><jats:p>In many cases, however, a surprisingly high proportion of the Technical Function budget is spent on the natural extension of the present business and a means of analysis by business unit objectives is proposed so that other functions can participate in the setting of objectives and evaluating progress. Close identification with business unit objectives will be found helpful in eliminating waste and often identifying new problems for the Technical Function to pursue.</jats:p>",

A mathematical programming model with the capacity to check multiple resource demand and supply compatibility over many time periods was developed for the solution to this type of problem. The characteristics of natural resource supply and the demand of activities were utilized to reduce the number of time periods and to minimize the loss of the dynamic reality of the problem. Reduction in the number of time periods extended the capability of the model to the solution of complex resource planning problems without oversimplification.</jats:p>",
