Joseph Smith spoke of the necessity to create a “Zion-like” society, where the Saints would abide by the governing laws of the gospel, and thereby live in harmony with one another under a theocratic government.’ In this society the Saints would live under the law of consecration, where all possessions would be held in common. Pride, greed, immorality, and crime would not be found there. It would be a place for the “pure in heart.” Such a utopian state of being was to be achieved in preparation for the millennial reign of Christ.</jats:p>",

The widely held notion that the switch from a general property tax to a land value tax would increase land use efficiency, reduce urban sprawl, and help preserve the environment is challenged. The traditional view of land development holds that a tax placed on land is capitalized and leaves resource allocation unaffected. No excess burden is created because developers and landowners can do nothing to reduce their tax liability. Taxes on improvements to land, however, create burdens that can be reduced by lowering development density and causing the city to spread more than it would under neutral tax. Recent theories challenge this view and suggest that, under certain conditions, the land value tax promotes urban sprawl more than does the property tax. Variants of the land value tax as applied in special districts appear attractive, but the empirical literature is inconclusive as to the spatial consequences of land taxation. </jats:p>",

It centers on the doctrine of Zion which led to over 500 planned settlements in Missouri, Illinois, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Canada, and Mexico. This doctrine also led to a hierarchy of building types from temples and tabernacles to meetinghouses and tithing offices. Their built environment stands as a monument to a unique utopian society that not only survived but continues to flourish where others have become historical or cultural curiosities. Hamilton’s account, augmented by 135 original and historical photographs, provides a fascinating example of how religious teachings and practices are expressed in planned communities and architecture types.</jats:p>",

Its size and central position within the community reminded the Saints of their covenants and obligations. Tabernacles were specifically de signed to meet the congregational needs of a stake, a term used to describe a Mormon ecclesiastical unit roughly equivalent to a diocese.’ A stake is composed of wards, smaller ecclesiastical units roughly equivalent to parishes. A typical stake, in the nineteenth century, often en compassed an entire community and a number of outlying areas, including other towns, whereas a ward encompassed a single settlement or ecclesiastical subdivisions in cities where there were larger concentrations of church members.</jats:p>",

Church doctrine pertaining to the family is based on the continuation of the family unit after death, and to Mormons, eternal life is the opportunity to live with God as a family unit. Because of this eternal emphasis, the home takes on an even greater meaning to the Mormons than it does in most societies. Their children are nurtured and instructed in the teachings and practices of the church to prepare them to be the next generation of faithful members. However, the importance affixed to the family was not necessarily translated into significant domestic architecture. For the most part, the Saints’ early designs were based more on existing vernacular forms than on current stylistic trends, yet they were a vital aspect of nineteenth-century Mormon history and material culture.</jats:p>",

By the 1850s and 1860s, schools, theaters, and civic buildings were being added to the ecclesiastical vocabulary of temples, tabernacles, and meetinghouses. Based primarily on economy of construction and practical functionalism, these structures were for the most part not architecturally distinguished. Vernacular became the accepted form, consistent with much of Mormon architecture before the death of Brigham Young in 1877. Even so, these buildings were an important part of nineteenth-century Mormon architecture.</jats:p>",

It took Newton to question why an apple falls down rather than up and to discover the law of gravity. It took Einstein to point out that time and space are relative, not absolute, which led to the theory of relativity. It took Keynes to observe that if every individual tries to save without investing, the nation as a whole may not be able to save because total output will decline. So, what is considered economically rational behaviour at the disaggregate level may not be all that rational at the aggregate level, an observation that culminated in the General Theory. And it took Churchill to thunder in the midst of the Second World War: ‘There is no finer investment than putting milk in babies.”In the same spirit, after many decades of development, we are redis covering the obvious-that people are both the means and the end of economic development. Often, this simple truth gets obscured because we are used to talking in abstractions, in aggregates, in numbers. Human beings, fortunately too stubborn to lend themselves to becoming a mere abstraction, are conveniently forgotten. Economists, in discussing the means of development, often talk about investment capital. Physical capital has taken centre stage, to the exclusion of many other factors of production. Human capital is measured neither quantitatively nor qualitatively. Nor does it receive the attention it deserves. Many societies, despite an abundance of financial capital, have been unable to develop.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the problem of achieving sustainable development in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and other policy suggestions is examined. Sustainable development is defined as a commitment to conserve necessary biological, cultural, and aesthetic capital for future generations. This is not a costless process. Constraints are required on current economic activity, entailing sacrifices by the current generation, if sustainability requirements are to be met. Specific wildlife sites within the farmed landscape are critical to the sustainability programme. Conservation of these sites entails the continuation of specific and often technically obsolete farming practices. Their conservation cannot be ensured by the practice of efficient sustainable agriculture as advocated by the authors Pretty and Howes. Furthermore, those authors are wrong in believing that such agriculture could be profitable without continuing subsidy. The approach of the CAP is to make payments for the practices necessary to safeguard these sites. However, the economic sustainability of the CAP is doubtful. Its costs are excessive and reforms are not reducing the excessive financial burden and resource costs. Alternative reform packages involving conservation through cross-compliance have even greater resource costs. The ability to safeguard these critical sites in the long run is therefore questionable. This suggests there is a need to rethink sustainability requirements for cultural and biological diversity. </jats:p>",

In accordance with these regulations, this paper presents a method for determining cost‐effective conservation plans for sensitive wildlife species. The method is a decision framework for determining what forest areas should be managed as habitat to meet a population viability constraint and what areas should be used for timber production to maximize the present value of revenue from timber yields. The viability constraint is a minimum probability of meeting a standard for the risk of population extinction. This viability constraint focuses regulatory decisions on two key parameters: the standard for extinction risk and the probability of attaining the standard. The decision model is used to estimate the economic costs of these parameters. Examples for single‐ and multi‐patch conservation problems show that the cost of habitat preservation increases as the standard for extinction risk becomes more stringent and as the required probability of attainment increases. Results from the decision model are useful for evaluating research and monitoring activities and determining the economically efficient risk standard.</jats:p>",

Our intention is not to explain such moments, not to analyze the motivations of those involved, but to follow them in the fashion of nomadic science, critically drawing upon the work of Deleuze and Guattari. In our conclusion we argue that the value of spirits of resistance should be upheld in the face of intellectual strategies to tame them, as it is these moments that best guarantee freedom, whether or not resistance is ‘successful’ . </jats:p>",

We present an interactive method of multi-objective linear programming for supporting the planning process. In the proposed procedure, emphasis is placed on reducing uncertainty that surrounds the resolution of goal conflicts. Parametric analysis is iteratively performed to shed insights into the question of what happens to goal tradeoffs if a particular criterion is achieved at alternative levels. The composite objective function guiding the parametric analysis is updated as decision maker replaces a previous choice with an improved one. Central to this step is the induction of criterion weights implied by a decision instance, through the use of shadow prices. Finally, ordinal goal priority is employed to generate initial solution and decompose a multi-objective planning problem into more tractable subproblems. The interactive procedure is illustrated by a land-use planning model containing five forest-related outputs, including noncommercial grazing, commercial grazing, timber, camping, and profit. For.

They recognized that most food items are generally consumed in whole units and as such they are represented as integer variables. However, as in most previous studies, they derived the minimum cost diets by optimizing over purchased food items. The present paper presents a computer-assisted, diet-planning modelling system for individuals by optimizing over recipes instead of food items. This is accomplished by restricting the integer programming solutions to those bundles of food that represent reasonably popular meal recipes. The modelling system is composed of three main components: recipe data entry, database management, and the model. The recipe data entry component creates and stores recipes. It aiso provides nutritional analysis of the recipes. The database management component creates and maintains several databases necessary to build the modelling data file. The modelling component solves the user-specified model. Currently, the model component can solve for the optimal diet by minimizing cost or minimizing cooking and preparation time. The optimal diet is prepared to satisfy the recommended nutritional guidelines for a predefined group of individuals for 1 week. The system currently has 895 popular recipes found in Hawaii. Diet plans generated using this modelling system with differing objectives are discussed and compared.</jats:p>",

In this regard, nutrition planning, taking into account the glycemic effect of food and the maximum compliance with the insulin therapy regimen, is one of the main links in good control of diabetes. Planning a child’s nutrition is imperative to provide for his age-related energy needs and the optimal ratio of basic food ingredients (proteins, fats and carbohydrates) without lowering the daily calorie rate. The adequacy of the energy and biological value of food to the age requirements of the child is assessed by the normal rate of physical and mental development of the sick child, as well as his good health. However, a child should not only receive food calories, proteins, fats and carbohydrates “due” to him by age, but also enjoy the food. It depends on how diverse the patient’s diet is and how the doctor takes into account the stereotype of the family’s nutrition and the patient’s eating habits: if the regimen and nature of the food recommended by the doctor is familiar and convenient for the patient, this will not create difficulties for observing the basic “dietary” rules.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Portering—carrying loads for pay—is an important source of cash income in the high mountain community of Shimshal, northern Pakistan. In this paper recent changes in the regulation of portering opportunities in Shimshal are interpreted as a tentative outcome of ongoing struggles among villagers over the ideological power of two integrated and competing conceptualisations, or discourses, of political legitimacy. These contemporary ideological discourses trace to historical conflicts between commoners and royalty in the feudal kingdom of Hunza, of which Shimshal was an outlying settlement. Specifically, an ‘authoritative’ position in Shimshal perpetuates a tradition of elite privilege developed by the kings of Hunza to justify their penetration of community-level political, social, and economic life. A ‘discursive’ position draws from an alternative tradition of equity and solidarity which originated in the consensual clan (and later, community) assemblies of commoners, and which was used historically to resist the infiltration of royal prerogative into everyday life. An account of recent struggles between advocates of these positions over portering regulation in Shimshal is developed from ethnographic material collected in 1988 and 1989. Aspects of Habermas's theory of communicative action are utilised selectively to interpret the implications of those struggles for political legitimacy in Shimshal. It seems that Shimshal is experiencing a tenuous shift away from authoritative forms of legitimacy toward more discursive ones, although a strongly Habermasian conceptualisation of discursivity is unwarranted. </jats:p>",

In the first and second sections, the main theoretical characteristics presented by a regulationist analysis of contemporary capitalist change are discussed in detail, stressing that regulation is a continuous but highly variable process. In the third section, some key findings from recent work on rural Wales—which highlights the cultural, social, and economic elements of change–are presented. In the fourth and concluding section we discuss the potential contribution which regulation theory might make to rural research, but in addition outline the ways in which an analysis of contemporary rural change might contribute to the continuing development of regulation theory. In particular, attention is drawn to several key issues which a regulationist account of rural change will have to consider. </jats:p>",

In particular, I focus on the processes of informalization and feminization of garment manufacture as Ecuadorian producers attempt to remain viable in a radically opened economy. A central premise of this study is that gendered labor supplies in places are significant to the form that industry restructuring assumes. The analysis draws on extensive fieldwork and builds a political economy of industrial development, debt crisis, and austerity to uncover those forces which have combined in place to restructure gender divisions of labor in paid work and households in the early 1990s. This is coupled with analysis of in-depth interviews with women informal garment workers in order to understand the diverse constructions of informal work, gender divisions of labor, and daily life that are emerging under austerity. This involves an examination of the ways in which gender roles and relations are being reworked for these women and their families through informal wage-earning activity. This moves the analysis beyond representations of women as uniformly subordinated by industrial capitalism and towards an appreciation of the mutual reworkings of employment relations and gender identities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contrary to many other types of spatial decisions, shopping destination choice behavior is highly repetitive. For the practitioner looking for good predictors of store patronage, for reliable marginal utility estimates and reliable market share predictions, a central concern is with the type of data best suited to the research question, given the existing logistic and financial constraints. Different approaches can be recognized in the literature in which conventional discrete choice models are applied to shopping destination choice problems. In this paper, two of the most common practices are assessed and compared. First, the choice model is estimated with all choices of a relevant destination observed during a certain period of time (pooled cross-sectional data). The alternative approach consists in an estimation with the choice of the destination where the majority of purchases takes place (cross-sectional data). In the particular data set employed here, no evidence is found to support the idea that a multinomial logit model estimated with cross-sectional data does not perform as well as a model estimated with pooled cross-sectional data. Both models are found to be similar in their ability to identity the main predictors of store choice. Models developed on either data sets have marginal utility estimates that exhibit no statistically significant differences. Finally, market share predictions derived from both models are not statistically different. It appears, therefore, that there is no need to collect repeated patronage data over an extended period of time. The practitioner who wishes to use a conventional discrete choice model may avoid spending much time and money by gathering limited data on regular patronage patterns. In addition to this practical implication, the conclusions suggest that regular shopping destinations are chosen in accordance with the same behavioral motives as ancillary destinations are. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Class analysis per se seems to have fallen out of favour in rural studies. In this paper the way in which it might usefully be reinstated as a unitary perspective on rural change is examined. The middle class is used as a focal point for the analysis. First, a short review of recent developments in class analysis within sociology is presented, and it is argued that class should be considered as an outcome of the various processes of collective action contributing to class formation. Second, some recent examples of class analysis in rural studies in the United Kingdom are considered. It is argued that these have been insufficiently attentive to the ways in which the processes of class formation unfold in the rural arena and the constitutive role of rural space. Yet rural England provides a particularly fruitful context in which to study middle-class collective action, for collective action is increasingly dominated by this class. Other forms of action associated with other attributes, such as race, ethnicity, and gender, are only likely to be successfully asserted if they reinforce the general character of this class context. In conclusion, the argument is made for a symmetrical use of class analysis, one which is in a subtle and complex relationship both with empirical work and with other forms of interpretation and analysis. It is proposed that the performative definition which underlies this paper provides such a symmetry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the emergence during the 1980s of a water pollution problem associated with intensive livestock production is examined. Farm pollution is socially constructed and is shaped by rural social change. Rural areas are experiencing social and economic restructuring with a resultant shift in emphasis from production to consumption concerns. ‘New’ people are living in the countryside, with ideas about how its resources should be managed that often differ from those with traditional production interests. At the same time, the debates surrounding the privatisation of the water industry opened up the issue of water pollution in the countryside to greater critical scrutiny. It is in this context that pollution from farm ‘wastes’ (termed here ‘farm pollution’) has gone from being a ‘nonproblem’ in the 1970s to an issue of greater public and political concern and regulatory activity since the late 1980s. Based on evidence from a study of dairy farming in Devon, it is argued in this paper that the farm pollution problem and its regulation are as much a function of social change in the countryside as of environmental change in rivers. </jats:p>",

Thus, most existing solutions are not suitable for on‐line motion planning applications, such as the interception of moving targets, where time‐optimality of the motion is advantageous. A novel technique is proposed in this article that separates the time‐optimal point‐to‐point motion problem into the following two sub‐problems: (1) selection of a near‐time‐optimal path between the two endpoints, and (2) generation of time‐optimal motion along the selected path (i.e., constrained continuous path motion). Although our approach uses known path‐constrained time‐optimal‐motion algorithms for the second sub‐problem, a new method is proposed for the selection of near‐time‐optimal paths. Based on a study of the characteristics of global‐time‐optimal paths, the near‐optimal path is selected as a minimum‐curvature joint spline, tangent to one of the manipulator's acceleration directions at the start point, and tangent to the required manipulator velocity direction at the end point. The algorithm for determining the overall near‐optimal path is described herein, along with an example. Simulation test results and computation‐time studies indicate that the proposed method is suitable for on‐line motion planning applications. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The exact mix will depend on the elements included in the strategy and the focal points for behavioural change. It is likely that the effective participation of householders could be increased by discard-relevant or jointly-relevant instruments such as residential waste-collection fees or potentially refundable product levies. We anticipate that brand owners will call for the implementation of such instruments to help in meeting their packaging-recovery responsibilities. </jats:p>",

Previous studies determined that the unseweved sanitation systems in the recharge areas are the main source of nitrogen. Calculations are made in this study to estimate the maximum population density allowable without improved sewage systems in order to keep the nitrogen levels in ground water below the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results were achieved employing a mass balance that involved the concentration and rate of domestic effluents and the flow rate in the aquifer, as well as an estimation of the effects caused by the agricultural activity. It was concluded that, in general terms, the population density must not exceed 45 inhabitants per hectare. Otherwise, sewage systems and treatment plants are necessary. These conclusions provide a basis for urban growth planning, which will protect ground water quality. The method used in this case should apply to similar situations.</jats:p>",

Such perspectives are relevant to the discussion of the media planning environment of the English-speaking Caribbean, especially within the television area where overall dispro portionate amount of foreign programming is perceived by some to contribute to the erosion of indigenous cultural character. These concerns have prompted many leaders throughout the region to re-examine existing policies and systems of control, and to consider appropriate alternatives. This article examines the television programming framework of the country of Barbados, and assesses the extent to which endogenous capacity exists for the development of alternative policy approaches that engender self-reliance and equitable participation in media planning. Based on field research conducted in Barbados in 1992, this examines how key sectors influence the nature and direction of television programming policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The extreme social and economic crisis affecting most Latin American countries has precipitated the expansion of a vast network of collective social movements as a means to cope with the increasing difficulty of life throughout the region. This paper is an examination of the collective struggle of women informal traders as they challenge, through workplace politics, the Peruvian state to address issues of family survival and social reproduction. Although the hierarchical and patriarchal structure of the street-trader union movement limits women's participation, a ‘critical consciousness’ has developed among women traders both in the rank-and-file and in low-level leadership positions which utilizes both direct and subtle strategies to influence the course of union politics. It is argued that the actions of these ‘grass-roots feminists’ to address their practical gender interests presupposes a commitment to strategic gender interests. Hence, their activism not only recasts Molyneux's gender-interest model but also transcends the artificial bifurcation that falsely characterizes the Latin American feminist movement. The experiences of women traders in Peru suggest that women's agency in social movements, such as informal sector trade unions, is introducing new ways of organizing social relations and political activity as it transforms entrenched and hegemonic meanings of politics, influence, and power. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> City planners need to consider aspects of emergency management, risk assessment and hazard vulnerability in their planning and development deliberations. Planners need to recognise that urban hazards, especially from technological sources, are more prevalent than may at first be apparent. An emergency management focus is particularly necessary when urban renewal and redevelopment is being considered Of special importance is the need for planners to understand that projects like this can exacerbate the plight of existing “at-risk” groups, and may even create a more hazardous social environment. Planners also need to be made aware that their professional actions have a direct impact on both the task-set and performance capabilities of disaster managers and emergency services operatives. In this paper two case studies are presented to demonstrate how these issues translate into practice. The first explores the consequences of a “classic” medium-scale technological emergency in Australia. The second study, from Canada, illustrates the ubiquity of small-scale industrial hazards in the modern city, and epitomises the extent to which city-dwellers are vulnerable. </jats:p>",

Data were collected from the chairs of Michigan LEPCs, who were asked to provide information about their LEPCs’staffing, activities, resources, and team climate, as well as information about community hazards and relationships with other organizations in their communities. The model was partially supported. As hypothesized, team climate substantially mediated the relationships between an LEPCs effectiveness and many of the attributes of its internal structure and external environment. In addition, three (emergency planning resources, community support and LEPC staffing and structure) out of four categories of variables hypothesized to influence team climate were, in fact directly related to it. There were two major inconsistencies with the model. First, two types of emergency planning resources were found to have a direct influence on LEPC effectiveness rather than an indirect effect mediated by team climate. In addition, hazard vulnerability was hypothesized to have a direct effect on team climate, but the data showed this relationship was mediated by community support and by LEPC staffing and structure. A revised model was proposed that suggests ways in which members can change the structure of an LEPC and strategies to enhance its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

The essential functionality at each level is also discussed and the new technology requirements are identified. The modularity of AMD will allow the generation of flexible, customized process planning systems to meet specific industrial requirements, enhance the operation of modules at each level and reduce the overall system complexity. However, the most important benefits offered by the AMD architecture are the establishment of time-dependent interfaces with design and production control and the formation of a modular structure that will facilitate the development of future generation, distributed process planning systems. </jats:p>",
