The fluid approximation is used and beam densities up to the plasma one are considered. The hierarchy between instabilities is established in terms of two parameters only: the beam relativistic factor and the ratio nb∕np of the beam density to the plasma one. It is found that for nb∕np≲0.53, the most unstable modes are a mix between filamentation and two-stream instabilities. Beyond this limit, filamentation instability may dominate, depending on the beam relativistic factor. The largest growth rates are found for a beam density slightly smaller than the plasma one.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A multistage stochastic linear program (MSLP) is a model of sequential stochastic optimization where the objective and constraints are linear. When any of the random variables used in the MSLP are continuous, the problem is infinite dimensional. To numerically tackle such a problem, we usually replace it with a finite-dimensional approximation. Even when all the random variables have finite support, the problem is often computationally intractable and must be approximated by a problem of smaller dimension. One of the primary challenges in the field of stochastic programming deals with discovering effective ways to evaluate the importance of scenarios and to use that information to trim the scenario tree in such a way that the solution to the smaller optimization problem is not much different from the problem stated with the original tree. The scenario generation (SG) algorithm proposed in this paper is a finite-element method that addresses this problem for the class of MSLP with random right-hand sides. </jats:p>",

Strategic airline fleet planning is one of the major issues addressed through such systems. We present background research connected with the dynamic allocation concept, which accounts explicitly for the stochastic nature of passenger demand in the fleet composition problem. We address this problem through a scenario aggregation–based approach and present results on representative case studies based on realistic data. Our investigations establish clear benefits of a stochastic approach as compared with deterministic formulations, as well as its implementation feasibility using state-of-the-art optimization software. </jats:p>",

Partial nitritation in the SHARON reactor should be performed to such an extent that an Anammox-optimal nitrite:ammonium ratio is generated. The SHARON process is typically applied to sludge digestion rejection water in order to relieve the ammonium load recycled to the main plant.A simulation study for realistic influent conditions on a SHARON reactor with a fixed volume and operated with constant air flow rate reveals that the actual nitrite:ammonium ratio might deviate significantly from the ideal ratio and might endanger operation of the subsequent Anammox reactor. It is further examined how the nitrite:ammonium ratio might be optimized. A cascade pH control strategy and a cascade O2 control strategy are tested. Simulation results are presented and the performance of the different strategies is assessed and quantified in an economic way by means of an operating cost index. Best results are obtained by means of cascade feedback control of the SHARON effluent nitrite:ammonium ratio through setting an O2-set-point that is tracked by adjusting the air flow rate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning-support systems offer an effective way of integrating social, economic, and environmental datasets, enabling a number of holistic spatial planning scenarios to be generated and evaluated by local planners. With increased acceptance of computer technology as a platform for the development and delivery of professional tools, planning-support systems (PSSs) may well be embraced by practitioners to improve current practices, just as computer-aided design (CAD) has been widely accepted by architects as a useful design and visualisation tool. There is some perceived optimism, (or realism?) that this may be the case sooner rather than later. It is believed that ‘What if?’ is one such PSS which is suitable for enhancing current planning practice. The author provides a technical and experiential examination of an application of the What if? PSS in assisting in the formulation of a sustainable land use strategy for Hervey Bay, Australia, supplementing previous published results. The focus of the research is to examine the underlying model and discuss the collaborative application of the PSS with local planners in a scenario-building exercise. Furthermore, the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the PSS are outlined from the perspective of the urban modeller, together with ex-ante feedback from the local planners on the use of the PSS to formulate urban-growth scenarios. In conclusion, the merits of the use of such a PSS are discussed and some future directions for the development of collaborative spatial decision-support tools are offered. </jats:p>",

It also spells out the details of the National Policy on Library and Information Services (NAPLIS) and the need for a more holistic New Information Policy.
