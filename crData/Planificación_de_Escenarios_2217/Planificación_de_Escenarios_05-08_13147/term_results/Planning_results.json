Four approaches are defined: scholarly, practice, educational, and rights-based. There is only a weak link between any of these approaches and actual local agency land use planning. However, the rightsbased approach is the most holistic of the four. Examining these approaches raised questions. These questions are discussed and lead into the formulation of a new approach that synthesizes components from all of the studied approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using plans and regulations when making decisions about urban development requires access to the many plans and regulations of many different organizations, both private and public. Current information technologies, the Internet and the World Wide Web in particular, make access to data from such disparate sources feasible. Using these technologies to implement a ‘system of plans’ approach to urban development planning will, however, require a widely shared data model for structuring the content and meanings of plans and regulations and a widely shared language, based on this data model. This paper presents an initial version of a planning data model (PDM), several use cases that set the scope of such a data model, and illustrations of how the current version of the PDM supports these use cases. Further work can build on this data model, including an XML (extensible Markup Language) implementation for sharing the information. These tools will enable urban development decisionmakers to conceive of planning as involving many actors whose many plans can provide useful and usable information. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning-support systems offer an effective way of integrating social, economic, and environmental datasets, enabling a number of holistic spatial planning scenarios to be generated and evaluated by local planners. With increased acceptance of computer technology as a platform for the development and delivery of professional tools, planning-support systems (PSSs) may well be embraced by practitioners to improve current practices, just as computer-aided design (CAD) has been widely accepted by architects as a useful design and visualisation tool. There is some perceived optimism, (or realism?) that this may be the case sooner rather than later. It is believed that ‘What if?’ is one such PSS which is suitable for enhancing current planning practice. The author provides a technical and experiential examination of an application of the What if? PSS in assisting in the formulation of a sustainable land use strategy for Hervey Bay, Australia, supplementing previous published results. The focus of the research is to examine the underlying model and discuss the collaborative application of the PSS with local planners in a scenario-building exercise. Furthermore, the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the PSS are outlined from the perspective of the urban modeller, together with ex-ante feedback from the local planners on the use of the PSS to formulate urban-growth scenarios. In conclusion, the merits of the use of such a PSS are discussed and some future directions for the development of collaborative spatial decision-support tools are offered. </jats:p>",

With a close analysis of the legislative record and archival material, this article argues that most of these amendments originated from divisions among Progressives or from Senator David I. Walsh (D-MA), who wanted to serve the poor and clear slums. The 1937 Housing Act should be viewed as a Progressive bill that weathered the legislative process surprisingly well. Furthermore, public housing’s later struggles cannot be blamed on a law emasculated at its origination. Instead, historians should more carefully examine the implementation of the law as well as its Progressive assumptions. </jats:p>",

Edge or boundary problems always are encountered when applying a holistic approach, and design of institutional arrangements cannot eliminate these problems but can minimize them. IWRM often does not have a statutory basis, which can lead to implementation challenges. By linking IWRM to land-use planning and official plans at the local level, IWRM can be given credibility, as well as be systematically connected to land-based issues. </jats:p>",

Responding to these fears, affordable housing advocates have claimed that there is little evidence from studies that have examined this topic to suggest that affordable housing detrimentally affects property values. Is this true? Does affordable housing have no effect on lowering property values? This review examines seventeen studies that have attempted to measure the effect of affordable housing on property values to try to answer this question. An analysis of these studies reveals that the extent to which property values are lowered depends on a variety of factors: design and management of affordable housing, compatibility between affordable housing and host neighborhood, and concentration of affordable housing. </jats:p>",

Inspired by European experiments, proponents of public housing dreamed of a decentralized housing program carried out by many entities and aimed at a majority of the population, not the very poor. Before their movement could take root locally, however, the Great Depression created political opportunities for a federal program. Lacking a grassroots constituency, public housers waged a masterful smoke-and-mirrors strategy to stir up support for public housing among nonhousing organizations and, in 1937, won a permanent program. Yet lawmakers used the housers’ antislum arguments to justify including provisions to clear slums and to house the poor and then excluded funds for nongovernmental housing entities such as limited-dividend corporations and cooperatives. The public housing projects themselves would never inspire much political enthusiasm. Thus, the public housers built enough political support to create a public housing program but not to realize their dream. </jats:p>",

Evidence is presented of the ways in which the project has succeeded in raising awareness of the advantages of bilingualism amongst parents, prospective parents and the public at large by working strategically with health professionals and Early Years organizations, and by developing a range of highly innovative promotional materials. Given the central importance of the family as a site of intergenerational language transmission, the achievements of this project are likely to be of interest to those concerned with language planning in other minority communities in many other parts of the world. The lessons for language planning both in Wales and in other settings are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last 15 years profound changes have taken place within the policy and institutional context of strategic planning for waste management in the United Kingdom. In addition to the significant influence of the sustainability discourse on policy innovation and the reconfiguration of institutional arrangements and policy networks, there have been growing political and public interest, and tensions, in the regionalisation of waste management, as represented by the establishment of the Regional Technical Advisory Bodies (RTABs) for waste. Drawing on concepts developed within urban-regime theory and debates on institutional capacity building, the authors argue that if RTABs are to be seen as a new form of governance for waste planning, the development of their capacity to meet the challenge of ‘collective action’ depends on the quality of their governance relations and, in particular, on the existence and amplification of four forms of capital: intellectual, social, material, and political. The first stage of the research which, by the time of writing (April 2004), included around sixty semistructured interviews with RTAB members throughout the English regions, has identified a number of potential barriers and enablers that affect the ability of RTABs to develop such a capacity. In conclusion, the authors provide an overall assessment of RTABs and draw a tentative picture of their possible future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The utilization of multiagent technology for urban planning purposes has already received much attention with regard to predicting and evaluating the effects of different policy scenarios and plan alternatives. The generation of these plan alternatives, however, remains underexplored in this context. In this paper the authors describe a multiagent model for generating alternative land-use plans, in which the agents are land-use experts that initiate the development of plan proposals and communicate with each other over time in order to draw up the proposals incrementally. The authors present a probabilistic approach to agent behaviour to enable decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty. They describe what personal and collective beliefs agents construct and use in order to choose their actions strategically. The negotiation, taking place between the initiating agent and the other agents, aimed at reaching agreement with regard to the various claims, is organized as an iterative process in which both parties consider conciliatory adjustments to their strategies, and thus their decisions, in order to try to find mutually acceptable solutions. A hypothetical case study demonstrates the operation of the model and the effects of its behavioural parameters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite more than four decades of efforts to integrate the two fields, the place of land-use models in planning remains problematic. The expanding possibilities afforded by today's planning support systems (PSS) invite a rethinking of the relationship between land-use models and planning in the context of new approaches, tools, and techniques that can amplify the positive synergies between the two domains and enhance the ability of spatial planning to prepare for the future. This paper addresses one vitally important area in which the contribution of models to planning practice could be greatly improved. This is the neglected area of strategic planning, which is inextricably linked with the future-oriented mission of the field. The paper begins with an examination of the continuing tensions between modeling and planning, tensions that need to be reconsidered in light of the growing sophistication of land-use models intended for use in a planning context. It then outlines three interrelated roles for land-use models that would help support the mission of planning as a visionary and future-oriented process. These roles are based on approaches discussed in the planning literature (and in the ‘futures' literature more generally) as scenario writing, visioning, and storytelling. Although scenario writing (or development) is a notion familiar to land-use modelers, not every form of scenario development commonly proposed by modelers is useful to planners. Visioning is a goal-oriented process that focuses the community on desired ends and helps sort out the means for reaching these ends. Finally, good storytelling can help to clarify the implications of different alternatives and to build consensus by presenting particular desired or feared future developments in terms meaningful enough to be credible to nonspecialists. The paper presents examples of land-use models that seem well suited to one or the other of these roles. Although no single model is likely to satisfy all three roles, a well-designed PSS can provide the context for their seamless integration and mutual reinforcement. </jats:p>",

In this paper we develop a method of estimating the boundary lines of land lots. With the assumption that the vertices of lots are tentatively given and that their deviations from true positions follow certain kinds of probability distributions, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem of adjusting the positions of tentatively given vertices, subject to the constraints of available information such as lot size and frontage. In this problem, two objectives are considered: one is to maximize the log-likelihood function and the other is to minimize distortion of lot shape. An index called the ‘suitability degree’, based on the concept of fuzzy logic, is proposed for evaluating the quality of estimates and is used as a decisionmaking rule for determining the weight parameter in the objective function. The proposed method is empirically tested with real lots and the results are satisfactory. It reveals the feasibility of applying this method in urban planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A number of shortcomings of space syntax—a well-known technique of urban analysis—were recently discussed in the scientific literature. They are mostly traceable to the reliance in space syntax on the ‘axial map’: a simplified line-of-sight description of the city, which is then analysed based on its topology. This paper explores how another type of urban representations—namely the urban digital elevation model (DEM), a raster map which stores building heights—could prove helpful in providing complementary information to space syntax. Although the use of DEMs is common in the geo-sciences, their application in urban studies is more recent and shows promise. This paper presents several analysis algorithms to derive urban lines of sight, viewsheds, travelling time maps, and simulations based on cellular automata. The relevance of the approach is discussed, suggesting that it could effectively complement traditional space syntax in the coming years. </jats:p>",

The authors' main objective in this paper is to answer these questions by using a multiagent land-use transport model to represent the interaction of agents' locations, the effects of mixed land use, and the agglomeration merits or demerits of agents.

Using a set of fifteen photographs as visual stimuli, we attempted to identify those scenes that are liked by visitors to Kowloon Park, Hong Kong. The visual quality of an urban park scene is measured by its likeability, referring to the probability that the scene will evoke a strong and positive response among the users of the park. Because Hong Kong is an international metropolis, the respondent sample included both Hong Kong residents and tourists. The principal component analysis revealed the three underlying ‘dimensions’ of the appraisal aspects of the data: the ‘affective’ component, the ‘management status’, and the ‘naturalness’ of the scene. The results replicated the affective responses of park visitors toward the scenic aspects of urban park spaces, in which scenic beauty can be used as a proxy for acceptable management. Overall, the study has yielded useful information for park professionals to provide enjoyable urban park spaces in metropolitan areas to meet the needs of their citizens and visitors. </jats:p>",

Corporate tax collections in Australia have climbed substantially as a proportion of GDP over the past two decades even though tax rates have fallen. Referring to this, Australian Commissioner Michael Carmody, in evidence before the Senate Economic References Committee of 9 February 2000, said, “it is fair to conclude that this reflects, at least in some part, compliance improvement following from our strategies”. The ways in which this indeed might be fair relate to some shifts to a responsive regulatory strategy within a sophisticated web of controls that includes strategic use of Australia’s general anti-avoidance provision, the work of the ATO Promoters Taskforce, the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce and meta risk management strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we discuss the application of Ramblas to estimate the impact of three possible urban development scenarios in North Wing of the Randstad region in the Netherlands. These land-use scenarios concern the location of dwellings, office buildings, and industrial sites in Amsterdam and its surroundings. The three proposed scenarios differ mainly in terms of the degree of concentration, density of residential development, and the timing of the construction. Ramblas was applied to assess the impact of these scenarios in terms of sustainability criteria such as the number of kilometres travelled. The results suggest that global criteria are not enough to decide whether one scenario is preferable to another. Ramblas can provide more inside information. </jats:p>",

By introducing the <jats:italic>questione della lingua</jats:italic> Dante set the terms of language debate in Italian public life and established himself as a language planner, and as a theorist of nationality and linguistic nationalism. Today, urbanisation, progressive aggregation of populations into larger identity groupings and the globalisation of economies appear to have led to a contraction in the vitality of many languages and pluralisation within and across communication systems. Alongside this reduction in language vitality is the challenge to nationalism itself.

The contagion is typically started by promoter entrepreneurship to seize structural opportunities, with a growing herd then following to take up those opportunities. The literature on contagion suggests that, at a private level, in a considerable variety of circumstances where one’s personal knowledge of a phenomenon is truncated, it can be rational to follow the herd (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000). Information can be too costly for investors who are not insiders, so an investor might benefit from looking at the market reaction to a tax scheme. With aggressive tax planning contagions, in those circumstances where there is economic rationality in following the herd, often the benefits are greatest for those who follow early, before ending the contagion becomes a policy priority. Contagion also becomes rational when the use of a tax arrangement becomes too big to stop. The losers then are those who fail to jump on an unstoppable bandwagon. A way of describing the history of the late 1990s Australian tax scheme boom is that the tax advice industry lived in fear of tough enforcement of Australia’s general anti-avoidance provision from the end of the aggressive tax boom in the early 1980s until more than a decade of failure to use it by the ATO and the courts led to doubts that it had teeth. Aggressive promoters of schemes first narrowcast their promotion to individual taxpayers with a taste for risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, much has been made in the media and in academic circles of the risk that the world is heading towards linguistic convergence. But as internationalisation gives way to globalisation, as the emphasis shifts from mere contact between states to pressures for homogeneity, there is a paradoxical tendency towards cultural divergence. Economic-inspired theories of globalisation seem to have underestimated the power of identity, which has contributed to nationalist revivals around the globe. This paper therefore seeks to make identity considerations more central to the current debate on language and globalisation, by focusing on the lesser-known context of Sweden. The minimal importance attributed to national and linguistic identity in Sweden during the era of internationalisation is contrasted with the renewed sense of national identity that has arisen in the more advanced era of globalisation. This nationalist revival could provide the necessary support amongst the general public for the protective language planning measures for Swedish currently proposed. With its traditionally positive attitudes towards English, the case of Sweden thus offers a unique opportunity to examine whether it is possible to establish a stable diglossic relationship between English and a national language, thereby reducing the risk of language shift that globalisation is so often claimed to pose.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I draw attention to the study of ‘unofficially sacred’ sites in geographies of religion, which provide significant insights into the construction of religious identity and community, and the intersections of sacred and secular. I show that such sites deserve as much attention as places of worship (the more conventional focus in the geographical study of religion) in our understanding of the place of religion in contemporary urban society. In particular, using the case of Islamic religious schools in Singapore, I examine how Muslim identities and community are negotiated within multicultural and multireligious contexts, and particularly within one in which there is a highly ‘educative’ state [Gramsci, 1971 Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci (International Publishers, New York)] that seeks to guide nation formation and the manufacture of consensus, and which strives to achieve a secular, modernist vision of society, characterized by economic progress and development. The specific analysis focuses, first, on the role of the state in the social construction of ‘schools’—particularly the ways in which state-constructed definitions of multiculturalism, multiracialism, multireligiosity, and modernity shape Singapore schools and education. Second, I examine the ways in which religious schools ( madrasahs) are a means by which some Singapore Muslims maintain and enhance their religious life. Further, I analyze state–religion relations, state strategies of nation-building, strategies of identity and community construction among Muslims in Singapore, as well as the fractured nature of the Muslim community by studying the divergent meanings invested in schools by state and religious groups. </jats:p>",

It is in these terms that central government has promoted the creative industries as a newly recognised and fast-growing sector of the economy, thus seeking to quantify the Cool Britania branding so famously propagated by the then newly elected Labour government. The author unpacks the enthusiasm for the creative industries at the national level, and further investigates how the creative-industries developmental agenda has been unfolding within UK regions. The trajectory of the United Kingdom's creative-industries agenda is contrasted with policy and developmental strategies undertaken elsewhere in the world. It is argued that implementation of a creative-industries agenda at the regional level in the United Kingdom is at best patchy, and there is currently a lack of strategic planning, best-practice models, and empirical research to guide policymakers. The West Midlands is then addressed in more detail, and it is argued that at the regional administrative level, a creative industries development agenda per se is all but lost. The implications of this policy trajectory are discussed. </jats:p>",

A qualitative approach was used for this study. Twelve volunteer registered nurses (RNs) working in a large metropolitan Victorian public hospital were interviewed. All participants stated emphatically that they were involved in the discharge planning process although differing levels of involvement existed. ‘Organizing’ and ‘planning’ were key words used by participants to define the term discharge planning. All but one participant considered the nurse to be the coordinator of the discharge planning process. How participants communicated with other nursing staff regarding the discharge planning needs of individual patients depended on the policy of each individual ward. Communication was perceived to be a major factor that either enhanced or impeded the discharge planning process.</jats:p>",

Whereas some work in this field risks reinscribing the discursive articulation of danger as an inevitable condition of political formation, in this paper I emphasise the need to disaggregate the concept of danger carefully to highlight its operation in specific contexts. I explore these processes across a range of discursive sites from official media to popular music, contrasting findings with material from focus groups composed of socially marginalised populations. I demonstrate the role of discursive constructions of danger or safety in the production and maintenance of the political identity of the new states, and how this is inseparable from material conditions of elite power struggle. I conclude by echoing Hewitt's call for a critical geography that confronts and challenges the domestic exercise of state terror. </jats:p>",

Although there is some evidence of positive development, the current picture of service provision is characterized by fragmentation and limited choice of resources and specialist care. Policy aims are variably met and inconsistently applied. Research suggests that service planning is often incoherent, that many older people with ID and their carers receive poor quality non-specialist care and that staff are inadequately trained to manage the often multiple and complex needs of this user group. There is a considerable co-joined service development and research challenge in this emerging field. If older people with ID and their carers are to receive quality provision, a coherent and well-funded service planning system is required which is underpinned by articulated agency partnerships, informed by good practice developments in the fields of ID, gerontology and dementia care, and linked to evidence about effective models of care and services. The incorporation of the perspectives of users and carers in the planning process is an essential pre-requisite as is a commitment to the development of effective support across the life course of all individuals with ID. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of globalization and post‐modern discourses, the debate about the relative status of local and dominant languages poses serious policy problems for post‐colonial communities. Critics of minority language rights (MLR) generally point out that engineering a language shift on behalf of a vernacular language – motivated by the preservationist interests, collective rights and sentimental associations of an ethnic group – is futile, as the economic and social mobilities of individuals are bound to work against this enterprise. Proponents of MLR have gone to the other extreme of essentializing the linguistic identity of minority communities, generalizing their language attitudes, and treating local language rights as non‐negotiable. This article addresses this debate in the context of the attempts to promote Tamil by the military leadership in the North and East of Sri Lanka. The paper brings together data gathered in sociolinguistic studies for four years in the Jaffna society in order to understand the reception of the language policy in everyday life. The leadership recognizes that language policy is a symbolic statement for political purposes and tolerates certain inconsistencies in policy and practice. While the community assures itself of ethnic pride and linguistic autonomy with the stated policies, it negotiates divergent interests in the gaps between the policy/practice divide. Scholars should recognize the agency of subaltern communities to negotiate language politics in creative and critical ways that transcend the limited constructs formulated to either cynically sweep aside or unduly romanticize language rights.</jats:p>",

The present research focuses on coating process optimisation using EB-PVD for turbine blades, which are widely used in industrial, marine and aircraft applications. More specifically, the present research identifies the five most important objectives for the EB-PVD coating process and then proposes metrics to quantify such objectives. In addition, a heuristic for EFB-PVD process optimisation is developed to control workpiece motion systematically to reduce coating thickness variance, providing a uniform coating for turbine blades. The heuristic developed is an iterative algorithm which uses a finite element model of the rotating workpiece to determine the translation motion. The finite element model can be readily generated using standard computer aided design (CAD) of the workpiece, which makes the method applicable to workpieces with complex three-dimensional geometry. These computational developments are illustrated using a simulation of a turbine blade coating in which the coating thickness variance is reduced significantly. The proposed method could eliminate dedicated tooling/fixtures used in the traditional coating process and improve the cost effectiveness of the process, especially for low volume production. </jats:p>",

The water balance equation was used to produce the crop water requirement map considering the crop coefficient for different crop stages.

The main results of the model are expressed in terms of number, capacity and location of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) and the length of main sewers. The decision process concerning the location and capacity of wastewater systems has a number of parameters that can be optimized. These parameters include the total sewer length and number, capacity and location of WWTP. The optimization of parameters should lead to the minimization of construction and operation costs of the integrated system. Location models have been considered as tools for decision support, mainly when a geo-referenced database can be used. In these cases, the GIS may represent an important role for the analysis of data and results especially in the preliminary stage of planning and design. After selecting the spatial location model and the heuristics, two greedy algorithms were implemented in Visual Basic for Applications® on the ArcGIS® software environment. To illustrate the application of these algorithms a case study was developed, in a rural area located in the central part of Portugal.</jats:p>",

Since return period is related to expected avalanche frequency and impact pressure is related to consequences if structures are hit, zone specifications imply a risk-based approach. In this paper, the schemes for definition of zones from three countries (Switzerland, Canada, and Austria) are presented and compared from a mathematical, risk-based framework. The comparison reveals that the Swiss standard is the least conservative and the Austrian standard is the most conservative.Key words: risk, snow avalanches, zoning, return period. </jats:p>",

Using data from 90 face-to-face interviews, this paper explores the expectations, plans, and coping strategies of TANF leavers in Oregon who are in the middle of this year of transitional coverage. The paper examines (1) the information available to these individuals, (2) their planning and expectations about securing health insurance, and (3) their perceptions of opportunities for obtaining jobs that provide insurance. The paper shows that while TANF leavers often assume their Medicaid coverage will continue after the transitional year, many lack complete information about this. Many respondents have no active plans for securing health insurance. Even those who do have sufficient information to plan for the end of the transitional year may find themselves having to make stark choices (e.g., sacrificing income in order to keep coverage). Policy recommendations are presented.\n\n</jats:p>",

In this paper I show how these new approaches are consistent with traditional urban models that have gone before, with the emphasis no longer being on spatial interaction but on development dynamics and local movement. I first introduce ideas about urban simulation based on spatial evolution as reaction and diffusion, showing how problems conceived in terms of cells and/or agents enable new implementations of this generic model. I sketch the rudiments of cellular automata which emphasise rules for development transition, and agent-based models which focus on how individuals respond to environmental attributes encoded in cellular landscapes. I illustrate these exemplars through models of residential location. Three applications are then presented at very different spatial scales: pedestrian movement at the building scale, the evolution of systems of cities at a regional scale, and urban growth at the city scale. I conclude with proposals that formal policy analysis in this domain should always be informed by more than one approach. </jats:p>",

Therefore using fertility awareness-based methods influences the timing of sexual activity, which may affect the nature of the sexual relationship. Data are used from the clinical trials of two fertility awareness-based methods – the Standard Days Method and the TwoDay Method – to determine the frequency and timing of intercourse during the cycle, and the determinants of coital frequency. The mean coital frequency of study participants was similar to that reported by users of other methods. Results suggest that coital frequency increases with consecutive cycles of method use. At the same time the frequency of intercourse during the identified fertile days and during menses decreases. This evidence implies a behavioural change as couples get more experience using their method and communicating about the fertile days. Coital frequency was also influenced by the method used and by the study sites. Potential differences between the methods and sites that may contribute to this effect are discussed.</jats:p>",

The aim of this review is to introduce ERP systems and explore their current state and future potentials. Using recent literature, the review provides a comprehensive understanding of ERP systems, including illustrating their main components and clarifying their basic and extended features. In addition, the review highlights the main producers of ERP systems, together with their partners and customers. Based on previous investigations, the review also addresses ERP selection criteria and critical implementation factors. Finally, recent views of ERP systems and their future development, including their enhanced intelligence, expansion, and management, are given. The views also include a STOPE view (strategy, technology, organization–enterprise, people, environment), which illustrates the integration of ERP systems with the overall enterprise network. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

I present a framework for involving the public in planning of U.S. MPAs. Derived from empirically and theoretically based research on public participation in U.S. natural resource management, this framework is composed of factors that influence the success of participatory processes: active participant involvement, complete information exchange, fair decision making, efficient administration, and positive participant interactions. Processes incorporating these factors will produce decisions that are more likely to be supported by stakeholders, meet management objectives, and fulfill conservation goals. This framework contributes to the MPA social science literature and responds to calls in the conservation literature to increase the use of social science research to inform conservation decision making.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

We present a systematic reserve selection for 1223 African mammals and amphibians in which habitat suitability models are used as estimates of the area occupied by species. In the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment, we collected the geographic range (extent of occurrence) and habitat preferences for each species. We used the latter to build species‐specific habitat suitability models inside geographic ranges, and for 181 species we verified the models by comparing suitability levels to presence‐absence data collected in the field. We then used the suitable areas as estimators of the area of occupancy and compared the results of systematic reserve selection based on geographic ranges to those based on estimated areas of occupancy. Our results showed that the reserve system would need a 30‐100% expansion to achieve minimal conservation targets, concentrated in the tropics, where species richness reaches a maximum. Comparative analyses revealed that using geographic ranges, which overestimate the area occupied by species, underestimates the total amount of area that needs to be conserved. The area selected for conservation doubled when we used the estimated area of occupancy in place of the geographic ranges. This happened because the suitable areas potentially occupied by each species overlapped less than their geographic ranges. As a result, any given protected area contained fewer species than predicted by the analysis of ranges. Because species are more specialized than our estimates of distribution based on extent of occurrence suggest, we propose that this is a general effect in systematic conservation planning.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Through a detailed examination of two case studies in the United Kingdom and the United States I conclude that the multicultural city necessitates a recognition of symbolic as well as material spaces—and the interconnections between these—and that the notion of public space warrants interrogation as to how it is imagined, read, and experienced in multiple ways. </jats:p>",

The quantification of expert opinion can be difficult, especially when more than one expert is consulted and experts are not in agreement. Decision analysis can provide a framework to systematically deconstruct a complex problem and provide greater objectivity to restoration decisions. We utilized decision analysis techniques to identify restoration objectives and to quantify expert opinions to prioritize restoration activities at 112 prairie openings in the Edge of Appalachia Preserve in southern Ohio, U.S.A. We first created an objectives hierarchy to model how decision‐makers decide which prairies to manage. We then determined how to measure each component of the hierarchy and sampled all prairies for percent woody cover, geology, indicator species index (an index of plant species richness), slope, aspect, and distance to nearest prairie. We modeled seven different experts’ preferences for managing prairies with varying values for each of these ecological measures. We then interviewed the same decision‐makers to determine relative weights for each component of the objectives hierarchy using trade‐off analysis. By combining the weights, preference relationships, and sampling data, we were able to rank each prairie and management unit based on its management priority. Experts had similar preferences except for the measure of distance to nearest prairie. We found that decision‐makers gave different weights to each of the different components of the hierarchy. Generally, experts weighted percent woody cover, indicator species index, and geology more highly than slope, aspect, and distance to nearest prairie. Despite these differences, priorities for management, once all factors were weighted and combined, were similar.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of rural business-support policy depends on the proper identification of those factors that have a differential impact on the success of rural as opposed to urban businesses. A number of studies have pointed to differences between urban and rural businesses in the business constraints and opportunities they face, and how they respond to them. This issue is investigated by use of a multivariate econometric model to analyse data generated by a survey of almost 800 businesses in all areas of Northern Ireland. The locations of the businesses in the study were mapped carefully according to an urban, accessible-rural, and remote-rural spatial typology. There is particular interest in the shape and form that rural business support policy might take in order to assist businesses in rural areas where there will be a reduction in traditional EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) assistance as well as a phased withdrawal of Objective 1 Structural Fund support. This is currently the case in Northern Ireland. The research should be seen as a pilot study designed to demonstrate how further work might be undertaken in an area where the search for appropriate interventions is likely to be a continuing theme in policy debate. Further research might usefully be directed towards examining the factors that are responsible for causing some of the differences observed. The research suggests that the business areas that will have the greatest impact on rural business competitiveness, relative to their more urban counterparts, are training, business-service provision, transport and communication infrastructure, costs of production, and the environment. This complex set of factors cuts across traditional departmental and national boundaries and highlights the importance of ensuring customised rural business support responses and the effective ‘rural proofing’ of strategically important public policies in general. </jats:p>",

The objective of the paper is to delineate the policy of making the development towns and the reasons explaining their relatively disadvantaged state against the backdrop of three master approaches in the social sciences in the 20th century: the modernist – functionalist approach, particularly the planning perspective within this approach; the neo-Marxist approach; and the colonial approach. Each places the planning and establishment of the new towns within a wider political context and sociospatial structure, hence suggesting different explanations for the backwardness. Yet, combining the approaches yields a comprehensive picture of the towns. Finally, the juxtaposition of these master approaches with the making of new towns elucidates the contribution of geography and public policy to the general discourse in social science. That said, it also exposes the weaknesses of the modern and rational approaches, and portrayed public policy and spatial planning as ingredients of multilayered control and domination, which are expressed in cultural (ethnic), geographical, and economic terms. </jats:p>",

An investigation of the concept of nostalgia allows certain levels of yearning to be made clear in Nora's writings. A melancholic nostalgia for ‘real environments of memory’ and for the unifying power of the nation-state pervades this work. However, Nora hints at the possibility for the survival of memory in the body, and for its defence through the mobilisation of counterhistorical narratives. I conclude through using interdisciplinary theories on embodied memory and sites of countermemory to expand the range of spaces in which the memories of a nation might be constructed, contained, and contested. </jats:p>",

The focus is on the frames of geopolitical thought developed in 20th-century Portugal, with particular reference to the post-1945 period and with some consideration of the transformations since 1974 accompanying the collapse of what was both the first and the most enduring European overseas empire. This study of Portuguese geopolitical discourses leads to a conclusion in which we reflect on the significance of relations between the ‘colonial’ and the ‘postcolonial’ and the articulations of East–West and North–South in geopolitical discourses. This permits wider critique concerning the location of geopolitics within 20th-century and contemporary imperialisms. </jats:p>",

This hypothesises that people are influenced in their decisionmaking and behavioural patterns by their neighbours, with interpersonal conversation being the main means of transmitting such influence. Although there is an increasing body of evidence showing the impact of such conversations—that people who talk together, vote together—relatively little of this has grounded the geography of such conversations in the individuals' local neighbourhoods. Those who interact locally should show more evidence of ‘neighbourhood-effect-like’ patterns than those who do not.

The advent of devolution in Scotland, and to a lesser degree Wales, has, however, created new policy forums in which the shift towards targeted benefits has been reversed in a number of important fields. Welfare provision in relation to children is a further key area in which this policy debate has emerged. Little evidence has been provided for the effectiveness of this shift in policy until now. We examine the effect of this divergence in welfare policy. We look at the issue of universality and targeting by examining the impact of the proposal for the introduction of universal free school meals to all children in full-time state education. The current system of free school meals is found to be the least effective method of welfare provision. Other methods of targeting are found to be more effective than the current system, but universal provision is found to be the only mechanism for consistently providing welfare to all low-income households. </jats:p>",

Socioeconomic factors are increasingly being recognized as major determinants of many aspects of health and causes of health inequities. Knowledge of socioeconomic characteristics of neighbourhoods is necessary to identify their unique health needs and enhance identification of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Careful integration of this knowledge into health planning activities is necessary to ensure that health planning and service provision are tailored to unique neighbourhood population health needs. In this study, we identify unique neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics and classify the neighbourhoods based on these characteristics. Principal components analysis (PCA) of 18 socioeconomic variables was used to identify the principal components explaining most of the variation in socioeconomic characteristics across the neighbourhoods. Cluster analysis was used to classify neighbourhoods based on their socioeconomic characteristics.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Results of the PCA and cluster analysis were similar but the latter were more objective and easier to interpret.

Subsequent studies will investigate inequalities in health outcomes both within and across the neighbourhood types identified in the current study.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

However, the free-rider attitude represents a barrier to participation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With sufficiently fast data sampling, ubiquitous sharp transients appear in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Initially, no known collective neuronal activity could explain MEG signal generation well above 100 Hz, so it was assumed that these transients were entirely composed of background electronic noise that could be eliminated by filtering and averaging. Recent studies at the cellular level provided evidence for synchronous synaptic input to dendrites and volleys of near-simultaneous action potentials. MEG studies have also identified high-frequency oscillations well above 200 Hz after averaging large number of somatosensory evoked responses. In this study, we searched for evidence of high-frequency neuronal activity in the raw MEG signal using the highest sampling rate available with our hardware. Two human subjects participated in three experiments using visual cues to define planning, preparation, and execution or inhibition of saccades. Tomographic analysis identified “MEG spikes” that were widely distributed across the cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem during cue presentations and saccades. Here we demonstrate how these MEG spikes can be recorded and localized in real time and show that task demands influence their properties. The MEG spikes were organized into feedforward and corollary discharge sequences that could, when combined with the slower activity-linked processing in discrete brain areas over long periods, lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Preparation for impending saccade began as soon as relevant information became available. Cues providing partial information initiated competing motor programs for as yet undecided future actions that were maintained until cues with new information resolved the uncertainty.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The critique of indigenous forest management in New Zealand in this paper contextualises the discussion in light of recent Eurocentric debates on the transition towards ‘postproductivist’ and ‘multifunctional’ agricultural and forestry regimes. The research findings confirm recent criticisms of Australian writers with regard to the direct transferability of the notion of a transition towards postproductivism developed by European researchers and also lend support to Holmes's (2002) notion of productivist and postproductivist occupance. Long-standing productivist demands continue to be made on New Zealand's indigenous forests, especially from economically marginalised stakeholder groups who depend on the continuation of logging for economic survival. We argue that the tension between the recent adoption of a ‘postproductivist’ conservation policy at government level and the continuing ‘productivist’ attitudes among some stakeholder groups explains why the protection of remaining indigenous forests continues to be contested. The New Zealand findings also provide further evidence for those persons criticising the implied linearity and dualism inherent in the Eurocentric postproductivist transition model. We argue that processes at the New Zealand forest–farmland interface support Wilson's (2001) notion of a territorialisation of productivist and postproductivist territories into a ‘multifunctional’ territory. From a social constructionist perspective, the results highlight the fact that a clear separation into productivist and postproductivist occupance may not be easy to conceptualise as our view of agricultural land as ‘productivist’ territory and unlogged or sustainably managed indigenous forest as ‘postproductivist’ territory is largely based on a Euro–American ‘deep green’ view of unaltered ‘nonhuman’ nature. This supports Mather's (2001) suggestion that postproductivism should be cast as part of a shifting mode of social regulation of forestry with particular stakeholder groups constructing images of nature according to their interests, and where western ideas of nature as a (postproductivist) wilderness embody cultural politics which arguably serve to marginalise the interests of indigenous communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> If done correctly, licensing technology to a start-up company provides a great opportunity for a university to commercialize its technology and generate good will. If done incorrectly, however, the venture may jeopardize the technology's value and adversely affect the university's reputation within the business and academic communities. Before licensing technology to a start-up, a university is well-advised to consider the issues that are most critical to the company's success; that is, those issues that will directly affect the university's ability to benefit from commercialization of its technology. This article surveys the issues a university should evaluate before licensing technology to a start-up venture. While presuming that the university's technology transfer office has overcome, or at least is aware of, any university-imposed policies relative to taking an equity ownership in a start-up, this article presents a workable framework for identifying the key questions that need to be asked and answered: (1) Why participate in a start-up? (2) Who are the right people for the job? (3) What incentives will motivate the start-up company's employees to perform? (4) What assets will the start-up need to be successful? (5) How will the venture be managed? (6) What is the university's exit strategy? </jats:p>",

A decade on, regional government in England is greatly expanded, and two other institutions of regional governance, the Regional Development Agencies and the Regional Assemblies, have also been created. In 2002 the Labour government proposed that this ‘triad’ of regional governance should be further reformed and strengthened, in some places being brought to democratic account. In this paper, we argue that academic research on the English regions has generally focused on the Regional Development Agencies and to a lesser extent the Regional Assemblies, to the exclusion of the Government Offices. This focus has led some to overstate the extent to which regional government represents the real decentralisation of power. Focusing on the role of the Government Offices, we argue that central government retains a great deal of power over the ‘triad’ institutions, which in their current form may be unable to challenge the structure of power in the English state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public participation in environmental decisionmaking has become an accepted part of Western societies over the last three decades. Whereas on a simple level every democratic process based on aggregating individual preferences contains an element of public participation, the literature on discursive democracy emphasises instead a more subtle, rich, and intense social process of deliberation. In this model, the spectrum of understandings, interests, and values expressed in different discourses is explored in detail by participants before a decision is reached. Although within an idealised model of discursive democracy such deliberations would involve every member of society potentially affected by the issue under discussion, a range of constraints mean that in practice this ideal model can only be approximated by discussions held in various forms of ‘minipublics’, which contain in most cases only a tiny proportion of the relevant community—for example, citizens' juries and consensus conferences. We identify three problem areas concerning the choice of participants in such ‘minipublics’, which we call the ‘recruitment problem’ (how individual participants are chosen to take part), the ‘composition problem’ (what the final composition of the minipublic is), and the ‘mandate problem’ (what role each of the participants assumes within the process). We suggest that most studies have not explicitly distinguished these elements, and consequently the rationale for why the results of such processes should be considered legitimate in either an advisory or a decisionmaking capacity is often unclear. We review the limitations of traditional recruitment methods and suggest a new alternative we consider appropriate for discursive processes—utilising Q methodology as a step in developing a purposive sampling frame for the recruitment phase. Although this approach is not without problems, we suggest that it could potentially offer a better basis on which to address the recruitment problem for those processes seeking to approximate discursively democratic ideals. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy modulated electron therapy (EMET) based on Monte Carlo dose calculation is a promising technique that enhances the treatment planning and delivery of superficially located tumors. This study investigated the application of EMET using a novel few‐leaf electron collimator (FLEC) in head and neck and breast sites in comparison with three‐dimensional conventional radiation therapy (3D‐CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques. Treatment planning was performed for two parotid cases and one breast case. Four plans were compared for each case: 3D‐CRT, IMRT, 3D‐CRT in conjunction with EMET (EMET‐CRT), and IMRT in conjunction with EMET (EMET‐IMRT), all of which were performed and calculated with Monte Carlo techniques. For all patients, dose volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for all organs of interest and the DVHs were used as a means of comparing the plans. Homogeneity and conformity of dose distributions were calculated, as well as a sparing index that compares the effect of the low isodose lines. In addition, the whole‐body dose equivalent (WBDE) was estimated for each plan. Adding EMET delivered with the FLEC to 3D‐CRT improves sparing of normal tissues. For the two head and neck cases, the mean dose to the contralateral parotid and brain stem was reduced relative to IMRT by 43% and 84%, and by 57% and 71%, respectively. Improved normal tissue sparing was quantified as an increase in sparing index of 47% and 30% for the head and neck and the breast cases, respectively. Adding EMET to either 3D‐CRT or IMRT results in preservation of target conformity and dose homogeneity. When adding EMET to the treatment plan, the WBDE was reduced by between 6% and 19% for 3D‐CRT and by between 21% and 33% for IMRT, while WBDE for EMET‐CRT was reduced by up to 72% when compared with IMRT. FLEC offers a practical means of delivering modulated electron therapy. Although adding EMET delivered using the FLEC results in perturbation of target conformity when compared to IMRT, it significantly improves normal tissue sparing while offering enhanced target conformity to the 3D‐CRT planning. The addition of EMET systematically leads to a reduction in WBDE especially when compared with IMRT.</jats:p>",

MR assessment included the evaluation of image quality and visualization of bile ducts (5-point scale), and the classification of tumor status. MR results were subsequently correlated with the results from surgery and pathology. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: The maximum intensity projections of multisection thin-slice MRCP had significantly more artifacts compared to MRCP in the single-shot thick-slab technique, and overall image quality of single-shot thick-slab MRCP was rated significantly superior compared to multisection thin-slice MRCP (4.4±0.7 and 4.1±0.9, respectively). Moreover, ductal visualization of different parts of the biliary system was rated superior with single-shot thick-slab MRCP. In contrast, the original data from multisection thin slice MRCP facilitated visualization of periductal lesions and adjacent structures. Overall MR accuracy for the assessment of tumor status, periductal infiltration, and lymph node metastases was 90%, 87%, and 66%, respectively. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: For evaluation of malignant hilar obstructions, MRCP by the single-shot thick-slab technique had superior image quality and fewer artifacts; in contrast, besides sole biliary visualization, multisection MRCP depicted complementary adjacent parenchymal and periductal structures. We therefore recommend MRI, with a combination of both MRCP techniques, for the diagnostic work-up and therapy planning of malignant hilar obstructions. </jats:p>",
