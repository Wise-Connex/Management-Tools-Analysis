The author, a participant-observer, argues that this board's success was rooted in several factors: effective organization of board and staff, productive public relations, cultivation of a diverse coalition in support of board initiatives, a strong local belief in active and fair local government, and geographic and socioeconomic independence from metropoli tan dynamics. The advantages of activist boards for effective and legitimate planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

The general aim of FPORT is to train researchers to provide information to family planning (FP) practitioners that will be of value in the operation of FP programs. It was decided that researchers in northern Luzon would focus on FP trainings undertaken by the Department of Health. Several meetings among researchers and health personnel were held to shape research questions that would be of use to the DOH as it implements its training programs. The design of the project was a joint effort of researchers and DOH personnel, in the end focusing on a tentative topic, the Basic/Comprehensive Family Planning Course for Physicians, Nurses, and Midwives. As noted in this report, it was decided that the process of training would be emphasized rather than its outcome, and it was also decided that the focus of research would be expanded to include other courses for FP providers, specifically Interpersonal Communication Skills and a Preceptors Course.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the late 1980s, it became clear that poor outcomes of the Russian health system were caused not only by underfunding but also by inadequate management of health care. Some features of the system led to great inefficiency in medical care provision and an irrational structure of medical care. The recognition of this fact has intensified the search for new methods of finance and management</jats:p><jats:p>The underlying idea of health care reforms in Russia is to weaken providers' dominance, to make them more responsive to consumer preferences, and to change the structure of medical care. The main developments of the reform parallel the reforms in Western countries. These are primarily the separation of finance and provision of medical care, with the shift from an integrated to a contractual model of relationships between payers and providers. But the specific characteristics of the health care situation, primarily the great underfunding and the absolute dominance of state‐owned medical facilities, make the reform in the Russian health sector more radical</jats:p><jats:p>This paper highlights the issues of the current and planned developments in the Russian health sector. After presenting the main characteristics of the current health systems, it addresses economic experiments which are underway in several regions of the new Russian Federation. They are designed to introduce elements of market relations into a highly bureaucratic system. The main features and the impact of the experiments are discussed. Then the new model of finance, which is based on a transition from tax‐financed to the health insurance system, is presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Japanese health care is characterized by a pluralistic system with a high degree of private producers. Central government regulates the prices and the financing system. All citizens are covered by a mandatory employment‐based health insurance operating on a nonprofit basis. The consumer has a free choice of physician and hospital. A comparison between Japan, Sweden and some other countries shows significant dissimilarities in the length of stay, number of treatments per hospital bed and year and the staffing of hospitals. About 80 per cent of the hospitals and 94 per cent of the clinics are privately owned. The typical private hospital owned by a physician has less than 100 beds</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper, data collected (1992/93) in an empirical study of Japanese hospitals and their leadership is presented. Also discussed are the hospitals' style of management, tools and strategies for competition and competences—personal and formal skills required of the leadership in the hospital</jats:p><jats:p>There follows a study of ten hospitals, among which hospital directors and chief physicians were interviewed. Interviews are also made with key persons in the Ministry of Health and Welfare and other organizations in the health care field. The result is also analysed from a cultural perspective—‘what kind of impact does the Japanese culture have on the health care organization?’ and/or ‘what kind of sub‐culture is developed in the Japanese hospitals’. Some comparisons are made with Sweden, USA, Canada and Germany. The different roles of the professions in the hospital are included in the study as well as the incentives for different kinds of strategies — specialization, growing in size, investments in new equipment, different kind of ownership and hospitals. Another issue discussed is the attempt to uncover whether there is an implicit distribution of specialities—silent agreements between hospitals, etc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The health care system in Sweden has been undergoing radical change since 1991. The mainly public financed (90%) system with 26 autonomous counties spent 8.5% of its gross domestic product on health care in 1991. The main features of the ‘paradigm shift’ are: separation of production and financing; resource allocation to health districts in relation to the needs of the population; and introduction of public competition between health districts (purchasers) and hospitals (providers). The health district boards are responsible for the health care of the population in their district hospitals financed by their activities (e.g. through diagnosis‐related groups (DRGs)) and quality aspects monitored by central authorities</jats:p><jats:p>A parliamentary committee (HSU 2000) is investigating how Sweden's health care system can be organized and financed in the future. Three models are analyzed: a reformed county council court model, a primary care‐managed model, and a compulsory insurance model. Each model must be consistent with equity and public financing</jats:p><jats:p>From 1992 in the Stockholm county, five surgical specialities were paid for their activities according to DRGs for inpatient care and another system for outpatient care. The number of treated patients during 1992 increased by 8% in inpatient care, 50% in day surgery and by 15% in outpatient care. Taken together, the activities increased by 11%, which is slightly more than the expected 10% increase in productivity. (There was a 10% decrease in DRG prices from 1 January 1992.) The total costs decreased by 1% due to fewer personnel. Nothing has been reported concerning the quality of care, neither before nor after the model was introduced. From 1993, all somatic acute specialities are paid by DRGs and the equivalent outpatient classification systems. The results from 1993 will be presented in the autumn of 1994.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the use of turnover analysis and vacancy chain research has been far more limited for developing nations. Here we review and critique past efforts and then turn to vacancy chain analysis to examine the housing market in Seoul, emphasizing: 1) the formal market's links to the informal housing sector; 2) tests for evidence of upward housing filtering and downward raiding by the middle and upper- middle classes; and 3) the location of the sequence of vacancies, including partial rental housing. We also discuss the policy implications of using turnover analysis including how emphasizing locational aspects of vacancy chains could be particularly helpful to planners who must contend with the locational spillovers of multiplier effects. </jats:p>",

While often considered universal, such spatial relations actually are inextricably entwined with societal values. Many seemingly neutral housing policies designed to protect health, safety, and welfare, in fact often protect dominant values and morals, not physical or emotional well-being of nondominant groups. Consequently they discriminate against the latter. Here, Mexican and U.S. domestic spatial relations are compared within their larger conceptual frameworks to explain some sociocultural bases for these regulations, questioning their applicability. The study concludes that a combined anthropological/planning approach is important for analyzing and developing policy generally. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Government of Egypt launched its national family planning (FP) program in 1966. The early phase was mainly supply oriented and aimed at ensuring wide distribution of contraceptives primarily through pharmacies to meet rising demand. Between 1988 and 1992 a number of additional sources of FP services appeared, with an increase in clinic-based services through both the private and public sectors. In 1992 about one-fourth of users relied on pharmacies to get their FP supplies compared to about one-half in 1988. This change evolved through the influence of two forces: the initiation of a number of FP projects, and expanded and improved FP services in Ministry of Health facilities. Because of these changes in the service delivery systems, senior program managers required information on current market segmentation to identify any overlap among activities of various service delivery systems. As noted in this report, this study assessed the complementary/competitive roles of these systems. It probes into factors that influence clients movements from one type of service provision to another, and their experience with services received. Six governorates were selected and sampled.</jats:p>"

Policy debates in this area are muddled and constricted by a failure to differentiate the variants of internal market that are available. This article outlines a taxonomy of the main types of internal market: primary doctor purchasing; managed competition; competitive bidding; social insurance; and compulsory private insurance. It notes their main structural characteristics and differences. Although internal market reforms have been intended to support the commercialization of healthcare, the idea of designing new types of economic structure to avoid market failure in healthcare has wider and more radical implications than most policy‐makers intend.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This report, which summarizes the major study findings on population and family planning (FP) trends in the Philippines, was prepared for the Research Unit of the Family Planning Services (FPS) of the Department of Health (DOH). It was used by the FPS in its National Consultative Planning Workshop in early 1994 to formulate plans for the Philippine Family Planning Program for 1994–1995. Workshop participants included DOH Regional Family Planning Coordinators, representatives of local government offices engaged in population and health activities, and local NGOs and women's groups. The report alerted participants to population and FP issues and trends that could assist them in formulating their FP program targets and strategies in their own areas and localities. Study findings are organized into those relating to indicators of demand, and those bearing on the supply of FP services. Considering the large number of population and FP studies that have been made to date, this review limits itself to a presentation of related trends in fertility and FP awareness, approval, and use over time. The report provides a backdrop for the formulation and implementation of local action plans to advance the national FP program.</jats:p>"

The FPORT program is being conducted under the Population Council's Asia and Near East Operations Research and Technical Assistance Project. This conference is the culmination of activities that started in October 1992 with a workshop on Introduction to Operations Research in Family Planning. The conference disseminated the results of five OR studies, discussed and evaluated policy and program implications, contributed to the legitimation of OR as a management tool, and helped identify OR needs at the national and local levels. As noted in this report, the conference was attended by health and population program managers and policymakers, researchers on family planning (FP) and population issues from NGOs, the academic community, and USAID collaborating agencies. FP program managers discussed how the study results have been or will be utilized.</jats:p>"

Respondents were currently married women who had either continued to use family planning (FP) since their initial acceptance (current users) or who had stopped using FP altogether (dropouts). Findings from the present study are expected to shed light on several aspects of the dropout problem, namely: How extensive is this problem and how accurate are the DOH records in this regard? How do FP acceptors view their local FP clinic and the services offered? What reasons are given by the dropouts for their decision to stop using FP? What are the factors associated with dropping out? As noted in this report, the study was made possible through support provided by the Population Council under its Family Planning Operations Research and Training (FPORT) Program.</jats:p>"

The information covers five key areas of RH: gender-based abuse, FP and gender issues among adolescents, sexuality and FP, men’s and women’s social and economic responsibilities for childrearing, and the complicated nexus between gender and FP/RH. In so doing, it provides a strong foundation for gender training. This concept was first developed to fulfill a need for gender training within the regional Operations Research/Technical Assistance Projects. To date, two such workshops have been funded by USAID. These activities not only reflect a clear commitment by USAID to the inclusion of gender in all aspects of programmatic planning and implementation but also to the empowerment of women in every phase of the development process. This tool will help guide program planners and policymakers toward making gender equity in FP and RH programs a reality for both women and men.</jats:p>"

En dépit de ces efforts, le taux est resté quasiment stable depuis 1977, augmentant même dans la population d'origine indienne. Les raisons tiennent autant à la résistance des valeurs traditionnelles qu'aux effets indirects de la modernisation : raccourcissement de l'abstinence post partum et déclin de l'alimentation au sein. Mais elles tiennent aussi à l'imperfection du message délivré et du suivi des programmes du planning familial. </jats:p>"

Telematics - the result of the convergence of telecommunications and computing technologies - are important facilitating technologies behind current processes of urban restructuring. But they are also a prime focus of current urban policy innovation. Three particular areas of such innovation are discussed in this paper : using telematics for urban economic development, developing social and community telematics applications, and networking between different cities using these new technologies. A wide range of policy experience is analysed in each area. The paper concludes by highlighting the continued importance of national policies in shaping urban policy in this embryonic area, and suggests how this new wave of urban telematics policies may play an important role in developing a new place-based politics for shaping progressive urban change in the new global era.</jats:p>"

The only volume on CRM in Northeastern America since Spiess's Conservation Archaeology in 1978, its contributors are all major participants in archaeology in the Northeast, which includes the six New England states and New York. Because the volume presents successful models and practical advice concerning CRM, it is relevant to regions other than the Northeast and can be helpful in providing a comparative framework for evaluating programs elsewhere in the United States.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>By the late 1970s, the traditional approach to spatial planning in the UK was widely perceived to have failed. This failure was associated with the problems of the economy in general, including the cumulative industrial, employment and spatial impacts of economic restructuring since the 1960s. During the 1980s, policies towards spatial inequality sought to exploit it, in the interests of wider economic goals, especially to encourage the mobility of factors of production, and to attract private, including overseas investment. Aid to the most needy assisted areas and the inner cities was highly localized, and designed to prepare them, wherever possible, for private investment. The privatization of nationalized industries and public utilities, and the reorganization of public sector agencies according to private sector norms, are also likely to remove many inbuilt subsidies to poorer and more remote areas during the 1990s. Spatial strategies thus now tend to encourage the inequalities which regional policies were once designed to reduce.</jats:p>"

The argument is based on a particular pause pattern observed written language production.

DC resistivity surveys over area covered by sand and dunes indicated the presence of a moderately thick surface layer underlain by a potable aquifer zone of substantial thickness over quartzite bedrock of even topography deepening towards southwest. The results of the magnetic survey show, in general, normal structural behaviour barring a high in the southwest part of the area. The high is explained as due to an intrusive feature at a considerable depth, hence inconsequential for town planning. Subsequently, Jaipur Development Authority has undertaken construction of urban complex with a high rise structure in the area. The paper presents the geophysical results along with chemical analysis of ground water and computer studies. The soundings reveal the suitability of the area for urbanisation, considering the presence of moderately thick surface horizon underlain by a promising aquifer formed over the quartzite bedrock of even topography and disposition. The order of the resistivity obtained and the chemical composition of ground water show the ground water to be of good quality for drinking purpose.</jats:p>",

Yet the meaning of the term varies among different people, projects, and places. Evidence from national parks, where this type of tourism has been promoted for many years, shows that such tourism can cause substantial long-term cumulative changes in environment. Concepts such as ecotourism, green tourism, and sustainable tourism development, are general in their nature and have to be described, planned, and assessed, in detail on the ground in terms of the socioeconomic and environmental conditions applying in different places. In this respect, careful planning and management procedures are needed not only for ecotourism but indeed for all forms of tourism.</jats:p>"

Er is in 1989 vooral op politieke gronden besloten drie minderheidstalen in te voeren als instructietaal in het lager onderwijs: het Pashto, Baluchi en Brahvi. Deze beslissing heeft geleid tot een crisis vanwege belemmeringen op economisch, politiek, linguïstisch en educatief gebied om dit beleid gestalte te geven. Deze belemmeringen worden geanalyseerd. De auteur heeft in Quetta, de hoofdstad van Balochistan, gegevens verzameld. Het in veel met name westerse landen als ideaal beschouwde beleid locale talen als instructietaal te gebruiken in het lager onderwijs, blijkt in Balochistan vooralsnog niet haalbaar te zijn.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa politiko de multlingveco kaj la edukado en Baločio\n\t\tEstas priskribata la multlingveco en Baloĉio (provinco en okcidenta Pakistano). Oni tie en 1989 decidis, cefe pro politikaj kaüzoj, enkonduki la tri lingvojn pastua, baloca kaj brahva kiel instrulingvojn en la baza edukado. Pro ekonomiaj, politikaj, lingvaj kaj edukaj malhelpoj en la realigo de tiu politiko, la decido kaüzis krizon. Tiuj malhelpoj estas analizataj. La aütoro kolektis informojn en Kveto, la cefurbo de Baloĉio. La politiko, konsiderata idealo en multaj precipe okcidentaj landoj, laü kiu oni uzu la lokajn lingvojn kiel instrulingvojn en la baza edukado, montrigas en Baločio esti en la nunaj kondiĉoj nerealigebla.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SAMENVATTING\n\t\tNationalistisch Vlaanderen en de Europese Unie\n\t\tDe Vlaams-nationalisten zijn om twee redenen tegen de Europese eenmaking gekant. Ten eerste zal als gevolg van de Europese functie van Brussel het aantal buitenlanders in en rond de hoofdstad verder toenemen. In Brussel zelf geraakt de Vlaamse minderheid daardoor nog meer in de verdrukking. In de periferie wordt de lokale bevolking geconfronteerd met een nieuwe, anderstalige elite die zich niet aanpast.\n\t\tTen tweede zal in het Europa zonder grenzen de rol van het Engels steeds belangrijker worden. De Europese Gemeenschap zou enkel in efficiëntie en profijt geïnteresseerd zijn en bijgevolg de talige diversiteit binnen haar grenzen als hinderlijk ervaren. Dat de EG de facto de positie van het Engels in Europa versterkt, blijkt wellicht het duidelijkst uit het feit dat als gevolg van het Erasmus-programma het aantal cursussen in het Engels aan de Vlaamse en Nederlandse universiteiten de jongste jaren sterk gestegen is.\n\t\tNiet alleen de Vlaams-nationalisten, maar ook het officiële Vlaanderen stelt zich defensief op, veel defensiever dan het officiële Nederland. Het officiële Nederland voelt zich helemaal niet bedreigd. De Vlamingen proberen nu via allerlei Algemeen-Nederlandse verenigingen en stichtingen hun taalnationalisme naar Nederland te exporteren. Ze boeken daar zelfs een zeker succes bij.\n\t\tHet Algemeen-Neerlandisme misbruikt Maastricht om zijn eigen project, de Nederlanden, te promoten: samen tegen het Europese monster en tegen het Engels.\n\t\tNatuurlijk is het Nederlands sterk genoeg om de Europese uitdaging aan te kunnen. Het Nederlands is nog nooit zo sterk geweest. En wat Brussel betreft: de Vlaamse aanwezigheid is er gewaarborgd; Brussel is de enige internationale stad waar de Vlamingen politiek beschermd worden.\n\t\tVlaanderen en Nederland moeten resoluut voor Maastricht kiezen omdat de Europese eenmaking het enige mogelijke antwoord is op de enge nationalismen die overal de kop opsteken. De enige formule ook die ons een multiculturele toekomst kan garanderen. De culturele paragraaf in het verdrag en het Comité van de Regio's vormen belangrijke stappen vooruit.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tNaciisma Flandrio fronte al Europo\n\t\tLa flandraj naciistoj kontraŭas la unuigon de Europo pro du kaŭzoj. Unue pro la europa funkcio de Bruselo la nombro de eksterlandanoj en kaj cirkaŭ la cefurbo plu kreskos. Per tio la situacio de la flandra minoritato en Bruselo farigos eĉ pli malavantaga. Ekster la urbo la loka logantaro pli kaj pli frontas novan, alilingvan kaj ne adaptigeman eliton.\n\t\tDue en la senlima Eŭropo la angla akiros pli kaj pli gravan rolon. Lau ili, la Europa Komunumo interesigas nur pri efikeco kaj prolito kaj do trovas sian lingvan diversecon malhelpa. Ke EK fakte plifortigas la rolon de la angla en Eŭropo, farigas plej evidente per tio, ke pro la Erasmus-pro-gramo la kursoj instruataj per la angla en flandraj kaj nederlandaj universitatoj en la lastaj jaroj grave plimultigis.\n\t\tNe nur la flandraj naciistoj, sed ankaŭ la flandraj oficialuloj sin tenas defende, multe pli defende ol la nederlandaj oficialuloj. Ĉi-lastaj tute ne sentas minacataj. La flandroj nuntempe — ec kun ioma sukceso — provas transmeti sian lingvan naciismon al Nederlando pere de aro da komunnederlandaj asocioj kaj fondajoj.\n\t\tLa komunnederlandismo misuzas Maastricht-on por antaŭenpusi sian propran projekton, La Malaltajn Landojn: komune kontraŭi la europan monstron kaj la anglan.\n\t\tEvidente la nederlanda estas sufiĉe forta por elteni la europan defion. Gi neniam antaŭe estis tiel forta kiel nun. Kaj se temas pri Bruselo: la flandra ceesto tie estas garantiita; Bruselo estas la sola internacia urbo, kie la flandroj estas politike protektataj.\n\t\tFlandrio kaj Nederlando fervore subtenu Maastricht-on, ĉar la unuigo de Eŭropo estas la sola ebla respondo al la malicaj naciismoj, kiuj ĉie burgonas. Gi ankaŭ estas la sola recepto, kiu povas garantii multkulturan estonton. La kultura paragrafo en la traktato de Maastricht kaj la Regiona Komitato estas gravaj antaŭenpasoj.</jats:p>",

It brought together program managers and regional researchers to identify problem areas that might benefit from operations research. From Western Visayas (Region VI), the City Population Office (CPO) of Iloilo City in collaboration with the Social Science Research Institute of the Central Philippine University, identified a problem concerning the poor performance of volunteer family planning (FP) workers and undertook to study it. The study focused on the Barangay Service Point Officers (BSPOs) who assist in the delivery of FP services under the supervision of the CPO, and Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) who concentrate on maternal and child care but have minimal involvement in FP and are supervised by the City Health Office. As this report states, the objective was to compare the FP activities and performance of the BSPOs and BHWs in Iloilo City and determine the factors that influence their performance.</jats:p>"

Ironicamente, questo contraste è particolarmente marcato proprio nel caso delle lingue comunitarie.

Zum Leitmotiv für die Raumplanung wird nach dem Franzosen Rouge (1947): „Das Suchen nach und das Zustandebringen der bestmöglichen gegenseitigen Anpassung von Raum und Gesellschaft, und zwar um dieser Gesellschaft willen“. Auch heute noch bestimmt dieses Leitmotiv das Handeln der verschiedenen für die Raumplanung zuständigen Instanzen. In dieser Übersicht, die vor allem für die Leser von „Raumforschung und Raumordnung“ als Einführung zum Thema Raumplanung in den Niederlanden gedacht ist, wird dies näher erläutert.Nach einem kurzen historischen Abriß werden in Teil I die formalen Seiten der niederländischen Raumplanungspolitik dargelegt. Der Gesetzesrahmen, die Organe und die unterschiedlichen Pläne werden besprochen. In Teil II wird die Entwicklung der Raumplanung in den Niederlanden anhand der Zielsetzungen und der einzelnen Regierungsberichte zur Raumplanung illustriert.Beide Teile sind unabhängig voneinander gestaltet, so daß der Leser selbst entscheiden kann, ob er sich der formalen oder der inhaltlichen Beschreibung zuwenden möchte.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tOrígenes de la /s/ del Español Mexicano. Una Sección Transversal de la Historia\n\t\tUna de las características más notables del espanol mexicano contemporáneo es la extraordinaria resistencia de la /s/ final de sílaba y palabra a los procesos de reducción fonética. En los estudios dialectológicos, esta pronunciación se atribuye comúnmente a los efectos lingüísticos conservadores de la capital virreinal; la retención de la /s/ tambén se atribuye a una emigración peninsular en la que los nativos de Castilla gozaban de una prominencia demográfica. Tampoco se excluye la contribución de las lenguas indígenas; la teoría más conocida postula que el substrato náhuatl reemplazba toda /s/ del español por la sibilante africada /ts/. El presente trabajo postula una trayectoria algo diferente, al detectar indicios de una /s/ reducida repartidos por toda la extension territorial mexicana, en las areas rurales entre los sociolectos inferiores. En efecto, se plantea la hipotésis de que la /s/ final en México de las áreas urbanas, y sobre todo de la zona capitalina, haya sufrido dos efectos que atrasaban o bien invertían la erosión fonética tan repartida en Hispanoamérica. El primero es la reacción conservadora que provenía de la Ciudad de México, convertida desde muy temprano en la concentración urbana más grande e imponente en toda América Latina. Al mismo tiempo, se reconoce una participación de la población bilingüe náhuatl-español, mediante la reintroducción, al léxico español, de préstamos anteriores que ya retenían una [s] sibilante.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa origino de /s/ en la meksika hispana: transversa sekco de la historio\n\t\tEvidenta trajto de la meksika hispana lingvo estas la nepra konservo de /s/ fine de silabo aŭ vorto, kontraste al la malforta aŭ malaperinta prononco observebla en la kariba kaj aliaj latinamerikaj regionoj samkiel en suda Hispanio. Oni ofte supozas la kaŭzon en kombino de fonetika konservemo spronita de la proksimeco al la vicreĝa ĉefurbo kaj superrego de enmigrintoj el /s/-konservaj regionoj de Hispanio. Kelkfoje oni proponis influon de la nahuatla lingvo, tiel ke la nahuatla anstataŭigis la fruan hispanan /s/ per afrikata /tV. Ci tiu artikolo studas faktojn el la malcentraj regionoj de Meksikio kaj sugestas, ke la nuntempa konservo de la fina /s/ estas tipa nur por la urboj, de kie gi iom post iom disvastiĝis al la kamparo kaj al malpli altaj sociolektoj. Gi hipotezas, ke la hispana fina /s/ iam estis multe pli malfortigita en tuta Meksikio. En Meksikurbo, konservema malprogreso subtenis la partan reinstalon de la sibla [s]. Estas ankaú tezate pri nerekta nahuatla influo, nome en fruaj hispanaj pruntvortoj, kiuj konservis la siblan [s]. Kiam la kontakto inter la nahuatla kaj la hispana plivastigis, tiuj fruaj pruntaĵoj estis repruntitaj en la regionajn variaĵojn de la hispana, subtenante kaj eĉ refortigante la siblan prononcon.</jats:p>",

La referajo esploras la reagon de činoj al la disvastigo de PTH kaj la kunligon de ilia starpunkto al variajoj kiel ekzemple ago kaj naskigloko. Donitajoj kolektitaj per enketilo estis analizitaj de unudirekta ANOVA. La rezultoj montras, ke ses kategorioj de starpunktoj al PTH estas identigeblaj. La aŭtoro nomas ilin jene: 1. konstato, ke utiligo de PTH estas prestiga; 2. tiom ke PTH povus malhelpi lokan lojalecon; 3. akcepto de la graveco de PTH kiel faktoro en klerigo; 4. rekono, ke PTH estas ilo de pli vasta komunikado; 5. generala aprobo; 6. nacia kaj politika solidareco. La dua kategorio estas negativa faktoro, kiu limigas la disvastigon de PTH, dum la aliaj kvin kategorioj konsistigas pozitivajn faktorojn. La statistika analizo montras korelacion de starpunktoj al PTH rilate al ago, naskigloko, nuna logloko kaj profesioj de gepatroj. Tiuj eltrovoj liveras utilajn donitajojn al lingvoplanantoj en Činio, kaj la metodiko evoluigita en la nuna studo eble utilos en aliaj lingvaj studoj.</jats:p>",

Wanaea oil reserves are estimated in the order of 32 x 106m3 (200 MMstb) making this the largest oil field development currently underway in Australia.Development planning for these fields posed a unique set of challenges.Key subsurface uncertainties are the requirement for water injection (Wanaea only) and well numbers. Strategies for managing these uncertainties were studied and appropriate flexibility built-in to planned facilities.Alternative facility concepts including steel/concrete platforms and floating options were studied-the concept selected comprises subsea wells tied-back to production/storage/export facilities on an FPSO located over Wanaea.In view of the high proportion of costs associated with the subsea components, significant effort was focussed on flowline optimisation, simplification and cost reduction. These actions have led to potential major economic benefits.Gas utilisation options included reinjection into the oil reservoirs, export for re-injection into North Rankin or export to shore. The latter requires the installation of an LPG plant onshore and was selected as the simplest, safest and the most economically attractive method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tEl espanol afromestizo de Costa Chica, Guerrero: De Cuaji a Cuijla\n\t\tLa presencia africana en México se remonta al inicio de la conquista espanola, aunque anos más tarde los esclavos africanos llegaron a ser importados en numerosas cantidades para servir en distintas actividades y regiones del país. Mientras que la mayoría de los descendientes se asimiló a la población mexicana mayoritaria, algunos mantienen todavía su comunidad en el municipio de Cuajinicuilapa y la Costa Chica del estado de Guerrero. Este artículo trata del origen de los afromexicanos de Costa Chica. Compara además los elementos del habla regional recogidos por Aguirre Beltrán en su obra de 1958 titulada Cuijla con datos recogidos in situ en 1991-1992. Se presenta un análisis de los rasgos más sobresalientes de la comunidad y se anotan semejanzas, actualmente decadentes, con el habla africanoide atestiguada histôricamente en México y todavia corriente en otros países hispanohablantes. Se concluye que la introducciôn exitosa de la education pública acoplada con la ubicuidad de los medios masivos de comunicaciôn han reducido o eliminado las características del habla más distintivamente regionales. Se concluye que el pueblo guerrerense de casi 25,000 habitantes muestra una marcada tendencia a la nivelaciôn lingüística que se observa en comunidades de mayor tamano, aunque se documentan numerosos casos de ultracorrecciôn. Se recogen también impresiones personales y actitudes linguisticas de los sujetos informates. Del habla africanoide original solamente quedan vestigios y memorias que estân destinados a desaparecer.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa lingvaĵo de la afrikanidoj en Costa Chica en Guerrero: de Cuaji al Cuijla\n\t\tAfrikanoj alvenis al Meksikio per la hispana konkero kaj estis de tiam alportitaj grandnombre por labori kiel sklavoj en diversaj partoj de la lando. Dum la plej multaj el iliaj idoj sorbigis en la generalan meksikan logantaron, en la distrikto Cuajinicuilapa kaj la Costa Chica en Guerrero, iuj ankoraû estas facile identigeblaj kiel aparta etno. Ci tiu artikoio priskribas la historion de la afrikanoj en Meksikio kaj la Costa Chica kaj komparas trajtojn de la regiona lingvajo priskribitajn'en la libro Cuijla de Aguirre Beltrán de 1958 kun faktoj observitaj surloke en 1991-1992. Estas notitaj la nuntempe forfadantaj similecoj kun historie dokumentita afrikecigita lingvajo en Meksikio, kiuj parte ankoraû ekzistas en aliaj hispanlingvaj landoj. Konklude la aûtoro konstatas, ke la sukcesa enkonduko de publika edukado kune kun la ciea ceesto de la amaskomunikiloj reduktis au forigis la pli evidentajn regionajn trajtojn de la lingvajo.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tEducatión bilingüe, nacionalismo y etnicidad en México: De la teoria a la práctica\n\t\tEste artículo describe el modelo de asimilaciôn de los grupos indígenas de México a la vida nacional a través de la educación bilingue (EB). La EB se ha usado como el instrumento que facilita el desplazamiento lingüístico. La EB se examina a la luz de un discurso superior que define la identidad nacional como una parte activa del nacionalismo. A su vez el nacionalismo esta fuertemente vinculado al Estado, el aparato de control de masas más efectivo. Se examina la trayectoria de casi quinientos anos de castellanizaciôn y como unos doscientos de política nacionalista: ambas trayectorias se vinculan a otra variable importante: la etnicidad central. Se propone ademâs que las fuerzas ideológicas que impiden una inversión del desplazamiento lingiiistico se encuentran profundamente arraigadas en las tradiciones de castellanizaciôn y nacionalismo. Las demandas de los grupos indigenas a tener education en sus propias lenguas maternas han generado una abundante literatura sobre un curriculo bilingue-bicultural. Sin embargo, los estudiosos de asuntos indigenas, los profesores bilingues y los funcionarios públicos no se han desprendido de las pesadas tradiciones arriba mencionadas. Por tanto, en los ultimos quince anos, no hay una sola prueba de que las lenguas maternas de los indigenas se usen en la educaciôn formal y se mantengan por efectos de la misma. Por el contrario, el proceso de desplazamiento es continuo. Y como la EB es subvencionada enteramente por el Estado, los grupos encargados de estudiar y proponer estrategias de mantenimiento de las lenguas maternas, lejos de proponer una inversión temporal o permanente del desplazamiento lingiiistico, han asimilado los dictados del Estado — el representante por excelencia del nacionalismo —, a través de un proceso de acomodo en las instituciones estatales, que sirve a su vez para logar la movilidad social ascendente.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tDulingva edukado, naciismo kaj etneco en Meksikio: de la teorio al la praktiko\n\t\tLa artikolo priskribas modelon de la adaptiĝo de indiĝenaj meksikaj popoloj al la ĝenerala socio. Dulingva edukado estis uzita kiel faciligilo de lingvoŝanĝo. Dulingva edukado estas studata rilate al la debato, okazanta sur pli alta nivelo, pri nacia identeco kaj naciismo. La vojo tra preskaŭ kvincent jaroj de kastiliigo kaj ĉirkaŭ ducent jaroj de naciisma politiko estas studata kaj ligata al alia grava variablo: la kreo de centra etneco. La aŭtoro sugestas, ke la fortoj, kiuj nun malhelpas la renverson de la lingvoŝanĝo, havas profundajn radikojn en tiuj tradicioj. El la postulo de indiĝenaj grupoj pri edukado en la denaska lingvo rezultis vigla diskuto pri la avantaĝoj de dulingva kaj dukultura instrutemaro, sed la sciencistoj, instruistoj kaj administristoj ne trovis taŭgajn strategiojn por malfermi spacon por la denaska lingvo en la formala edukado aŭ en neformalaj terenoj. Post forpelo de la Somera Instituto de Lingvistiko, kiu supozeble uzis dulingvan edukadon por religia konvertado, ĉiuj projektoj nuntempe estas zorgataj de institucioj financataj aŭ stirataj de la regis-taro.

The heuristic is the shortest-route algorithm which deals with finding the smallest possible distance to visit multiple locations only once. The only point taught by a human operator was a starting position and all other points within the workspace, to be visited by the robotic arm to perform tasks such as screw-fastening, adhesive application and detailed inspection of assemblies, were learned by the system.</jats:p>",

Der Artikel erörtert die Suche nach einer nigerianischen Nationalsprache seit der Unabhängigkeit 1960 und analysiert verschiedene Faktoren, die eine Einigung bisher verhindert haben. Die Entscheidung für eine der vorhandenen afrikanischen Sprachen hätte das politische Gleichgewicht in Nigeria in Gefahr gebracht.

That which has, has concentrated on:descriptions of the process;the variety of audit types and reasons for undertaking audits; andmethodologies or systems of audit (audit protocol).Little attention has been paid to the human and organisational dynamics of an environmental audit; yet it is this factor, probably above all else, that determines the value that such a process can yield.The composition of the audit team, planning for the audit itself, the management and administration of the audit and finally the audit report, follow-up and implementation, are critical factors in ensuring that the process is both valuable and value adding.Undertaken well, and with due cognisance of the above factors, audits can provide a valuable indicator of systems effectiveness, levels of compliance with regulations, assessment of risk factors and, through documentation and reporting, demonstrate the application of the process of due environmental diligence.Key elements of a successful audit include:ownership of the process by those who's activities are being audited;the professionalism and inter-personal skills of the auditor;due reference to the positive aspects of systems and groups who work well and deserve recognition; andthe overall determination of the organisation to maximise and utilise positively the information recorded during the process.There must be an open and positive communication between the three key groups—the auditors, those 'being audited' and those administering the audit. The ultimate recipients must feel that the people who are responsible for the audit will not just 'hit and run' but will stay the distance to ameliorate identified problem areas.</jats:p>"

In the conventional gait study, one of the major concerns has been the foothold selection based on a prescribed body motion, but, in the paper, we consider the body motion planning problem under the assumption that a set of irregular footholds is given, and propose a hierarchical strategy. The strategy can be divided into three stages: first, a feasible range of the body movement is sought under the kinematic limit and the stability constraint. Next, a swing-leg sequence is selected with the aid of a proposed measure of traversability.

Die Studie bestand aus zwei Teilen: qualitativen regionalen Fallstudien und quantitativen Modellprognosen der regionalen Wirtschaftsentwicklung.Ein wichtiges Fazit der Kanaltunnelstudie ist, daß durch den Tunnel zumindest im hochurbanisierten Kern Europas nicht notwendigerweise wirtschaftliches Wachstum in allen anliegenden Regionen induziert wird.Dennoch eröffnet der Kanaltunnel als ein Schlüsselelement der neuen Verkehrsinfrastruktur Europas ein neues Kapitel in der Debatte über die Rolle des Verkehrs in Europa und unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit einer integrierten Verkehrs- und Regionalpolitik der Europäischen Union.</jats:p>"

With knowledge of the cost functions of storage-treatment systems, the developed cost optimization precedure can be used to determine the least-cost combination of storage and treatment systems which can achieve various levels of quality control. This information is useful for specification of design performance and subsequent design level analyses of control systems.</jats:p>",

Small firms which engaged in formalized planning performed better financially than those which did not. They also possessed more information about themselves and their environment than the non‐planning firms and made greater use of this information in strategic decision‐making. The acquisition and utilization of information about the firm and its environment was found to mediate the impact of strategic planning on performance.

Twelve physical education teacher education (PETE) majors each taught two 25-minute lessons to elementary-age learners. Lesson plans were developed for the first lesson (planned condition) but not the second (unplanned condition). All lessons were videotaped and employed in the data analyses. Three data collection instruments were used for the analysis of selected teaching behaviors: (a) the Academic Learning Time-Physical Education (ALT-PE) system, (b) an event recording instrument for coding teacher verbal feedback statements, and (c) the Qualitative Dimensions of Lesson Introduction, Task Presentation, and Lesson Closure (QDITC) system. The results suggest that planning has a positive effect on some preservice teachers’ instructional behaviors. For teachers in training, it seems that planning is important to the employment of “effective” teaching behaviors in the interactive teaching environment.</jats:p>",

In this paper, proposals are put forward for the explicit inclusion of an economic cohesion clause into EC mergers regulation. Also, the advantages such a clause would have are discussed, and the possible objections to the consideration of regional issues during merger investigations are assessed. </jats:p>",

The shape of this curve depends upon the parameters of the demand process, specifically the expected level of demand, standard deviation and correlation structure, as well as upon the capacities and initial state of the production and inventory system. A model is presented which explicitly determines this trade‐off curve for a firm. The model is intended both as an operational model to aid managers in setting revenue and service targets which are compatible with the capacities and resources of the firm, and as a tool for exploring relationships between the parameters of the demand process and the constraints of the physical production and inventory system. The results illustrate that the level of risk depends strongly on the variability of the demand process, the cost structure, the capacities and initial state of the system and, to a lesser extent, the correlation in demand between succeeding periods. Results suggest that establishing service level targets consistent with the firm's strategic orientation must be done in consideration of both the characteristics of the demand process and the capacities of the production and inventory system. The model provides a tool for estimating the premium above unit cost which must be paid to provide a designated service level.</jats:p>",

Hier werden an Standorten mit vorhandener Infrastruktur zahlreiche Investitionen blockiert. Damit fallen Entscheidungen für problematische Standorte (insbesondere „auf der grünen Wiese“). In den Städten, selbst in und nahe den Zentren, sind aber oft Flächen in Großgrundbesitz vorhanden, d. h. ein großes Volumen an städtischem Raum wäre erschließbar. Zusammen mit den gebündelten Anlagen und Einrichtungen der Infrastruktur existiert dort ein bedeutendes Entwicklungspotential. Erodieren oder veröden die städtischen Zentren weiter, gibt es, abgesehen von den damit verbundenen Kosten und Folgekosten, kaum Chancen für das Gedeihen von wirklichem städtischen Leben. Urbanität aber wäre über Einkommen, Arbeitsplätze, Steuereinnahmen u. a. hinaus von großer Bedeutung für die Menschen und die Gesellschaft.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Von ihren Ursprüngen her tendierten Städte immer zu einem Wachstum entsprechend ihrem Kommunikationsnetz. Im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, hauptsächlich aber in der Nachkriegszeit, ermöglichten bedeutende Innovationen im Bereich der Kommunikation das Wachstum der Städte über die Stadtmauern hinaus und ließen Vorstädte entstehen. Die Siedlungen dieses Netzwerkes waren internen Zwängen wie Relief und Hydrographie entsprechend ausgerichtet. Deshalb blieben die städtischen Formen auch nahezu konzentrisch.Zum ersten faßt dieser Beitrag die Ergebnisse früherer Forschungen in der Städtedynamik und in der städtischen Raumstruktur zusammen, zum zweiten analysiert er einerseits die Stadtentwicklung von Namur von ihren Anfängen an. Andererseits betrachtet er neuere Entwicklungen, die in bevorzugte Richtungen verlaufen, was einen sehr zerstörerischen Einfluß auf die frühere konzentrische Struktur zu haben scheint. Dieses ungleichmäßige Wachstum wird durch den Einfluß exogener Faktoren auf die Stadtregion hervorgerufen.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1980s saw a conscious restructuring of economic life in Australia. The direction of that restructuring was derived partly from prescriptions about the virtues of free trade and government deregulation. Another influence has been the view that the economic success of Japan and the Asian ‘dragons’ is because of their adoption of free trade and liberal market regimes. In this paper, evidence from Korea and Taiwan is used to show that this interpretation is seriously flawed. The growth of the dragons was not driven by comparative advantage. Rather, the industries of the dragons were set up independently of their competitiveness; some became competitive by exporting. Industrialisation in the newly industrialised countries (NICs) exemplifies a variety of forms of local initiative by a state: how does it have the will and power to create industrial policy? The development of state policy depends on local class structures and perceptions of the global political and economic environment that nullify attempts simply to copy policy into different social and economic circumstances. The lessons of the economic success of the Northeast Asian NICs are improperly drawn in two respects: these are dirigiste, not free market, economies; and even if that intervention has been for the good it does not follow that similar policies could be applied, much less be successful, in the different place that is Australia. This is the geographic lesson: places differ, and so, therefore, must policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An increasingly common practice in Israel and other countries is the imposition of restrictions and burdens on land developers, without utilizing formal planning or expropriation processes. A land owner, for instance, may agree to dedicate part of his land for public use and to transfer its title to the planning authority, with no compensation and without expropriation procedures. Similarly, the parties can agree on height or bulk restrictions for buildings to be constructed on the land, beyond those imposed by the plans applicable to the area. The burdens might take the form of a contract between the planning authority and the developer, or may be included in the building or subdivision permits. In many cases, the authority attempts to use these tools to obtain benefits that it could not have acquired through its statutory powers. This article examines the legality of this practice and the restrictions which should be imposed on it. As regards the transfer of rights in land without compensation, the question arises whether such agreements or permits should be subjected to the same restrictions that apply to injuries caused by plans and expropriations. For instance, should one invalidate an agreement in which a developer purports to transfer land without compensation in quantities beyond that permitted by statutes authorizing expropriation without compensation? Does the fact that the land was transferred with the owner's consent (and not through the coercive power of expropriation statutes) restrict judicial intervention to contract law grounds, such as duress, misrepresentation or mistake?</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tThe Indigenous Languages of Mexico and the Creation of a National Language\n\t\tThis article dwells on the role that the members of scientific societies played in the process of selecting a linguistic code in 19th-century Mexico. The members of the Mexican Society of Georgraphy and Statistics (1833) and those of the Mexican Academy of Language (1875) engaged in the study of Mexican multilingualism. The purpose of their projects was to delineate the basis of language policy which in turn had a fundamental component: the creation of national identity. Both leading intellectuals and government officials considered decolonization the most important task of their time. As a result, they assumed the evaluation of two equally relevant traditions: the Hispanic and the Amerindian. Firstly, it was necessary to demonstrate the \"level\" of civilization reached by some Amerindian groups in general and the Mexican in particular. The need to demonstrate that Amerindian languages were languages of \"culture\" made the 19th-century thinkers resort to the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, represented by Francisco Xavier Clavijero. Secondly, the researchers of this era resorted to comparative linguistics. The preservation of the colonial language was justified on the grounds that it was convenient to continue participating in the Hispanic spiritual tradition, a tradition that was reflected in its language. Indigenous languages were examined to preserve the memory of the glorious Indian past. The thinkers and political leaders of the 19th century were convinced that the disappearance of the indigenous languages was inevitable. By integrating select traits of Nahuatl — the most \"civilized\" and widely spoken Indian language — the new \"decolonized\" language would stand out as a unique geographical variety, a variety that would eventually be accepted by the members of the Spanish Royal Academy.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa indiĝenaj lingvoj de Meksikio kaj la kreado de nacia lingvo\n\t\tLa artikolo priskribas la rolon luditan de membroj de sciencaj societoj en la procezo de elekto de lingva normo en Meksikio en la 19-a jarcento. La membroj de la Meksika Societo pri Geografio kaj Statistiko ( 1833) kaj tiuj de la Meksika Lingva Akademio ( 1875) studis la meksikan lingvaron. Estis la celo de iliaj projektoj krei bazon por lingva politiko kies baza elemento estis la kreado de uacia identeco. Kaj la gvidaj intelektuloj kaj la registaraj oficistoj konsideris la plej grava tasko de sia epoko la malkoloniigon. Sekve ili ekstudis du samgravajn tradiciojn, la hispanan kaj la indianan. Unue, gravis montri la \"nivelon\" de civilizo atingitan de indianaj grupoj ĝenerale kaj de la meksikaj specife. La bezono pruvi, ke la indianaj lingvoj estis lingvoj de \"kulturo\" kondukis la deknaŭa-jarcentajn intelektulojn al ideoj el la epoko de la racionalismo, reprezentataj de Francisco Xavier Clavijero. Due, la sciencistoj de tiu periodo aplikis komparan lingvistikon. La konservo de la kolonia lingvo estas pravigita per la argumento, ke estis konvene plu partopreni en la hispana spirita tradicio, reflektita en la hispana lingvo. La indigenaj lingvoj estis studataj por konservi la memoron pri la glora indiana pasinteco. La intelektuloj kaj politikaj gvidantoj de la 19-a jarcento estis konvinkitaj, ke la malapero de la indigenaj lingvoj estis neevitebla. Alprenante kelkajn trajtojn el la nahuatla lingvo - la plej \"civilizita\" kaj plej vaste parolata indiana lingvo - la nova \"mal-koloniigita\" hispana lingvo apartigus kiel unika geografia variaĵo, kiu fine ec gajnos la aprobon de la Hispana Rega Akademio.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to analyze the problem of aggregate data generation starting from separate items in patient records. After describing the different uses of patient record data, we outline the process which generates aggregate data starting from individual records. This process leads to the definition of the “view on aggregation” as an intermediate step between patient records and aggregate data.</jats:p><jats:p>A simplified schema is presented based on the Entity-Relationship model representing a conceptual model of the integration of aggregate data and patient record items. Finally, the role is discussed of automation in this process and the perspectives for its implementation.</jats:p>"

This is a combinatorial optimization problem, and an enumerative check of every pattern is necessary to obtain the optimal solution.</jats:p><jats:p>In practice, successive heuristic search methods are adopted to obtain the quasi‐optimal solution within a limited computation time. However, a very long computing time is still required when the problem size becomes slightly larger. The step‐by‐step nature of the methods results in many iterations, although it ensures satisfaction of the constraints. Reduction of the iterations is considered to be necessary to enhance processing speed.</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper, “supply adequacy” is introduced as a new criteria index to guess the solution, which is obtained by fuzzy inference for each possible pair of source and load zone. The reconfiguration pattern is obtained at once or in a few processing steps by assigning to each zone the source with the highest adequacy. Numerical examples show that the proposed method can obtain the solution faster than the ordinary method, more remarkably with the increase of problem size.</jats:p>",

We have developed a concept of a dose–volume distribution (DVD) and its corresponding differential dose–volume distribution (DDVD), based on organization of the data in the volume rather than in the dose domain. The new concepts make full use of the information that can be obtained from the dose calculation points and the sampling pattern and are designed to overcome shortcomings of the classical concepts of dose–volume histograms (DVH) and differential dose–volume histograms (DDVH). The new concepts can be applied to any number of dose calculation points, but they are especially advantageous when a small number of points is used. DVDs are particularly well suited to pseudo‐ and quasirandom sampling of dose distributions. We have developed an error analysis for DVDs and DDVDs in the case of pseudorandom sampling. We also describe an adaptive technique for minimizing the amount of data needed for purposes of display.</jats:p>",

The problem is to find an optimal sequence of base positions and manipulator configurations for performing a sequence of tasks given a series of task specifications. The formulation of the problem is nonlinear. The feasible regions for the problem are nonconvex and unconnected. Genetic algorithms applied to such problems appear to be very promising while traditional optimization methods cause difficulties. Computer simulations are carried out on a three‐degrees‐of‐freedom manipulator mounted on a two‐degrees‐of‐freedom mobile base to search for the near optimal path‐planning solution for performing the sequence of tasks. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

Three case studies are performed for a hotel, a hospital, and an office building (20,000 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in total floor space, respectively). The optimal capacity of the generator under the flat rate is 50 to 70 percent of peak power demand. Effects of the on‐peak/off‐peak energy charge ratio are saturated at a ratio of 5. It is not until an energy charge ratio of between 2 and 5 that the purchase of off‐peak power increases in summer when price reduction is applied to city gas. As the energy charge ratio is raised, cheaper off‐peak power is substituted for city gas and the sum of electricity energy charge and gas energy charge decreases. The simulation results indicate that properly designed TOU rates may provide commercial customers an incentive to operate a cogeneration system with an appropriate mix of the self‐generation and commercial power.</jats:p>",

We hypothesize that what‐if analysis, a prominent feature of most decision support systems, creates an “illusion of control” causing users to overestimate its effectiveness. Two experiments involving a production planning task are reported which examine decision makers' perceptions of the effectiveness of what‐if analysis relative to the alternatives of unaided decision making, and quantitative decision rules. Experiment 1 found that almost all subjects believed what‐if analysis was superior to unaided decision making, although using what‐if analysis had no significant effect on performance. Experiment 2 found that decision makers were indifferent between what‐if analysis and a quantitative decision rule which, if used, would have led to significant cost savings. Thus, what‐if analysis did create an illusion of control: decision makers perceived performance differences where none existed, and did not detect large differences when they were present. In both experiments, decision makers exhibited difficulty realizing that their positive beliefs about what‐if analysis were exaggerated. Such misjudgments could lead people to continue using what‐if analysis even when it is not beneficial and to avoid potentially superior decision support technologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tThe Impact of \"the Underdogs\" in Three Processes of Linguistic Change in the Spanish of Morelia, Michoacán\n\t\tThis paper deals with the role that the educational and the socioeconomic levels of the speakers play in some processes of linguistic change. Three phenomena of the Spanish grammar in different stages of linguistic change are examined in the light of the data collected among Spanish speakers from Morelia, Michoacan: (a) the opposition \"periphrastic/morphological future,\" (b) the use of pluperfect subjunctive in the apodosis of conditional sentences instead of compound conditional, and (c) the innovative use of the copula estar. Results from the analysis reveal that in the two more advanced change processes (a and b), the lower educational levels and the low socioeconomic group are the leaders, while the group with more formal education and the middle-high socioeconomic group have joined, although with some resistance, the tendency marked by the leader groups. The analysis of the ser/estar opposition evidences an innovative use of the copula estar in the community. This change is in the first stages and consists of an extension of the estar semantic domain. The educational and socioeconomic levels also show differences in the use of this innovative form. Speakers with college education and speakers of the upper-middle socioeconomic group are more resistant to adopt the innovative use. However, speakers with less education and speakers of the low socioeconomic group show a very important proportion of the innovative use. The results found seem to suggest that the size of the group with less education and the size of the low socioeconomic group in communities like the one studied permit the imposition of some changes that are led by them.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa influo de la \"subuloj \" en tri procezoj de lingvosangigo en la hispana de Morelia en Michoacdn\n\t\tLa artikolo temas pri la rolo de la eduka kaj sociekonomia niveloj de la parolantoj en procezoj de lingvosangigo. La aǔtoro studas tri fenomenojn de la hispana gramatiko en diversaj stadioj de lingvosangigo per faktoj observitaj inter parolantoj de la hispana en Morelia en Michoacán: (1) la alternativo inter helpverba kaj morfologia futuro, (2) la uzo de pluskvamperfekta subjunktivo en la cefpropozicio de kondicaj frazoj anstataǔ la helpverba kondicionalo, kaj (3) la novstila uzo de la kopulo estar. La rezultoj montras, ke en la du pli progresintaj ŝanĝoprocezoj (1 kaj 2), la malpli altaj edukniveloj kaj la malalta sociekonomia grupo gvidas, dum la grupo kun pli da formala edukigo kaj la mezalta sociekonomia grupo postsekvas, ec se kun iom da rezisto, la tendencon indikitan de la gvidantaj grupoj. La analizo de la alternativo ser/estar montras novstilan uzon de estar en la komunumo. Tiu ŝanĝo estas en la komenca stadio kaj konsistas el plivastigo de la signifo de estar. La niveloj kondutas malsame ankaǔ rilate al ĉi tiu novaĵo. Parolantoj kun altlerneja edukigo kaj tiuj el la mezalta sociekonomia grupo rezistas la disvastigon de tiu novstila uzo. Aliflanke parolantoj malpli edukitaj kaj sur malpli alta sociekonomia nivelo uzas la novstilaĵon grandkvante. La trovitaj rezultoj sajnas sugesti, ke pro sia grandeco la malaltaj socigrupoj kapablas en socio kiel la studita esti gvidantaj en sango.</jats:p>",

Given limited knowledge of how low intensity fire would affect wildlife species, the expert reasoning of researchers was used to postulate fire response curves showing how high intensity fire affects vegetation structure and hence wildlife population density through time. These fire response curves and knowledge of the habitat preferences of wildlife species provided the best available information upon which to frame decision rules advocating prescribed burning at low intensity to manipulate wildlife habitat. Decision rules were also framed for protecting recreation sites, limiting fire spread, and reducing the risk of wildfire ignition. Once the decision rules were quantified, the LUPIS land use planning and information system was used to derive and map burning options reflecting different wildlife management strategies.</jats:p>"

The effects of a chronic labour-supply situation and the appreciating Singapore dollar on the export competitiveness of the manufacturing sector are reviewed. Enterprise and state responses to these mounting pressures are examined, particularly with regard to the labour shortage. One optimistic long-term solution seems to lie in regional cooperation in industrial development, with a sectoral and technical division across Singapore, Johor in Malaysia, and the Riau Islands of Indonesia. With the three regions in different stages of development, the regional development plan is to bring about a division on the basis of the relative availability of land, labour, and infrastructure. In the second half of the paper, the Singapore—Johor link, the most developed side of the growth triangle is examined, and the potential and problems arising from this arrangement are explored. </jats:p>",

Few studies are focused upon corporate strategy, an essential ingredient for a better understanding of the motive forces behind restructuring. This paper is an attempt to redress the balance, beginning with the relationship between structure (the inherited configuration of production) and strategy (the design and implementation of restructuring). As part of this analysis, three types of strategy are distinguished: structure-dependent, structure-limited, and structure-focused strategies. To appreciate better the connection between the choice of strategy and corporate form, a series of models of corporate control are developed that distinguish between ownership and management. These preliminary arguments are then used to analyse the scope of sunk costs—that portion of fixed costs which are non-recoverable. To illustrate the scope of the framework used, recent examples of restructuring from northeast Asia and North America are interpreted in the light of the analytical model. </jats:p>",

The method utilizes the property that the value of the distance transformation image represents the distance from the obstacle. By the proposed method, the robot can move by translation to the farthest possible point only by examining a small number of points on the straight‐line of the progress. This makes it possible to realize the fast motion planning. When a deadlock is produced, a new posture of the robot is determined at the position so that the collision with the obstacle does not occur. Then, the part of the motion down to the initial point is regenerated.</jats:p><jats:p>Finally, the speed of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of the conventional motion planning algorithm, and the fast operation is demonstrated experimentally.</jats:p>",

In this paper the author estimates the parameters of the demand for housing, using data drawn from the city of Ibadan in Nigeria. The empirical analysis, in which housing is viewed as a composite product, reveals that the demand for housing is income inelastic. Specifically, income-elasticity estimates for renters and owners are 0.88 and 0.56, respectively. Furthermore, these income-elasticity estimates were found to be higher than those reported for other African cities. </jats:p>",

Issues which were addressed by this team during planning included wellbore stability, drilling fluids, liner and completion design, wellpath orientation, reservoir constraints and formation evaluation techniques.After an extensive planning period, three sinuous path horizontal wells, Griffin-5(H), Griffin-6/ST1(H) and Scindian-2/STI(H) were successfully drilled in early 1993 by a semi-submersible rig as part of the Griffin/Scindian fields development drilling program.These sinuous wells have a well path profile which intersects the reservoir in three low-angle passes of the vertical section over a horizontal length of between 800 and 950 m, in the shape of a sine wave.A feature of the wells was the use of geosteering techniques to keep the sinuous profile on track to intersect specific reservoir targets, using the latest in formation evaluation measurement while drilling (FEMWD) technology.Although technically successful, the economic benefit of the horizontal wells will be measured by their production performance when tied into the 'Griffin Venture' floating production facility, expected on stream in early 1994.</jats:p>"

A captive breeding program has been initiated for reintroducing rabbits into suitable but vacant habitat. DNA fingerprinting was used to identify individuals within a captive group suitable for inclusion in a larger captive breeding program. This methodology allowed the ranking of suitabilities of these individuals, and the results emphasize the need to capture wild rabbits over a wide geographic area for setting up a larger founder population. A statistical technique for inferring linkage between fingerprint probes was used. Fingerprinting methodology allowed a genetic basis for planning the captive breeding program. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

In this paper, an attempt is made to examine the case of Hong Kong through intensive case studies of its garment-making and electronics industries. It is argued that the way the manufacturing industries respond to rising production costs, increasing protectionism, and growing competition from other NIEs is essentially shaped by the ‘politics of production’, at the structural, institutional, as well as organisational levels. With a noninterventionist state, the dominance of small local capital, the arms-length relationship between industrial and financial capital, and the underdevelopment of shop-floor unionism, Hong Kong's manufacturing responds to the changing business environment by developing flexible, labour-intensive production strategies. The success of such strategies hinges upon the ability of the industries to find niches in the world market of consumption which is increasingly characterised by rapid changes in styles. </jats:p>",

Subjective, experiential or linguistic uncertainties are selected from among various uncertainties, i.e., we treat fuzziness in generation expansion planning. The fuzziness can be divided into: (1) the fuzziness of decision making; and (2) the fuzziness of some planning parameters, such as load growth, fuel price, and so on. Both classes of fuzziness are integrated into a fuzzy decision based on fuzzy sets theory, and then the optimal generation mix can be determined by the Fuzzy Dynamic Programming (FDP) technique.</jats:p><jats:p>The proposed method, which is based on the dynamic programming technique, is extended by using the Bellman‐Zadeh maximizing decision. In the method, each generation technology and generation capacity are selected as a stage and state, respectively. The proposed method can easily accommodate not only the fuzziness but also many constraints of generation expansion planning, such as integer solutions of unit capacities, condition of existing units, and so on. Furthermore, the arbitrary shape of membership function can be used. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated on a typical power system model.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the manufacturing of innovative products requires lean and efficient production structures and stable production processes. But the way to lean production often suffers from the lack of objective performance criteria at shop floor level. We introduce new approaches for the logistics evaluation of production: monitoring and diagnostic methods support the analysis of production flows and order structures, allowing for a quantified turn to account of hidden potentials. By means of a dependency model combined with <jats:bold>AI</jats:bold> techniques, deviations are detected and even appropriate actions can be proposed. On this basis, company‐wide accepted information systems with illustrative graphics help to keep on‐track with consistent and realistic defined goals.</jats:p>",

Participating teachers were identified by administrators and peers as being effective in working with students with LD. Sixty teachers (20 elementary, 20 middle school, and 20 high school) completed a survey instrument assessing teachers' beliefs, skills, and practices. A subset of the initial cohort of teachers (n = 12) also participated in extensive interviews and classroom observations to provide additional insight into their adaptive instructional practices. Results indicated that even among skilled teachers gaps exist between beliefs, practices, and skills. Discussion focuses on teacher beliefs, skills, and practices and differences among teachers in the three grade groupings. </jats:p>",
