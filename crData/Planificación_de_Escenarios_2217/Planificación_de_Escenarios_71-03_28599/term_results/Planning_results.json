The dynamic extension of the location-allocation problem is shown to be of especial interest and significance. Two major approaches to the formulation and analysis of this dynamic problem are discussed. The first approach makes no attempt to anticipate future events and thus leads over the long-run to sub-optimal solutions. The second approach attempts fully to anticipate the future, and is formalized as a dynamic program. This second approach guarantees full optimality over the range of definition of the problem. Some numerical examples are presented. </jats:p>",

The aim of the research was to arrive at measurements of community preferences so that priority values could be quantified. The method relies on interviews with groups of people who have differing experiences of the variables under study. During the course of the interview, they are asked to play a priority evaluation ‘game’ using an electronic device built for that purpose. This approach extends traditional attitude survey measurements by allowing and ensuring that respondents understand the concept of trade-off preferences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many sets of observations have shown that intra-urban migration is generally oriented outwards, away from the City centre. Two major suggested explanations for this directional bias are Hoyt's concept of the sectoral structuring of socio-economic status residential patterns and Adams's ideas concerning the shape of the mental images of the City which its residents hold. The present paper presents an investigation of the mental maps of some sample respondents in the Christchurch urban area, New Zealand, which asks whether these images are influenced both by the perceived socioeconomic status of the various suburbs and a restricted view of the City. The results are encouraging and suggest that both Hoyt and Adams may have been correct in formulating their ideas. </jats:p><jats:p> It is becoming commonplace within urban research to criticise the widely-used models of intra-urban residential patterns as inappropriate. Not all would agree with this, however, so further testing is required. Among the more important aspects needing further investigation are the assumptions on which the models are based, since if these are irrelevant then the validity of the models is extremely unlikely. The aim of the present paper is such an inquiry with reference to Hoyt's sectoral model of the residential patterns of socio-economic status groups. </jats:p>",

The demand for transportation is incorporated into the equilibrium conditions of the household, and in turn the equilibrium conditions of the household are incorporated into the existing models of market equilibrium. The resulting relations are used to verify the characteristics of the prices of housing, rents, velocity, transportation costs, and densities. The implications of the model are consistent with the exponential form of the velocity function observed empirically by Angel and Hyman (1970). These implications illuminate the question of efficient resource allocation in improving the transportation system in the proximity of the CBD. Earlier explanations of the exponential density function given by Muth (1969) are verified and shown to be insufficient. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Overall balance between expected available resources and planned investment is not sufficient to ensure development with stability. Imbalances and inflationary pressures could develop as a result of inconsistencies between sector‐wise investment structure and the sector‐wise structure of saving. This means that the dichotomy between real and financial planning needs to be eliminated not only at the national level but at the sectoral levels as well, so that the sector‐wise investment pattern is consistent with the emerging structure of saving and the flow‐of‐funds. This presents an analysis of the structure of saving and flow‐of‐funds in India, shows how it is actually used for the purpose of financial planning, and attempts to derive a formalized technique of financial planning. Analysis of the structure of saving in India during 1954–1955 to 1967–1968 indicates the importance of the household sector as the net lending sector to the borrowing sectors, the government and the private corporate sectors. On the basis of the feasible sectoral rates of growth in income and the past trends in sectoral saving‐income ratios and household saving pattern with such modifications as are necessary in the light of expected changes in various policies, sector‐wise saving structure and the pattern of household sector saving are projected for the Fourth Plan period (1969–1974).</jats:p><jats:p>Then a flow‐of‐funds matrix is prepared to derive sector‐wise investment estimates as are consistent with the estimated structure of saving and the likely changes in the lending policies of the financial institutions.
