On one hand, garden programs are praised and supported as local action to serve environmental, social, and individual objectives. On the other hand, because they are perceived as opportunistic and temporary, community gardens are largely ignored in long-range planning. Socially constructed as public catalyst and private resource, community gardens illustrate unresolved tensions between planning as a profession and as a civic concern and between comprehensive planning and interim, local interventions. </jats:p>",

Included as well are studies of efforts to oppose discrimination, such as fair housing enforcement, fair share housing, and the open suburbs movement. The bibliography consists of 321 annotated entries in four groups: bibliographies and reference sources, monographs (pre-and post-1990), and journal articles, with author, geographic, and subject cross-references. </jats:p>",

These utopian sites were shaped as much by cold war concerns as by capitalist dreams, and as a result, they came to highlight tensions between the imperatives of commerce (which made malls possible) and the cooperative ones at the root of much utopian thought. This is seen in a close study of Gruen’s “shopper’s paradise,” Southdale—the first fully enclosed, temperature-controlled mall. </jats:p>",

This article creates a framework based in distributive justice for categorizing the existing research into cost-based and benefit-based claims of injustice.

This study uses data from two surveys conducted in the style of the Demographic and Health Surveys to compare patterns and predictors of racial differences in modern contraceptive use in the late‐ and post‐apartheid periods. Age‐group‐specific logistic regression models show that despite strong state family planning programs targeting black women, these women were less likely than nonblacks to practice modern contraception both before and after the political transition, even after controlling for large racial‐group differences in sociodemographic characteristics and the distribution of socioeconomic resources. Black, colored, Indian, and white women show different patterns of contraceptive use across their reproductive careers; in particular, young, unmarried black and colored women show high levels of use. Use of injectable contraceptives is also high among black and colored women, whereas injectables are not the primary method used by Indian or white women. These findings are discussed in light of their research and policy implications.</jats:p>",

Malawians' concerns about coercive population control imposed by a national government or international cabal provide a moral lens through which condoms and other health promotions are viewed, with unknown but probably negative impact on the use of condoms. The focus of the study is on the long shadow cast by population control because it is underresearched and, in fact, virtually unmentioned in most studies of health promotion, yet appears to be common if not ubiquitous. Moreover, this long shadow poses a distinct challenge to HIV‐prevention and intervention efforts. The data for the study were gathered by six Malawian research assistants in Balaka district, in southern Malawi, who kept journals over a period of three years in which they recorded conversations and everyday chats that they observed. These journals demonstrate that condoms do not arrive in communities as neutral, value‐free objects; rather they enter a social setting permeated with ideas about health, self‐protection, and danger. The lens of population control has proved to be both durable and flexible, providing a moral context in which both commodities and actors can be understood. Disentangling condoms from the symbolic nexus in which they are fused with disease, population control, and malevolence will be an ongoing challenge in the struggle to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.</jats:p>",

This study explores the extent and determinants of condom use within marital and cohabiting partnerships in KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa. In focus‐group discussions, in‐depth interviews, and individual survey responses, knowledge of condoms as an effective method of dual protection against the risk of pregnancy and disease was found to be high. Consistent with numerous other studies, this study found widespread disapproval of condom use within marriage. Only 14 percent of men and 17 per cent of women reported consistent or “occasional” condom use. Nevertheless, condom use is much higher among urban, more‐educated individuals than among their rural, less‐educated counterparts. Apart from education, perceived risk of HIV infection from the partner is the most powerful determinant of use within marital and cohabiting partnerships, particularly for women. Resistance to condoms within marital and cohabiting partnerships is not immutable, however, and women may not be as powerless to protect themselves as is often reported.</jats:p>",

The only compositional factors that increase the likelihood of birth limitation are having a member of the family with a higher level of education and community access to health services. Compositional factors by themselves do not explain Muslim and ethnic variations in contraceptive use and intentions. Village health and economic crises do not promote birth limitation. One normative economic factor—the practice of sons' inheritance of land from their fathers–considerably reduces the likelihood of contraceptive use, but does not account for religious and ethnic differentials. No evidence is found of a minority‐status effect on contraception. Exposure to ethnic and religious diversity in the community of residence substantially increases the likelihood of emergent birth limitation, especially among the predominant Muslim Silte population.</jats:p>",

In Atlanta, then, the residential segregation debate was influenced not just by the racial predilections of the white majority but by issues of class and property ownership as well, particularly as these issues played out within an aesthetic culture that continued City Beautiful’s celebration of large, ordered spaces. </jats:p>",

Eight focus‐group discussions were conducted with women and 28 interviews were held with men in four Kenyan towns. Ethnograph 5.0 computer software was used for the analysis of data. Women's primary incentive for engaging in such relationships is financial; men seek sexual gratification. Pressure from peers compels women to find older partners. Although some peers encourage such relationships, other groups, especially wives, same‐aged boyfriends, and parents, disapprove of them. Couples are preoccupied by the threat of discovery. STI/HIV risk perception is low, and couples rarely use condoms. Material gain, sexual gratification, emotional factors, and recognition from peers override concern for STI/HIV risk. Women's ability to negotiate condom use is compromised by age and economic disparities. Programmatic strategies include communicating information about such relationships' STI/HIV risk, promoting consistent condom use, decreasing peer pressure to pursue such relationships, and improving women's access to alternative sources of income.</jats:p>",

Their importance is, in general, more important in service settings because of the unique characteristics of services, particularly their intangibility and perishability, the inseparability of production and consumption, and heterogeneity in delivery quality. E‐businesses, whether offering products or services, ultimately share many service characteristics. For example, the benefits consumed are often not solely in the products purchased, which could have been purchased elsewhere, but rather in the intangible benefits of interaction with the website, i.e. saved time, convenience, and a reduced risk of dissatisfaction with an enhanced availability of information. This paper adapts Bitner's model to encounters in “cyberspace”, where the key characteristics of the service “product” are still present, with the result that, just as in the physical setting, stimuli may be planned and designed to engender approach behaviour. In so doing, it borrows from the motivational psychology construct of “flow”, a metaphor for optimal experiences.</jats:p>",

This is primarily driven by a number different environmental factors, such as relatively high ambient temperatures, humidity and cargo temperatures. Therefore, it is difficult to select a cost effective corrosion control design that addresses both the fabrication and operational aspects. This paper provides guidance on how to address the key corrosion protection design and fabrication issues and their corresponding impact on inspection, maintenance and repair during operation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Eventhough there are over 100 FPSOs operating worldwide, designing and implementing a cost optimal Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) system for a 20 year service still remains a major challenge. Primarily this is due to the fact that there is limited information available to facilitate the corrosion control design for a 20 year continuous service.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Newbuilding FPSOs have traditionally been purpose built for harsh environments, such as the North Sea, with converted FPSOs dominating the benign regions, such as Asia, Australia, Brazil and West Africa. As a result previous newbuildings have been designed with a major focus on fatigue and ultimate strength. However, it is forecast that 90% of future FPSOs will be installed in benign regions, with 60% of these being newbuildings/1/. Although these regions may be benign from a wave climate perspective they can impose significant corrosion control challenges relative to their North Sea counterparts. This is primarily a function of increased ambient temperatures and humidity.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Many of the current newbuilding 'mega' FPSOs will have production capacities in excess of 200,000 bopd and, therefore, any lost production time can have very significant economic consequences. Therefore, it is very important to design, implement and manage a proper corrosion protection design.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper provides some background and guidelines to facilitate the cost effective corrosion control design for newbuilding FPSO hulls. Specifically the focus is on:Identifying and quantifying the dominating factors related to corrosion control,How to select a cost effective corrosion protection system based on a combination of corrosion margins, coating systems and cathodic protection,Fabrication inspection related to the desired corrosion protection system,Providing an operation inspection, maintenance and repair strategies for selected corrosion protection system,Introducing a new RBI tool for IMR control of coated areas. Corrosion problems for converted vessels operating in the same regions, e.g. Brazil and West Aftrica, are well documented and selecting a cost-effective corrosion protection system can be equally difficult. Although this paper does not address converstions specifically, many of the basic concepts are still applicable.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Basic aspects of FPSO corrosion control</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>For carbon and low alloy steel FPSO hulls there are three principal types of corrosion to be considered/2/:General corrosion,Pitting corrosion, including \"in-line pitting attack\" and \"grooving corrosion\", andGalvanic corrosion (e.g. at welds).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides an introduction to three key concepts derived from chaos theory, with practical examples of each, which the authors believe can offer marketers an enriched understanding of the process by which they set out to construct an alternative future. A central tenet of chaos theory is that the future is inherently unpredictable in detail, but can be predicted in broad terms: what appears to be random (e.g. the unexpected results of a new marketing strategy) may turn out to be determined by a phenomenon known as an attractor. Marketing managers are setting out to “construct a future”. The broad outcomes of their actions may be predictable in general terms, but the path by which their organisations reach those outcomes, and the detailed stages through which they pass, are not – however sound their conventional marketing planning may be. Practising marketing managers may understandably have reservations about transferring concepts which have not yet been fully tested in the natural sciences, where they have their origin, into marketing planning. Nevertheless, many are not in fact unique to chaos theory. Therefore, they are used here as a metaphor, to encourage managers to take a different view of the strategic issues facing their organisations, and to question the conventional wisdom that executive action can be taken on the basis of extensive rational analysis, in the expectation that it will achieve predetermined objectives. This paper thereby offers novel insights into the process of redefining markets and the opportunities that they provide. The attractor metaphor holds out a number of challenges for innovative marketers, as well as some cautionary lessons.</jats:p>",

Caretaker resource accounts are a mass program, which should deliver a uniform package of resources to a large number of individuals. In contrast, life-planning insurance would provide individualized assistance to a small group of parents and will come into play only in catastrophic situations. The corollary is that life-planning insurance will inevitably require more bureaucracy to ascertain the facts about families’ particular situations and to craft appropriate remedies. There are ample precedents for this sort of program. Disability insurance for adults and children, workers’ compensation, special education—all require individualized determinations. None of these is a model of perfection, and indeed, the disability system requires major reform. Still, life-planning insurance represents an extension of familiar principles and not an entirely new enterprise.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Marketing practice is increasingly being affected by new technologies, creating opportunities and threats for marketing practitioners. Much of the literature has concentrated on effects external to the firm such as the Internet's impact on market structure, or new business paradigms. However, the research reported on here highlights how new technologies are acting as internal agents of change, forcing firms to adapt to new processes, which in turn are disrupting existing hierarchies. The paper makes the case that this disruption will create opportunities for marketers, who have hitherto failed to be seen as key players at board level. It has been argued that marketing's focus needs to move to internal management and facilitation in order to enable enterprise‐wide market orientation to emerge as the dominant ethos of the firm. The respondents’ often blunt views on marketers’ abilities to lead this change are reported, making rather sombre reading for the profession. A number of possible routes were explored through which marketers could address these weaknesses, improve their influence within the firm, and capitalise on the internal disruption caused by new technology.</jats:p>",

The paper reviews concept, design, planning, and implementation of the project and provides insight into technical and operational aspects which must be considered such as kicking off in soft formations, hole stability and shallow water flows. This unique combination of available technology resulted in reduced operational time and lower costs than originally planned. The paper demonstrates the viability of such combinations of activities for similar deepwater development projects.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Matterhorn platform is located in Mississippi Canyon, Block 243, and is in approximately 2850' of water. The field objectives are Plio-Pleistocene age sands ranging in depth from 3,000' to 7,500' below mud line. Five principal pay sands were identified during the exploration phase. The initial development plan included drilling a total of 8 wells : 7 \"dry tree\" wells at a central location and a subsea water injection well approximately a mile from the central location. The wells would be drilled to TD using a semi submersible drilling rig and temporarily abandoned after running and cementing production casing/liner. After releasing the drilling rig, a tension leg platform (TLP) would be installed on the central well cluster, and the wells completed individually after running the production risers (Fig 1). This central well cluster would be located with the #1 exploration well within the pattern to allow re-entering the well, if feasible, for more economical field development. The design resulted in the well spacing being on only 25' centers at the mud line.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper will review the process which was used to successfully drill the required development wells. It will specifically review two processes, 1) batch drilling which significantly helped to reduce time and cost, and 2) kicking off in the upper hole which was required to reach the shallower upper intervals. Nonproductive/nonplanned time which impacted the project will also be presented. Finally, time and costs savings as a result of the improvements and combination of technical planning will be shown.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Despite the relatively simple geology and normal reservoir characteristics, several drilling challenges were foreseen for this project. Because of the number of wells to be drilled, several time saving measures could be implemented in order to reduce the overall cost of the project. Some of these measures posed added risk for a single well; however the techniques learned could potentially produce substantial savings on the subsequent wells. Many of the techniques employed posed no additional risk to the project.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Shallow water flows were experienced on two of the exploration wells, and although they were not severe, contingency plans had to be made to deal with a severe flow due to the unpredictability of these events.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Because of the planned wellbore architecture, all of the wells were deviated with some of the wells requiring significant horizontal departure. Because of this architecture, aggressive build rates in the upper (30\") section of the wells would be required for several wells. In addition, due to the complex completions planned for each well, the wells needed to be within specified maximum hole angles at the top of the upper intervals for completions needs (Fig. 2).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nepal has a tremendous potentiality of water-resources ranking only second in the world and it has also a rich natural wealth like biodiversity, lofty Himalayas, scenic valleys and mountains among others. It has a hardworking and patriotic workforce. However, it is limited by heavily diverse topography and fragile geological conditions coupled with extensive poverty and abundant illiteracy. The thrust of the development problem in Nepal is “poor management”. Simply said, management is a cycle of planning, implementation, monitoring/evaluation and re-planning. One of the weaknesses of the Nepalese management process is the lack of adequate geographic information in decision-making thus resulting in poor-management. To support this gap, His Majesty’s Government of Nepal initiated National Geographic information Infrastructure Programme (NGIIP) since 2002. This programme is the extension of the digital mapping programme of Survey Department, which was initiated in 1996.\nNepal is a member of the Global Mapping community. The NGII programme will support in the development of a spatial data infrastructure and a geographic information system at the national level. NGII Programme has the overall objectives of strengthening planning and resource management in Nepal and its specific objectives are to develop a platform to facilitate data sharing among Survey Department, Central Bureau of Statistics and participating agencies. As part of its contribution to the NGIIP, Survey Department provides spatial data ranging from 1:25,000 to 1:1Million. To facilitate the success of the NGII initiatives several approaches have been undertaken. Some of them are: the identification of the key players and developing a stakeholders’ institutional coordination mechanism, the situational analysis and needs assessment, developing an implementation strategy, and conceptualisation of a NGII centre of excellence for promoting sustainability.\nThe programme has multiple facets like: fundamental- and meta- database production, technology installation and human resource development, and institution building components including standards and processes. The details are explained. Least developed countries like Nepal are entangled with the vicious circle of lack of information, poor planning, poor performance, and subsequent lack of resources for additional funding for information. A strong will and commitment is necessary to make a breakthrough. This is a time in Nepal, when a breakthrough is underway with the launching of a NGII programme. The programme has a promising future; but it being on a very initial phase, its effectiveness cannot be evaluated as yet.</jats:p>"

Marketing activity may affect the performance of a company's own product and that of its competitors not only within a single time horizon but also over several extended periods. Starting from a static market‐share analysis model, the dynamic relationships of market shares between competitive brands are described by multiplicative competitive interaction (MCI) time‐series models, in which the problem of logical consistency for estimated shares is resolved. A Bayesian shrinkage estimator solution is applied to the further problem of model‐induced collinearity in cross‐differential MCI models. Dynamic elasticity is defined and used to measure the delayed and long‐term effects of marketing mix variables on market shares. The dynamic relationships of future market shares are predicted by means of predictive density. Strategic simulations are conducted under several scenarios for marketing planning. It is argued that the new dynamic model proposed here, applied to daily national or store tracking data, provides useful insights into dynamic competitive relationships in the marketplace, to the benefit of corporate planners, marketing directors, brand managers and retail strategists.</jats:p>",

With more than 250 wells having been completed using solid expandable tubulars, this technology has made the transition from novel concept to accepted downhole application. As the oil and gas industry continues to push into deeper water, and the cost of wells increases, it is imperative that every effort be made to drill wells to depth as quickly and efficiently as possible. An obvious challenge for all operators to overcome is to reduce or eliminate flat time on the drilling curve.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper will explore how the application of solid expandable tubulars enables drillers to reduce both the flat time on a drilling curve and steepen the angle of the curve. The result of this synthesis will enable the operator to reach total depth (TD) in less time. A probabilistic approach will be used to demonstrate the value of expandables.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper presents case studies where solid expandable tubulars have reduced or eliminated flat time on the drilling curve and show how the technology has enabled faster drilling of wells. Decision analysis will be used to demonstrate how solid expandable tubular technology can be deployed to reduce costs significantly when an operator faces a myriad of well problems. Through the use of expandables, operators have shown that many technical challenges can be overcome in a cost effective manner. Solid expandable tubulars have enabled a step change in how wells are drilled. This paper addresses several ways in which those changes have occurred and how the technology continues to move forward.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Operators are all too familiar with the flat time on the drilling curve that occurs on drilling projects due to changing bits, setting casing strings, fighting lost returns, and so on.

Based on the experience of various operators in different drilling environments, planning in the use of solid expandable tubulars can be a key to reducing flat time.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>The Drilling Curve</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The drilling curve has been around for years. When wells are in the Authority for Expenditure (AFE) generation stage, the curve is in its ideal form, steep with few horizontal lines, all of which are necessary products of the drilling process; rigging up, installing blowout preventers, running casing, cementing, etc. As the actual drilling of the well progresses, in many cases the actual curve starts to diverge from the ideal, with the slope of the curve flattening. As the curve flattens, actual cost of the well versus the AFE starts to diverge as well. In many cases this flattening of the curve is a direct result of fighting mud losses, stuck pipe, or any of a myriad of other issues that prevent rigs from making hole.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

More recently, the focus of urban scholarship on L.A. has come to include topics such as the heterogeneous cultural and spatial politics of identity, political struggles over urban spaces, and the unmer challenges of developing an ecologically sustainable urban theory and practice. In a comparative transatlantic perspective, an L.A. case study can help to identify central dynamics and core challenges in contemporary and future urban development. Based on a systematic analysis of urban development processes in L.A., debates about the “Americanization” of European or German cities can be criticised as tending to be overtly simplified and ideologically totalizing.</jats:p>"

The top three reasons for turnover are low salary, lack of career path, and burnout. On average, it costs about $10 to a call center for each call, and the cost to bring on a new agent is more than $6,000. The author treats call centers as knowledge-intensive operations that are characterized by extensive knowledge required for each agent, combines control theory and chance-constrained programming in a model for workforce planning that allows for agent learning, and derives steady state workforce levels for different knowledge groups within the call center to minimize total labor-related costs. The objective is to meet stochastic demands with a desired service level. The author applies his model to an actual call center situation in the high-tech industry with adjusted data and discusses the managerial implications. </jats:p>",

The subdivision of the church into macroelements consists of the identification of architectonic elements in which the seismic behavior is almost independent from the rest of the structure (façade, apse, dome, bell tower, etc.). For each macroelement, by considering its typology and connection to the rest of the church, it is possible to identify the damage modes and the collapse mechanisms. During inspection operations, the surveyors must indicate: (a) the actual macroelements; (b) the damage level; and (c) the vulnerability of the church to that mechanism, related to some specific details of construction. From these data a damage score is defined, which is a number from 0 to 1, obtained as a normalized mean of the damage grades in each mechanism. The analysis of the collected data (more than 1,000 churches in Umbria) allows the definition of the correlation between macroseismic intensity and damage. </jats:p>",

Departures of senior personnel occur for a variety of reasons and are often unexpected. Succession planning for a change in the executives of a closely held business presents both income tax and transfer tax issues. Recent tax law changes have reduced the tax rate on dividends and can affect the cash flow of a company. Other tax issues will affect a company, the executives who are leaving, and the new leadership. Stock options, the type of corporation setup, and other factors can create advantages or disadvantages for a company. In closely held businesses, many executives are family members.

(What we often call “autism” comprises a range of related conditions.) Like many children with autism, Sarah seemed typical in her development until she became a toddler. Her parents became a bit concerned as Sarah lagged in language acquisition and missed other developmental milestones, but they did not suspect any serious problem. When Sarah was 3, the doctors diagnosed her as autistic, and the news turned her parents’ lives upside down. They felt crushed, but they did not have time to indulge their own emotions, because early intervention is crucial for children on the autistic spectrum. All of a sudden, Sarah’s parents had to navigate the special education system to get the best possible therapy for her. And they had to educate themselves, fast, about autism, so that they could act as Sarah’s advocate with the special-education authorities.</jats:p>",

This study distinguishes between planning intervals used for data collection and intervals used for scheduling employees. This distinction is relevant because it is not necessary for the two interval types to be of the same duration. The results of a simulation experiment show that both increased variability in the customer-arrival rate and high mean customer-arrival rates work to reduce the ideal length of both data-collection and schedule-development intervals. In fact, with a mean arrival rate of five customers per minute, the most profitable labor schedules originated with a five-minute data-collection interval combined with a five-minute schedule-development interval. At present, because of the paucity of procedures that can accommodate such brief intervals, managers will find fifteen-minute data-collection and schedule development intervals generally to be the most effective. </jats:p>",

A ‘Goal Planning Progress’ form was also used to specifically detail the goal planning process. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: Across the 65 patients, 396 goal planning meetings were held with 6176 goals set in total. Seventy-two per cent of the goals set at the first goal planning meeting were achieved by the second meeting. The rate of achievement at subsequent meetings was 68%. Significant differences in the number of planned rehabilitation days, number of goal planning meetings, and goals set were identified between injury categories. Significant positive correlations were found between the number of goals set and achievement, as measured by the NAC, in certain rehabilitation domains. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that the Needs Assessment and Goal Planning framework is effective in planning SCI rehabilitation. The capacity of this goal planning system to reflect individual need has also been established.

This is also true for South Africa, a country that harbours remarkably rich biota. The concept of bioregional planning prominently includes aspects such as informed conservation planning and the sustainable use of biodiversity, among a range of other equally important environmental considerations. This paper argues that support of on–going, basic taxonomic studies in bioregions are critically important to ensure the comprehensive and accurate documentation and inventorying of biodiversity at any scale. As such, taxonomists fulfill an essential role in the initial and follow–up phases of bioregional planning processes. Insufficient attention to checklisting activities will severely hamper the implementation of workable bioregional plans.</jats:p>",

Two features characterize the interaction of the state and the public via this campaign: a lack of public involvement, and the construction of the citizen as a passive consumer. The author emphasizes a tension that exists between two readings of the consumer citizen: the pliable figure who listens to neoliberal bottom-line arguments, and the political economic actor who identifies not with consumerism but with political change. Citizens thus cannot be wholly embodied by constructions such as the consumer, and consumerist activism has potential. Citizens, though often interpellated as consumers, can position themselves as reasoning publics who see climate change, their cities, and themselves in relational perspective. The author enlists Foucauldian and deliberative-democracy theory to explore the making of citizens through the Cities for Climate Protection campaign. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last few decades a certain fragmentation of economy and society has taken place on a global scale. A related observation is that the marketplace for landed property has become more complex, involving more actors and informal networks. The consequence is a cultural and behavioural reorientation of the conceptual model of property-value formation, which traditionally is anchored in equilibrium economics. This postulate is especially relevant for the residential sector as households and their preferences, as well as external factors forcing their mobility, are factors that contribute to the formation of house prices. However, from the early 1970s there was literature that pointed to a multidimensional theoretical framework on aesthetic and other values that ‘make the place’. Using more multiple and idiosyncratic perspectives of value conceptualisation is therefore not a completely new trend, only a neglected line of research. With these potentially powerful formulations as the background, this contribution presents evidence of property-value formation from the 1990s Helsinki housing market. Using the analytic hierarchy process, quality ranks for different bundles of locational attributes were generated based on interactive data, and compared with actual market-outcome data. Both the theoretical and the empirical material compiled for this paper suggest that, to remain a valid concept, equilibrium needs to be treated at the level of market price together with stated actor choice—not just on the level of the first concept. </jats:p>",

A leg swing motion is created by moving the pelvis without contact with the legs. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem for an underactuated articulated chain. The optimal control problem is converted into a discrete parameter optimization and an efficient gradient-based algorithm is used to solve it. Motion capture data from an unimpaired human subject is compared to the simulation results from the dynamic motion optimization. Our results suggest that it is feasible to drive repetitive stepping on a treadmill by a paralyzed person by assisting in torso movement alone. The optimized, pelvic motion strategies are comparable to “hip-hiking” gait strategies used by people with lower limb prostheses or hemiparesis.

Interviews were conducted with 160 women who experienced violence from an intimate partner and had at least one child aged 5 to 12. Women employed numerous and diverse strategies in attempting to keep themselves and their children safe. Their choices depended on several contextual factors, including severity of violence and relationship with assailant. Although contacting domestic violence programs and staying at domestic violence shelters were most likely to improve women’s situations, no strategies were universally effective. Clusters of safety planning strategies were identified to further understand women’s actions. Women who experienced the most violence and had assailants who engaged in the most behaviors indicative of potential lethality were most actively engaged in safety planning but remained in serious danger. These findings highlight the importance of community response and support in protecting survivors and holding assailants accountable. </jats:p>",

In particular, we exploit a minimum jerk approach to define the trajectory in the Cartesian space. Then, cubic splines are adopted in the joint space. The redundancy problem arising from the presence of three links is solved by assuming that there is a constant ratio between the second and the third joint motion. The value of the proportional constant is determined by minimizing the maximum jerk in the joint space. It is found that this constant value can be suboptimally but effectively set to one for all the movements. This approach guarantees a natural movement of the finger as well as reduced vibrations in the mechanical structure and increased control performances. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

Selection of environmental hazards, relevant datasets, and their attribution to standard small-area geography using a geographic information system are described. Four indices for 1991 Census wards are proposed, relating to ambient air quality, atmospheric chemical releases from large-scale industrial processes, landfills, and sites registered under Control of Major Accident Hazard regulations. Ecological measures of association between these indices and the Carstairs material deprivation index and its components are presented in the context of variations by urban–rural status. Based on these analyses, the study generally supports previous findings of environmental inequity in England and Wales, but highlights that associations are dependent on the environmental and deprivation measures under consideration, and urban–rural context. It is proposed that environmental indices such as those described here should be included in considerations of area deprivation, could assist with equitable environmental decisionmaking and planning, and that measures of environmental inequity could be considered as indicators of progress towards sustainable development. </jats:p>",

We apply the procedure to a specific enclave of the chemical and basic industry sectors, which has been and still is of special significance for the development of the region. Because we feel that interdependency effects should be adequately captured, we rely on a 1995 regional social accounting matrix (SAM) of Andalusia, Spain, to establish the empirical structural support for the analysis. We proceed by setting up a linear SAM model to obtain extended multipliers, then we decompose them in three categories of effects (direct, indirect, and induced) under different hypotheses about the classification of endogenous and exogenous sectors. The decomposed multipliers are then apportioned to measure and distinguish the effects on the economic enclave. The results are seen to be quite robust to the exogeneity assumptions. </jats:p>",

Three normative practices which are associated with partnership working—representativeness; consensus-based decisionmaking; and bureaucratic styles of working—are examined in relation to the experiences of two UK case-study localities in receipt of Single Regeneration Budget funding. The findings reflect a complex interaction between acceptance and noncompliance with these norms by community organisations which leads to a variety of outcomes for individual community representatives and for relations between community groups and regeneration partnership boards. In conclusion, it is argued that protecting the independence of local organisations can allow for opposition to partnership-based decisions but that this risks undermining holistic or strategic approaches to social problems. The actions of some community organisations in these two localities suggests that, although some aspects of partnership working are increasingly institutionalised within community sectors, organisations remain alert to opportunities to subvert these norms to further their own aspirations. </jats:p>",

In particular, following a tender process whereby the authors provided advice on alternative means of achieving the agency's objectives, the authors were contracted through the University of Western Australia's Institute for Regional Development to mount an on‐line course designed for agency officers.</jats:p><jats:p>While students have responded positively to the course content, a number of problems relating to the delivery of this course has emerged. They include the feeling of isolation by the students, problems with web designer over educational philosophies, the inordinate amount of time involved in writing and delivering the course, and unresolved questions relating to intellectual property. The question still remains as to whether the course will achieve the primary underlying objective of attaining sustainable agricultural development.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The entropy-maximixing model has been applied with varying degrees of success in the analysis and planning of origin – destination types of spatial interaction. Although theoretical underpinnings and solution methods have been developed over the years, there are still outstanding problems that need to be thoroughly investigated. From the practical point of view, solving this model directly and in real time has high theoretical and pragmatic value. In this paper we propose a neural network for solving the dual problem of this model in real time. The size of the proposed network is very small and its structure is very simple, so it can be implemented in hardware. From the theoretical perspective, we solve the seldom investigated issue of convergence to the optimal solution of the entropy-maximising model. We strictly prove that the proposed dual neural network is Lyapunov stable and that each of its trajectories can converge asymptotically to an exact solution of the dual problem. The validity and transient behaviour of the proposed neural network are demonstrated by numerical examples. It is also demonstrated that the proposed network approach renders for the first time a tight integration of an entropy-maximising model and a neural network, and offers a general representation and solution to a large variety of entropy-maximising models. </jats:p>",

A broad freeway net is then developed through a new α‐<jats:italic>MID</jats:italic>(maximal inscribed discs) concept. A potential function is assigned to the net to form an obstacle‐free network of valleys. Afterwards we take advantage of a bidirectional search, where the visibility graph and potential field modules execute alternately from both start and goal configurations. A<jats:italic>steepest descent mildest ascent</jats:italic>search technique is used for local planning and avoiding local minima. The algorithm provides a parametric tradeoff between safest and shortest paths and generally yields shorter paths than the Voronoi and potential field methods, and faster than the visibility graph.

The appropriate setting for the beamlet size is critical to the outcome of IMRT planning. With too small beamlets the dose calculation can be inaccurate, and the resulting intensity profiles can be unnecessarily complex and difficult to generate. Relatively simple intensity profiles can be obtained using large beamlets. However, this may compromise the conformity of the dose distribution. In this paper we present a method, in which multiple beamlet matrices displaced from each other by a shift in MLC leaf travel direction are used instead of the single beamlet matrix per beam in a conventional method, to achieve finer spatial resolution for the intensity distribution than the given beamlet size. Two test cases were used to assess the method by the resultant DVHs and dose distributions and characteristic indices of the intensity profiles. The results show that this method can produce optimized dose distributions that are similar to those produced by the conventional inverse planning method with the benefit of smoother intensity profiles that are easier to deliver with a computer controlled MLC.</jats:p>",

It offers a general description of downtown Mexico City, its physical and social character, and the foreign and domestic reference points used to build the city in the period of revolutionary transition when competing views about downtown changed the profession of planning and the city itself. The article suggests that the existence of conflictive views of the city advanced by different planning elites impeded any real consensus on government efforts to develop downtown. This owed in no small part to the fact that the low-income, market, and trading-centered activities of downtown residents did not figure into modernist views of city planners, conservative and progressive alike. As downtown areas fell out of the urban planning picture, its populations were neglected, its physical spaces deteriorated, its social composition narrowed, and its so-called publicity became ever more circumscribed. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the realization and visualization of ball passing, a low level move-to-ball behavior of a soccer robot, in a robot soccer game.

We build a control command driven mobile robot motion simulator with a controller and dynamics of mobile robots, not only nonholonomic kinematic constraints to simulate the motion of a soccer robot driven by wheels torques to generate wheels accelerations, to update the robot position and orientation at successive time instants. Kick motion follows a physical law, and a simplified collision check and response model is utilized for the efficient detection of the hitting a robot with the ball or other robots. The realization of specific ball passing strategy to drive each soccer robot in a position to receive a pass includes three levels of organization, coordination, and execution: careful integrated design of a dynamic formation and role change scheme, ball position estimation, and coordinated trajectory (i.e. path and velocity) planning and tracking control. Simulations are performed to illustrate the feasibility of the realization of ball passing among three robots, implemented by a software program for coordinated trajectory planning and tracking control in the developed simulator.</jats:p>",

The model represents, in network form, the system made of the two rivers and their various consumption, supply, and transshipment nodes, and accounts for evaporation and return flows. The constraints include water-conservation balances and maximum and minimum water consumption. The model is used to assess the economic consequences of various cooperation and noncooperation strategies that may be adopted by the riparian countries. Cooperative game-theory concepts (core and Shapley value) are used to identify stable water allocations, under which all three countries find it beneficial to cooperate. The results suggest that an allocation of the total benefits exists, under various scenarios of future energy prices and agricultural productivities, that makes this global cooperation attractive to all countries.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A CAD assembly model is a collection of components, comprised recursively of various levels of individual parts and sub-assembly models. Although the overall geometry in the CAD assembly model accurately represents the final finished product, this model is often meaningless from a manufacturing planning and simulation point of view. The grouping of the components into sub-assemblies and the assembly sequence implied by the CAD model does not accurately represent the manufacturing/assembly sequence or process. Reordering, regrouping, and modifying existing sub-assemblies, or creating new sub-assemblies in the CAD model may be needed to ensure this correspondence for simulation or assembly planning tools that derive the manufacturing sequence directly from the CAD system. Although this task can be performed using the existing functionality of the CAD system, it quickly becomes unwieldy for large industry-grade models due to the assembly constraints and relationships in place during the model creation. In industry today, there are several digital mockup and assembly planning tools that greatly outstrip the ability of CAD systems in loading complete models and creating assembly plans. Methods to organize the CAD model assembly quickly and easily for use in these systems, and to record the “as manufactured” assembly in the CAD data format are needed to close the loop and ease the transfer, storage, and maintenance of model data between the CAD systems, PDM systems, and these new age planning and mockup systems. In this paper, a new hybrid method is proposed to provide this functionality. Of key significance is the fact that using this approach, polygonal representations of any new or modified sub-assemblies designated in the reorganized hierarchy can be produced and that the original constraints used in the original assembly are transformed in a consistent manner to the new components. In addition, corresponding property files for the new components can be created for use in the assembly planning tool. In order to validate this hybrid approach, the time required to rearrange the assembly hierarchy and output the required information using both methods are compared–1) the traditional method using the CAD system alone, and 2) the new hybrid system. A statistical analysis using three treatment factors indicates that if the number of components is more than 15, then it is far more efficient to use the hybrid method over the CAD system by itself. This hybrid method implementation has now been used very successfully in virtual assembly simulations of many industry models, some with several hundred components, provided by various industry partners.</jats:p>",

To investigate these determinants, a sequential hurdle model is estimated in which people first decide to work and then decide to divide total labor supply in at-home and out-of-home labor supply. To correct for possible endogeneity, the modem variable is estimated by means of instrumental variables. When we consider only office hours, possession of ICT facilities at home stimulates both at-home and out-of-home labor supply. Thus, the two may be called complements from the ICT perspective. However, outside office hours, modem possession leads to less work out of home. During this part of the day the time worked less on the job is partly substituted by work at home. Thus, during this part of the week we find that substitution dominates. However, because labor supply during office hours dominates labor supply during the rest of the week we find complementarity as the main feature of overall labor supply. These results underline the importance of timing issues. </jats:p>",

A case study method of investigation was used, and the experiences of five manufacturing companies were documented. Also, this study explores and proposes an ERP system selection process and a cost‐based business case approach. The critical factors in the adoption of ERP are identified as learning from the experiences of others, appointing a process innovator, establishing committees and project teams, training and providing technical support for the users, and implementing appropriate changes to the organizational structure and managerial responsibilities. For more effective ERP implementations, we advise building a supportive culture and environment with a strong emphasis on human and organizational aspects. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since its release in the mid-1990s, close to 37 000 facilities have been certified to ISO 14001, the international voluntary standard for environmental management systems. Yet, despite claims that the standard can be readily adapted to very different corporate and geographic settings, its take-up has been highly geographically variable. This paper contributes to a growing body of work concerned with explaining the uneven diffusion of ISO 14001 at the global level. Drawing from the existing theoretical and empirical literature we develop a series of hypotheses about how various economic, market, and regulatory factors influence the national count of ISO 14001 certifications. These hypotheses are then tested using econometric estimation techniques with data for a panel of 142 developed and developing countries. We find that per capita ISO 14001 counts are positively correlated with income per capita, stock of foreign direct investment, exports of goods and services to Europe and Japan, and pressure from civil society. Conversely, productivity and levels of state intervention are negatively correlated. The paper finishes by offering a number of recommendations to policymakers concerned with accelerating the diffusion of voluntary environmental standards. </jats:p>",

In order to plan for sustainable transport development, there is a need to develop indicators for assessing and monitoring transport development. In this paper we develop a sustainable transport development indicator by making use of the concepts of accessibility and geographical information systems. A modal accessibility gap index is proposed, which is calculated by finding the difference between the accessibility indices of public and private transport, which are in turn determined by accessibilities to opportunities such as the number of population, jobs, shops, and schools by public and private transport. Considering energy-efficiency, public transport will achieve sustainable transport more than private transport. A higher accessibility gap may mean more sustainable development. In the present study, the accessibility gap of Hong Kong in 1991 is compared with that in 1996 to examine whether transport development has been more sustainable. We also discuss how to use the accessibility gap indicator to test land-use and transport-development policies and scenarios to determine the more sustainable ones. </jats:p>",

In this system, named <jats:styled-content>Ballista</jats:styled-content>, the orientation (table and gantry), the wedge filter and the field weights are simultaneously optimized for every beam. An interesting feature is that the system is coupled to <jats:styled-content>Pinnacle</jats:styled-content><jats:sup>3</jats:sup> by means of the <jats:styled-content>PinnComm</jats:styled-content> interface, and uses its convolution dose calculation engine. A fully automatic MLC segmentation algorithm is also included. The plan evaluation is based on a quasi‐random sampling and on a quadratic objective function with penalty‐like constraints. For efficiency, optimal wedge angles and wedge orientations are determined using the concept of the super‐omni wedge. A bound‐constrained quasi‐Newton algorithm performs field weight optimization, while a fast simulated annealing algorithm selects the optimal beam orientations. Moreover, in order to generate directly deliverable plans, the following practical considerations have been incorporated in the system: collision between the gantry and the table as well as avoidance of the radio‐opaque elements of a table top. We illustrate the performance of the new system on two patients. In a rhabdomyosarcoma case, the system generated plans improving both the target coverage and the sparing of the parotide, as compared to a manually designed plan. In the second case presented, the system successfully produced an adequate plan for the treatment of the prostate while avoiding both hip prostheses. For the many cases where full IMRT may not be necessary, the system efficiently generates satisfactory plans meeting the clinical objectives, while keeping the treatment verification much simpler.</jats:p>",

This paper describes how one Regional Office of the Department of Health, with CABG and PTCA rates of around half the NSF target levels, designed a strategy to plan rationally to meet the derived population need for these procedures. A bottom-up needs assessment model was used to predict the population need for these procedures for the Eastern Region of the UK. The Excel-based model took account of the effects of demographic change, anticipated reduction in incidence of heart disease due to primary prevention programmes and the expected improvement in cardiology and cardiac surgery technologies. The model predicted that excess procedures would be required across the region over the next 20 years. Further access study modelling was used to determine the best location for additional tertiary cardiac centres. Further, a commissioning tool was produced that could compare the predicted need, including additional procedures needed to meet waiting list targets, with capacity available from a range of providers. These tools have been used successfully in the Eastern Region to increase the regional revascularization rates from 371 pmp CABG and 322 pmp PTCA in 2000 to planned rates of 453 pmp CABG and 447 pmp PTCA in 2002 / 2003, to recommend the building of a new tertiary cardiac centre in Essex in the next decade and to inform the commissioning of revascularization rates in three coronary heart disease networks. </jats:p>",

Although often advanced, based on observations that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients exhibit hypokinesia in the absence of significant directional errors, this hypothesis has been challenged by a recent alternative, that parkinsonian hypometria could be caused by dysfunction of on‐line feedback loops. To re‐evaluate this issue, we conducted two successive experiments. In the first experiment we assumed that if BG are involved in extent planning then PD patients (who exhibit a major dysfunction within the BG network) should exhibit a preserved ability to use a direction precue with respect to normals, but an impaired ability to use an amplitude precue. Results were compatible with this prediction. Because this evidence did not prove conclusively that the BG is involved in amplitude planning (functional deficits are not restricted to the BG network in PD), a second experiment was conducted using positron emission tomography (PET). We hypothesized that if the BG is important for planning movement amplitude, a task requiring increased amplitude planning should produce increased activation in the BG network. In agreement with this prediction, we observed enhanced activation of BG structures under a precue condition that emphasized extent planning in comparison with conditions that emphasized direction planning or no planning. Considered together, our results are consistent with the idea that BG is directly involved in the planning of movement amplitude or of factors that covary with that parameter.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In treatment planning in a heavy particle cancer radiation facility which is utilized by multiple remote medical institutions, it is necessary to calculate accurately the three‐dimensional dose distribution within the body of the patient in order to achieve efficient treatment. However, this presents a problem, since a long processing time is needed, which degrades the efficiency of treatment planning. In order to handle this problem, the authors used a cluster system in which Alpha 21164A CPUs were connected over a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet to speed up the dose distribution calculation (Dose) and digital reconstructed X‐ray image regeneration (DRR) by parallel processing. Parallel calculation is performed by segmenting the calculation area. The communication time among processors is reduced by data compression, and the load is made uniform by assigning more than one area to a processor. As a result of evaluation experiments, calculations performed iteratively by varying parameters at the actual site of medical care were accelerated by using 10 processors, by a factor of 7 for Dose, and 9 for DRR. In other words, the speed was improved in proportion to the number of processors. This implies that processing which has required several tens of seconds can now be handled in 3 to 6 seconds, which is short enough for the user to wait before the terminal. The objective is to make the system usable by multiple remote medical institutions by refining system functions such as fault recovery in order to ensure its reliability as a calculation server. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Germination characteristics are important for the establishment success of grass species. The objective of this study was to study the variation in germination characteristics within and among cultivars in three grass species by use of a curve‐fitting procedure. The study included 20 seed lots of slender creeping red fescue (<jats:italic>Festuca rubra</jats:italic> L. var. <jats:italic>littoralis</jats:italic> Vasey), 19 lots of perennial ryegrass (<jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic> L.), and 16 lots of Kentucky bluegrass (<jats:italic>Poa pratensis</jats:italic> L.), and the seed lots represented four, four, and five cultivars, respectively. Seeds of each seed lot were germinated in standard tests, and germination was recorded daily. Germination time courses were described for each replicate of each seed lot, using a generalized hyperbolic multinomial distribution. The function efficiently described all observed germination time courses, and germination was summarized as three characteristics of biological significance: final germination percentage (FGP), mean germination time (MGT), and time from 25 to 75% germination (T<jats:sub>25‐75</jats:sub>). For each of the characteristics, an ANOVA was performed. Cultivar differences were tested against variation between seed lots within cultivars. Within all three species, there were significant cultivar differences in FGP, and cultivars of red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass also differed significantly in MGT and T<jats:sub>25‐75</jats:sub> Cultivar variation was 53 to 99% larger than seed lot variation within cultivars, but in some cases, seed lots within cultivars differed considerably in germination characteristics. Cultivars should, therefore, be represented by more than one seed lot and cultivar differences should be tested against seed lot differences to get valid test results.</jats:p>",

In this study, we have investigated the impact of catechol‐O‐methyl‐transferase (COMT) val<jats:sup>158</jats:sup>met polymorphisms on performance of the Tower of London (TOL) test of planning by PD patients. Motor and cognitive assessments were performed on 288 patients as part of a population‐based study of PD. These patients were subsequently genotyped for the COMT val<jats:sup>158</jats:sup>met polymorphism. Patients with high activity COMT genotypes performed significantly better at the TOL task than those with low activity genotypes. Subgroup analyses suggest that this effect is greatest in patients exposed to dopaminergic agents. We hypothesise that the inferior performance in patients with the low activity COMT genotype is attributable to a state of relative hyperdopaminergic activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with that in the striatum. We suggest that polymorphisms of common genes, which regulate central nervous system dopaminergic transmission, can influence some of the phenotypic manifestations of PD. © 2004 Movement Disorder Society</jats:p>",

The location of obstacles is known in advance. In DNA computing, Watson-Crick pairing is used to find this trajectory. DNA sequences representing locations of obstacles are removed in this process. The shortest DNA molecule that begins with the start section and terminates with the goal section represents the shortest trajectory avoiding obstacles in the robot’s work area.

The real-time collision-free robot trajectory is generated by a topologically organized neural network, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized by a shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley’s biological membrane equation. The dynamically changing environment is represented by the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network, where the neural activity propagation is subject to the nonholonomic kinematic constraint of the mobile robot. The tracking velocities for the mobile robot are generated by a novel neural dynamics based controller, which is based on two shunting equations and the conventional backstepping technique. Unlike the conventional backstepping controllers suffer from sharp jumps, the proposed tracking controller can generate smooth and continuous commands. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.</jats:p>",
