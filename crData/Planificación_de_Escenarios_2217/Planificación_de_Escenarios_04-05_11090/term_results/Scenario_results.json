      "abstract": "<jats:p> Seaports are critical nodes in regional transportation networks and can have important impact to the local economy. During recent earthquakes, seaports have demonstrated that they can be highly vulnerable to seismic motion and associated ground failures, and their poor seismic performance has resulted in billions of dollars of losses. In order to make informed decisions concerning the design, expansion, and retrofit of port facilities, it is important to forecast the economic and operational outcome after such events. In this paper, the authors present a methodology to assess probabilistically the operational losses in multiterminal container ports after scenario earthquakes via simulation. For this purpose, a port operations simulation model is developed and is applied to various single and multiterminal examples. It is shown that parameters like the total downtime and the correlation between the damage states in different structures can significantly affect the losses. It is also shown that proper post-earthquake operation strategies can minimize the total operational loss. </jats:p>",

Using a Fourier decomposition into stationary and propagating components of several oceanic and atmospheric variables, we show that most of the Antarctic interannual variability can be explained by a geographically phase‐locked standing wave train linked to tropical ENSO episodes. This ENSO‐modulated quasi‐stationary variability is not zonally uniform, rather, the strongest ENSO impact is consistently concentrated in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The eastward propagating wave component is found to be not only minor (25% of variability) but also intermittent in phase, yielding little support for the so‐called Antarctic Circumpolar Wave scenario.</jats:p>",

Although, feature‐oriented approaches have been proposed for building product lines, none of them provide a systematic approach for identifying features. This paper proposes a domain analysis method for creating SPL based on scenarios, goals and features. In particular, the paper presents a domain requirements model (DRM) that integrates features with goals and scenarios, and a domain requirements modeling method that uses the DRM. This approach has been applied to the home integration system (HIS) domain to demonstrate its feasibility. This approach makes it possible to systematically identify features and provide the rationale for both features and C&amp;V.</jats:p>",
