The phenomenon of pro viding services to drug users is conceived of as a flow system with four major structural components: (1) the drug-user population, (2) the nonuser popu lation, (3) the service component, and (4) the legal component. A computer model based on this conceptualization is described. The model is used in simulations of four typical strategies for dealing with the drug problem. The relative costs of the strategies and their effects on the size of the drug-user popula tion are discussed. </jats:p>",

This paper deals with possible treatment failures that can result from poor displacement patterns of the chemicals injected into a formation. Successive injection of a series of flushes are normally required to consolidate a formation. Mathematical model studies were made of fluid fronts, considering such variables as (1) flush volumes to blend fronts, (2) viscosity of the flush fluids and (3) different perforation lengths. Results of the studies should perforation lengths. Results of the studies should be particularly useful in successful consolidation of longer perforated intervals. For instance, results showed that failure to treat successfully a long uniform formation interval with one type of consolidation technique could be caused by excessive flushing of the plastic solution injected into the sand; this flushing occurs adjacent to the wellbore near the top and bottom of the perforated interval. A method is given for estimating the volume of fluid flushing these critical zones. Such data can be used to design realistic laboratory experiments to evaluate how effective a consolidation technique will be for a particular well treatment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>One means of controlling sand production from weak sands is to treat the formation with certain chemicals that cement formation particles together. Since a series of successive particles together. Since a series of successive fluid injections are normally used in such commercially available treatments, there is the possibility that a consolidation treatment can possibility that a consolidation treatment can fail if poor displacement by the sequential injections takes place, even though all other precautions to obtain a successful treatment precautions to obtain a successful treatment are taken. This paper presents a mathematical model that can be used to show the movement of successively injected fluids in the sand around the wellbore. The results of well model studies can be used to increase the success ratio of successful consolidations of formation sands, especially in wells having long perforated intervals.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>An example of how the results of displacement studies can be utilized is also included in this paper. The variables considered in this example paper. The variables considered in this example include (1) volumes required for adequate displacement, (2) viscosity of the first injected fluid and (3) different perforation lengths. Hopefully, this paper will encourage the use of laboratory tests based on model studies to deal satisfactorily with one part of the many requirements for successful sand consolidation. The percentage of successful sand-control treatments should increase if such an approach is followed.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

In principle, there are no significant differences of opinion about PPB among the Department of National Revenue, Taxation, the Treasury Board, and the various authorities. However, following the procedures laid down by the Treasury Board, when the Department presented its first formal program forecast in 1969 covering the fiscal years 1970/71 to 1975/76 it discovered very formidable obstacles. Some of the obstacles related to the inadequacy of the organization to cope with the changes that PPB brought in its wake because of the absence of the necessary infra‐structure and information systems. Other problems encountered were the result of the Treasury Board's exigencies and still others related to the strengths and weaknesses of PPB in general. This review of four years' operation discusses its problems on a year‐by‐year basis, and the solutions found or approaches to solutions that were discovered.</jats:p><jats:p>In the final analysis, the Department went through major changes to accommodate PPB and is currently operating as one of the leaders in the field. The various changes are also highlighted in the paper — the introduction of management by objectives, performance indicators, and the Taxation Information System to mention a few.</jats:p><jats:p>The review of these problems and solutions may offer help to others who may be contemplating introducing PPB into their own organizations. Recent attempts at introducing PPB by other government agencies appear to be based on adopting a method by which existing management techniques are synthesized and the infra‐structure modified (within the over‐all framework of PPB) so that it can work, The promise for the future is in such an approach.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire. </jats:bold> Cet article est une étude d'implantation du PPB au ministère du Revenu national, Impôt, Canada; l'évolution du système, de ses succès et de ses échecs. En principe, il n'existe pas de différence d'opinion significative entre le ministère, le Conseil du Trésor, et les diverses autorités concernant le PPB. Néanmoins, quand le ministère présenta ses premières prévisions à l'intérieur d'un programme formel, en 1969, pour les années 1970/71 à 1975/76, suite aux proceéures établies par le Conseil du Trésor, il découvrit des obstacles assez importants. Certains obstacles étaient reliés aux faiblesses dans les infrastructures d'organisation pour s'adapter aux changements, ainsi qu'à l'absence d'information Préalable. D'autres étaient le résultat des exigences du Conseil du Trésor, ou étaient causés par les forces et les faiblesses du PPB en général. Cet article qui est une revue des quatre années d'opération permet d'aborder les problèmes sur une base annuelle, ainsi que les solutions trouvées ou les approches découvertes en vue d'en arrives à une solution.</jats:p><jats:p>En dernière analyse, le ministère a fait les changements nécessaires, pour accommoder le PPB, et il est maintenant considéré comme l'un des premiers dans ce domaine. Les nouvelles techniques introduites pour faciliter ces changements sont aussi montrées dans cet article: gestion par objectif, indicateurs de performance et système d'information pour la gestion, pour n'en mentionner que quelques‐uns.</jats:p><jats:p>La revue de ces problèmes et des solutions peut aider les gestionnaires désireux d'implanter le PPB dans leur organisation. Les tentatives récentes d'introduction du PPB chez d'autres agences gouvernementales semblent se baser sur une synthèse des techniques de gestion qui existent déjà, ainsi que sur la modification de I'infrastructure (dans un encadrement de PPB) pour le faire fonctionner. La promesse pour l'avenir est dans cette approche.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Part I of this paper, we develop an algorithm for finding planning horizons for the deterministic production smoothing problem when all demand must be met from regular production, under rather general assumptions for the production, production smoothing, and holding cost functions. (In Part II, planning horizons will be developed when the model is extended to include backlogging and overtime.) </jats:p><jats:p> The techniques developed here are essentially forward-looking and marginal-cost-balancing in nature, rather than total-cost-minimizing and backward-looking such as dynamic programming, or total-cost-minimizing and omni-looking in nature such as linear programming. The fact that the planning horizon theorems do not depend on having discount rates less than one illustrates that the approach developed here is fundamentally different from ordinary infinite horizon dynamic programming techniques. </jats:p><jats:p> The algorithm is “user oriented” in the sense that only a small amount of forecasting work and computation ordinarily must be done to determine the horizon; the nature of the algorithm also makes the exact dependence of the horizon on the forecast clear for sensitivity analysis. Firms facing a seasonal demand pattern will often find that the horizon occurs within the first several periods after the peak period if there is a sufficient enough drop in demand afterwards. This result complements the findings of Modigliani and Hohn and provides insight into the nature of the optimal policy for stochastic planning problems. </jats:p>",
