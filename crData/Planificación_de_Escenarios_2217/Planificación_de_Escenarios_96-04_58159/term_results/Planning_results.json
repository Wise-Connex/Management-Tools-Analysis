      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper makes the case that planning should fully incorporate the notion of sustainable development (SD) and argues that SD is not achievable in any real way without attention to the substance and process of planning as it happens on the ground. Sustainable development should be a fundamental principle of planning but the concept is ambiguous. This paper distills a working definition of SD suitable for planners in terms of process and substantive criteria. The definition is derived mainly from an analysis of recent literature and shows that ecological sustainability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustainability and that social and economic conditions must also be met The highest priorities in planning for SD are to ensure that plans address ecological issues and to improve decision-making processes to achieve vertical consistency between actions at local, national, and even international levels and horizontal coordination between development actions at all levels Despite the limited effectiveness of local decisions, there is so much that local communities can do for SD in their own interest and for the long-term benefit of the planet.</jats:p>",

The empirical research was undertaken as part of the University of Strathclyde’s Department of Marketing’s review of the undergraduate programme. It involved both students and employers in the decision‐making process and gauged the reaction of both sectors to the idea of becoming more integrated into the university planning structure. Results show that both student and employer markets welcome the idea of further integration and collaboration and that there are some valuable lessons to be learned from industry in the arena of strategic planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The vision of modern urban planning after World War 2 was a remarkably standardized project around the world. Implementation was also universally problematic, the heady reformism of 1940s reconstructionism never being comprehensively realized. Moreover, by the 1970s the early ‘heroic’ modernism had evolved into a counterrevolutionary ‘high’ modernism. Exemplifying these themes was the career of the Sydney-based architect—planner Walter Bunning (1912–1977). In this paper I provide an overview of his particular brand of modernist thought, his central planning ideas, and his physical planning work, with special reference to a disastrous redevelopment scheme near the end of his life. The nature and scope of Walter Bunning's professional life represent a virtual microcosm of the uneven course of planning in Australia in the postwar years: genesis in the avant-garde Le Corbusier-tinged modernism of the 1930s, the early priorities, the broadening agenda but ever moderating tone, the difficulties in translating heady dreams into reality, and the crises which led to the emergence of a new paradigm. I will demonstrate how a biographical approach to planning history can illuminate the origins, meanings, hopes, and outcomes of modernist planning in the urban arena. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Transportation planning consists of a variety of activities that can be supported by Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This kind of system offers many functions that can be used for both spatial and transportation analyses. TransCAD is a GIS-package with specific transportation analysis tools. This package offers different functions for network analysis, transportation modeling, route analysis and traffic assignment. This paper describes the role of GIS for transportation planning which will be illustrated by several research projects. Special attention is given to the functions TransCAD offers for transportation analysis purposes. Three projects conducted by the Urban Planning Group of the Eindhoven University of Technology illustrate some of these functions in more detail. The projects concern the simulation of activity patterns, the evaluation of planning scenarios, and the simulation of parking behavior. Experiences from several research projects show that TransCAD is very useful for transportation planning activities. The open architecture that makes it possible to implement any self-made procedure in the TransCAD environment appears to be one of the most important characteristics of this software. Also the amount of network analyses such as shortest path finding and traffic assignment makes the package valuable. Still, improvements are desirable, for example a better structured users' manual, more advanced options for presentation and for modeling and statistical fitting of distribution. Some of these requests are implemented in the new Windows version of TransCAD 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

In this way, the algorithm can first eliminate disastrous decisions and recognize particularly advantageous decisions, considering finer details if time permits. We view planning as a decision-making process and discuss the design of anytime algorithms for decision-theoretic planning. In particular, we present an anytime decision-theoretic planning algorithm that uses abstraction to focus attention first on those aspects of a planning problem that have the highest impact on expected utility. We discuss control schemes for refining this behavior and methods for automatically creating good abstractions.</jats:p>",

These abilities involve appropriate reaction to environmental situations given the agent’s goals; selective attention to multiple, competing goals; planning new action routines when innovation beyond designer-provided routines is necessary; and learning the effects of actions so that the planner can use them to build ever more reliable plans. The teleo-reactive format allows actions to be closely coupled to continuous environmental feedback and is also especially compatible with conventional AI planning and learning mechanisms. The workings of the proposed architecture and its subsystems are illustrated in a simulated robot domain. We conclude by noting areas where future work is needed.</jats:p>",

These environments are normally defined as having hydrostatic pressures of at least 10,000 psi and bottomhole temperatures of at least 300 F. Factors affecting reliability may include deteriorating mud conditions caused by increased depth and temperature ranges, high pressures. which hinder tool operation, and reduced sealing capability resulting from the high temperatures. Solutions to these issues are available, but in many cases, are not used because of insufficient pre-job planning.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper discusses a joint project undertaken by eleven major operators and service/testing companies in the Norway, UK area to address these problems and to determine methods that would increase the reliability of DST operations in HP/HT well testing. Emphasis was placed on the selection of the downhole equipment used for the HP/HT DST's and design of the full scale testing of the North-Sea-area field tools in use. Additionally, an investigation was to be made to establish methods that could be used to verify and increase equipment reliability. The project also included design parameters for contingency conditions that were not normally present during equipment operations but could exist in emergency situations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Eleven tools including tester valves, multiple-cycle circulating valves, bypass valves and safety/circulating valves from different service company/suppliers were rigorously tested. The results of the tests, which compare the susceptibility of various tool design types to reliability problems, will be provided as well as the types of tool modifications that were subsequently made to increase reliability of the equipment for the HP/HT conditions. The data presented will also include results of testing conducted on the equipment modifications.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The method of testing helped determine changes needed to address reliability in HP/HT conditions and has demonstrated that DST tools could maintain integrity in this type of environment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>For over 60 years, drill stem testing has been used to determine reservoir parameters of potential producing zones. However, the early DST applications were traditionally limited to open hole at low to moderate temperatures and pressures. These conditions would include temperatures between 150 and 300 F and pressures ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 psi. With the expansion of offshore DST to cased-hole applications with increased temperature ranges of up to 410 F and increased hydrostatic pressures of up to 15,000 psi, traditional equipment experienced operational problems. These problems included the following in descending order of relative frequency:Mud deterioration resulting from mud remaining static at temperature for several days, either in water-based systems in which the settling of solids caused the string to become stuck in the hole and to create plugs of solids that hindered pressure transmission to the tools, or in oil-based systems that increased in viscosity and gel strength, reducing capability to transmit operating pressures to downhole tools.Tool design that was not fully suited for the conditions. This included insufficient pressure capabilities, especially in the area of air chambers, shear pin-operated tools that were susceptible to pressure and shock from the perforating guns, and string designs that were too complicated for the conditions. For example, several annulus pressure-operated tools run with operating pressures that are too close together because of an insufficiently low pressure test of the casing or liner lap.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Both of the above problems can be minimized with the application of prejob planning.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 525</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The casing program is also dictated mainly from the fracture and collapse gradient. Therefore, the knowledge and use of the correct fracture and collapse gradients can save the operating companies large sums of money. When estimating the safe operational mud weight window two important parameters arethe strength of the rock, andthe stress conditions the rock is subjected to.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The question is; how can these parameters be monitored while drilling a well. Today there is no way of measuring compressive rock strength or stresses while drilling. The best method of determining compressive rock strength is by triaxial testing of core samples, but the problem is that these data will then only be available after the well is completed. These triaxial data are then used in conjunction with logs through correlations when planning the next well.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes a decision support system for well planning, and follow-up of well integrity (safe operating mud weight window) during drilling operations. The system, is a Windows based modular system, using Internet as the communication network for data exchange and technological support.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>One module in the system is the inverted ROP module which back calculates the compressive strength of the formation while drilling. This in-situ compressive strength will be used dynamically to calibrate the in-situ stresses which in conjunction with knowledge of the overburden and pore pressure, and the wellbore survey dictates the collapse and fracture pressure for the wellbore instantaneously. If the well has already been drilled and the above information is available, the true vertical depth collapse and fracture gradient can be predicted as part of the post analysis or for pre-planning the next well in the area.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Another approach to obtain the collapse and fracture gradient is from log data, where the rock compressive strength of the rock is estimated from the sonic travel times. After the compressive strengths as a function of depth are estimated the same approach as for the use of drilling data to obtain in-situ stresses is applied.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Using such a decision support software system, data may also be more readily available for display instantaneously or for use in future planning, thus providing a more complete set of data for design prognosis.

With the use of the operationalized model, and microlevel and macrolevel data for guestworkers in Germany during the period 1970 to 1989, we can empirically test the relative influence of internal network variables versus external forces on the attraction of immigrants over time. The empirical results suggest that—as the system matures—network variables have an increasing impact on the attraction of immigrants, while the impact of economic factors declines. The research is concluded with a series of simulations that further highlight the internal dynamic of international migration systems. </jats:p>",

Housing production programmes are examined at the level of the municipality, as a way of shedding light on the institutional structuring of the activity of agents in housing production. Changes in the characteristics of these programmes are located within the broader field of central–local state relations. A case study focuses on the relations surrounding council housing production in one particular locality—the north London borough of Haringey—during the 1980s. Detailed attention is given to the activity of Haringey's own building capacities through its direct labour organisation. A model of municipalised construction in housing production is proposed as providing an insight into the structure and form of the social relations of housing provision. In conclusion, this approach is put forward as a way of understanding the characteristics of local state restructuring beyond municipal housing production. </jats:p>",

In practical terms, this means that men who are judged to be ‘effeminate’ and women deemed to be ‘masculine’ are those most at risk of assault, I also consider the implications of this insight for those individuals who live outside normative sex-gender relations (‘transgenders’). In this paper the ways in which public space is defined through gender arc also examined, such that an attack on gender outlaws or gays and lesbians is often an attempt to police one's self-presentation, Though gender and sexuality are thus intertwined, I investigate the ways in which these variables can be juxtaposed. An analysis of antiviolence activism in the city of Montréal provides the focus for this study. I conclude with a call for research and education on violence, which recognizes the role that gender plays in incidents of aggression, and which therefore accounts for the different experiences of violence faced by men, women, and transgenders. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With intensified globalization, and more specifically European integration, the ground is shifting under established political institutions, practices, and concepts. The European Union (EU), however, is usually conceived in traditional ‘realist’ or ‘functionalist’ terms which obscure the possibility that distinctly new political forms arc emerging; or, alternatively, some self-styled ‘postmodernists’ speculate implausably about a ‘Europe of the regions’ replacing the ‘Europe of states’. In contrast, I argue for ‘new medieval’ and ‘postmodern’ conceptualizations of territoriality and sovereignty, which recognize that geographic space is becoming more complex and ‘relative’: Conventional political concepts based on ‘absolute’ space are increasingly problematic for understanding the political complexities of contemporary globalization. Here ‘postmodernity’ may mean something different from what some postmodernists think it means: not, for instance, a federalized ‘United States of Europe’ where regions and regionalism replace nations and nationalism, nor simply an intergovernmental arrangement of sovereign states, but something quite distinct—‘arrested federalization’ and an ‘intermediate’ arrangement distinct in its own right rather than ‘transitional’. In this paper I sketch transformations of sovereignty from ‘medieval to modern’, and from the ‘modern’ to the allegedly ‘postmodern’. I focus on the ‘unbundling’ of territorial sovereignty, which has reputedly gone furthest in the EU. However, even here the process is partial and selective, with globalization affecting different state activities unevenly. Contemporary configurations of political space are a complex mixture of new and old forms, the latter continuing to exist rather than being tidily removed to clear the ground for new politics. The EU itself is still territorial, and in many respects traditional conceptions of sovereignty remain dominant, whether exercised by the member states or by the EU as a whole. Moreover there are problems both with the elusive notion of postmodern, and with the historical analogies of new medievalism. Nevertheless, despite problems and qualifications, these concepts are useful for exploring the possibility of radical transformations, not just with respect to the ‘actors’ of global and local politics, but to the space–time of the ‘stage’ on which they operate. </jats:p>",

There was no significant difference in the number of intra-operative fractures among the two groups. No correlation was found between femoral fit and upper femoral morphology nor between fit and the surgeon's seniority. There was no significant difference in the incidence of thigh pain in the two groups at an average follow-up of 28 months. The more striking finding was the poorer femoral fit and fill encountered in the unplanned group. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Regulation theory is of Marxian inspiration, has been strongly influenced by historical analysis and institutionalism, and can be applied to the study of accumulation in and regulation of societies in all eras, of capitalism. But these features of the theory have not prevented many geographers from applying it primarily to the study of the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. Moreover, many of them have narrowed the research agenda even more by focusing on the feasibility of fashionable but economistic ‘flex spec prof high-tech’ production models for the development strategies of privileged areas. Research efforts have drifted away from the study of ‘undefended cities and regions’. This evolution is, I believe, all the more deplorable given the creation of the Single European Market, with its permissive social charter and the spatially biased reorganization of the structural funds of the Commission of the European Communities. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper a methodological viewpoint is defended which contends that progress in the social sciences can be accomplished only through the confrontation of experience and action-orientated research needs with existing theoretical frameworks capable of leading the research in the right direction. Then, an examination is made of the research needs of agents (policymakers, planners, academics, and so on) involved in action which is orientated towards achieving greater intraspatial and interspatial equality in Europe. The extent to which regulation theory is capable of guiding such research, given the ideological influences as well as theoretical refinements it has undergone, is discussed, and it is concluded that further improvements to regulation theory could make it more appropriate for action-orientated research in socioeconomic geography. This conclusion is illustrated for the application of the analysis of socioeconomic development in depressed areas. </jats:p>",

To help illustrate the framework it was then used to assess the quantifiable outcomes and direct costs of three of the main alternative screening strategies: From antenatal clinics, ‘2-step’ screening where females are tested first followed by a screening invitation to the partners of female carriers, and ‘couple’ screening where both partners must agree to be tested at the outset; and from primary practice clinics ‘active’ contact of attenders. Quantifiable outcomes are defined as the number of individuals informed of their carrier status and the number of carriers, carrier couples, and affected fetuses detected. Direct costs are those associated with the recruitment and testing of individuals and the subsequent counselling of any gene carriers or carrier couples identified. Results are based on services for a resident population of 250 000 at two time points, year one and a year at ‘steady state’. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> The resultant framework estimates the number of individuals tested using data on the size of the target population, the proportion of that population alerted to the screening service, and the proportion who agree to be tested when approached. Given service users, prevalence data are used to assess service outcomes. Given the number of individuals approached and the subsequent demands for services, service costs can be estimated. Preliminary results indicate that in the short-term health care purchasers and planners who favour screening are likely to opt for antenatal strategies. Although the high coverage of the primary practice strategy leads to high outcomes in year one, relative to the antenatal strategies, it also leads to very high costs. At ‘steady state’, cost and outcome differences between the strategies are less marked. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> This paper provides a framework which can be used to provide information to support decision-making surrounding the development of screening services.

Preliminary findings based upon use of the approach demonstrate the need for continued research to further refine and improve the methodology. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

The modernisation project in recent years has shifted from the national to the local level, partly as a reaction to national neoliberalism which prioritises capital mobility over socialisation to promote manufacturing, Local modernisation strategies can avoid the dangers of overpoliticisation which beset national modernisation, but they are undermined not only by deeply rooted traditions but also by themselves promoting capital mobility and regressive effects. Local strategies for socialisation and movements for British modernisation are both disrupted by the opposition between, but mutual dependence of, capital mobility and the territorial socialisation of production. The difficulty of modernising Britain is thus due to the typicality rather than to the cxceptionalism of British capital. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a continual interest in research on multipurpose shopping (MPS), because it provides a further extension of rational decisionmaking, whereby consumers who combine shopping activities reduce the time and cost of travel. The literature describes the importance of this type of shopping for infrequent trips to higher order centres (Bacon, 1984) or MPS constructed around convenience, supermarket, or comparison trips (West, 1993). A study of MPS at a range of planned suburban shopping centres (PSSCs) in Sydney, Australia during 1988/89 endeavoured to relate these hypotheses to results from a space—time differential consumer-trip model (Baker, 1994). The standardised number of MPS consumers is shown to form a substantial quadratic relationship with centre scale. The model predicts positive and negative states of MPS. An investigation of the shopping patterns within the data set shows the ‘negative’ MPS is based around the supermarket visit (supporting the West hypothesis). This strategy is adopted both by low mobility and by high disposable income groups within a shopping-centre hierarchy. ‘Positive’ MPS occurs for shifts in trip purpose, where comparison shopping (such as, for gifts or clothing) is the fundamental construct behind the multipurpose trip. This study shows that distinctly different socioeconomic groups can have in common an MPS strategy independent of centre scale, and it is argued that these groups are using this strategy as a mechanism to minimise the total effort in the shopping cycle. </jats:p>",

Manufacturing costs are particularly high in the biotechnology industry because process technologies are relatively new. Contamination, genetic instability, and other factors complicate production planning and make bioprocess systems unreliable. This paper presents a Markov decision process model that combines features of engineering design models and aggregate production planning models to obtain a hybrid model that links biological and engineering parameters to optimize operations performance. Using tissue plasminogen activator as a specific example, the paper shows how the hybrid modeling approach not only improves production planning, but also provides accurate information on the operating performance of bioprocesses that can be used to predict the financial impact of process changes. Therefore, the model can be used to guide investments in manufacturing process improvement and R&amp;D (e.g., genetic modifications). Although stochastic production models are not commonly used in process design, this paper shows how a combined engineering/production model can facilitate a concurrent design approach to reduce cost in bioprocess development. </jats:p>",

Spatial forms reveal material conditions that govern social processes and, therefore, provide keys to the understanding of how societies work. Two examples are provided. First, it is argued that gravity patterns in spatial interaction are an outcome of human intentionality but that they also show how human actions are controlled by material conditions. Second, it is shown how the spatial structure of multiplant firms reflects the need for cooperation and control in capitalist production. </jats:p>",

An appropriate theoretical framework and a careful methodology (with special attention to variable control and measurement problems) are used to gain new insights into processes of neighbourhood cognition. Although classical results are corroborated at the aggregate level, specific results are derived at the individual level: (1) large differences are found between individual learning processes; (2) differences in individual cognition decrease over time. Methodological conclusions are also provided. The main likely conclusion is that currently unidentified variables are to a large extent responsible for the observed impressive diversity of individual learning processes. This is a challenge to future research on cognition. </jats:p>",

In 1960, Korea instituted a national family planning programme to combat rapid population growth. Cuba explicitly rejected Malthusian policies, but made family planning universally available in 1974 in response to health needs. Both countries have undergone rapid fertility declines and today have less than replacement level fertility. Both countries have also used a similar mixture of methods, including a high prevalence of female sterilisation. Abortion has played a major role in the fertility decline of both countries, rising in the first half of the fertility transition and then falling, although remaining a significant variable in the second half. It is concluded that access to contraception, voluntary sterilisation, and safe abortion has a direct impact on fertility and has been associated with a rapid fall in family size in two very different countries.</jats:p>",

On the one hand there is the global concern about sustainability and the financing of new energy capacity which has motivated integrated energy planning as a means to accommodate conservation and other demand‐side measures. On the other hand, there is the rapid restructuring and privatisation of public utilities, world‐wide, into competitive markets. These trends not only appear to pose conflicting policy objectives, e.g. planning versus liberalised market‐forces, they also pose a modelling challenge. This paper investigates how far systems modelling and simulation can provide the broad policy oriented framework required for these new purposes. Applications to the UK and Colombia are presented to explore some of the new issues which need to be integrated on this modelling platform.</jats:p>",

This article describes an integrated software system that combines perception, planning, real-time control, and task-level control to navigate autonomously the Ambler, a six-legged rover. The overall approach to walking is highly deliberative: Where actions are goal-directed, steps are planned out in detail using explicit models of the terrain and the vehicle, and moves are checked for safety prior to execution. We believe that this approach is well-suited to meet ing the challenges of reliability, efficiency, and terrainability faced by autonomous planetary rovers. The Ambler system has been extensively tested, both indoors and outdoors, and the results confirm our expectations regarding the degree of system capability and performance afforded by our approach. </jats:p>",

Data from input—output and structural path analysis are utilized to develop indices that can be used for assessing the connectedness of sectors (and industries within sectors) in any economy. In addition, measures are developed for quantifying linkages, and the economic influence transmitted by them, that are sensitive to structural change over space and time. The indices are then used to examine the relationship between sectoral diversity, linkages, and development by analyzing the economic relationships between sectors in the form of intersectoral linkages of six planning districts in Virginia, in addition to the economies of the State of Virginia and the USA. On the basis of these analyses, it is concluded that: </jats:p><jats:p> (a) contrary to Hirschman's suggestion that the complexity of linkages increased with industrial diversification, the results suggest that diversification leads to less complexity in the linkage relationships; and (b) economies with mixed sectoral representation have higher levels of cycling, on average, than those with industrial diversity in just one sector. </jats:p><jats:p> The implications of these findings for policy and planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

A total of 98 women were referred from the FPC for GUM testing. They were randomly referred to be tested either in a local FPC or in the local GUM clinic. Sixty-three per cent of the 49 women randomized to be tested in the GUM clinic attended the consultation compared to 83% of the 49 wom en who attended the consultation in the FPC. This was statistically significant (P &lt;0.05). Twenty-six per cent of those attending the GUM clinic for testing and 29% of those women attending the FPC had a sexually transmitted disease (STD), that is, excluding candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups. Full GUM testing was successfully carried out in the FPC setting. This study showed that women were less likely to attend for GUM testing if the consultation took place in the GUM clinic compared to the FPC. It is known that there is a need for GUM services to be accessible to FPC attenders (and vice versa ). Further research is needed to determine why women are reluctant to attend GUM clinics. </jats:p>",

Dental practitioners (n=500) were sent a questionnaire with information on and questions about treatment for either an addicted or an identical non‐addicted patient; response rate was 41%. Loglinear analysis showed that after controlling for the influence of four demographic variables (sex, age, number pf patients and number of National Health Service insured patients), the treatment plans made for addicted patients were less elaborate than those for the non‐addicted. For the addicted, fillings or frames were proposed more often, whereas for non‐addicted patients more often crowns or bridges were proposed. Extraction instead of filling was more often proposed for the addicted patient. Less elaborate treatment for addicted patients corresponds to the way dentists specialized in treating drug addicts work, with one exception: extraction should be avoided whether a patient is addicted or not. Treatment planning did not differentiate for addicted and non‐addicted patients, whereas dentists specialized in treating addicted patients do recommend an adjusted treatment plan for the addicted.</jats:p>",

Multiattribute value assessment is used to elicit the objectives of several elected officials and other key decision makers. The results are structured into a fundamental objectives hierarchy and a means‐ends objectives network. A set of measures to indicate the performance of planning alternatives in terms of the fundamental objectives is developed. Preliminary value tradeoffs between objectives are elicited from several elected officials. The results of these steps are useful for many aspects of long‐term planning: facilitating communication about values and priorities; designing attractive alternatives that are more likely to serve stakeholder interests; identifying information needed to evaluate alternatives; clarifying the relative importance of information about different impacts; providing a basis for quantitative evaluation of the alternatives with multiple objective analysis; and focusing attention on key tradeoffs that will affect the choice of alternatives.</jats:p>",
