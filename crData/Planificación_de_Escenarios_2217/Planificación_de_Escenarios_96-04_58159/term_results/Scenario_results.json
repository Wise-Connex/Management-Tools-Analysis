Recently however, local entrepreneurs have been afforded the opportunity to participate to some extent, in oil production activities of the land-based operations of the state-owned oil company.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The state-owned oil company of Trinidad and Tobago has over five thousand (5000) inactive wells. Because of limited capital resources and the resultant low priority for reactivation, a programme of leasing blocks of these idle wells to small independent operators was initiated in July 1989. This programme is currently being expanded because of its initial success. In addition, acreages are being offered for farmout operations, again because of the scarcity of capital funds for internal investment and the associated risks involved.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>As a consequence of these programmes, the oil production scenario in Trinidad's land-based operations is undergoing a radical transformation. This paper reviews the current status of lease operatorships and farmouts and discusses the key issues involved.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Trinidad is the most southerly of the Caribbean Islands and is located to the east of Venezuela (Figure 1). The major part of the history of the oil industry of Trinidad's land-based operations reflects a domination by foreign multinationals including Shell, Texaco and British Petroleum amongst other smaller foreign companies. Over the years, the land-based assets of these companies were acquired by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to form two state-owned oil companies TRINTOC and TRINTOPEC. In 1993, these two companies were eventually merged into one state-owned oil company, PETROTRIN.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In the late 1980's, because of the low oil prices, many wells became uneconomic to produce and were left idle.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For more than two decades, advocates of malpractice system reform have claimed that the most damaging and costly result of the U.S. medical malpractice system is the practice of defensive medicine, in which physicians order tests and procedures primarily because of fear of malpractice liability. In this article, we discuss the issues raised by different definitions of defensive medicine and propose a working definition to guide measurement of the concept. We also consider the strengths and weaknesses of available approaches for measuring defensive medicine. Finally, we describe an empirical approach to measuring defensive medicine using clinical scenario surveys. The results suggest that, if physicians actually practice as they say they would in these surveys, defensive medicine does exist, although not to the extent suggested by anecdotal evidence or direct physician surveys. The results also suggest that defensive medicine varies considerably across clinical situations. In all of the scenarios, many physicians chose aggressive patient management styles even though conservative management was considered medically acceptable by the expert panels that developed the scenarios. In most cases, medical indications, not malpractice concerns, motivated clinical choices. Our results highlight the limitations of surveys as a method of measuring the extent of defensive medicine. The implications of managed care and health care reform for defensive medicine are also discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The following three basic scenarios have emerged for the genetic relatedness of strains in recurrent vaginal candidiasis: strain maintenance without genetic variation, strain maintenance with minor genetic variation, and strain replacement. To test the frequency of each of the three scenarios, the genetic relatedness of Candida albicans isolates from each of 18 patients with recurrent infections was assessed by sequential DNA fingerprinting with the following three probes: the Ca3 probe; the C1 probe, a subfragment of the Ca3 probe which hybridizes to hypervariable genomic fragments; and the unrelated CARE2 probe. In each of the 18 patients with recurrent infections, the same strain was responsible for sequential infections, suggesting that the predominant scenario is strain maintenance. However, in 56% of these patients, the strain exhibited minor genetic variations in sequential infections. These changes were not found to be progressive. Rather, the changes suggest that substrains of an established infecting strain are shuffled in sequential infections. Results are also presented that in 45% of patients with recurrent infections, oral and vulvovaginal isolates were identical, in 35% they were highly related but not identical, and in 20% they were unrelated. These results differ markedly from those for commensal isolates simultaneously cultured from the oral cavity and vulvovaginal region of healthy individuals. Finally, it is demonstrated that in all eight cases in which C. albicans was isolated from both the male sexual partner of the patient with a recurrent infection and the patient, an isolate from the male partner was identical or highly related to the vulvovaginal strain. These results demonstrate that in patients with recurrent vulvovaginitis, a single strain usually dominates both in the different body locations of the patient and in the male partner and that it is maintained through sequential infections. However, in patients with recurrent infections, different substrains of the established clone dominate in an apparently random fashion, a process that we refer to as \"substrain shuffling\".</jats:p>",
