It presents four procedures for developing work‐center capacity plans designed to insure the production of components and assemblies as specified by the MRP plan and the master production schedule (MPS). These procedures (capacity planning using overall factors, capacity bills, resource profiles, and capacity requirements planning) are compared using simulation analysis. The results indicate that the performance of a procedure when measured against the MPS depends on the operating conditions of the manufacturing system. The results also indicate that the choice of a particular procedure often represents a compromise among the benefits of improved MPS performance, the costs of preparing and processing data, and the premium expenses required for more frequent adjustments in work‐center capacity levels.</jats:p>",

The multi-case approach provided a naturalistic, descriptive account of planning at two levels: daily and yearly plans. Two general research questions guided this study: How do the subjects plan for class in terms of time, setting, and so forth? What factors influence their planning patterns? Four teachers were observed over an intensive 2-week period for data collection. Data consisted of observations, interviews, and excerpts from documents and records. The researcher assumed the role of participant-observer and remained in the school for the entire school day during the data collection. The results indicated that the four teachers did not use the classical ends/means model for planning but instead employed informal planning habits that typically focused on daily activities, not coherent efforts to match objectives with content. This pattern does not necessarily produce disorganized classes, however, as the researcher described the teachers as having positive in-class instructional behaviors. It is suggested that the teachers did in fact plan for classes, however briefly or informally.</jats:p>",

Such expert systems have been found to be useful in a number of applications (e.g. medicine, biochemistry and mineral exploration). In this paper the author presents an expert system for solving problems concerning income and transfer tax planning for individuals In developing this system, a theoretical structure and a set of decision rules were specified and then programmed into a rule‐based system that had previously been used for medical diagnosis (Mycin [1]) Once the system was developed, its problem‐solving capabilities were refined and verified by a panel of tax experts using a blind verification procedure. This verification step demonstrated that an expert system could be developed in that domain.</jats:p>",

Although most of the men expressed a desire to have large families, several findings suggest that they felt that they may have to be satisfied with a lower number for economic reasons. Three-fifths of the men with wives of reproductive age wished to use family planning services now but only about one-fifth were currently using an effective method. Almost 60% of the men were interested in learning more about female sterilization and about 50%, more about male sterilization. In general, attitudes towards family planning were more favourable than previously believed by providers of these services. Only 2·8% of these men had obtained services from a family planning clinic, suggesting that the demand currently exceeds the supply.</jats:p>",

The model suggests that the probability that the first vehicle arrives at the scene within a given time may be increased by reducing the path time correlations, even if doing so necessitates increasing the mean path travel time for some vehicles.

Under the assumption that in-migration and out-migration rates are uncorrelated with city sizes, it is shown that Fisher's log-series distribution is that distribution. Fisher's log-series distribution yields a much less concentrated size distribution than does the Yule distribution, which is the equilibrium distribution associated with a pure growth process. Thus, we might expect a lower level of concentration or city size inequality when the overall urban system is stationary than when it is growing. </jats:p>",

A state-of-the-world decomposition approach is introduced that solves the dynamic probabilistic generation expansion problem using simple static deterministic solution techniques. The main problem is decomposed into a set of static deterministic problems. Each problem represents a distinct state-of-the-world (i.e., a time and outcome scenario) and is solved individually using a new dynamic programming procedure. The problems are linked through Lagrange multipliers that are determined iteratively and that can be interpreted as “shadow” fixed costs. Consequently, one difficult problem is replaced with many easy ones. The solution obtained represents the minimum discounted expected cost generation expansion plan. It reflects the importance of future conditions in current decisions and the utility's ability to respond to the resolution of uncertainties over time. </jats:p>",

It is solved by use of the Lagrangian form of the maximum principle. The possible existence of strong decision and forecast horizons is demonstrated. When they exist, they permit the breaking up of the whole problem into a set of smaller problems which can be solved independently because optimal decisions up to a strong decision horizon are completely independent of demand data beyond the next forecast horizon. A forward branch and bound algorithm is developed to determine such horizons and to solve the whole problem.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A major concern of geographers has been the explanation and prediction of spatial choice behavior. Several discrete choice models have been developed which attempt to account for the use of different transport routes, modes, shopping centers, and so on. One of the fundamental issues associated with these models is the problem of model specification; furthermore, each type of model can potentially give disparate results for the same spatial choice situation. In this paper the models and their characteristics are summarized, and a generalized method for comparing the results yielded by alternative model specifications, or results obtained from different model formulations, are presented. The procedure is an application of recent developments in heuristic methods for comparing related matrices. </jats:p>",

Each teacher taught the same lesson content for a 15-minute episode. The planning group spent 1 hour before the lesson writing explicit plans, while the control group was given 2 minutes just before the lesson to gather their thoughts and be informed of the content to be covered. The behaviors of all teachers were observed by the Cheffers Adaptation of the Flanders’ Interaction Analysis System (CAFIAS). The results indicated significant differences in only two interaction categories: amount of directions given and the amount of silence. Both variables were better for the planning group.</jats:p>",

Discrepancies between the two indicators were observed m monthly statistics but were minimal in trimester data. Differences between indicators were greater for barrier methods than the pill, although both systems yielded similar results on the distribution of users by method.
