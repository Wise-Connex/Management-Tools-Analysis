      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scientific tradition holds that it is essential to permit individual researchers almost complete freedom in their selection of research projects. As a result, structured research planning has not played a major role in determining the course of the sciences. By “structural research planning” we mean the methodical establishment of goals, and the identification of research routines which apparently accord priority to highest value goals, while minimizing the cost and time of their attainment. With increasing competition for limited fiscal and intellectual resources this kind of planning may become more necessary. Let us cite three specific examples: First, the individual researcher is often faced with the question of how best to spend his time in pursuing a particular line of investigation. He must allocate his personal resources of time and talent to work which appears to hold the promise of highest pay-off. Second, on a larger scale, the competition for resources also raises the question of priority among alternative government-sponsored research projects. Individuals proposing equally alluring projects sometimes seek the same funds; government planners need some sort of objective criteria (hopefully based on a rational strategy) in order to judge the proposals. Furthermore, government planners face the problem of justifying their request for “big science” resources; a planning strategy which defines the use and expected output of the requested resources can help in the design and promotion of their concept. Finally, there is a growing sentiment that at least some research should be directed toward the solution of current and anticipated societal problems, to find means of circumventing or minimizing the impact of potentially dangerous problems of civilization. These needs : the choice of individual research, allocation of national resources among competing projects, and selecting research of societal importance, suggest that structured research planning might be valuable.</jats:p>",

The solutions, to be effective, must be carried out in a co‐ordinated and integrated fashion among the city, the regional, and the cantonal planning groups. Much is being done at all levels to ensure that the future growth of Zürich and its surrounding region will take place in an orderly, aesthetically satisfying fashion. Certainly many serious problems remain to be solved. Nevertheless, the development of Zürich from a Roman settlement to one of the world's most important industrial, financial, commercial, and cultural centres has been accomplished with a minimum of destruction to the city's beautiful site.
