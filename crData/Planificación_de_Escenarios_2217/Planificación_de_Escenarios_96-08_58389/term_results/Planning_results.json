This approach divergesfrom the downtown-oriented land-use planning tradition of most U.S. cities. The bibliography compiles literature that describes some of the theoretical and political debate about planning for social equity goals. It is also a resource that informs and guides planners, public administrators, urban policy analysts, and community leaders regarding some of the actual experiences of equity planning over the past twentyfive years. </jats:p>",

Transit played an instrumental role in urban expansion during the nineteenth century. More recently, rail transit has also often influenced urban development, but in conjunction with favorable zoning, attractive sites, and a strong market for development. Numerous examples of station-area projects can be found in San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. In several cities, land near transit stations has realized rent premiums. The effects of rail transit on development, independent of zoning and other factors, are not readily identified. Most research has not examined specific real estate projects from the developer's perspective. It is not clear whether rail transit is the most cost-effective means of directing development, but if rail transit is built, then station-area development should be encouraged to enhance the returns on the investment. </jats:p>",

The approach is based on approximating the swept volumes of moving objects with convex segments formulated for the use of quadratic programming in distance-to-contact calculations. This swept volume strategy is designed to conservatively estimate the distance-to-contact between moving and static objects and is well suited for the planning of motions using optimization methods. It has been adapted to obtain convenient distance-to-contact gradient information which is an important factor in the application of efficient optimization algorithms to the motion planning process. The paper describes the generation of the swept volume segments and applies the process to examples of robot motion planning in three dimensions using an SQP optimization strategy.</jats:p>",

Therefore, they can reach only a finite number of locations. Compared to a manipulator built with continuous actuators, a binary manipulator provides reasonable performance, robustness, and is relatively inexpensive (up to an order of magnitude cheaper). The number of states attainable by a binary manipulator grows exponentially with the number of actuators. This makes brute force calculation of the inverse kinematics impossible for binary manipulators with many actuators. This paper presents a combinatorial method for planning trajectories for a binary manipulator while reducing the search space to a manageable size. Despite the discrete nature of binary actuation, it also creates motions that follow a specified trajectory accurately (in both position and orientation) without large deviations of the end-effector from the specified path.</jats:p>",

The fundamental assembly modeling strategy for a product is based on the mating features of its components. The objectives of this study are to integrate assembly planning of a product with its CAD model, generate a correct and practical assembly sequence, and establish a software system to carry out the planning process. A disassembly approach in assembly planning is used in this study. The degree of freedom information between two mating features is used to characterize their kinematic conditions. The intersection calculation of the degrees of freedom on all features of a component provides its local degree of freedom which is used to set up functional precedence relationship. In some cases where functional precedence relationship can not be detected by geometric reasoning, clipping of the known “common sense” relationship is applied by an user. A bounding box checking approach is used to ensure no global collision during assembly. Furthermore, a set of criteria and heuristic rules based on assembly feasibility, manipulability, assembly direction, cost and stability is used to choose a good assembly sequence.</jats:p>",

However, the motion of a redundant manipulator is usually not conservative while it is tracking a repetitive task. That is, it requires re-calculation of its motion at each increment in a repetitive task. Therefore, conservative motion has been a research topic of redundant manipulators. In this paper, two trajectory-planning methods based on the pseudo-inverse method and Euler Taylor-series are presented. These two methods enable us to obtain a convergent configuration(s) after repetitive motion cycles and the motions become conservative after the manipulator reaches the convergent configuration(s). The required number of iterations could be exceedingly large for certain trajectories. Two methods which are able to efficiently identify the convergent configuration(s) are also presented. This study is based on a three-linked planar manipulator tracking four trajectories: circles, ellipses, squares and line segments.</jats:p>",

The number of alternative process plans for machining a given workpiece on this class of machines can be large, and the process plan optimization problem can, therefore, be complex. Due to the lack of a computer-aided process plan generation and optimization system, these highly flexible machines are being used in industry today as dedicated, mass-production machines. In this paper, we present research (being conducted in close cooperation with industry) on the development of a computer-aided process planning system for four-axis turning centers.

Although many planners were introduced in research to solve this problem automatically, it is still solved manually in many advanced assembly firms. The reason behind this is that most introduced planners are very sensitive to large increases in product parts. In fact, most of these planners seek the exact solution, while performing a part basis decision process. As a result, they are trapped in tedious and exhaustive search procedures, which make them inefficient and sometimes obsolete. To overcome these difficulties, Sebaaly and Fujimoto (1996) introduced a new concept of ASP based on Genetic Algorithms application, where the search procedure is performed on a sequence population basis rather than a part basis, and a best sequence is generated without searching the complete set of potential candidates. This paper addresses the problem of improving the GA performance for assembly application, by introducing a new crossover operator. The genetic material can be divided and classified as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The new crossover insures the maximum transmission of ‘good’ features from one generation to another. This results in a faster GA convergence. The performance of the new algorithm is compared with that of the ordinary matrix crossover for a modified industrial example, where it proved to be faster and more efficient.</jats:p>",

The aesthetic is both nomadological and immaterial. Apprehensions of Australian space are constructed as movement through them. Accordingly the reader is taken on a journey from the backyard to the Outback, and it is explained why these two spaces have a certain homology. Anteriority, it is claimed, is a central category for a non-Aboriginal Australian imaginary. But some accounts of Aboriginal apprehensions of space are brought out for the purposes of contrast (for Aboriginal people there is no ‘Outback’). The textual status of these Aboriginal accounts is contingent upon the structures of their knowledge and ways of obtaining it. Instances of the author's ‘capture’ on a tape recorder of stories by an Aboriginal woman, Bonnie Edwards, indicate the divergence of the form and purpose of her texts from the ‘textual suburbs’ of theory that the author usually inhabits. As he leaves her country, his practical solution to the material weight of theory and the self-presence of narrative subjectivity is an immaterial one. He gets lost. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) problem is a complicated task that is still performed manually in most advanced industries. It consists of finding the best or optimal sequence to assemble a certain product, given its CAD design. Although it seems simple at first, its complexity drastically increases with increasing numbers of product parts, so that complexity is very high for most actual industrial products. Many ASP planners have been developed by researchers to automate this problem, but most of these are not practical and general enough to deal with actual industrial products. One of the main disadvantages is that these planners perform an extensive search of all possible sequences in order to choose the optimal solution. Another rather important disadvantage is that most generated sequences are linear, i.e. one part is assembled at a time, or have very simplistic plan generation. Sebaaly and Fujimoto (1996) introduced a novel approach to overcome the first disadvantage by applying genetic algorithms. A best-so-far solution is reached without searching the complete set of possible candidates, and the search is performed on a sequence population basis rather than on parts basis. However, this method is restricted to generating linear sequences only. This paper addresses improving that approach to generate more general solutions, by introducing an assembly fuzzy graph representation that can represent both linear and non-linear sequences. The sequences search space is thus extended to include all feasible combinations of linear and non-linear assembly operations. From the set of assembly rules and constraints of a certain product, a set of assembly stages is defined, such that every assembly operation is assigned to a certain stage according to its position in the set of constraints. A fuzzy relation is then defined as a grade of connectivity between product parts. Based on this relation, a fuzzy graph connecting the product parts is generated. This graph can represent both linear and non-linear sequences. After that, the algorithm of Sebaaly and Fujimoto (1996) is improved to deal with the new search space. The new modified algorithm is applied to a practical example from industry where the applicability and capability of the new algorithm are confirmed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The writings of poststructuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze are intentionally designed to defy summary. Their ‘rhizomatic’ (infinitely bifurcating) form renders it impossible to generate a totalizable, self-consistent system from them. They are nevertheless highly ordered and produce concrete effects, including situated meanings and verifiable propositions. It is, in fact, the particular form of their openness which, far from consigning them to slippery irrelevance, charges them with pragmatic power. The pragmatic dimension of the works of Deleuze can be brought out by analyzing the process of their reception, rather than attempting to isolate their content as a closed system. In the encounter between the reader and the work, the work can be seen as performing its own content. That ‘content’ is conceptual, understood in a way that sharply distinguishes ‘concept’ from ‘proposition’. For Deleuze, the concept is a dynamism. It conveys a force that is real without ceasing to be ideal. This makes the encounter with the work a literal ‘event’ in which something always new transpires. Thus alongside situated meanings and verifiable propositions, the work also produces ‘becomings’. Becoming, for Deleuze, can only be grasped as a function of an open system, and with reference to an ontological distinction between the actual and the virtual. Deleuze's emphasis on the ideal as a literal force that enters actual experience without being contained in it, that is actualized without ceasing to be virtual, that cannot but be felt but always escapes, earns his philosophy the paradoxical label of ‘transcendental empiricism’. </jats:p>",

In such a planning problem, a plant configuration, i.e., types, models, and numbers of equipment, is determined so as to satisfy required energy demand conditions and to minimize the sum of plant facility cost and input energy cost. This is a combinatorial optimization problem similar to the knapsack problem, which is hard to find an optimal configuration for due to the huge number of alternatives. In this paper, we apply a genetic algorithm to such an optimal planning problem by representing a plant configuration with bit vectors and by arranging cost functions so as to keep search performance superior against the deceptive problem. The method is implemented on a symmetric shared-memory, multi-CPU workstation, where almost linear speedup is accomplished. Its performance is demonstrated by computational examples of a cogeneration plant and comparison results with a random search and a simulated annealing method.</jats:p>",

The case-based process planner operates on general 3D prismatic parts, represented by a collection of features (eg: slots, pockets, holes, etc.). Each feature subplan is developed by the case-based planner. Then the feature subplans are combined into the global process plan for the part via a hierarchical plan merging mechanism. Abstracted feature subplans correspond to cases, which are used in subsequent planning operations to solve new problems. The abstracting and storing of feature subplans as cases is the primary mechanism by which the planner learns from its previous experiences to become more effective and efficient. The computer-aided process planner is designed to be extensible and flexible through the effective use of object-oriented principles.</jats:p>",

In case of sheet-metal bending operation planning, processing a search node involves extensive geometric reasoning and many other types of complex computation steps.

In this scheme, we eliminate unnecessary computation at the time of node generation by extracting the required information from already generated nodes. Although generation of two different search nodes rarely involves identical computation steps, there is considerable overlap in node generation steps. We have divided the node generation step into a number of computation subproblems. When we need to generate a new node, we first try to see if any of the node generation subproblems have been solved for any of the already generated nodes. If any subproblem has already been solved for some other node, then we use the solution of that subproblem to save computation time. In such cases, we do not perform node generation computation steps, and therefore we call such node generation virtual.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The scheme presented in this paper increases the node generation capability and allows us to generate many more search nodes.

I will discuss the ways that by consciously refusing ‘mastery’ in both the academy and its research practices, ‘minor’ research strives to change theory and practice simultaneously, and I will suggest that these practices can be conjoined with the critical and transformative concerns of Marxism, feminism, antiracism, and queer theory to pry apart conventional geographies and produce renegade cartographies of change. </jats:p>",

The enormous pressure which these developments have had on public systems in general - sanitation, sewage, housing, health care and transport, has forced many cities to think of innovative ways of handling these crisis. Planning departments with substantial expertise in urban problems, are being set up or are being re-organized to meet these new challenges. The powers that planning departments have, and their impact on the lives of ordinary citizens cannot be over-estimated. To prevent abuse of power and to make them responsive to the needs of citizens, several methods are used to control them. Judicial review of administrative actions is the legal method used to control many public bodies in English speaking West African countries. In this article, I shall argue that in spite of its strengths, there is a general tendency to use judicial review to protect common law values like individual proprietary rights against the claims of state institutions. In West Africa, because of the weakness of public institutions, the intervention of the law, while protecting important private rights may hamper administrative effectiveness. Anticipating the use of the leading English case, Cooper v Wandsworth2 in reviewing planning decisions in West Africa, I shall conclude that such a position may not only diminish administrative effectiveness, but it may also diminish property rights.KEY WORDS: Planning, Administrative Effectiveness, Common Law in West Africa, Cooper v Wandsworth, Statutory Interpretation. </jats:p>"

Operation planning includes tool selection, machining parameter selection, and tool path generation. An object oriented approach to program structure is adopted, whereby features, operations and tools, inherit behaviors and attributes from the appropriate class-hierarchies for the part, the manufacturing operations, and tooling classes. A detailed example is presented illustrating the operation planning search algorithm. Scripts are generated by the individual machining operations for execution on a machine tool. Tooling information is maintained in an object-oriented database through the FAR libraries for Common LISP. Examples of particular process plans show that the inherent trade-offs between specified precision and machining time can be investigated. An Open Architecture Machine Tool (MOSAIC-PM) has been used to machine the parts created by the feature based design and planning system. The novel contributions of this paper relate to the demonstration of “seamless” links between, a) design, b) planning, and c) actual fabrication by milling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Several Design for Assembly (DFA) methodologies have already been introduced both in research and industry, among which methodologies having quantitative assemblability evaluations are more favored in industry. The evaluation criteria involved in such quantitative measures are only concerned with the difficulty of performing assembly operations one by one. These measures are then combined by a formula to find the total product evaluation. Accordingly, the designer can improve the total assemblability by redesigning the parts that caused bad measures. It can be observed that a major effect of cascading several assembly operations in a certain order on the remaining operations to complete the product assembly is neglected by most DFA evaluation methodologies. Actually, this effect might result in serious difficulties while generating the assembly sequence usually done at a later stage in most industrial firms. To overcome these difficulties, this paper introduces some elementary insights to the integration of assembly design and planning. A systematic feature-based method is introduced to find the precedence assembly constraints and the global evaluation constraints resulting from operations cascading orders. A modified genetic algorithm that finds the best assembly sequence based on these constraints and on the traditional DFA evaluations is then introduced to be included in the DFA procedure. This genetic planner generates a more representative evaluation of the product assemblability by considering the effects of operations orders. As a result, feedback reflecting the actual assembly process difficulties can be given to the designer to improve the product design, while simultaneously generating the best sequence to assemble the product.</jats:p>",

If there is a large undercount, these techniques may be accurate enough for adjustment. With a small undercount, it is unlikely that current adjustment methodologies can improve on the census; instead, adjustment could easily degrade the accuracy of the data.

Zero runoff crop production systems can protect surface and ground water and use water, fertilizer, and labor resources more efficiently. However, scarce capital and fear of new technology are impediments to change. Our objectives were to characterize decision making and profitability related to zero runoff systems. Managers of 80 greenhouse operations with zero runoff systems in 26 states participated in a survey designed to gather information on the costs–benefits of adoption and production changes and issues related to zero runoff systems for greenhouse operations. The survey results revealed that some adjustments of production practices were essential when adopting zero runoff systems. It also appeared that greenhouse operators believe they are achieving the intended outcomes and efficiencies from their investment. Size of the operation appeared to be closely linked to the growers' willingness to adopt this new technology. Important reasons for making the decision of adopting zero runoff systems were to improve quality of productions, cut production costs, increase production efficiency, and respond to public concern for the environment. Two thirds of the operators surveyed found that special employee training in the operation of zero runoff systems was required. Most employers found in-house training was adequate for their needs. Operators verified that a significant learning curve slows implementation of zero runoff production Adjustments of cultural practices coupled with good production management were keys to growing zero runoff successfully.</jats:p>",

When a certain number of sectors is taken out of the input—output matrix one obtains a cross. It is shown that the Leontief-inverse for a cross can be decomposed into the product of three matrices, OUT*INTRA*IN, where INTRA represents all intracross economic interactions, IN represents all effects from the rest of economy upon the cross, and OUT represents all effects from the cross upon the rest of economy. Furthermore, we present a general scheme of additive as well as multiplicative decompositions of the Leontief-inverse, reflecting the hierarchical decomposition of the matrix of input coefficients into the sum of crosses. These decompositions provide us with the means to find new insights into efficient aggregation, importance of regions, and issues of industrial complexes in inter alia input—output analysis. </jats:p>",

The kitchen operates in this paper as far more than a functional site in the home. It is a multifaceted concept which shows the nexus of the flow of energy between body politics, the state, and its key organ, the family. Official discourses of gender, family, motherhood, education, and employment flow through this unbound space of the kitchen. Here the kitchen is far more than architecture, it is a concept which defies material limits to become a space of domestic fantasies, both homely and unhomely, of the family and the nation-state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The prevalence of a culture of ‘tolerance’ towards ethnic minorities in the West in the face of the practices of ‘ethnic cleansing’ in Eastern Europe and of other more general practices of intolerance and extermination in parts of the Third World has led to a popular as well as a sometimes academic conception of ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ nationalisms essentialised into two radically different kinds of nationalism. In this paper I offer a critique of such a differentiation based on an examination of various practices of dealing with otherness in the process of nation building, particularly in Lebanon and Australia. I argue that practices of nation building, ranging from the promotion of ethnic cultures to mass ethnic killings, are guided by national imaginaries which, despite their empirical variety, are basically structured in the same way. This means, first, that such differences are better understood as the historical or contextual privileging of specific nationalist problematics grounded in this common national imaginary. Second, it means that within the nationalist imaginary that guides them there is a space in which, in given circumstances, the practitioners of valorisation and tolerance can turn into practitioners of mass killings and vice versa without them turning into a radically different kind of nationalists. Far from being specific to an ‘Eastern’ nationalism, the logic of extermination is inherent to any form of nation building today. </jats:p>",

There are marked urban—rural differentials in fertility and, as a result, the pace of urbanization has significant effects on population growth. In this research an attempt is made to model urban—rural population growth in China. A demoeconomic model of urban and rural sectors is calibrated to account for the long-term trend of urbanization in China. Two important components of urban population growth—rural to urban migration and transition—are considered. In previous research, rural to urban population transition was ignored and thus urbanization levels may be significantly underprojected. An accounts-based urban—rural population model, in which rural to urban migration and transition are driven by the foregoing demoeconomic model, is established in this research. These models are used to make urban—rural population projections for the period 1988–2087 under various fertility rate assumptions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the relative amount of money firms spend on hospitality trade shows as compared to other marketing activities (such as direct mail and display advertising) and evaluates whether hospitality-industry exhibitors are maximizing the value of their trade-show participation. Six activities were identified as contributing to trade-show success (and, presumably, cost effectiveness): (1) integrating trade shows into an overall marketing plan; (2) establishing specific and quantifiable objectives for each show; (3) planning show strategies and actions far in advance; (4) promoting the company's participation to prospective customers beforehand; (5) selecting and training personnel; and (6) following up with show visitors. A survey of 200 companies found that the size of a company's trade-show budget and the existence of planned, quantifiable objectives for trade-show participation increased the show's value to the company. The key objectives of hospitality exhibitors were generating and qualifying sales leads. Such sales-related activities require advance planning and the commitment of sufficient funds to do them well. Planning for the show includes motivating potential buyers to attend the show, to visit the company booth, and to be receptive to the notion of doing business with that particular firm. As such, the booth's presentation and the information disseminated there by knowledgeable, well-trained attendants must be first-rate and, ideally, more creative than competing exhibitors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I argue that urban-policy evaluation makes little or no difference to the lives of the communities which are the recipients or targets of urban-policy projects. In particular, I will show how processes of policy evaluation are alienating both for communities and for researchers alike. This is related, in part, to the socioinstitutional contexts within which evaluation takes place but, as importantly, to the utilisation of evaluative (broadly positivist) models which conceive of the process as socially and politically neutral. Such approaches, as I show, are poorly sensitised to the evaluative contexts. It is suggested that a more fruitful, although not necessarily unproblematical, way to produce sensitised, and relevant, evaluative methods is to change what Oliver terms “the social relations of research production”. This involves the development of what some social scientists are terming an emancipatory research paradigm. In the paper such issues and their implications for urban-policy evaluation are explored. </jats:p>",

A review of available literature suggests two main exploratory themes. The first establishes the key features of business planning in the private sector. The second theme discusses the problems of adapting this approach to the distinctive requirements of the public sector. The literature also suggests three dimensions for evaluating planning: incremental-developmental; reactive-proactive; ends-means. </jats:p><jats:p> Qualitative data were collected by scrutinizing relevant organizational documentation and by discussions with focus groups formed by participants in the planning process. The data were analyzed against eight key elements of a business plan identified from the literature and from panels of business experts. These elements were found to be present in the Hospital Authority's plans but were less evident in hospital level plans. Because of the unitary nature of hospital organization in Hong Kong, it has been difficult for hospitals to break out of a reactive, incremental and ends-based pattern to a more imaginative identification of the distinctive business and market that they may be in. This is, however, changing rapidly and it is clear that there is in place a robust and ‘seamless’ health care management process. </jats:p>",

The economic activity generated by and conducted through LETS is based upon direct forms of social relations and a local currency which facilitate locally defined systems of value formation and distinctive moral economic geographies. Nevertheless, LETS take on some of the class and gender characteristics of the wider economy. Furthermore, the ways in which LETS are represented—not least in the media—may serve to stereotype them as exclusionary and marginal to the needs of those most in need and so to distance them from those excluded from the formal economy. </jats:p>",

Straightforward application of published table of <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> values, which are for standard‐size homogeneous activity sources in a standard‐size body geometry, is not sufficient for accurate RIT dosimetry calculations. A new, fast, and functional treatment planning approach is developed that considers heterogeneous activity distributions. Calculation of the three‐dimensional absorbed dose distribution requires convolution of a cumulated activity distribution with a point‐source kernel; both represented by large matrices. To reduce the computation time required, a novel implementation of convolution using FHT is realized. Absorbed dose calculation time was reduced from 80 hours to 5 minutes. Volume measurement error has a direct impact on the absorbed dose calculation when mean activity information for an organ is used. Since identification of the tumor and other organs of interest is time‐consuming, a semi‐automated segmentation toolkit is developed. It is now possible to determine the volume of a structure in half the time with the same accuracy. The developed system was used to calculate and display as isodose contours the absorbed dose distribution in a patient's tumor and for a bone marrow sample.

Both spatial and nonspatial measures of separation are used to estimate the model. Travel time was found to provide improved fits over linear distance in modeling patient flow behavior. Transformations of travel time (square root and log) were found to improve model performance further. Model diagnostics suggested additional spatial separation measurw, separation measure parameters demonstrated stability over time. The model is used to forecast the effects of health care financing reform and hospital closure on patient flows in an urban hospital market. Universal health coverage was found to dramatically improve access to hospital services for lower income patient populations. Hospitals at risk for closure were forecast to receive increased patient flows. Medical school hospitals are expected to lose patients after implementation of health reform, with important implications for graduate medical education. Hospital closures were shown to have negative effects on access to services in poor neighborhoods, but relatively little effect on access in the system as a whole.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With its recent opening to the global market economy, the natural resources of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, referred to in this paper as Laos) – especially its water resources–have attracted external interest and investment. The overall level of water development is low. While even modest development would help Laos meet some of its urgent needs, past experience in Southeast Asia and other tropical regions suggests that fast‐paced water development may damage the natural resource base. This article examines some efforts in water development from Southeast Asia and other regions and their relevance to water policy formulation in Laos. Future social and environmental changes in Laos are inevitable, but the nature and direction of these changes are uncertain. It thus makes sense to design policies that are flexible and can be adjusted to, and even take advantage of, a changing social and environmental context. Smaller‐scale, deliberately‐paced projects which merge local knowledge and external expertise fulfil the requirements of flexibility and adjustability, and are also appropriate for other important reasons: they do not require massive inputs of funding, and they do not initiate large‐scale environmental and socio‐economic changes. Current knowledge of the complex ecological and social systems in Laos is only sketchy. A slower‐paced development will allow developers the necessary time to learn more about these important aspects.</jats:p>",

LETS are local associations whose members list their offers of and requests for goods and services in a directory and then exchange them priced in a local unit of currency. From the results of a national survey of LETS, it is found that LETS are growing rapidly and that a high proportion of the national membership are poor and unemployed. With use of a membership survey of Manchester LETS, it is then revealed that, although the poor and unemployed are capitalising on LETS to gain access to work and credit, it is utilised mainly by what can be called the ‘disenfranchised middle class’. In this paper it is advocated that, for a wider cross-section of the poor and unemployed to become involved, changes are needed not only in the internal operating environment of LETS but also in the approach of the government towards benefit claimants working on such systems. </jats:p>",

Variations in material conditions of struggle over local state policies and procedures, both within and between localities, contribute to the uneven development of practices of dissent and to ‘fragmented’ or contradictory experiences of gender and class relations in and against local states. The meanings assigned to these experiences and how they are incorporated into political identities, views, and action strategies play a vital role in determining whether and how collective opposition to gender and class biases in local states will proceed. Two Canadian examples are used to illustrate this approach to understanding gender and class formation in local states. The first example is that of recent feminist and working-class struggles within Ontario's legal-aid clinic system. The second example is that of the development of a women-only housing cooperative in Hamilton, Canada. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> What is space? What is spacing? And how does spacing itself hold together? The author pursues these questions, which continue to haunt and transfix geographers, by drawing upon the collaborative work of two exemplary thinkers: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. What emerges from such an encounter is a fundamental shift in the way space, place, and spacing are configured; a shift which will have enormous implications for anyone concerned with unfolding the relationship between society and space. Particular emphasis is placed on the radicalization of relations, of the spacing of relations, and of relational space. Such a radicalization effectively deconstructs the field of geography as we know it, and demands that we reconfigure both the world and our theoretical-practices ‘from the middle’. This yields a world of continuous variation, becoming, and chance, rather than one of constancy, being, and predictability; and it is populated solely by hæcceities, singularities, and events, strung together through joints, intervals, and folds. Accordingly, a fractal world of infinite disadjustment, destabilization, and disjointure is what is meant by the term ‘scrumpled geography’, and it constitutes the horizon on which one should situate deconstruction, postmodernism, and poststructuralism more generally. Unfolding the joints, intervals, and folds of such a world is precisely the task undertaken by Deleuze and Guattari. However, the author reworks their own undertaking by giving it a much more explicitly spatial inflexion and consistency. Thus, the paper not only clarifies the scrumpled geography embedded within the work of Deleuze and Guattari, it also demonstrates the revolutionary implications of a rigorously deconstructive and poststructuralist consideration of space, place, and spacing. </jats:p>",

The personal interviews and standardized surveys generally produced convergent results, but the personal interviews also revealed a significant amount of conflict about members’ conceptions of the LEPC's mission, external role relationships, and staffing.
