      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a growing body of findings that individualistic achievers incur punitive social costs in the workplaces of collectivistic and equalitarian cultures, little attention has so far been paid to measuring such motivational gravity in psychometrically appropriate ways. From egalitarian Australia, reports psychometric data from two organizational surveys, evaluating the 20‐item “Tall Poppy Scale” (TPS), a Likert instrument which measures attitudes towards high achievers in society, and the twin‐item “Motivational Gravity Scenario Scale” (MGSS), which focuses instead on behavioural intentions towards high achievers in one’s own workplace. In Study I, involving 80 employees of a retail chain, scores on the TPS were significantly and positively associated with social desirability effects on the Marlowe‐Crowne Scale, whereas the MGSS remained free of such confounding. In Study II, 47 employees of a major service organization rated the MGSS as significantly more satisfactory than did 49 university undergraduates, who preferred the TPS. Workplace scenarios may be more appropriate than the conventional Likert TPS for describing organizational cultures, but recommends the development of multiple‐item instruments for assessing individual differences in motivational gravity.</jats:p>",

At the data model and knowledge representation level, many systems of this kind constitute a marriage of the relational data model and the rule‐based reasoning. Experience has shown that either approach is restricted in the way it can express the demanding information and knowledge structures required for applications like decision support systems. Two new technologies offer an exciting new integrated approach to knowledge management. Object‐oriented database management systems (OODBMS) provide an object model that supports powerful abstraction mechanisms to facilitate the modelling of highly structured information. Whereas case‐based reasoning (CBR) systems are knowledge bases which organise their capabilities around a memory of past cases and the notion of similarity. Both types of system are built upon two fundamental concepts: 1) the retrieval of entities with potentially complex structure, called objects in the former, and cases in the latter type of system; 2) the organisation of those entities in collections with common characteristics. In an OODBMS such collections are termed extents, and in CBR they are usually called categories. In either system, the conceptual meta notion to represent both, objects as well as extents, and cases as well as categories, is the class.</jats:p><jats:p>Revolving around a Conceptual Case Class and extending a standard object model, this paper proposes a novel and general approach to represent case‐knowledge and to build KBMSs. The work presented here is a spin‐off of the design of an object query language within the ESPRIT project Lynx.</jats:p>",

The most cost-effective solution is to create optimal aerobic and anoxic conditions within the existing reactor volumes. The IAWQ-model No. 1 was used for the simulation of the biological reactor. A measuring campaign and some specific respirometric tests provided the necessary information for calibration and verification of the biological model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The study consisted of two parts: 1) increase of the denitrification capacity, and 2) optimisation of operation. First, the impact of three measures, i.e. creation of anoxic zones, implementation of step feeding and introduction of internal recirculation, was evaluated by means of simulation. For this purpose a standard time variant influent was defined based on the measuring campaign. This approach made it easy to compare the different scenarios.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the second part of the study some specific problems were handled. To avoid high nitrate concentrations during weekends three possible control actions were simulated. The simulation study also evaluated the usefulness of the primary clarifier in the upgraded design and the effect on the biological process of first flush during intensive rainfall.</jats:p>",

Hydrologically effective rainfall is predicted from temperature and precipitation for each season based on site specific formulae developed using the Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System (MORECS) and UK Surface Water Archive databases. Comparisons are then made between the effects predicted for the scenarios established from equilibrium simulations and the new Hadley Centre High Resolution Model (UKHI) transient mode results. Though very different, both suggest increased stress on water resources late in the hydrological year.</jats:p>",
