Four types of information systems — the expert system, the traditional statistical system, the integrated problem-oriented system of databanks and the all-comprehensive databank — are described and their advantages and disadvantages summarised. The interrelationships between type of society and planning on the one hand and between planning and information systems on the other hand are discussed and a combined type of information system (experts plus traditional statistics plus databanks) is recommended. The use of norms and indicators is discussed and the structure and weak points of the various approaches in planning are described, To some extent, normative (deductive) planning is practicable in any type of society, but in many areas inductive planning is better suited to modern industrialised societies. In any case, information is a prerequisite to systematic planning. Health affairs are considered to be one of the elements of general national information systems, but the greater part of health-related information can be used for administrative and practical decisions on a lower level only. Suitable decentralisation prevents too great an escalation of combinations and makes it possible to fulfil the main requirement: to give adequate and objective service to all those who have to make decisions.</jats:p><jats:p>The construction of an information service based on »system analysis« is recommended which pays special attention to decisions, and an example from the hospital field is given. The producer-orientation of the information system presented is noted and the necessity for more consumer-oriented complementary systems for basic problems related to matters of health and our mode of living is stressed.</jats:p>"

The presurvey was made to obtain demographic information and data on the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of family planning among the population and their exposure to the various media. The media campaign was directed at those couples who because of their media behavior and previous experiences with contraception were thought to be predisposed to adopt modern family planning methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The health services system in Finland is analyzed from the point of view of planning–oriented activities. Society has traditionally been the main provider of services in this country, and executive responsibilities of local autonomous authorities are balanced with the centralized control carried out by legislative measures and subsidies. An organized information system is a prerequisite to planning (this is especially true in a country with Finland's type of organizational structure). The Finnish system is based on problem–oriented data banks. Health interview surveys which link social background data with health–related information have a key role in this system; these surveys are well suited to before and after comparisons. Information is capable of producing action only if it is properly analyzed and timed. In order to obtain information about actual goal expectations of the decision–makers, the special–purpose planning departments are located at a high level of government in Finland. Typical methods of implementation, such as financial subsidies, are described in this paper, and economic estimates and long–term budgeting are given as examples of guides for the central authorities. The use of before and after studies to measure the effect of the policies is described, and some observations on the weaknesses in the present system are presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past 15 years health planning has received a great deal of attention, and a large number of conferences, seminars, and papers have been devoted to this fascinating subject. However, because of a lack of guidebooks based on practical experience, many health agencies, especially those in developing countries, are afraid to embark upon sophisticated and costly procedures. Instead, they continue to use the “rule of thumb” in deciding on easy solutions in order to please local authorities. Health services have been compared to a tangled skein. The present paper suggests a practical approach to begin to disentangle the situation. Total health programs could be divided into three main parts: (1) environmental control and community protection, (2) personal preventive services, and (3) curative services, including rehabilitation. Each of these three main components should be defined and clear borders between them should be delineated because the methods of planning differ in each case. Leaving aside the first sector because it is in fact the responsibility of many government agencies, methods of assessing and planning personal preventive services are studied separately from those which could be applied to curative services. The distinction between these two last sectors is that between needs and demands. Warnings are given against easy oversimplification and ignoring of methodologic problems which could result in failure of the best theoretical health plan. Finally, health planning is within the reach of any health agency, even those in developing countries. </jats:p>",
