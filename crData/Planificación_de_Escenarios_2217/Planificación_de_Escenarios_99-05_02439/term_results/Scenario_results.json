      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Third world countries, including India, lack sophisticated investigations to assess the progression of HIV disease. Hence, this study was undertaken to determine the clinical mucocutaneous markers of HIV disease and to establish its relationship with the stage of the disease. This was an observational institutional study of 75 patients with mucocutaneous disorders and HIV infection recruited over a period extending from September of 1996 to June of 1998. The patients with mucocutaneous lesions were staged according to the Centers for Disease Control classification system for HIV infection (1986). The most frequent mode of acquisition of HIV infection was heterosexual contact (96%). The patients were broadly categorized into two groups. The AIDS group was comprised of patients who were in group IV and the early HIV infection group included patients in group II and III; none were detected in group I. Forty‐eight cases belonged to the AIDS group, and 27 belonged to the early HIV infection group. A total of 207 dermatoses were diagnosed and grouped as fungal, viral, bacterial, or miscellaneous. The common mucocutaneous disorders in order of frequency observed in this study were: candidiasis, dermatophytosis, herpes simplex, oral aphthae, xerosis/ichthyosis, scabies, HPV infection, molluscum contagiosum, and psoriasis. Xerosis/acquired ichthyosis and giant molluscum contagiosum were characteristically seen in group IV of HIV disease, whereas oral candidiasis, oral aphthae, papular dermatitis of HIV, and psoriasis were early warning signs. The mean number of dermatoses per patient in group IV was 3.15; in group III, it was 2.41; and in group II, it was 1.5. There was a statistically significant difference between the early HIV infection group and AIDS group with regard to number of dermatoses. Apart from syphilis and human papilloma virus infection, the treatment outcomes were satisfactory.</jats:p>",
