However, a second and third glance reveals that it is a very complex concept. Some of the complexity is inherent to the nature of the phenomena associated with density, but part of the complexity stems from the different ways in which density is defined and used in different countries and different disciplines. This review of the literature presents this complexity in an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the concept and a more careful approach to its use. The review includes both academic and practice literature from the planning, urban studies, and environment-behavior disciplines and selected planning documents from countries around the world.</jats:p>",

The main objective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities. </jats:p>",

The readings are grouped into nine broad categories in this bibliography: community development and neighborhood planning; economic development planning and regional economics; environmental and natural resources planning; housing, real estate development, and zoning; international planning and development; physical planning, urban design, and historic preservation; planning theory, history, practice, and education; public policy and human services planning; and miscellaneous readings. The bibliography is by no means an exhaustive list of sources on these topics. It reflects the material that was employed by planning academicians primarily in the mid-1990s. </jats:p>",

The focus herein is on fatigue crack damages in North Sea structures.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A Probabilistic Inspection Analysis tool, PIA is presented. PIA is based on a probabilistic fracture mechanics model of fatigue crack growth as well as a simplified systems reliability approach. This approach makes it possible to systematically include the information achieved by inspection of the actual as well as other structures. PIA provides information about where and when to perform inspections to detect fatigue crack growth and thereby initiate repair actions that are found to be necessary.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The use of PIA has generally given a 70 to 80 percent reduction of the inspection programmes. Improved fatigue analysis and use of PIA has also increased the number of fatigue cracks that are detected by a factor fo 3 to 4.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Comparisons between observed fatigue crack growth and predictions by PIA have revealed shortcomings. Improvements of the methods and data used in PIA are discussed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Traditionally, PIA has been used to recommend the frequency of EC/MPI inspection for welded structures. During the last years, PIA has also been applied to define inspection programmers based on flooded member detection (FMD).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Adequate safety of offshore structures is achieved by applying ultimate (ULS) and fatigue (FLS) limit state criteria for components as well as accidental limit state criteria (ALS) for the global structure, Ref. 19. Fatigue is an important consideration for structures in areas with more or less continuous storm loading (such as the North Sea).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In addition to design measures, inspection, monitoring, and repair, if necessary, are important measures for maintaining safety, in particular with respect to fatigue, wear, and other deterioration phenomena. However, significant costs of underwater inspections make it important to properly prioritize and limit inspections. Moreover, in-service experiments with the actual as well as other structures should be utilized. Hence, at the design stage, design and inspection planning should be carried out to achieve an optimal balance of the different safety measures. In addition, the inspection programmer (methods, frequency, and repair strategy) needs to be sequentially updated, especially based on the specific inspection results that become available during operation. Obviously, more favorable performance than design predictions indicate is especially beneficial in connection with possible extension of the service life.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In practice, the additional information that becomes available during operation can be used to update the fatigue assessment, primarily in three alternative ways:Deterministic SN model: well suited for new design. However, inclusion of information from inspections is difficult since the Miner damage can not be directly measured. Also, if a joint is repaired to re-establish its initial state, using SN curves as for a new joint is questionable. The information on the development of damage vs. time is not utilized.Deterministic Fracture Mechanics (FM) model: the model facilitates quantities relating to damage that are directly measurable, e.g. cracks. The model may be calibrated to reproduce the crack growth history before failure of the joint considered. However, since the most common inspection result is no finding, the model will often not be applicable.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

A \nparticular strength of the technique is that it provides optimal paths to all locations in the \nfield, thus being useful in situations where the goal is not known at the outset of the search. \nDetails are presented on the basic technique and extensions are derived to include the \nintegrations of resources (such as fuel store), and to provide flexibility in the objective. Two \nexamples are given: minimum-time planning for vehicles under the influence of drift, and \nplanning to minimise the risk of detection for a stealthy vehicle in the presence of threats.</jats:p>",

The field is located in Green Canyon Blocks 160, 161, and 205 in the Gulf of Mexico. The development wells will be drilled and completed from the spar located in Green Canyon Block 205 in 2590 feet of water.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The discovery well was drilled in 1988 and several delineation wells followed in the early 1990's. Development funding was approved in early 1996.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A semi-submersible rig was used to batch set 36, 26, and 20 inch casing strings on 19 wells. The seafloor well pattern included locations for 20 wells and two export riser bases. One of the well locations in the pattern is actually one of the early delineation wells and was not included in the batch set program. Spacing between locations is 20 feet in a 140-foot diameter circle.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A shallow water flow zone was successfully isolated on all batch set wells. The 26-inch casing was set just above the shallow water flow zone. Deepwater foam cementing was used to cement the 20-inch casing, set below the shallow water flow zone. A wellhead isolation system was also used to shut off the shallow water flow zone.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In addition to the batch setting operations, the semisubmersible rig was used to drill the first two development wells with 9-5/8 inch production casing set at total depth. The batch setting and drilling of these first two wells was completed in the summer of 1997.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The spar was installed in early summer of 1998 followed by topsides and rig installation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new approach to migration in developing countries is used in this paper, which integrates into the migration process the experiences of moving to cities, working in urban areas, and returning to the countryside. As a result, rural labor migration is directly linked to rural development through remittances, as well as through physical and human capital brought back by return migrants. Migration information is mainly drawn from China's 1995 1% National Population Survey. Findings from other recent migration surveys are also incorporated. It has been found that patterns of temporary migration are mainly shaped by the magnetic force of the growth-pole region. Job opportunities created there in labor-intensive industries have attracted large numbers of migrants, first from the surrounding rural areas and then from the peripheral regions, enhancing migration propensity in both areas. As a result, migrations from the periphery to the growth-pole region become the largest interregional flow. With respect to the effects of temporary migration on the development of the rural origin, it is found that the enhancing effect of migration on net income is large. In some relatively poor provinces, migrants' net income can even outweigh the provincial rural net income. More importantly, a return trend has recently emerged. About 4 million migrants returned to rural areas in the early 1990s, bringing back both physical and human capital. The volume is increasing, with returnees playing a crucial role in the development of rural areas in the peripheral regions. </jats:p>",

The results of a recent survey assessing current levels of involvement in cross‐organizational collaboration among firms utilizing automatic inventory replenishment are presented. The results provide strong support for positive associations between high levels of CPFR and implementation of operating process change and information system capabilities.

An important aspect of the argument is the importance of differentiating associations by the types of their members because this reflects their demand orientation and their decisionmaking structures. Associations of companies (traditionally termed trade associations), individuals (traditionally termed professional associations), owner-managers, mixed member types, and federations are each different types of member bodies. The estimates in the paper, using new survey evidence, confirm the significance of these distinctions and demonstrate the different factors explaining association membership size, density of encompassing of members (as a proportion of the number of businesses in their sector, and the proportion of the sector's turnover), as well as the membership joining and lapsing rates. The results generally confirm the dominance of the logic of influence on trade associations and the logic of services on other associations. The role of sector concentration, association age, association size, and management structure are also shown to be significant explanatory variables for some association types. </jats:p>",

This difference is generally attributed to such factors as source placement errors, overestimation of the prostate volume on CT, and post‐implant edema. In the present work we investigate the impact of edema alone. In routine prostate implant planning, it is customary to assume that both the prostate and seeds are static throughout the entire treatment time, and post‐implant edema is not taken into consideration in the dosimetry calculation. However, prostate becomes edematous after seed implantation, typically by 50% in volume [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. <jats:bold>41</jats:bold>, 1069–1077 (1998)]. The edema resolves itself exponentially with a typical half‐life of 10 days. In this work, the impact of the edema‐induced dynamic change in prostate volume and seed location on the dose coverage of the prostate is investigated. The total dose delivered to the prostate was calculated by use of a dynamic model, which takes edema into account. In the model, the edema resolves exponentially with time, as reported in a separate study based on serial CT scans [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. <jats:bold>41</jats:bold>, 1069–1077 (1998)]. The model assumes that the seeds were implanted exactly as planned, thus eliminating the effect of source placement errors. Implants based on the same transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images were planned using both <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0005\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0006\" /> sources separately. The preimplant volume and planned seed locations were expanded to different degrees of edema to simulate the post‐implant edematous prostate on day 0. The model calculated the dose in increments of 24 h, appropriately adjusting the prostate volume, seed locations, and source strength prior to each time interval and compiled dose‐volume histograms (DVH) of the total dose delivered. A total of 30 such DVHs were generated for each implant using different combinations of edema half‐life and magnitude. In addition, a DVH of the plan was compiled in the conventional manner, assuming that the prostate volume and seeds were static during treatment. A comparison of the DVH of the static model to the 30 edema corrected DVHs revealed that the plan overestimated the total dose by an amount that increased with the magnitude of the edema and the edema half‐life. The maximum overestimation was 15% for <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0007\" /> and 32% for <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0008\" /> For more typical edema parameters (a 50% increase in volume and a 10 day half‐life) the static plan for <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0009.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0009\" /> overestimated the total dose by about 5%, whereas that for <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8585-math-0010.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8585:mp8585-math-0010\" /> overestimated it by about 12%.</jats:p>",

It is argued that within existing research on retailer—supplier relationships the innovative capacity of retailers, their competitive strategies, and the radical ways in which they have reorganised the food supply chain remain insufficiently problematised. Against this background, I employ notions of culture, identity, and strategy in order to embrace the imaginative and creative energies which fuel the dynamism of corporate practice at the retailer—supplier interface. Corporate interviews concerning food retailers' own-brand supply relationships are drawn upon in order to ground an understanding of these energies in the organisational realities of material practices. The multiple ways in which these own-brand supply relationships are initiated and negotiated are argued to be deeply embedded in the historically and geographically specific competitive conditions which constitute the food industry, as well as being endowed with the capacity to transform the meaning of production, circulation, and consumption of food in Britain. </jats:p>",

It has long been known that large metropolitan areas have become integrated among themselves into the national economy, but it has been assumed that small centers remain focused on local and regional links. This study uses 1996 data from Federal Express Corporation to measure flows of packages to and from 18 pickup and delivery zones for the area served by Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport to 41 large US metropolitan areas. Although the rural and small pickup and delivery zones do not generate or attract the high magnitude of flows of large metropolitan areas, the data show that, by a variety of measures, the small centers are remarkably strongly tied to the uppermost level of the US metropolitan hierarchy. </jats:p>",

However, questions remain about the most appropriate geographic scales and time lags for these models. In this paper we estimate a well-known adjustment model for a recent 25-year period in the USA. Regional population and employment changes (levels and densities) are examined at three scales (states, Bureau of Economic Analysis regions, counties) using various time lags (one to ten years). Two-stage least squares regression estimates, based on Regional Economic Information System data running between 1969 and 1994, are generated and discussed. Analysis is restricted to the core relationships between population and employment; the roles of other exogenous variables, normally included in adjustment models, are not considered. Instead, concern is focused on issues such as stability and directional causality of the interacting population—employment systems. Some brief suggestions regarding future research conclude the paper. </jats:p>",

These were carried out in England and Wales between 1983 and 1996. Using geological maps as a base these studies have developed two types of applied geological maps: thematic maps dealing with particular topics and summary maps bringing together many of the earth science factors relevant to planners and developers. The recommendations made by Geomorphological Services Limited (GSL) in 1985 in a previous review of these studies are summarized. The output, type and range of information, and its potential users are compared. Each study is assessed, with respect to the GSL recommendations, in terms of its content and usefulness, based in part on how it has been received by users. The main types of summary and thematic maps are described and guidance given on their content and presentation. The importance of maps in providing the key interface between earth scientists and planners is discussed, in particular the significance of map scale, use of colour and accuracy of the geological lines. Good practise is illustrated by reference to examples.</jats:p>",

In this view, the clinician and nature are partners in seeking the ideal. In the modem biological model, variation is accepted as the natural form; ideal occlusion is the exception rather than the rule, and the orthodontist and nature are often adversaries. The orthodontist's task is to achieve the occlusal and facial outcomes that would most, benefit that individual patient, whose esthetic concerns are often paramount. Because the soft tissues largely determine the limitations of orthodontic treatment, from the perspectives of function and stability, as well as esthetics, the orthodontist must plan treatment within the patient's limits of soft tissue adaptation and soft tissue contours. This emerging soft tissue paradigm in diagnosis and treatment planning places greater emphasis on clinical examination of soft tissue function and esthetics than has previously been the case, and new information in these areas is required.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Quantitative examinations of internal representations for arm trajectory planning: minimum commanded torque change model. A number of invariant features of multijoint planar reaching movements have been observed in measured hand trajectories. These features include roughly straight hand paths and bell-shaped speed profiles where the trajectory curvatures between transverse and radial movements have been found to be different. For quantitative and statistical investigations, we obtained a large amount of trajectory data within a wide range of the workspace in the horizontal and sagittal planes (400 trajectories for each subject). A pair of movements within the horizontal and sagittal planes was set to be equivalent in the elbow and shoulder flexion/extension. The trajectory curvatures of the corresponding pair in these planes were almost the same. Moreover, these curvatures can be accurately reproduced with a linear regression from the summation of rotations in the elbow and shoulder joints. This means that trajectory curvatures systematically depend on the movement location and direction represented in the intrinsic body coordinates. We then examined the following four candidates as planning spaces and the four corresponding computational models for trajectory planning. The candidates were as follows: the minimum hand jerk model in an extrinsic-kinematic space, the minimum angle jerk model in an intrinsic-kinematic space, the minimum torque change model in an intrinsic-dynamic-mechanical space, and the minimum commanded torque change model in an intrinsic-dynamic-neural space. The minimum commanded torque change model, which is proposed here as a computable version of the minimum motor command change model, reproduced actual trajectories best for curvature, position, velocity, acceleration, and torque. The model’s prediction that the longer the duration of the movement the larger the trajectory curvature was also confirmed. Movements passing through via-points in the horizontal plane were also measured, and they converged to those predicted by the minimum commanded torque change model with training. Our results indicated that the brain may plan, and learn to plan, the optimal trajectory in the intrinsic coordinates considering arm and muscle dynamics and using representations for motor commands controlling muscle tensions. </jats:p>",

The main findings are as follows. First, the propensity to make fast return migration is negatively affected by the level of education and positively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that those with a limited labor-market knowledge and an unsuccessful job search are more prone to make a return migration. Second, the propensity to make fast onward migration is strongly enhanced by the number of previous moves and negatively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that more experienced and more successful previous migrants are more prone to make an onward migration. Third, those whose reason for the previous migration was job search are more likely to make a fast return migration than those whose reason for the previous migration was job change or job transfer, which suggests that those who have secured a job at the destination before moving are less likely to be disappointed and to make a fast return migration than those who migrated before securing a job. Fourth, gender selectivity in fast onward migration is very strong in terms of both overall level and age pattern, which reflects the strong dominance of patriarchal ideology on Taiwanese society. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors examine the impact of civil service reform on work and employment in the civil service. The research is based on an analysis, at the national scale, of secondary-source employment data, and a case study of civil service employment in the North East of England. Important gender dimensions to employment change are demonstrated. Nationally, job losses have been concentrated in full-time work in lower administrative grades—where women predominate. In contrast, women have benefited from the growth of part-time work, again in more junior grades, and there has been less substantial employment growth in middle-ranking posts. Job loss has also been concentrated in certain geographic areas, predominantly London and a few major administrative centres in peripheral regions. A study of selected civil service departments in one of these locations, the North East of England, demonstrates that continual organisational change, intensification, and associated ‘incentivisation’ of work, as well as a growth of contracting out to the private sector, has created a climate of uncertainty and instability in the civil service. The authors also demonstrate that different salaries and conditions of service are evolving in quasi-independent agencies. They speculate about the geographical implications of such a breakup of the civil service. </jats:p>",

Those models have been tested in Great Britain on many occasions, though the data employed rarely allow detailed exploration of all aspects of the many interrelationships suggested. In particular, the great majority of studies are cross-sectional in nature, and although most produce the same general findings, indicating stability in attitudes and their links to behaviour at the aggregate level, they do not allow study of whether such stability is also characteristic of individuals. With data provided by the first four waves of a large panel study of British adults (the British Household Panel Survey) this first paper in a series exploring the stability of attitude—behaviour links over time tests five hypotheses regarding the interrelations among attitudes, party identification, and voting (or voting intention) during the period 1991–94, and finds very strong support for all five. </jats:p>",

It is claimed that in small enterprises, where the success depends on the skill of individual employees and their ability to collaborate, the manufacturing performance can be improved by the use of the appropriate information technology (IT) tools and the appropriate planning and control structure, designed and developed on the basis of these holonic concepts. Such novel tools and planning structures must provide the most appropriate information in a way that enhances collaborative activity within the business and strengthens the role of the individual. This paper identifies a number of major requirements that must be considered for the design and implementation of an effective production planning and control (PPC) structure, tailored for the needs of small enterprises. Based on these requirements and the use of holonic manufacturing concepts, a novel distributed autonomous real-time planning and control structure is presented. The final sections of the paper describe the implementation of such a planning and control structure within a typical configuration for the production facility of a small metalworking enterprise. </jats:p>",
