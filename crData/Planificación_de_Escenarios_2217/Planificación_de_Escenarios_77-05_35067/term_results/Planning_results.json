In this review I will concentrate on describing, collating and appraising the recent work which has been called <jats:italic>Manpower Planning</jats:italic> and the definition of the subject will therefore be the net coverage of the work reviewed. As an aid to the reader unfamiliar with the subject, the following preliminary definition is offered as a starting point: “Manpower planning is a strategy for matching future manpower numbers and skills with organisational activities”.</jats:p>",

The effect of clinic locations more than doubled between 1969 and 1971, partly due to increased demand.

Consequently, problems like temporal autocorrelation have received much attention. Recently the attention of econometricians has also concentrated on spatial autocorrelation, particularly in the field of spatial interaction models. The existence of spatial autocorrelation among spatially dispersed phenomena appears to lead to significant differences in the treatment of multiregional models. In this paper, attention will be focused on the formal aspects of dynamic spatial diffusion models. Some statistical measures for temporal-spatial autocorrelation will be constructed. In addition, a formal derivation of necessary extensions in estimation procedures for dynamic multiregional econometric models will be presented, particularly in the field of seemingly unrelated regressions and instrumental variables. The analysis will be illustrated by means of a dynamic explanatory model for the spatial dispersion of foreign workers in The Netherlands. </jats:p>",

The latter component is defined here as voting power, and an analytical procedure is outlined which investigates the distribution of power. Application of the procedure to three EEC institutions—the Council of Ministers, the European Assembly, and the European Parliament—indicates clear disparities between the distributions of votes and of power, which have implications for national sovereignty. </jats:p>",

This investigation is necessary because the cause and effect relationship between the level of noise exposure and noise response is confounded by personal and situational variables. Examination of the effects of these variables on response to road traffic noise with the use of data collected at residential sites in Southern Ontario suggests the following points for residential planning decisions. Arguments for taking no action to reduce noise impact are not supported. The sex, age, and socioeconomic compositions of residential areas are not important considerations for implementing measures to reduce noise impact. Life-style characteristics of residents on the other hand do affect response to noise. Methods to reduce noise must be effective indoors and outdoors to have a significant effect on attitudes: air conditioning alone is inadequate. Noise barriers appear to be more effective for improving attitudes than their noise reduction properties would suggest. </jats:p>",

For each year over a planning horizon the program determines what types and sizes of generating plants should be constructed, so as to minimize total discounted cost while meeting reliably the system's forecasted demands for electricity. The problem is formulated as a large-scale, chance constrained, mixed integer program. The solution algorithm employs Benders' Partitioning Principle, a mixed integer linear programming code, and a successive linearization procedure. Computation costs are low and, in the important area of sensitivity analysis, the program offers special economies which make it attractive to power system planners. Computational results are presented for a full sized generation planning problem for the six New England states where the algorithm is currently being used for planning generating facilities. </jats:p>",

The measure is compared to those obtained by counting ‘cordon crossings’. It is seen that a measure obtained in this way agrees with the one proposed if the cordon crossings are weighted by the reciprocals of the cosines of the incidence angle. </jats:p>",

Use of these varying methodological approaches allows observations both on research strategies for migration studies and on substantive findings concerning place attributes. Relative to the latter, a two-step process is proposed. </jats:p><jats:p> The first stage of the migration process is identifying a set of alternative destinations in comparison with the former place of residence. Although all thirteen attributes are important in the abstract, housing, jobs, schools, and health care facilities are particularly critical should trade-offs be necessary. Nearness to home and shopping would be traded off most readily, as would ‘city lights’ amenities, which are generally regarded as important in migration literature. </jats:p><jats:p> In the second stage, a destination is chosen. Attributes appear to function primarily as threshold conditions in this process. Thus, Columbus and the second choice were both perceived as dramatically different from the former place of residence, but were nearly identical to one another. In this context personal contacts in a potential migration destination are apparently crucial in confirming for the migrant that perceptions of attributes are correct and in easing assimilation and adjustment problems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the use of discriminant analysis as an empirical technique for assisting the urban planner in predicting patterns of neighborhood change. A discriminant model estimated for ninety low-income census tracts within the city of Pittsburgh predicts 97% of upgrading income paths and 92% of downgrading paths over the period 1960 to 1970. Some form of the discriminant model would appear to be a useful guide to policymakers and a reasonable technique for limiting the areas of immediate policy concern. </jats:p>",

The method is illustrated by an analysis of the hypothetical effects of a hypermarket upon shops and consumers in the Reading area. Details of shop closures are derived from a simulation model, and the effects of these closures upon consumers are expressed through indices of ‘discomfiture’ and ‘loss in accessibility’. It is shown that the loss in accessibility to local shops could be widespread, but in almost all parts of the area it is only slight in importance. Further applications of, and improvements in, these methods are suggested. </jats:p>",
