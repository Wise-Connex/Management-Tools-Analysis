      "abstract": "<jats:p> Institutional economics is not a homogeneous field, but a pluralist family of approaches, all analysing institutional aspects of economic development and organization. A distinction is usually made between New Institutionalism (evolutionary economics, regulation theory and various offshoots of ‘old’ US institutionalism) and New Institutional Economics (NIE). This article examines the principal theoretical underpinnings of these currents and assesses their potential to enrich planning theory, in particular institutional planning and land-use planning theory. The author warns against injudicious marriages, especially if future spouses behave as ostriches, seeking to avoid ontological incompatibilities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Individuals, organizations, and urban regions face a complex and uncertain future. Planning is about changing the future and therefore must try to understand what is known and unknown about the future. Planning involves understanding and managing uncertainty—focusing on what is unknown as well as what is known. Uncertainty arises from the environment or planning context— environmental uncertainty—but also from the planning process itself— process uncertainty. This article builds on research and practice to identify dimensions of uncertainty in planning. Understanding these dimensions will assist planners in establishing planning processes and in managing their ongoing dynamics. To be effective, planning needs to push the bounds of possibility, and this will raise uncertainty and the possibility of disagreement and failure. </jats:p>",

The intersection of land use and transportation is that of two topics that have risen to be front and center for the planning profession. This article focuses on the manner in which planning programs and, in particular, specific courses address land use and transportation planning. After describing the context in which such courses exist, this article analyzes syllabi from fifteen courses in North American planning programs in two respects. The first examines the list of topics covered within each course by discussing the nature of primary, secondary, and peripheral topics. Second, the analysis uncovers the frequency with which specific readings are employed in each course. The article closes by discussing the nature of a land use-transportation course from the University of Minnesota in which there is a lecture and laboratory component. </jats:p>",

Baseline (n = 5,338) and end line (n = 5,502) population surveys were conducted during 1999–2000 and 2001–02 in four study sites and two control sites. Exit interviews with clients identified the socio demographic and geographic characteristics of clinic users. The results show that the clinics contributed to a 5 percent increase in overall knowledge of family planning methods and an increase in knowledge of female sterilization and the IUD of 15 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Distinct effects were found on contraceptive uptake, including an 8 percent increase in female sterilization and a 7 percent decline in condom use. Unmet need for family planning declined in two sites, whereas impacts on the other sites were variable. Although the new clinics are located within poor urban communities, users of the services were not the urban poor, but rather were select subgroups of the local population.</jats:p>",

This article provides a critical analysis of the notion of ‘dark side’ from a Lacanian and Derridean perspective. A short case study of the use of planning for what would broadly be regarded as ‘dark’ ends highlights a number of issues, particularly through engagement with Lacanian theory, which provides a useful theoretical framework for further research into the misuse of planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This review of recent studies examines the conceptual and methodological tools that are used to understand sexual behavior and HIV. Whereas surveys have provided reliable indicators of behavior, their validity is uncertain, their correlation with biological indicators tenuous, and the explanations they offer limited. Microlevel research has called into question the rationalizing, medically informed, and risk‐averse frameworks used in the public health literature on HIV and behavior, but its impact has been limited. Thus, surveys and qualitative research have proceeded along two separate tracks, and this separation has hampered our understanding of sexual behavior. A small but growing number of studies, however, provide examples of less‐compartmentalized research that avoids oversimplification. They show that expanding the models that drive research in this area is possible, and that efforts to combine disciplinary perspectives result in deeper understandings of knowledge, risk perceptions, attitudes, and behavioral change.</jats:p>",

The results are based on interviews with members of the Norwegian national assembly’s Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. In three parliamentary periods, members were interviewed about their use of results from analytic planning models evaluating the projects and strategies of three consecutive road and transport plans. It is studied how the attitudes of the politicians towards the analytic results change as the planners supply increasingly advanced means-ends models. </jats:p>",

The goal of this article is to search empirically for such robust, parsimonious indicators. In five cities, the authors analyze the interrelationships among a broad set of census tract indicators related to mortgage market activity; home prices; jobs and firms; demographic, socioeconomic, and housing stock characteristics; crime; and public assistance and health. Through factor analysis, they identify four to six neighborhood dimensions among these indicators that are common across cities. Using regression, the authors identify a parsimonious number of indicators that are inexpensive, annually updated, and available for all U.S. communities yet robustly capture significant variation in these neighborhood dimensions. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on mortgage approval rates, loan amounts, and loan applications and Dunn and Bradstreet data on businesses comprise such a set for four of the dimensions. </jats:p>",

Eighteen purposively sampled homogenous groups in Kassena‐Nankana District of northern Ghana participated in focus‐group discussions about traditional beliefs, barriers to the use of health professionals, and ways to improve obstetric care. All the groups were knowledgeable about the life‐threatening signs and symptoms of complications of pregnancy and labor. Decisions about place of delivery generally were made after the onset of labor. Accessibility factors (cost, distance, transport, availability of health facilities, and nurses' attitudes) were major barriers, whereas traditional beliefs were reported as less significant. Informants made pertinent recommendations on how to improve obstetric services in the district. These findings demonstrate that even in this district, where African traditional religion is practiced by a third of the population, compared with a national average of 4 percent, lack of access was perceived as the main barrier to seeking professional obstetric care.</jats:p>",

This study uses data recently collected from low‐income areas of the city of Recife, Brazil, to study boys' age at first sexual intercourse and factors that hinder their use of condoms. These boys become sexually active at early ages, and despite their general awareness of HIV, they rarely use condoms, especially at ages younger than 15. Sustained family involvement in guiding boys is associated with later first intercourse and an increased use of condoms. Boys who describe themselves as shy with girls have later first intercourse, although the probability of their using condoms does not differ from that of other boys of their age. Higher socioeconomic status leads to earlier sexual activity for boys (in contrast with girls), but also to a greater likelihood of using condoms during first intercourse.</jats:p>",

Counseling the client about the management of side effects is a principal approach advocated for increasing continuation. Evidence of a biological basis for variation in women's tolerance of hormonal contraceptives argues, however, that greater attention should be given to altering the product rather than principally attempting to alter a woman's ability to deal with the product. Discontinuation rates for hormonal contraceptives, largely attributable to side effects and health concerns, are high in nearly all less‐developed countries for which Demographic and Health Survey data are available. Oral contraceptives appear to be particularly problematic for Latin American women, most notably in Bolivia. Clinical trials suggest substantial variation in the physiological response to exogenous hormones, and new evidence confirms the hypothesis that the normal hormonal profiles of Bolivian women are significantly lower than those of women in the United States. These findings suggest a need for more population‐specific physiological research linked to analyses of the possible association between endogenous hormone differences and contraceptive continuation. Appropriately adjusting the level of the steroid delivered may benefit women's health and improve the acceptability and continuation of hormonal contraceptives.</jats:p>",

Much of the popular and academic literature on gated communities promotes this view.

There are gated communities composed of mostly White homeowners with high incomes that have a secure main entry—the kind of classic gated community in the public mind. But there are also gated communities that are inhabited by minority renters with moderate incomes. We expected that this dichotomy reflects a divide between gated communities, one based on status versus one motivated by concern for security. Using the 2001 American Housing Survey (AHS), we attempted to explain the differences between gated homeowners, nongated homeowners, gated renters, and nongated renter households. </jats:p>",

We look at the way in which growth controls—given fragmentation—produce “spillovers” and whether spillovers have been a principal force (process) fueling suburbanization and exurbanization in recent decades. Although the role of spillovers has received some attention recently, few scholars have launched comprehensive analyses of its impact on the contemporary urban landscape. Our spillovers-based explanation of sprawl will likely hold for metropolitan regions in which growth management/control has been imposed in the absence of statewide or regionwide coordination. </jats:p>",

This study, in contrast, argues that regulatory barriers to these approaches underpin their relative scarcity and that removal of these barriers demands no justification in proof of travel-behavior modification. Rather, such reform can improve the fit between people’s transportation-land use preferences and actual neighborhood choices. This fit is compared here between two distinct U.S. metropolitan areas: Boston and Atlanta. In providing a greater range of neighborhood types, Boston allowed a closer fit between household transportation-land use preference and actual neighborhood choice than did Atlanta. This suggests the potential gains in household choice from removal of barriers to alternative development forms. </jats:p>",

The author sought to investigate the complicated interactions between the hydrodynamics and aerodynamics of a sailboat. The type of sailboat investigated was the Olympic dinghy class called the Laser. It was the author’s understanding that at that time, no work has been completed in the area of velocity prediction for this type of sailboat. Thus, the fundamental goal of this thesis was to develop a velocity prediction program specific to the Laser. In order to accomplish the goal of creating a velocity prediction program, multiple essential pieces of the data were needed. In particular, the hydrodynamic resistance data, aerodynamic drive and side force data, and hydrodynamic side forces were needed. To determine the dynamic trim of the dinghy, a series of experiments were conducted. In addition, a data acquisition system was developed in which full scale tow testing could be done. Next, a complete tow test series was conducted for the Laser. The aerodynamic sail coefficients were derived from Marchaj’s Aero-Hydrodynamics of Sailing. To determine the hydrodynamic side force, a two dimensional approach was employed. The coding of the velocity prediction program was done using Microsoft’s Visual Basic 6.0 and Excel 2000. The algorithms published in the 15th Chesapeake Sailing Yacht Symposium and Principles of Yacht Design pertaining to velocity prediction were used as a baseline. Finally, validation and verification was performed with the shareware program PCSAIL.</jats:p>",

The study empirically examines the implementation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Los Angeles and compares its spatial characteristics with the public investments associated with the place-based Enterprise Zone (EZ) program.

Planning health services on a national, statewide, or regional basis has multiple considerations to be taken into account and can be an overwhelming task. There are many key stakeholders including politicians, policy-makers, planners, purchasers, providers, practitioners, patients, potential patients, and premium or taxpayers (James, 1995 ). Some of these key stakeholders have multiple investments; all have points of view, and values that they want to have considered, and too often these are diametrically opposed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the beginning of the 1990’s the European institutions have discovered the theme area “city and urban development” for themselves. Particularly the European Union and here especially the European Commission with its structural policy are dealing with the subject. The main concern of the European Union is the support of the development of integrated concepts for urban development. The previously traditional sector-specific approach and the distribution of competence and responsibilities at different decision-making levels that is associated with this has made the solution of urban problem situations more difficult. The entire European economy is suffering from this. Particularly with the AGENDA 2000 urban promotion contents have increased in importance. With the reform of the structural funds this urban development policy dimension is to experience a further revaluation after 2006 according to the intention of the Commission. Urban development is to become an explicit component of regional policy, in order to contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives in this way.</jats:p>"

This book focuses on one task implementation variable: planning. It considers theories of how opportunities to plan a task affect performance and tests claims derived from these theories in a series of empirical studies. The book examines different types of planning (i.e. task rehearsal, pre-task planning and within-task planning), addressing both what learners do when they plan and the effects of the different types of planning on L2 production. The choice of planning as the variable for investigation in this book is motivated both by its importance for current theorizing about L2 acquisition (in particular with regard to cognitive theories that view acquisition in terms of information processing) and its utility to language teachers and language testers, for unlike many other constructs in SLA ‘planning’ lends itself to external manipulation.  The study of planning, then, provides a suitable forum for demonstrating the interconnectedness of theory, research and pedagogy in SLA.</jats:p>",

Most of the experience with EOR is still in the United States, principally with CO2 flooding in the Permian Basin in west Texas and with the several thermal processes in the San Joaquin Valley in California. A listing of these projects is compiled every 2 years. But worldwide applications are growing. Thermal recovery of bitumen in Alberta, Canada, is increasing rapidly, and thermal projects have been successful in Venezuela, Indonesia, and elsewhere. Chemical and polymer floods are being implemented in China.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>New applications increasingly will be worldwide. Each one will depend on careful planning to design an EOR project specific to the properties of the oil, the reservoir conditions, and the availability of injectants. In many situations, new EOR technology will be necessary. The processes being applied in the United States were tailored for those conditions and do not necessarily translate to other geologic provinces. This article attempts to distill past experience to define the state of the art in planning EOR projects. It is grounded in more than 30 years of experience by the authors in a wide variety of EOR applications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>The Planning Process</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Successful EOR project management depends on good planning. “Prior proper planning prevents poor performance,” they say, and it is especially true when EOR is involved.

The study is based on a household survey of traffic behaviour, on an analysis of regional house building rates and on a fiscal impact analysis. The results show that the signals sent out by the fiscal system towards municipal zoning policies are not in direct contradiction with the planning goal of a traffic-avoiding spatial structure. In fact their guiding effects are not strong enough to prevent a traffic-intensive sprawl in urban regions.</jats:p>"

However, in the course of the discussions the goal of separating powers between levels of government gained more and more acceptance. This goal is hardly realisable, and it provides no sensible guideline for the development of the federal state. In view of the interdependencies between central and decentralised tasks ways must be found instead to strengthen the autonomy of the Länder governments and to improve the co-ordination between central and decentralised policy at the same time. As an alternative to a separation of power and to the economic model of competitive federalism the concept of a creative federalism is outlined here, which promotes decentralised innovations in the framework of central rules and realises a flexible allocation of competence. Such a concept of federalism has advantages particularly for spatial planning policy.</jats:p>"

They link climate, human activities and ecologic processes through groundwater and surface water interactions. For simulating these linkages an integrated regional hydrologic model has been coupled to an ecologic evaluation model. The simulated ecologic effects of climate change on mesotrophic riverine grasslands are clearly positive. Simulation results also indicate a high sensitivity of the peak discharges to the precipitation. For modelling the long-term development of land use and water management an integrated ‘bio-economic’ model has been constructed. It includes a model for the development of agriculture. Results for the autonomous development in reaction to climate change indicate a strong increase of field drainage by agriculture. This development would substantially reduce the predicted positive effects of climate change on riverine grasslands. The challenge is to guide regional developments in such a manner that opportunities for improving nature are not lost, but that at the same time the peak discharges are kept under control. Flow retardation in the ‘fine arteries’ of the upstream areas appear to be a viable option for the latter. The bio-economic model can provide help in anticipating on climate change through spatial planning.</jats:p>",

In this article particularity of strategic management approaches within institutions is revealed. Special literature does not provide clear methodological recommendations for strategic planning of institutions. Opinions of strategic management commentators are more polemic than recommendations. In the literature two essential approaches to strategic planning are provided, i.e. prescriptive and emergent. Fulfilled researches create preconditions to specify and systematize essential characteristics of approaches. Prescriptive strategic planning can be defined by sufficient foresight of future, systemic complexity, necessary definition, large possibilities of formalization, one‐sided adaptation of strategic decisions with organizational structure, petty stimulation of initiative, stable consistency of planning steps. Emergent strategic planning can be defined by petty foresight of future, fragmentary complexity, weak definition, limited formalization, double‐sided adaptation of strategic decisions with organizational structure, large creativity, unstable sequence of planning steps. This characteristics are being handled as assumptions. According to the prescriptive approach they are favorable for preparing decisions, which are oriented to increase opportunities of institution strategic accordance with its environment demands. According to the emergent approach ‐ they are favorable for preparing decisions which are oriented to emerge institution potential for opportunities used. With regard to inside and external environment factors of institution which predetermine the choice of methodology, the regularities of coherency of factors and methodologies which are suggested to apply for integral combination of approaches in specific institutions situation are defined.</jats:p>",

On top of the regular business, the branches had to cope with an unknown amount of exchange transactions of DM into euro. To avoid chaotic situations in the branches and high extra costs, the branches had to prepare themselves. It was, however, unclear what would happen and which measure would be appropriate for which scenario. The branch manager's uncertainty was high. This article shows that the system dynamics method can be successfully applied even to such non‐typical, short‐term, event‐driven problems. Using a feedback perspective, defining the problem dynamically, creating scenarios, developing models and using simulation experiments does not only help to find better strategies but also improves decision making in unique situations with a short‐term focus such as the introduction of the euro coins and notes.

Against this background the paper discusses how the findings of modern growth theory can affect the design of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The results of this analysis can be summarized as follows: (1) the existence of a geographically different growth dynamic provides an additional justification for a decentralization of political competences. (2) To cover more exactly the regional economic backward and forward linkages, especially local government authorities should intensify their cooperative behavior. (3) From the perspective of economic growth, the equalizing effect of horizontal transfers between decentralized jurisdictions should be limited.</jats:p>"

While there is a growing body of work addressing this issue in the housing sector, similar work considering the business sector is marked only by its absence. The paper describes the first substantive attempt to explore this subject area through an analysis of the impact of planning on business rents. A full structural model of a local property market was developed. It incorporates the planning regime as a key element of the system and it allows for the interaction between property market use sectors. The model formed the basis for the creation of a simplified five-equation system that could be operationalised within extant data constraints. Upon application, a local effect of planning was identified that was consistent with theory. As planning regimes become tighter, the local supply of space decreases. This has a negative effect on local economic activity and a positive effect on local rents. However, the results must be much qualified. The study was affected by various limitations relating to data, to the geography upon which the model was based and to its cross-sectional character. Nevertheless, the work makes a contribution to the development of a theoretically robust model for analysing and estimating the effect of planning on the property sector of the local economy. </jats:p>",

To address this issue, a scenario (i.e., macro-level approach) for modeling and analyzing projects with significant uncertainty in their network structure and/or durations of some activities is presented. This approach requires that a set of project network scenarios is able to be identified, each with an assessed probability of occurrence. These scenarios might differ according to the results of uncertain events that could occur during the course of the project, uncertain activity durations (whether independent or dependent), finite loops where repeated activities can have different durations, or a combination of these. Advantages of our approach include the use of standard methods and software, as well as greater accessibility to, and likelihood of, the use of uncertainty analysis in project planning. Several examples are used to illustrate the suggested approach. </jats:p>",

They have been implemented by TNC in more than 30 ecoregions across the U.S., and work is expanding to include other parts of the Americas. The tools are now in their second iteration. While the first version of the tools worked only with the RF3 hydrography dataset available in the U.S., the second version is more flexible and will function with a variety of datasets. Future improvements in the tools could include an improved interface and improved algorithms to reduce data pre‐processing needs. The GIS tools, documentation, and data from completed ecoregions are now publicly available on the Internet.</jats:p>",

The author uses this debate as a springboard for examining the position of English in Malaysia. This is done within the framework of the development of non-Anglo Englishes (Schneider 2003a). Whilst there is much evidence pointing to the indigenisation of the English language and an acceptance of it to represent a Malaysian identity, especially in situations of mixed ethnicity, it is interesting to note that much of the debate appears to stay clear of these issues and instead emphasises the international, as opposed to the Malaysian, status of English. The paper proposes some reasons for this silence and suggests that this might problematise a characterisation of English in Malaysia in the manner of Schneider.</jats:p>",

Este contacto multicultural y multilingüe diario ha creado la necesidad de uso de una lengua común entre aquellos implicados en el ámbito marítimo, con el fin de aumentar la eficacia en las comunicaciones y asegurar un correcto funcionamiento de este sistema comercial. Pero el comercio por vía marítima no supone sólo una actividad económica de intercambio, sino que implica también una forma de vida particular, principalmente para aquellos encargados de la navegación y maniobra de los buques, donde la terminología utilizada para las comunicaciones diarias es específica y única de este ámbito, y donde en la eficacia de estas comunicaciones puede estar en juego la seguridad de las personas y la integridad del medio ambiente marino. Es con esta idea de mejorar la seguridad en las actividades marítimas que la Organización Marítima Internacional (OMI) ha desarrollado una serie de normativas internacionales que regulan el uso de la lengua inglesa como lengua común para este ámbito en las comunicaciones buque–buque y buque–tierra. Sin embargo, considerando que esto no es suficiente, sino que es necesario conocer la problemática de las comunicaciones a bordo, nos hemos propuesto realizar el siguiente análisis de las necesidades comunicativas en las tripulaciones multilingües, que nos ayudará a entender mejor cómo y porqué surgen problemas comunicativos entre los tripulantes, y como estos problemas pueden afectar en la operatividad normal del buque y poner en peligro la seguridad del mismo y, por lo tanto, de su tripulación.</jats:p>",

We then examine the extent to which rooming houses provide low-income tenants with ‘homes’, drawing from in-depth interviews with rooming-house tenants living in Hamilton, a city of 450 000 people in southern Ontario, Canada. Our analysis raises concerns about the capacity of rooming houses to provide affordable and stable accommodation. Poor living conditions and poor relations with rooming-house landlords worked directly against the capacity of rooms to offer private, controllable spaces and a degree of ontological security. Analysis also raised concerns about rooming houses as sites for social relations. Many respondents saw rooming houses as unpredictable and sometimes unhealthy social spaces, forcing them to seek other environments to cultivate and sustain relationships with friends and family. In general, respondents' experiences point to the shortcomings of rooming houses as ‘home’ environments, with implications for the health and social lives of the tenant population. Conceptual and policy implications are discussed in conclusion. </jats:p>",

HAZUS-MH estimates financial losses resulting from a 100-year flood by analyzing the potential direct and indirect economic damages that could occur in a local jurisdiction. HAZUS-MH Flood Model and Hurricane Wind Model was used to estimate losses in the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as part of the jurisdiction’s hazard mitigation planning process. Depth grid maps and flood loss maps are explained and displayed to show the results of the flood hazard and loss analysis. The article evaluates HAZUS-MH against the criteria of quality, timeliness, and completeness. The different levels of HAZUS-MH are explained within the context of accuracy.

However, the material involvement of service users in mental health research is still in its infancy. The aim of this paper is to attempt to place these developments in a conceptual context, to summarise the ethics-based and evidence-based reasons why it has to be considered as necessary, and to illustrate some of the emerging evidence which shows the advantages to be gained from it. In particular the results of recent studies are briefly reported, showing that outcomes data rated by service users in some cases are more important than those rated by staff. The reduction in patient-rated <jats:italic>unmet needs</jats:italic> in the social domain was the strongest predictor of an increase in subjective quality of life. The importance of including service user preferences within the content of the research questions is exemplified by the results of a recent study that showed that joint crisis plans can significantly reduce the use of compulsory admission during crises and by a review that demonstrated that the use of an explicit service user perspective produced distinctive insights into the long-term effects of Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Declaration of Interest</jats:bold>: none.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to investigate school-based occupational therapists’ knowledge of transition planning, their degree of participation in assessment and intervention of students requiring transition services, and to identify potential barriers limiting therapists’ participation in transition services.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHOD. Using survey methods, a questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of therapists listed as members of the School System Special Interest Section of the American Occupational Therapy Association. Eighty therapists from all geographical regions within the continental United States and who identified themselves as working with students 13–21 years of age in an educational setting, participated in the study. The response rate was 20%.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS. The majority of participants reported that they understood the terminology associated with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990 and the 1997 IDEA amendments definitions of transition planning at the secondary level, but were less likely to apply that knowledge to the transition planning process. The majority of therapists reported minimal participation in secondary education transition planning assessment and intervention for students with disabilities. Most respondents believed that they were not contributing to the transition planning process in a manner that maximized their skills, and identified several barriers that they believed hindered greater participation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSION. This pilot study suggests that occupational therapists may not be participating in transition services to their fullest potential. While the low response rate in this study precludes generalization, this information is important to guide further study as well as to shape efforts to increase occupational therapy’s role in this important service area within school-based practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Spatial decentralization is a common measure used by public planners to redistribute urban social and economic activities in order to resolve escalating problems such as crowdedness, pollution, and high cost of living in the central cities. Findings from studies assessing the changing rent gradient of cities, and probability of development around suburban centers, provide insights to the various impacts of spatial decentralization policies. The author makes use of global and local spatial auto-correlation statistics and seeks to explore the spatial clustering of property values in the context of polycentric urban development. Data were collected from the property sales transaction database in Singapore and analyzed employing geographic information systems and spatial statistics. Empirical results suggest that there was a remarkable redistribution among the planning regions as regards the number of condominium projects in the 1990s, which was in line with the polycentric urban development policy. A decline in the global Moran's I indicates a change from a strong to a relatively weak positive clustering. However, the local Moran statistics show that a spatial pattern of property-value clusters continued during the study period. Findings of this research capture a market signal indicating that the spatial distribution of property values may not readily follow planning guidelines, at least in a given short time frame. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new Pinnacle 3D treatment‐planning system software release has recently become available (v7.4, Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA), which supports modeling of rounded multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf ends; it also includes a number of other software enhancements intended to improve the overall dose calculation accuracy. In this report, we provide a general discussion of the dose calculation algorithm and new beam‐modeling parameters. The accuracy of a diode dosimeter was established for measurement of MLC‐shaped beam profiles required by the new software version by comparison with film and ion chamber measurements in various regions of the field. The results suggest that a suitable diode or other small volume dosimeter with appropriate energy sensitivity should be used to obtain profiles for commissioning the planning system. Film should be used with caution, especially for larger field profile measurements. The dose calculation algorithm and modeling parameters chosen were validated through various test field measurements including a bar pattern, a strip pattern, and a clinical head and neck IMRT field. For the bar and strip patterns, the agreement between Pinnacle calculations and diode measurements was generally very good. These tests were helpful in establishing the new model parameter values, especially tongue‐and‐groove width, additional interleaf leakage, rounded leaf tip radius, and MLC transmission. For the clinical head and neck field, the comparison between Pinnacle and film measurements showed regions of approximately 2 cGy under‐ or overdose. However, the Pinnacle calculations agreed with diode measurements at all points to within 1 cGy or 1% of the maximum dose for the field (67 cGy). The greatest discrepancy between film and diode measurements for the clinical field (maximum of 2.8%) occurred in low‐dose regions in the central part of the field. The disagreement may be due to the overresponse of film to scattered radiation in the low‐dose regions, which have significant shielding by the MLCs.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.53.Bn, 87.53.Dq</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of a power function as a cost function in inverse planning optimization. The cost function for each structure is implemented as an exponential power function of the deviation between the resultant dose and prescribed or constrained dose. The total cost function for all structures is a summation of the cost function of every structure. When the exponents of all terms in the cost function are set to 2, the cost function becomes a classical quadratic cost function. An independent optimization module was developed and interfaced with a research treatment planning system from the University of North Carolina for dose calculation and display of results. Three clinical cases were tested for this study with various exponents set for tumor targets and sensitive structures. Treatment plans with these exponent settings were compared, using dose volume histograms. The results of our study demonstrated that using an exponent higher than 2 in the cost function for the target achieved better dose homogeneity than using an exponent of 2. An exponent higher than 2 for serial sensitive structures can effectively reduce the maximum dose. Varying the exponent from 2 to 4 resulted in the most effective changes in dose volume histograms while the change from 4 to 8 is less drastic, indicating a situation of saturation. In conclusion, using a power function with exponent greater than 2 as a cost function can effectively achieve homogeneous dose inside the target and/or minimize maximum dose to the critical structures.</jats:p>",

A considerable body of research has addressed this burgeoning demographic over the past 20 years. Although some variations appear within etiological subgroups, the biological processes of aging and related concerns (e.g., changes in health status) are similar for people independent of whether a person has an intellectual disability. The unique life experiences of individuals with intellectual disabilities, however, introduce social and environmental factors and practices that affect healthy aging and life quality, but are less well understood. As such, later‐life planning is an accepted, although not always practiced, mechanism used and directed by adults without disabilities to plan for their futures in later life. Planning for this life stage among older adults with intellectual disabilities, if it is done at all, typically is a parent/family‐driven process with a limited scope of focus (e.g., guardianship, financial security). Drawing on previous research in the areas of later‐life planning and leisure education, the authors present a conceptual rationale for melding these two processes and propose principles and content elements that could facilitate the use of <jats:italic>leisure education as a framework for</jats:italic> holistically exploring later‐life options and issues.</jats:p>",

Surprisingly, the effects of travel time and location have not been formally investigated. The authors do so, following developments in the environmental economics literature, by presenting estimates of individual travel cost models for multiplex and nonmultiplex cinemas. A key finding is that travel time has a significant negative effect on nonmultiplex cinema trips, but that this does not hold for multiplex trips; reasons for this are advanced. In the case of multiplex cinema trips, a range of phenomena relating to minimising time-cost uncertainty are shown to be significant. The authors also contribute to an explanation for the ‘overscreening’ phenomenon observed in the United Kingdom and the USA, which has led to the closure of some relatively recently built multiplexes. </jats:p>",

Using Coles's rethinking of the politics of generosity, we interrogate ethos in terms of three ideal types—Christian caritas, secular humanism, and postsecular charity—concluding that the principal fault-line in current services divides organisations which expect particular behavioural outcomes from homeless people (including Christian ‘conversion’ and more secular assumptions of self-responsibility), and those which provide care regardless of individual response. </jats:p>",

Housing policies in Third World countries have also emphasised the provision of physical infrastructure and buildings, and urban aesthetics. In this paper the authors draw on the voices of young informants from Maseru (Lesotho), and Blantyre (Malawi), who, in discussions concerning moving house, chose to talk about social and economic aspects of life in the informal sector rented accommodation that is increasingly characteristic of these and many other African cities. The children offer insight into the peopling of urban space, mapping unruly environments characterised by disorder, gossip, and social contestation, far removed from the hard technocratic spaces imagined by planners. Their observations are important not only because children represent a very large and relatively neglected proportion of African urban dwellers but also because they offer a unique insight into the dynamic character of urban environments. As close observers of adult decisionmaking processes, children are informed commentators on motivations for moving house as well as the impacts of urban environments on their own lives. Not only do the children highlight the inadequacies of the informal private rental sector but they also offer a window onto why it is inadequate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Four‐dimensional (4D) radiotherapy is the explicit inclusion of the temporal changes in anatomy during the imaging, planning, and delivery of radiotherapy. Temporal anatomic changes can occur for many reasons, though the focus of the current investigation is respiration motion for lung tumors. The aim of this study was to develop 4D radiotherapy treatment‐planning methodology for DMLC‐based respiratory motion tracking. A 4D computed tomography (CT) scan consisting of a series of eight 3D CT image sets acquired at different respiratory phases was used for treatment planning. Deformable image registration was performed to map each CT set from the peak‐inhale respiration phase to the CT image sets corresponding to subsequent respiration phases. Deformable registration allows the contours defined on the peak‐inhale CT to be automatically transferred to the other respiratory phase CT image sets. Treatment planning was simultaneously performed on each of the eight 3D image sets via automated scripts in which the MLC‐defined beam aperture conforms to the PTV (which in this case equaled the GTV due to CT scan length limitations) plus a penumbral margin at each respiratory phase. The dose distribution from each respiratory phase CT image set was mapped back to the peak‐inhale CT image set for analysis. The treatment intent of 4D planning is that the radiation beam defined by the DMLC tracks the respiration‐induced target motion based on a feedback loop including the respiration signal to a real‐time MLC controller. Deformation with respiration was observed for the lung tumor and normal tissues. This deformation was verified by examining the mapping of high contrast objects, such as the lungs and cord, between image sets. For the test case, dosimetric reductions for the cord, heart, and lungs were found for 4D planning compared with 3D planning. 4D radiotherapy planning for DMLC‐based respiratory motion tracking is feasible and may offer tumor dose escalation and/or a reduction in treatment‐related complications. However, 4D planning requires new planning tools, such as deformable registration and automated treatment planning on multiple CT image sets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the relationships between class and gender in the context of current debates about economic change in Greater London. It is a common contention of the global city thesis that new patterns of inequality and class polarisation are apparent as the expansion of high-status employment brings in its wake rising employment in low-status, poorly paid ‘servicing’ occupations. Whereas urban theorists tend to ignore gender divisions, feminist scholars have argued that new class and income inequalities are opening up between women as growing numbers of highly credentialised women enter full-time, permanent employment and others are restricted to casualised, low-paid work. However, it is also argued that working women's interests coincide because of their continued responsibility for domestic obligations and still-evident gender discrimination in the labour market. In this paper we counterpose these debates, assessing the consequences for income inequality, for patterns of childcare and for work–life balance policies of rising rates of labour-market participation among women in Greater London. We conclude by outlining a new research agenda. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Varian 120 multileaf collimator (MLC) has a leaf thickness of 5 mm projected at the isocenter plane and can deliver a radiation beam of large field size (up to 30 cm) to be used in intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Often the dose must be delivered to depths greater than 20 cm. Therefore, during the commissioning of the BrainSCAN v5.21 or any radiation treatment‐planning (RTP) systems, extensive testing of dose and monitor unit calculations must encompass the field sizes (1 cm to 30 cm) and the prescription depths (1 cm to 20 cm). Accordingly, the central‐axis percent depth doses (PDDs) and off‐axis percentage profiles must be measured at several depths for various field sizes. The data for this study were acquired with a 6‐MV X‐ray beam from a Varian 2100EX LINAC with a water phantom at a source‐to‐surface distance (SSD) of 100 cm. These measurements were also used to generate a photon beam module, based on a photon pencil beam dose‐calculation algorithm with a fast‐Fourier transform method. To commission the photon beam module used in our BrainSCAN RTP system, we performed a quantitative comparison of measured and calculated central‐axis depth doses and off‐axis profiles. Utilizing the principles of dose difference and distance‐to‐agreement introduced by Van Dyk et al. [Commissioning and quality assurance of treatment planning computers. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993; 26:261—273], agreements between calculated and measured doses are <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20012-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20012:acm20012-math-0001\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20012-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20012:acm20012-math-0002\" /> for the regions of low‐ and high‐dose gradients, respectively.

For a given field size, the disagreement increased with the depth. Similarly, for a given depth the disagreement also increased with the field size. These large systematic errors were caused by using the tissue maximum ratio (TMR) in BrainSCAN v5.21 without considering increased field size as depth increased. These errors have been reported to BrainLAB.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.‐j</jats:p>",

The purpose of this investigation was to examine variation among faculty in diagnosis and management of common periodontal diseases. Twenty‐seven clinical instructors (periodontists, general dentists, dental hygienists, and first‐ and second‐year periodontal graduate students) reviewed three web‐based cases and answered a brief questionnaire focusing on radiographic interpretation, periodontal diagnosis, and treatment planning. Response rates for the three cases ranged from 62 percent to 70 percent. Clinical instructors’ rating of percent bone loss in the majority of cases varied between three descriptive categories for the same tooth. Greater consistency in periodontal diagnosis was noted within the graduate student group as compared to periodontal and dental hygiene faculty groups. Diagnoses offered for one of the three patients varied between gingivitis and chronic and aggressive periodontitis. Six to nineteen different treatment plans (many with subtle differences) were submitted for each of the three cases. Inter‐rater variation was qualitatively more prevalent than intra‐rater variation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document substantial variation among instructors in radiographic interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment planning for common periodontal diseases. Qualitative judgments speculating on the impact of variability among dental school faculty on student performance and patient care can be made but as yet remain unknown. Consistent use of accepted practice guidelines and greater consensus‐building opportunities may decrease variation among faculty and enhance dental education.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

To that effect, the predictive performance of the Albatross model, which incorporates nine different facets of activity–travel behavior, based on the original full decision trees, is compared with the performance of the model based on trimmed decision trees. The results indicate that significantly smaller decision trees can be used for modeling the different choice facets of the sequential model system without losing much in predictive power. The performance of the models is compared at three levels: the choice-facet level, the activity-pattern level (comparing the observed and generated sequences of activities), and the trip-matrix level, comparing the correlation coefficients that determine the strength of the associations between the observed and the predicted origin–destination matrices. The results indicate that the model based on the trimmed decision trees predicts activity-diary schedules with a minimum loss of accuracy at the decision level. Moreover, the results indicate a slightly better performance at the activity-pattern and the trip-matrix level. </jats:p>",

However, in Taiwan relatively little attention has been given to this with respect to vulnerable groups of people, such as those with intellectual disabilities (ID). Using a structured questionnaire, posted to all disability service programs (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 157) caring for people with ID, the authors examined the perceptions of directors of service programs for people with ID with respect to health planning and the development of health‐planning issues in their programs. Results indicate that although most respondents agreed with the importance of health planning and concurred with the specific health‐planning issues identified by the authors, there was a gap between perceived importance and satisfaction with how these issues were being dealt. The three greatest gaps were observed in “hearing and vision screenings,”“routine meetings on health issues,” and “regular dental health checkups for the ID population.” Using an opportunity calculation to prioritize the most promising health‐planning areas, the authors found that “emergency planning and practice,”“routine meetings on health management,”“planning for infectious disease control,”“regular oral health checkups,” and “hearing and vision screenings” were the areas with greatest opportunities for further improvement in the programs. Size and auspice of the programs were not correlated to the perceived importance and satisfactions. The authors conclude that Taiwanese health authorities need to more carefully promote health planning for people with ID within disability programs so as to ensure the quality of health care and health promotion for people with ID.</jats:p>",
