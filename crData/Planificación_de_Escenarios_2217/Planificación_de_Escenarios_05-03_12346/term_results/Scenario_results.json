      "abstract": "<jats:p> All organizations and communities are strongly influenced by factors and events that lie outside their boundaries. A shared understanding of these environmental influences—in the past and the present—has been an important aspect of popular large group interventions. Traditional scenario planning has long been a way of confronting uncertainty and complexity about the future of environmental influences. Large group scenario planning is an adaptation of traditional scenario planning. Meeting for 2 or 3 days, a critical mass of an organization or a community can use scenarios of the future environment to move beyond their natural tendency to think of the future as an extrapolation of the past. Ageneral method is described, and the use of large group scenario planning by the Boston University School of Dental Medicine is presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An important component of risk management relates to project schedule uncertainty. To address this issue, a scenario (i.e., macro-level approach) for modeling and analyzing projects with significant uncertainty in their network structure and/or durations of some activities is presented. This approach requires that a set of project network scenarios is able to be identified, each with an assessed probability of occurrence. These scenarios might differ according to the results of uncertain events that could occur during the course of the project, uncertain activity durations (whether independent or dependent), finite loops where repeated activities can have different durations, or a combination of these. Advantages of our approach include the use of standard methods and software, as well as greater accessibility to, and likelihood of, the use of uncertainty analysis in project planning. Several examples are used to illustrate the suggested approach. </jats:p>",

Global warming is likely to allow range expansion of many invasive species, including <jats:italic>S. invicta</jats:italic>. We used a dynamic, ecophysiological model of fire ant colony growth coupled with models simulating climate change to predict the potential range expansion of <jats:italic>S. invicta</jats:italic> in the eastern USA over the next century. The climate change scenario predicted by the Vegetation–Ecosystem Modelling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) was used in our analyses.

As the pace of global warming is expected to quicken in the latter half of the century, however, the habitable area for <jats:italic>S. invicta</jats:italic> in 2100 is predicted to be &gt; 21% greater than it currently is (a northward expansion of 133 ± 68 km). Because the black imported fire ant, <jats:italic>S. richteri</jats:italic> Forel, occupies higher latitudes than <jats:italic>S. invicta</jats:italic>, the overall area of the eastern USA infested with invasive <jats:italic>Solenopsis</jats:italic> species could be greater than that estimated here.</jats:p>",
