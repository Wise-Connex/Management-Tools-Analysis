HYMS aims to provide a structured marketing planning\nprocess, guide a user through this process, offer expert advice at key\nstages and finally make recommendations for users in setting objectives\nand strategies. It combines the advantages of the expert system and\ndecision support system technology in order to enhance its\neffectiveness. Presents a a brief review on expert systems and decision\nsupport systems in marketing and then discusses the selection of a\nstrategic marketing planning model and software for HYMS. Describes the\narchitecture of the prototype system and the knowledge elicitation\nissues.

The investigation derives information from both secondary and primary sources and centres on three distribution dimensions, namely structure, operation and behaviour. Finds that structural characteristics are inextricably linked to the idiosyncratic demographic, economic and sociocultural environment of the Kingdom, and that operating elements are greatly affected by environmental forces, as well as by rising competitive pressures and demanding customers. Behavioural aspects reveal the powerful role of distributors/agents and wholesalers in the distribution scene, as well as signs of channel conflict and competition. Overall, the study demonstrates that the Saudi distribution system is unique, complex and transient, and one where traditional and modern elements coexist. A thorough understanding of this system, therefore, is critical in gaining a foothold in such a lucrative but difficult market.</jats:p>",

Input of patient data is either from an arbitrary spaced set of computed tomography (CT) scans throughout the treatment volume or from outlines traced on a digitizer. Any gantry, head or table rotation is allowed as well as any beam portal shape including internal blocking. Account is taken of beam modification due to the presence of the beam flattening filter, wedges and compensators. Both portal image and beam's eye view displays are readily available. A dose calculation algorithm is presented which uses a differential scatter-air ratio method to calculate the scatter dose in the presence of inhomogeneities. The beam model and algorithm form the basis of an interactive three-dimensional planning system running on a UNIX workstation, and performance times for dose calculation are given.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the motions of a planar tracked vehicle are constrained by a velocity dependent nonholonomic constraint, derived from the force equation perpendicular to the tracks. This reduces the trajectory planning problem to determining the slip angle between the vehicle and the path tangent that satisfies the nonholonomic constraint along the entire path. Once the slip angle has been determined, the track forces are computed from the remaining equations of motion. Computing the slip angle is shown to be an initial boundary-value problem, formulated as a parameter optimization. This computational scheme is demonstrated numerically for a planar vehicle moving along circular paths on horizontal and inclined planes.</jats:p>",

The application of the model provides the solar access availability in percent out of the total exposed area, for three different types of solar access, for each building separately and for the entire site. The model could be applied at the site-design stage, where it allows improvement in its energy conserving qualities. The improvement can be performed by changing the location of buildings in the site (in order to change the shadow interaction), or by changing their future utilization. The model offers a practical tool to quantify the solar energy gain on a site over a specific exposure period. The model is applied to design a site which contains twenty structures with different dimensions. Four different designs are analyzed, considering three different types of solar access. The results are then discussed and compared to demonstrate the practicality of the model for planning purposes, which are concerned with the overall site's energy-conserving qualities, and the improvement of these qualities, at the site-design stage. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the interplay between regulation and consumption is explored. Questions are posed about the regulation of consumption by the state and by private retail capital, and the way in which consumption relations influence the operation of the state either directly or through the mediative role of the retailers. We argue in general terms that, since the 1980s, it is the consumption nexus rather than that of capital and labour which has increasingly provided the most attractive location for the abstraction of surplus value and for capital accumulation; that the state had increasingly become an active agent in class formation and class relations through the sphere of consumption; that consumption processes have increased in significance in the legitimation of the state; and that, particularly in the United Kingdom, the major food retailers have played a critical role, not only in delivering new and revised ‘rights to consume’ to empowered groupings of service-class consumers, but in defining consumption interests around their own particular notions. As a result, we argue that regulation by necessity has become far more embedded than hitherto in the consumption process, and that a consideration of the regulation of retail capital offers particularly valuable insights into the regulatory influences shaping the extraction of profits from the ‘situation of exchange’. Above all, our aim is to inject a ‘political economy of consumption’ perspective into the increasing and diverse debates concerning cultural aspects of consumption. We argue, in conclusion, that it is necessary to explore how the political economy and cultural aspects of consumption interact, and how social and political practices embody both. To this end, we conclude our paper by posing questions about the next steps in what we believe is a vitally important emerging dialogue and integration between these two perspectives. </jats:p>",

Several underlying factors at the household, community, and national level and the interactive process of care were also considered. The resource constraints and trends were child characteristics; caregiver factors, including time availability; psychological, health, and nutrition status; organizational resources; and modernization and urbanization.

The planning was initiated at an early stage in the care of patients above the age of 75. The geriatric approach implies that the elderly patient's medical, functional and psycho-social needs are taken into consideration. A team consisting of a geriatrician and a qualified district nurse was responsible for the discharge planning in consultation with the patients and their relatives. One health care district formed the intervention group, while two comparable districts became two control groups. </jats:p><jats:p> The intervention proved to be effective, giving better utilization of acute hospital beds through reduced numbers of bed-blocking patients, shorter waiting times for bed-blockers and reduced expenditure for district health authorities who were financially liable for that group. This was true even when the cost of the intervention was included. The results show how vital it is that discharge planning initiated at an early stage becomes standard practice in the acute care of the elderly. Collaboration with the district nurse is necessary for continuity, exchange of information, optimal assessment of care requirements and planning for discharge and follow-up after return to the home. Geriatric consultation at an early stage in the care episode, with assessment of geriatric-medical factors and rehabilitation requirements can contribute to more efficient care and discharge planning, especially for patients “at risk” at the discharge. </jats:p><jats:p> In times when economic incentives are gaining increasing significance, a balance must be struck between an efficient use of resources, by choosing the right type of care at the right time, and the needs of the patients, with their right to autonomy and a say in their own care. </jats:p>",

An alternative perspective is proposed in which animals are regarded as a marginal ‘social’ group discursively constituted and practically affected by human communities, and as a group which is thereby subjected to all manner of sociospatial inclusions and exclusions, The argument is that animals should be seen as enmeshed in complex power relations with human communities, and in the process enduring geographies which are imposed upon them ‘from without’ but which they may also inadvertently influence ‘from within’. The implications of adopting such a perspective require careful examination, but in the second part of this paper some possibilities are raised though substantive vignettes of animals as a social group included in or excluded from the city. Particular attention is paid to 19th-century debates about meat markets and slaughterhouses, wherein can be detected a will to exclude livestock animals from cities such as London and Chicago on a variety of grounds (medical and hygienic, organisational and moral).</jats:p>",

A similar kind of reduction is common in many semiotic analyses of shopping malls and in studies of advertising which assume an audience's readings rather than investigating them empirically. Drawing on field research in north London, we provide evidence from focus group discussions of the social use of shopping centres and of the multiple meanings of such apparently mundane activities for the consumers themselves. Five themes are highlighted concerning skill, style, and shopping; shopping as a source of pleasure and anxiety; shopping as a socially situated activity; consumers as knowing, active subjects; and shopping as a highly and complexly gendered activity. These themes illustrate that the consumption process condenses many aspects of our contemporary identities including the dynamics of class and ethnicity, gender and generation, and the cultural politics of space and place. </jats:p>",

The spatiality is the specific organisation of space through which that subjectivity is constituted and through which it sees the world, a problematic described here as a space of self/knowledge. The importance of a particular organisation of space to this particular subjectivity is introduced through the work of Irigaray, and elaborated with reference to Mulvey's account of the Lacanian mirror stage. Both Mulvey and Irigaray emphasise the importance of a distancing, visualised space to dominant masculinities. However, Mulvey and Irigaray have both been criticised for conceptualising this dominant subjectivity and his visual space in ways which leave little possibility for feminist disruption. These criticisms have been made from a diverse range of theoretical-political positions. In this paper, however, I engage specifically with the visual space of phallocentric space/knowledge, and therefore only explore the critical possibilities offered by other, more recent feminist appropriations of Lacan because these have centred precisely on questions of visuality, spatiality, and subjectivity. In particular, interpretations of Lacan's distinction between a certain organisation of space and what Lacan calls ‘the gaze’ arc drawn upon here in order to theorise both the fragilities of dominant masculinities and the existence of other visualised spaces of self/knowledge. It is thus argued that certain psychoanalytic feminisms can offer a critical account of phallocentric self/knowledge, which is also a critical account of the production of visual spatialities. </jats:p>",

We argue that retailers are in the business of creating particular urban landscapes and that qualitative differences are emerging between areas as consumption centres. By focusing on the spatial outcomes of the complex mediation between retailers, advertisers, and consumers, we examine the complex political-economic relations which enable the production of consumption. The project is thus an attempt to mesh production-oriented and culturally derived understandings of consumption and identity. </jats:p>",

This study evaluates New York City's Child Immunization Day (1993), with emphasis on the cost and effects of a mass campaign and the use of strategies from developing nations in an inner-city context. METHODS. The methodology was designed to (1) document the planning and implementation process, (2) analyze the number and characteristics of children in the target group, and (3) estimate costs. RESULTS. Neither the social mobilization nor the political will that characterize successful campaigns in developing nations occurred in New York City's campaign. Despite substantial time and effort from both private and public agencies, turnout for the event was low. In total, 2647 families and 5237 children were assessed for health care and insurance needs, 2949 children were immunized at a cost of about $279 per immunized child, and 7236 vaccines were administered. CONCLUSIONS. The differences between inner cities and developing nations have a bearing on strategies used in planning and implementing mass campaigns. New strategies need to be forged from a blending of these contexts to create effective campaigns in industrialized inner cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper an exploration is made of the potential offered by combinations of computing and telecommunications technologies (known as ‘telematics’) for supporting a shift from competitive to collaborative urban policies in Europe. First the context for such policies is set by an analysis of the ways in which the uses of telematics by transnational corporations have helped to encourage ‘zero-sum’ competition between cities and localities for investment. The resultant competitive telecommunications-based policies of cities are then discussed and criticised. Then, a review is provided of emerging examples where telematics-based policies are being explored as supports for interurban collaborative policies, first at the national, regional, and cross-border level, and then at the international and trans-European level. In the conclusion, an assessment is made of the potential that these policies offer for supporting truly beneficial shifts towards collaborative urban policymaking. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new wave of agro-industrialization has taken place in the US pork sector since the mid-1980s, Driven by changes in consumer demand and by restructuring in US meat-packing, agro-industrialization is centered around lean-meat production and involves alterations in genetics, feeding regimes, facilities construction, and management practices ‘down on the farm’, Two main expressions of intensive accumulation in US meat-packing are evident, but the lean-meat imperative is integral to both, There is a movement towards an increased scale and standardization of production as major meat-packing firms develop value-added meats for general consumption. Counter to this is the manufacture of boutique meats by firms that are poised to exploit health and food safety-related challenges to energy-intensive and capital-intensive ‘productivist’ agriculture, In this paper the current thrust of agro-industrialization in the US pork sector is examined in historical perspective, within the rise, decline, and recomposition of the postwar livestock–feed–meat complex. Attention is given to value-based marketing and pricing systems that many meat-packers have recently instituted to insure adequate supplies of lean hogs. In this paper it is argued that value-based pricing results in highly differentiated payments to producers, thus spurring demand by feeder-farmers for an array of new, commercial inputs—lean genetics, partitioning agents, medications—in hopes of refashioning the interior geography of the pig for profit. </jats:p>",

The political turmoil in local government is examined as efforts are made to capture the ‘residual legitimacy’ of the Communist Party and to replace the latent functions of the Party in coordinating the complex structure of local government. It is demonstrated that the complex centralized structure of Soviet local government still exists. It is argued that the conflict between the mayor and the city soviet has at least partly been a turf battle over whether the mayor or the city soviet will assume functions previously performed by units of the Communist Party; that, although on the surface the administrative system has been significantly altered, some units are little changed from the Soviet period; and that policy responsibilities of city government are being shaped as they assume by default residual responsibilities from the republic government and as the effects of privatization are felt. </jats:p>",

In this regard, the usual pattern of labeling, judging, and acting nearly always leads to taxonomizing or classification of people or things—sometimes resulting in benefits for the classified ‘other’, sometimes just the opposite. In this paper, the representations of the wolf in the USA during the historical period of its near extinction at the hands of private citizens and government hunters are examined. From an ecofeminist position, it is argued that indulgence in the practices of representation in those particular forms exhibited during that historical period were not only devastating to the wolf and other animals but also the same practices that perpetuated racism and sadism in the treatment of other people who were purportedly below European-American males on the hierarchy of beings. The argument contained within this paper cautions us to beware of admonitions of ‘necessity’ that creep into our thinking about the way the world must be (that is, there is no way to coexist with ‘savagery’) and encourages the examination of both cultural and economic determination of human and nonhuman animal relations. </jats:p>",

I use a case study of Columbus, Ohio, to examine the process by which individual workplaces go about recruiting women workers and how women search for paid work. This process is viewed from the perspectives of employers and women clerical workers through the interpretation of a questionnaire survey of a sample of workplaces, and interactive interviews with personnel managers and women employed as clerical workers. I analyze the strategies that establishments utilize to recruit clerical workers and the job-search methods of the women interviewed. The results indicate that formal techniques of hiring and searching (for example, newspaper advertisements and temporary agencies) are particularly important, but informal methods (for example, personal contacts) are also very significant. The popularity of these techniques varies by location within the metropolitan area. Downtown locations for establishments and women employees are much more likely to be associated with formal methods, whereas informal methods are more popular in suburban workplaces. I argue that these processes illustrate that employers and women are enmeshed in a complex web of localized sociospatial relations and networks in their efforts to fill positions and find jobs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This is the first of two papers in which multiple criteria location problems (MCLPs) are discussed. In this paper the main aim is to formalize a discrete MCLP and to develop a generalized network model. A critical overview of various techniques for generating efficient solutions to multiple criteria decision problems is offered. The three most commonly used methods for tackling MCLPs, namely the weighted method, the noninferior set estimation method, and the constraint method, are discussed. The main purpose of the generating techniques is to determine an exact representation of or an approximation to the set of efficient solutions among which one can choose the best or most preferred solution (location plan). To identify the best solution some information about the decisionmaker's preferences or a decision rule is needed. Consequently, in paper 2 we focus on preference-based approaches to multiple criteria decisionmaking and relate them to the concept of interactive decision support. Specifically, optimizing decision rules (utility-function-based approaches) and satisficing decision rules (goal programming methods) are discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches to solving the MCLP are highlighted. It is suggested that the utility-maximizing and satisficing decision rules are not mutually exclusive. Accordingly, a quasi-satisficing approach that merges these two decision rules is proposed. Also, a framework for an interactive decision support system (DSS) for tackling MCLPs is presented. The system incorporates the generalized network model into a quasi-satisficing approach. It is argued that the DSS data and analytical components can be effectively integrated by means of the interactive decision support concept which allows for exploring the problem and the alternative solutions both in decision space and in criterion outcome space. </jats:p>",

There is a shortage of arable land, health services are stretched, and there are limited places in school for children. A study in Choiseul Province, a rural area in Solomon Islands, suggests that people want smaller families but have limited means to control their fertility.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The present transition from a Fordist to a post-Fordist stage of development is characterized by a structural crisis (the crisis of Fordism). Within the industrial sector, this crisis is associated with economic decline (especially in terms of employment) and substantial reorganization and modernization activities. The way in which the spatial patterns of production will be affected is largely unclear. In the case of the German economy, an increasing number of scholars are worried about the threats which might originate from global restructuring processes of industrial activities. In this context, the economic and spatial structure of the German chemical industry will be analyzed in this paper. It will be argued that the recent economic decline of the chemical industry of western Germany is not indicative of a general deindustrialization trend. The chemical industry is, because of its development path, characterized by a strong tendency to concentrate both economically and regionally. Only a few dominant firms, which form the basis for the spatial development of the industry, have retained, and will retain, technological leadership within the industry (particularly Bayer, Hoechst, and BASF). Their allocation of resources between world regions has remained relatively constant over the past twenty years. It seems unlikely that this geographical distribution will be dramatically changed in the near future through cost-induced relocation activities. Location decisions will, rather, be characterized by a distinct market orientation. This does not, however, imply that chemical production will be shifted away from German locations to other chemical core regions. In contrast to the situation in western Germany, the future existence of chemical production in eastern Germany seems questionable. This is not related to the Fordist crisis but is a consequence of remnants from the previous planned economy and problems associated with German unification. </jats:p>",

The main objectives of the ‘Technopolis’ Program of the Japanese national government, implemented in the mid-1980s, were—and still are—the introduction of technology into all sectors of the national economy and the reduction of the disparities between the individual parts of the country. On the basis of hitherto unpublished data on each one of the twenty-six technopolises, in this paper I analyse their chances of success and draw conclusions regarding the regional–political value of the Technopolis strategy. One of the most important results of this analysis is the discovery of a strong and negative correlation between the success of the twenty-six sites and their distance from the Japanese core region around Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. </jats:p>",

Analysis of domestic policy is often dominated by process models, whereas scholars of international relations tend to apply rational models to explain state behavior. We apply Kingdon's ‘policy windows’ model of agenda setting and Brams's dynamic game theory framework to the development of acid-rain legislation enacted by the USA in the Clean Air Act of 1990. We compare the explanations of these theories with the work of other analysts, as well as with perceptions of policymakers by using data from interviews of policymaking elites in Canadian and US government, industry, and interest groups.

First, a recursive method is developed from the viewpoint of supplying electric power only where solutions for one unit are superposed. The computational loads are decreased by selecting alternatives of buses based on the so‐called penalty factor. However, for effective utilization of dispersed generating sources, it is indispensable to consider their thermal merits in addition to electric power. After applying the Kuhn‐Tucker theory to the optimal dispatching problem including boiler fuel costs, thermal values of the dispersed generating units are evaluated quantitatively. Finally, the above‐mentioned technique for the optimal planning basically is also effective and is extended into this case. The validity of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated using a real‐scale model system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A set-up is a group of features that are machined together in one particular orientation and position of a workpiece. Hence, the task of set-up planning is to group the features that are required on a part into set-ups and sequence these resultant groups to form an optimally ordered plan to produce the part. This ordered plan has forthright effects on the process and fixture plans that are needed to produce this part. This paper presents the knowledge modelling and formulation process for the development of an intelligent set-up planning system. The knowledge-based information needed for set-up planning from experts in the machining domain and the problem-solving procedures of these experts were obtained from a knowledge acquisition process and modelled in this set-up planning system. The acquired knowledge is modelled using production rules and fuzzy sets, and is coupled with a fuzzy-set-based formulation of the problem-solving procedures of these experts. This formulation and a control framework for set-up planning that closely emulates the expert's thinking processes during planning are integrated to formulate set-up plans. </jats:p>",

        "included in the contract in the first place. As regards non-contractual notices, the issue to be decided is one of reasonableness of reliance according to s 11(3). The s 11(1) test differs from the reasonableness of reliance test adopted by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (to which this part of the 1977 Act otherwise bears a reasonably close resemblance) and has generated a fair amount of controversy. Interestingly, the 1977 Act here adopts the proposal of the Scottish Law Commission Report (1975, para 177), the English Commission having proposed a continuation of the existing reliance test (para 183). The English Law Commission felt that judicial discretion, to take account of all circumstances, pre and post-contract, should not be curtailed. The Scottish Commission reasoned that a reliance test might undermine the planning of relationships and the allocation of risk(s), normally associated with commercial contracts. Whatever else, it seems entirely clear that (unless some form of severance is possible) a clause which, as drafted, is unreasonably wide (on a ‘reasonable’ construction!) will not be saved merely because it operates fairly in the particular circumstances. This is a clear encouragement for careful and conservative contract planning and drafting. Secondly, the burden of proof is clearly placed on the person seeking to justify the reasonableness of the clause (s 11(5)). Thirdly, there are distinct ‘guidelines’ in s 11(4) concerning limitation clauses. Finally, the specific"
