In rural communities across the United States, the decades after World War II left rurality and prosperity increasingly irreconcilable, but not so in Lancaster. Agriculture remained supreme, while new industries—not the least of which was tourism—provided thousands of new jobs. While sons and daughters of farmers elsewhere headed for the city in search of work, native Lancaster Countians could stay home. But success, too, had a price. A rural community was a delicate balance: too much progress, and it became urban or metropolitan; too little, and it eroded from within. One path led to the city, the other back to wilderness. If Lancaster County avoided the latter demise, it was, by 1970, in danger of the former. Some residents seemed to recognize the change and tried to fight it, but even their efforts to find a solution brought them ever closer to urbanization. Tourists bore more than their share of the blame, but there seemed no way to control the mushrooming industry—and little will to find one. Population growth was a greater problem and even harder to handle.</jats:p>",

It then outlines an economic framework for the analysis of delay costs, distinguishing between private costs and the various elements of social cost. It shows that the costs of delay are contingent upon the restrictiveness of planning and should be assessed in relation to the benefits of planning control. Available estimates of delay cost are identified, but are shown to be deficient even as measures of the private cost of delay. Various suggestions are made for the improvement of existing approaches, but it is concluded that the assessment of private and social delay costs requires case-study research which distinguishes between property sectors, locations and different points in the cycle of property development. </jats:p>",

Although there are important a priori links between auction theory and house purchase through informational asymmetries which could yield testable propositions, there are fundamental areas of difficulty. Auction analysis is essentially static whereas house purchase is primarily a process wherein market makers have a pivotal role. Nonetheless the need for further research into housing auctions and purchase behaviour is identified and supported. In particular, further research of a more qualitative and experimental methodology is strongly urged. This should be the first step in the integration of housing economics with a more microeconomic study of process and outcome at the point of house purchase. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The task of writing an editorial has been, for me, vaguely embarrassing and difficult; ‘editorialising’ conjures an image of intellectual centrality seemingly at odds with the times. Although it is now accepted as an ethical and political responsibility to position oneself so as to betray the partiality of one's perspective, establishing the grounds for taking a position and the right to speak—for oneself and certainly about others—is by no means unproblematic. The stakes surrounding the politics of presence are high. They offer the potential for more democratic, inclusive public discussions and institutions. Donna Haraway (1991) argues that ‘situated knowledge’ also comprises a middle course between relativism and objectivism (a type of limited objectivity). At the same time, a commitment to positioning each speaker can be used to put people in their place, to shut them down. In practice, the diversification of perspectives opens up the possibility of a pluralisation of antagonisms, an essentialising of some differences (for example, within feminism, the subtlety of the theorising of the category of gender is frequently attended by a remarkably static treatment of other social categories, such as race or sexual orientation), and a trivialisation of intellectual debate to ad femina/hominem insults. </jats:p>",

In planning an area development project, experts have therefore to conceptually create `underdevelopment' to legitimise their intervention in the social and economic processes of their target area. On the basis of field research in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, it is shown that a lack of information hides existing structures and institutions which in turn leads to the assumption that an area is underdeveloped. Furthermore, the planning process itself is defined as modern, while existing local procedures are seen as traditional. It is part of the culture of planning that an artificial contrast between planners and target populations is constructed. On the basis of interviews it is shown that the target population has its own culture of planning which is often long-term spanning several generations in contrast to the usual three- to five-year planning intervals of development projects.

In this paper, the focus is on the evolutionary dynamics of (multistate) multiregional populations whose interdependent subpopulations can experience increments as well as decrements. It is shown that in such instances migration rates that are not true occurrence-exposure rates are ambiguous, because they depend on the relative weightings existing during the initial model-fitting period. Net migration rates, lifetime migration rates, and return migration proportions all are imperfect measures of migration propensities, and their use as input measures to an analysis should be avoided whenever possible. </jats:p>",

It was developed for the US Air Force under a subcontract with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The heuristic is fast and flexible, incorporating all significant constraints for both deliberate (peacetime) and execution (crisis) planning. Because of its speed and detail, MAC will be able to evaluate many options quickly when performing deliberate planning. With its interactive data-base structure and ability to interrupt and restore a problem at any time in the analysis, MAC can be very responsive in execution planning. </jats:p>",

The author explores what such representations can tell us about the ‘centre’ rather than the ‘margins’.

This text, written by Horace St. John, forms a substantial part of Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor. Volume IV: Those Who Will Not Work (1861–62). Through an exploration of the textual strategies deployed within the text it is argued that it operates within a discursive space marked out by three sets of oppositions between ‘the same and the other’: forms of sexual relations, forms of state power, and forms of the self. The elaboration of these oppositions, and their inherent contradictions, suggests the conclusion that the ‘centre’ is made up of multiple power relations which are never able to achieve closure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The distributed coordination problem can be described as \"how should the local scheduling of activities at each agent be affected by non-local concerns and constraints?\" Partial global planning (PGP) is a flexible approach to distributed coordination that allows agents to respond dynamically to their current situation. It is based on detecting relationships in the computational goal structures of the distributed agents. However, the detailed PGP mechanisms depend on the existence and availability of certain characteristics and structures that are idiosyncratic to the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT). Generalized Partial Global Planning tries to extend the PGP approach by communicating more abstract and hierarchically organized information, detecting in a general way the coordination relationships that are needed by the partial global planning mechanisms, and separating the process of coordination from local scheduling. This new characterization of partial global planning has less communication overhead and can be more easily adapted and extended to new styles of problem solving and new multi-agent environments that have different characteristics from the original DVMT. This paper first describes the coordination problem as it was viewed by the PGP algorithm, and then extensions to that problem. It then briefly describes our model of task structures and coordination relationships. Finally, we show how the PGP algorithm, as an example, can be described using our method. </jats:p>",

It is demonstrated that in perfectly competitive land markets these approaches are equivalent, therefore they should be understood as complementary rather than alternative. The case of markets subject to speculative land prices is then explored for the cases of speculative supply and/or speculative demand, with the discovery that both approaches are theoretically equivalent in every case studied, thus extending the previous conclusion for the general case. These conclusions provide the base for an integrated and more comprehensive urban economic theory and for the bid-choice land-use model. </jats:p>",

Traditional coastal resorts are found to be identified with relative decline, but the growth of tourism employment in the cities is somewhat smaller still; analyses of museum and recreation employment show a decline of city employment, which offsets significant job increases in hotels and catering. Otherwise, there are elements of ‘urban-rural’ drift, with the growth of leisure jobs (which are indistinguishable from tourism) reflecting the growth both of resident population and of visitor attractions, which both generate car-based outings to successively less urban types of area. </jats:p>",

Conversely, the observed evolution of a given locational system corresponds to certain characteristics of an analogous Weberian locational system.

A model corresponding to such a ‘topodynamic’ approach is presented and an application is made. Three different effects are integrated into the model: an interdependency effect which determines the polarization level; an ‘attraction — repulsion’ effect which determines the center — periphery equilibrium; and a distance deterrence effect which determines the diffusion process and the inertia level. </jats:p>",

The Fordist system is entering the negative profit-cycle phase and the post-Fordist system is in the mature phase.

These were the single internal market programme, and the economic challenge from Japan. The automobile industry was particularly closely involved in these, because of the extent of Japanese exports and direct foreign investment in the sector, and the range of national state interventions, most of which ran contrary to the ‘1992’ programme. In this paper therefore the issues which underpin the role of the industry in the drive to create a single internal market and to respond to the expansion of ‘transplant’ assembly capacity are considered first. The policies which have been adopted by the EC in this context are then examined, and the author goes on to identify the limitations upon the policies which have emerged. The paper concludes with reflection on the evident tensions between national state policies and those of the EC and argues that (partly because of these) the political debate has excessively concentrated upon the strategies of vehicle assemblers. This is unfortunate because it obscures the deeper implications of change for the automotive components industry where, it is suggested, there is greater scope for a more effective EC policy response. </jats:p>",

In this paper this thesis is examined by looking at changes in residential care for the elderly in Britain. It is argued that although there has been a rapid growth in private provision during the 1980s, the consumption cleavage thesis is inappropriate for a number of reasons. First, as with education and health, residents do not own the means of consumption but pay for their use. Second, there is no evidence that the quality of care is better in the private sector than in the public sector. Third, owing to the rapid expansion of state financial support for private care, most private residential homes how accommodate a large proportion of publicly financed residents. In addition, local authority homes also provide for residents who pay for care from private funds or the sale of their house. There is therefore no clear-cut divide between the public and the private sectors in terms of residents or financing. </jats:p>",

The results suggest the following: First, the average level of business taxation by state and local governments is approximately 5% of net business income. Second, there appears to be substantial and increasing variation in the effective tax rate on businesses among the individual states. Third, the Northeast remains a place of significantly high tax burdens on businesses. And, last, certain states experience more variation in their effective tax rate over time—a phenomenon at least partly attributable to the effects of the business cycle on business income. </jats:p>",

It is argued that the reactions of the media and government present a discourse of disorder, a discourse in which graffiti is presented as a symptom of disorder and thus a threat to the image of New York City and civilization itself. Simultaneously the art establishment reacts to graffiti by (dis)placing it in Manhattan galleries and describing it as creative, ‘primitive’, and valuable. These discourses play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the meaning of a place. Simultaneously the place—New York, the subway, the gallery—plays a role in affecting the nature of the discourses and judgements of the value of graffiti. This case study is framed in the context of a wider discussion of the relation between place and ideology in which it is suggested that each plays a role in structuring the other. </jats:p>",

Linear regression is used to analyze the factors that underlie the popular support for (or opposition to) stricter gun-control legislation. It is found that, with respect to support for gun control, cultural differences between Canadians and Americans are overshadowed by socioeconomic variables, such as gender and gun ownership. </jats:p><jats:p> The similarities in public attitudes between Canadians and Americans suggest that the explanation for stricter firearms legislation in Canada lies more with the differences in political elites and institutions than with differences in public opinion.

We use four sets of criteria. Firstly, the survey is assessed as a means of regulating the interdependent relationships of the principal participants. Secondly, as a system for making decisions about public expenditure, the survey is judged by the extent to which it has enabled governments to achieve their broad spending objectives. Thirdly, the survey is assessed b the extent to which it provides directly for the participation of ministers collectively in tie process of decision‐making, and how they decide the relative priority of both the total of public expenditure and its composition. And fourthly, its effects are measured by analysing the outputs of the system ‐ the allocation of spending to departments and agencies. In the concluding section we address directly the question of whose interests are best served by the survey.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Patients taking warfarin for long-term anticoagulation require frequent clinic visits to monitor the prothrombin time ratio (PTR), a measure of blood clotting. A dynamic stochastic model using nonlinear optimization was developed to select follow-up visit intervals that minimize the overall costs of patient care. Assuming that fluctuations in a patient's PTR behave as a random diffusion process, future PTR fluctuations are unknown, except as revealed by past PTRs. To determine the incidence and costs of complications in relation to PTR, the authors reviewed the charts of 216 patients who had 719 patient-years of follow-up with 695 trivial, significant, life-threatening, or fatal complications. They modeled the relationship between costs of complications and deviation of the PTR from the therapeutic target as a fourth-order convex polynomial. The model is used to compute the interval to the next follow-up visit to minimize accumulated potential costs. Variables in the optimization are the cost of a mon itoring visit and the expected costs of complications. The latter are derived from the current PTR, the variability of the patient's past PTR values, the number of past PTRs available, and the target PTR for the patient. No attempt is made to predict the level of the next PTR or suggest adjustments in the warfarin dose. Shorter follow-up is recommended for patients who have histories of large fluctuations in past PTRs and for patients with few prior PTR determinabons. As visits accumulate, the patient's degree of variability can be estimated more accurately and visit intervals adjusted accordingly The scheduling method balances costs to the health care system of monitoring each patient against the expected costs of complications. This approach has the potential to reduce the number of monitoring visits necessary for safe management of anticoagulated patients with stable PTRs and to improve control among unstable patients.

The literature highlights the need to involve the elderly in planning health promotion programmes. It is only by understanding their concerns, attitudes, beliefs and values that appropriate strategies can be developed. This paper describes how the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used to plan a health promotion programme's content and strategies for a Veterans' Quality of Life Project. The NGT group meetings yielded a wealth of easily collected, rank ordered, qualitative data from over 400 consumers. Additionally, consumer responses revealed issues not raised in the literature and, provided the foundation for continued participation and enthusiasm in subsequent health promotion activities. NGT proved to be an effective and efficient way to involve elderly consumers in planning health promotion programmes.</jats:p>",

This evaluation is primarily based on data obtained from more than 400 applicants in nine counties.

The virtual arm has the same kinematic structure as the actual arm except that its end-point is located at the joint or link of the actual arm. Therefore, the configuration of the actual arm can be represented as a set of end-points of the virtual arms, and the path planning for multi-joint manipulators can be performed only in the task space. Our method adopts a hierarchical strategy which consists of the global level, the intermediate level, and the local level. The global level plans the collision-free endpoint trajectory of the actual arm based on the global representation of the task space. The intermediate level generates the subgoals for the actual and virtual endpoints based on the current positions and the actual endpoint trajectory specified by the global level. The local level moves each end-point to the corresponding subgoal, avoiding the close obstacles based on the local informations of the task space. The effectiveness of the method is verified by computer simulations using a planar manipulator with redundant joint degrees of freedom.</jats:p>",
