A theory of planning is proposed and used to guide discussion of the experience of urban development planning in the USA and UK during the last two decades. It is concluded that physical planning is an institution which controls the location and level of public investment in urban infrastructure and which produces plans of the development of urban areas as a means of increasing the profitability and reducing the risks associated with private land development. Operational models are used in this process to provide forecasts of development; the nature of these models can then be deduced. </jats:p>",

Notwithstanding US Constitutional constraints, a joint Federal-State effort attempted to plan for the State of Alaska's 375 million acres of land, following statehood in 1959. The study focuses on the seven-year life of the Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission (FSLUPC) and the competing interests of resource development, environmental preservation, and subsistence life-styles. A consensus decision mode resulted in considerable success in resolving conflicts among competing interests, but failure in consolidating a constituency and developing a land-use plan. The FSLUPC closed its doors in 1979, and in 1980 Congress passed an Alaskan Wilderness Bill the effect of which is so large that it doubles American conservation lands. </jats:p>",

Generally, it can be said that the health planning laws, by establishing controls to prevent the unnecessary duplication of services, protect service monopolies. In contrast, antitrust laws are designed to prevent the establishment of monopolies which are able to control the supply of services. The antitrust laws are intended to promote a vigorous and competitive economy, in which businesses have a full opportunity to compete on the basis of price, quality and service. As a result of this conflict, those involved in health planning have become concerned about the legal environment in which they act.</jats:p>",

Slant-well, S-shape, and maximum turn well paths can be computed. Equations are developed for calculating critical points along the well path in terms of cartesian coordinates and directional survey parameters. The effect of right-hand walk (drift) and a technique for calculating the appropriate lead to compensate for drift is presented.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In contrast to the many references on methods for calculating directional surveys, there is a notable absence of articles discussing the related problem of well planning. Wilson derived the concept of compounded wellbore curvature in discussing the curvature method to calculate directional surveys. However, no 3D method has been published to handle the calculation of well paths that have both changes of azimuth and changes of inclination. This is a common type of well path, especially in sidetracked holes and for drilling around salt domes. The intent of this paper is to describe a procedure that will accommodate the 3D geometry of practical well trajectories.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The general solution assumes that all curvatures between two points are constant. The only other limitations imposed are a maximum curvature and a maximum inclination.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Radius-of-Curvature Equations</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The radius-of-curvature method used in this procedure is a preferred approach to well-path calculation because of its relative simplicity and general use in the industry for interpreting directional surveys. It also appears to conform to the geometry of directional drilling since the objective of turning a well with, for example, a bent sub and downhole mud motor is to drill a well path with constant radius of curvature. Rivero has generalized the radius-of-curvature equations to the following form.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Cases 1 and 2.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>(1)</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Case 1. .</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>(2)</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>(3)</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This case represents a constant curvature in azimuth as well as inclination.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 952^</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

And yet, until recently the combinatorial intricacies of vehicle routing and of vehicle scheduling have precluded the widespread use of optimization (exact) methods for this problem class. Our discussion in this paper identifies the extent and nature of these problem complexities and draws contrasts with other applications of combinatorial optimization. It also summarizes a number of successful uses of optimization for vehicle fleet planning and highlights potentially fruitful avenues for algorithmic development. In particular, we describe several alternative models and novel algorithms for the vehicle routing problem, show how various modeling approaches for this problem are intimately related, and illustrate the interplay between model formulations and the algorithms that they suggest. This discussion shows that prospects for applying exact methods, possibly in conjunction with heuristics, are far from fully realized and points to vehicle fleet planning as a tempting target of opportunity for further investigation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To assure a successful completion of an assigned task without interruption, such as the collision with fixtures, the hand of a mechanical manipulator often travels along a preplanned path. An advantage of requiring the path to be composed of straight-line segments in Cartesian coordinates is to provide a capability for controlled interaction with objects on a moving conveyor. This paper presents a method of obtaining a time schedule of velocities and accelerations along the path that the manipulator may adopt to obtain a minimum traveling time, under the constraints of composite Cartesian limit on linear and angular velocities and accelerations. Because of the involvement of a linear performance index and a large number of nonlinear inequality constraints, which are generated from physical limitations, the “method of approximate programming (MAP)” is applied. Depending on the initial choice of a feasible solution, the iterated feasible solution, however, does not converge to the optimum feasible point, but is often entrapped at some other point of the boundary of the constraint set. To overcome the obstacle, MAP is modified so that the feasible solution of each of the iterated linear programming problems is shifted to the boundaries corresponding to the original, linear inequality constraints. To reduce the computing time, a “direct approximate programming algorithm (DAPA)” is developed, implemented and shown to converge to optimum feasible solution for the path planning problem. Programs in FORTRAN language have been written for both the modified MAP and DAPA, and are illustrated by a numerical example for the purpose of comparison.</jats:p>",

Le plan initial trahissait à la fois l'influence de l'esthétique de l'école de Chicago et du mouvement des «villes-jardins.» Après 1958, la communauté devint le théâtre d'une expérience importante de réamnénagement des banlieues qui se déroula à Brunetville, à l'est du secteur planifié de Kapuskasing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the application of travel-demand models for forecasting, it is assumed that the model form and coefficients are stable in time. This study analyzes the time stability of a three-mode disaggregate modal-split model for trips to work over two points in time. Data were used from the 1972 Travel Habits Survey and from the 1976 Survey of Patterns of Travel to Work. All the trips used were made within the Tel-Aviv metropolitan area. The main method used in judging the transferability of the model was to apply the 1972 model to the 1976 trips thus giving for each trip the predicted probability of choosing the modes. The trips were split up into classes by various criteria, and for each criterion the probabilities of choosing a mode were summed over all trips in each class. This sum is the predicted number of trips in the class that uses the mode, and this was compared with the number actually observed. Another method for examining transferability is to recalibrate the model on the 1976 data, and to compare the coefficients obtained with the 1972 coefficients. It appears that the model calibrated on the 1972 data predicts the 1976 modal split satisfactorily in spite of the major structural changes which took place between 1972 and 1976 which resulted in a considerable change in the modal split itself. There is a problem with the prediction of use of the car-passenger mode, but this arises because of differences in survey techniques that were used for collecting the 1972 and the 1976 data. The model coefficients are stable in time except the coefficient for the number of vehicles. These results add confidence to the use of these models for forecasting. </jats:p>",

In solving for a fixed value of p, tight bounds on all other median solutions in the range m − 1 to p + 1 are generated where m is the number of possible location sites and p is the number of medians. A step by step numerical example is described, and extensive computational experience is reported for some standard sets of tests problems in the literature. Comparisons with the well-known greedy interchange heuristic confirm the effectiveness of this drop approach in solving a significant number of difficult median problems. </jats:p>",

Some of the factors underlying these decisions have a bearing on city size, and, it is assumed, make up a utility function that varies with city size according to the Weber-Fechner law of marginal effects. Under these conditions, the maximum entropy distribution of the population among the cities of the region gives rise to the hierarchical model described in the paper. Examples are given of calibrations of the model. It is shown that in the applicable statistical range this distribution and the Pareto distribution, although formally different, are quantitatively interchangeable. The derivation presented here may therefore be regarded as providing a new rationale for the Pareto city-size distribution model. </jats:p>",
