The research reported here includes a more comprehensive set of performance variables and investigates the reliability and validity of these measures of performance, as well as explanatory variables’ measures. Research hypotheses about export performance as an outcome of international firm strategies covering channels of distribution, product, promotion, pricing, and planning are tested by data from a mail survey and from in‐depth interviews.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The antagonism of neoliberalism to local intervention raises questions over the future of planning theory and practice. Recent reviews suggest planning's response to regulatory reform has been to become more flexible, although this may simply reflect nothing more than instrumental pragmatism. Drawing on regulation theory in this paper I review the reforms which have taken place in New Zealand since 1984, when New Zealand moved sharply from a form of regulation described as ‘peripheral Fordism’. Planning after Fordism risks being confined to mediating environmental relations, despite the likelihood of far-reaching social conflict and economic contradictions in the emergent form of capitalism. Two choices face planning in New Zealand; adapt to the mandate of environmental management or extend planning to confront other (social and economic) challenges in the emergent form of capitalism. The second alternative requires planners to adopt a more active and critical role than has been evident to date. </jats:p>",

Operators determine what can be achieved, generally based on their own previous experience, with some individuals being able to produce treatment results that others are incapable of producing with precisely the same facilities. To this end, many controversies exist in orthodontics which can only be alluded to in a text of this nature. It is important, however, to be aware that many debates as to the effectiveness of a particular mode of treatment often have little or no basis in scientific fact.</jats:p>",

The “standardisation” versus “adaptation” debate will be applied, albeit sparingly, to international publicity planning, bearing in mind that, as with all other communication tools, successful international publicity campaigns are largely dependent on the consideration of the peculiarities of foreign environments. The impact of these constraints in terms of strategy and planning are also considered and further areas for research identified.</jats:p>",

A unique feature of this experience was that knowledge was acquired from multiple expertise sources in various forms. Expertise acquired from text analysis of textbooks and manuals was used in developing the core knowledge base for the expert system; while those acquired from text analysis of research publications and interviews with selected domain experts was used in the subsequent refinement and expansion of the basic prototype. The building process for the LRPA prototype adopted a modular approach using the incremental rapid prototyping methodology.</jats:p>",

Increasingly, business leaders want to engage with their workforces and stakeholders in together deciding what they want to achieve and how to get there. Leaders see participative strategic planning as a significant opportunity, although hitherto the lack of techniques for large group involvement has been a blockage. Search conferences ‐ whether with staff, managers, suppliers or customers ‐ offer a tried and tested process for co‐operating together effectively. They enable the maximum use of human resources, commitment, learning and flexibility so that innovation is unlocked. Originally invented by Eric Trist and Fred Emery of the Tavistock Institute in the 1960s, the basis of the search conference is in open systems theory and active, adaptive planning.</jats:p>",

It is based on more than 75 interviews with urban planners and officials in Jerusalem and Johannesburg. Partisan Israeli planners utilise territorial policies that penetrate and diminish Palestinian land control. Post-apartheid urban policy in Johannesburg has pursued both conflict resolution and socioeconomic equity and is seeking to restructure apartheid geography. Both policy strategies are problematic. It is likely that partisan Israeli planning is creating an urban landscape of heightened political contestability and increased Jewish vulnerability. Johannesburg's equity planning is likely to be insufficient as economic forces shape new spatial inequalities. Urban planning must be reconceptualised in polarised cities so that it can contribute meaningfully to the advancement of ethnic peace. </jats:p>",

In the first stage, problems must be structured and defined in a way that is accepted by all major stakeholders in the planning process. In the second stage, a transparent process of decision making must exist which will provide the means for the planning group to establish priorities and time‐scales. The tools chosen in this instance were selected in relation to the characteristics of the local environment, and the paper describes these.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author traces the origins, evolution, and contested meanings of the ‘keyword’ workfare (work + welfare) in the United States which, in the space of 30 years, has evolved from a technocratic term deployed in the process of intrawelfare reform, through to powerful signifier of a systemic, postwelfare ‘alternative’. Discursive struggles around workfare are shown to have played a decisive role in reencoding the language of poverty politics, as ‘old’ discourses of needs, decency, compassion, and entitlement have been discredited, while ‘new’ (or more accurately reworked) discourses of work, responsibility, self-sufficiency, and empowerment have been forcefully advanced. This process is a geopolitical one in the sense that local models and stories of workfare have been absorbed—in a transformative way—into the new orthodoxies of policy discourse and practice. The ascendancy of local workfare (represented as the ‘solution’ to the ‘welfare mess’) over federal welfare (itself now a political attack term) has been associated not only with a rolling back of the language, routines, and systems of welfarism, but also with the rolling forward of radically new institutions and vocabularies of regulation. Although it continues to be contested, workfare is becoming the regulatory antonym of welfare; the programme is becoming programmatic. The paper presents a political-economic contextualization of workfare discourse. </jats:p>",

Planners responsible for the economic evaluation of plans and projects increasingly are using a particular type of survey, the contingent valuation (CV) survey, to estimate the value of public goods such as water quality and recreation. It is argued in this article that CV is a useful tool for planning and that, following Throgmorton, planners will be more effective if they accept the idea that the results of CV surveys are both scientific and contestable. In this study, the CV-type questions about willingness to pay provided information not available from conventional surveys and helped local decision makers gauge the strength of local support for a parks board. Effective use of CV, like use of other survey data, requires that planners be competent technically and politically. </jats:p>",

The authors confirm that there are continuing cohorts of people who express a desire to buy in the near future. Multivariate analysis indicates that the motivation to buy is chiefly created by the households' economic circumstances, but family characteristics, the type and perceived quality of the house, and rent levels also exert an independent influence. Analysis also suggests that the responses to the relatively hypothetical questions about future intentions appear to be consistent both with aggregate outturns and with the expected characteristics of possible purchasers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many social scientists and development experts working in the South have dismissed postmodernism and related perspectives as irrelevant in the context of continued poverty and struggles for modernisation. Conversely, Northern authors on postmodernism frequently imply the global salience of the paradigm in a universalising manner redolent of modernist discourse, whereas critics of conventional development(alism) tend to base their arguments on caricatures in which the diversity of real-world experiences and some important improvements in the quality of life over the last 30 years are ignored, Neither approach is tenable, and in this paper the author explores the scope and basis for more fruitful engagements with postmodernism, postcolonialism, and related perspectives, including Southern notions of posttraditionalism, in the context of current developments and popular aspirations in the South. A critical reading of the literature is combined with examples drawn from different regions. In the analysis a pathway is offered through these often confusing fields and the relationships between globalisation, modernisation, and postmodernism, the changing roles and abilities of state and nonstate actors, and the complex ways in which local communities engage with such dynamics in pursuit of a better life, are encompassed. </jats:p>",

This is primarily because of the complexity and large‐scale nature of construction information, and problems with expert systems including: knowledge acquisition; rule‐based knowledge representation; information storage (or memory); learning; and robustness. Case‐based reasoning is one area of current research which may hold the key to overcoming a number of these problems. In the present paper, previous related case‐based reasoning work is examined. The key factors which influence the formulation of construction project plans are identified. This knowledge is used to develop a conceptual framework within which previous planning experiences can be captured and reused in new situations as a means of providing system decision support in construction planning and control. A prototype system, CBRidge, developed to test and demonstrate the concepts within the framework is presented. The results are very encouraging and provide a sound basis for the further development of case‐based reasoning for construction planning in practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The speed, transparency, and extent of the reregulation of New Zealand society over the last decade offer many insights into issues of social change and systems of regulation and governance. The forms of reregulation have been embedded by the set of new regulations and reorganised state practices referred to as the ‘reforms’. These have involved a major shift in the sites and exercise of power within and between economic, social, and political spheres. They have been promoted and articulated in a restructuring discourse which has dominated New Zealand's reaction to the expiry of its social democratic settlement. Reconstructions of space and democracy have been heavily implicated within the processes of change, both as explicit goals of the reform programme and as overt strategies for the achievement of other redistributions. They are also definitive outcomes of a decade of upheaval. The authors explore the spatialities of core-state reform. They develop the concept of an altered dominant representation of space to explore new configurations of space and democratic practice. They seek to inform contemporary debates over the stability of New Zealand's reconstructed social formation. The discussion is illustrated with references to the spatial reorganisation of the institutions of government and core-state activities; in particular the altered administration of education and public health, and changes in local government organisation. </jats:p>",

Regional policy is challenged by the globalisation and regionalisation of political and economic structures, the implementation of sustainable development, and the reform of political and administrative structures. Most European countries have started to reformulate their regional policy. This wave of change has touched Switzerland as well. Although disparities between the regions are not of the same magnitude as in other countries, regional development problems can be found all over Switzerland. Regional policy, however, has not been adapted to tackle the present challenges. Evaluations in Switzerland and experiences in other countries reveal a need for a more integrated regional policy approach. With reference to the Swiss context, the authors outline the form an integrated policy approach could take. The approach includes the political system and sectoral policies with regional impact and comprises six elements: public and private actors; institutional structures and processes; top-down and bottom-up approaches; exogenous and endogenous strategies; economic, social, and environmental dimensions; and policies at regional, national, and European levels. This integrated perspective is complemented with considerations of how this approach in practice could look like on the national and the regional level. Special attention is given to the role of regional actors and institutions in the development process. </jats:p>",

The paper suggests some simple tools for identifying and classifying user needs as well as for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of RTIs.

Data from the 1991 UK Census are analyzed in order to examine the patterns of social division and ethnic residence in two large manufacturing cities in the United Kingdom—Leicester where the main ethnic minority is of Indian origin, and Bradford where it is Pakistani. Both cities are socially divided and can be considered, at the very least metaphorically, as taking the form of ‘butterfly attractors’, but the relationship between social division and ethnicity is not the same either in both places or for both ethnic groups. Pakistanis in both cities are predominantly located in poorer areas. Indians in Leicester live both in affluent and in poorer areas, and some residential areas which are predominantly Indian are affluent. The author concludes that the residential patterns described are a complex resultant of locality effects and ethnicity effects, and notes that observed ethnic residential patterns in both cities support neither the assertion that the United Kingdom has ethnic ghettos nor any general account of ethnic minorities of South Asian origin as confined to ‘underclass’ positions in the general social order. </jats:p>",

A major reason is that they usually neglect user inconvenience and delay costs, which alone can greatly exceed the maintenance costs. It is known that different maintenance plans have very different effects on users and on highway performance. These interactions have not been intensively explored, and the existing analysis methods are not quite satisfactory. To remedy the existing deficiencies, the development of a realistic and efficient maintenance planning methodology is proposed. Specifically, the proposed approach incorporates several components already developed for selecting and scheduling interdependent projects in transportation networks; however, it organizes them in a more efficient way. The proposed maintenance planning methodology can overcome the main weaknesses of prevailing methods and help decision makers to greatly reduce user costs and improve the efficiency of highway maintenance operations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Four models are estimated to examine the consumption of fuelwood in selected countries of Sub-Saharan Africa from 1970 to 1990. Using a two-stage least squares estimation technique, we use the models to analyze the effects of income and price on fuelwood demand. Variables included in the models are income, price, and precipitation with a dummy variable based on level of development. The best model yields an income elasticity of 0.39 and a price elasticity of −0.28, indicating that fuelwood is a superior, normal good. Attending to the mounting concerns about fuelwood depletion in Sub-Saharan Africa, we feel the results provide insights for the formulation of effective energy policies. Specifically, policy measures that simultaneously address household income and fuel price are required. Increasing household income, directly with income supplements or indirectly with the provision of energy-efficient cookstoves, has the potential to decrease fuelwood consumption. Similarly, price reforms that force the price of energy to reflect its real economic cost encourage more efficient consumption. </jats:p>",

Overall, this literature is not characterized by a particular attention to the importance of method in drawing conclusions about spatial equity based on empirical studies. Specifically, there has been scant interest in the effect of geographic methodology on assessing the relationship between access and socioeconomic characteristics that are spatially defined. In this paper we take a spatial analytical perspective to evaluate the importance of methodology in assessing whether or not, or to what degree the distribution of urban public services is equitable. We approach this issue by means of an empirical case study of the spatial distribution of playgrounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma, relative to that of the targeted constituencies (children) and other socioeconomic indicators. In addition to the ‘traditional’ measure (count of facilities in an areal unit), we consider a potential measure (based on the gravity model), average travel distance, and distance to the nearest playground as indicators of accessibility. We find significant differences between the spatial patterns in these measures that are suggested by local indicators of spatial association and other techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. The choice of access measure not only implies a particular treatment of spatial externalities but also affects conclusions about the existence of spatial mismatch and inequity. </jats:p>",

These types of initiatives have emerged as an important new policy tool for environmental management in North America. The focus of this paper is on the merits and shortcomings of three major categories of voluntary initiative: self-regulation, the voluntary agreement, and the voluntary challenge. Using data collected from eighteen new and two previously documented case studies of voluntary initiatives, the authors present some of the key characteristics of these types of initiatives and speculate on their role in North America's environmental policy regime. Industry respondents in the case studies identified the threat of regulation, public image, financial considerations, and peer pressure as key motivating factors in their decision to participate in a voluntary initiative. From a policy perspective, issues of concern are the effectiveness of nonstatutory initiatives relative to regulations, the degree of flexibility that they offer, and the role of public involvement. It is concluded that considerable research is still needed to confirm the contentions of proponents or opponents of voluntary initiatives. </jats:p>",

The model is based on a theory entailing behavioral principles of how persons acquire, represent, and use information from and about the environment. Choices of destinations and departure times are consequences of the scheduling of a set of activities to be executed in a given time cycle. Illustrative computer simulations of the operational model show realistic effects of work hours, living in or outside the center, and travel speed. Several necessary improvements of the theory and operational model are discussed, such as incorporating learning effects and choice of travel mode for home-based trip chains. Strategies outlined for empirical tests include comparisons with existing models, psychological experiments illuminating basic assumptions, and the use of geographical information systems to process travel-diary data for single cases. </jats:p>",

These have been seen in Europe and North America, but, so far, have been almost undiscovered in developing countries. Based on the assumption of the strong embedding of the stable and ‘pure’ district model, in this paper we examine a new-tech agglomeration in Beijing, as a variant of such districts in the making, and explain it with the use of concepts adopted from the industrial districts school. The Beijing case represents an experiment in the conscious public creation of new industrial spaces founded on the spontaneous action of key individuals. Initially it progressed as an embryonic industrial district that, in its early development, appeared to contain all three elements of entrepreneurship: small firms, new firm formation, and innovativeness. However, it has eventually been stranded by a unique combination of weaknesses. These include strong hierarchical restraints from the state-owned institutions or firms on local networking, and direct global linkages with the multinationals, which expose local economies to volatile world competition. We pinpoint the necessity for a developing country to rest its development of industrial districts on self-sustained innovativeness, and highlights the difficulties encountered in such a process. </jats:p>",

In the case of the Netherlands, central—local policy communities, in which nongovernmental organizations may play a significant role, divide local policymaking into sectors. Responsiveness to local requirements is highly skewed. Decentralization to improve local policymaking is frustrated by the urge for equality in this one-constituency state. The pillarization in the formative decades of the welfare state contributed to the development of this characteristic of the Dutch polity. These central—local relations are not conducive to innovation, which is required for local implementation of environmental policy. Sectoral boundaries preclude the essential integration of this policy. Municipal development plans, essentially designed to improve local resources, defy centrally devised norms and even prevent proper application of environmental impact assessments in central government's decisions on motorways. </jats:p>",

In this paper the authors analyze the impact of important social, political, and economic factors on municipal debt behavior. They examine the 42 largest US cities from 1980 to 1990, using a pooled time-series regression model. It was found that, generally speaking, these factors had the effect of increasing cities' reliance on revenue debt, which is less accountable to the voters than full-faith and credit debt. It is difficult to say whether local officials have consciously pursued a policy of insulating municipal debt decisions from the voters. However, it is clear that these officials are responding to environmental cues that lead them to prefer revenue debt over general-obligation debt by a large margin. Recent research has shown that cities have historically pursued a ‘politics of circumvention’. With the demand for debt increasing as other means for financing local services are constrained the effects on the polity of these preferences warrant serious attention. </jats:p>",

These movements are reflected qualitatively, in a variety of social, political, and cultural forms, including popular music in Australia. An analysis of the ‘cultural apparatus’, recordings, and popular performance events of indigenous musicians reveals the construction of ‘arenas of empowerment’ at a variety of geographical scales, within which genuine spaces of Aboriginal self-determination and self-expression can exist. Although these spaces often remain contested, new indigenous musical networks continue to emerge, simultaneously inscribing Aboriginal music into the Australian soundscape, and beginning to challenge normative geopolitical doctrines. The emergence of a vibrant Aboriginal popular music scene therefore requires a rethinking of Australian music, and appeals for greater recognition of Aboriginal artists' sophisticated geopolitical strategies. </jats:p>",

The lessons learned from the Synthesis Coalition's experience can be applied at the departmental level to meet the requirements of these agencies. The planning strategy focused on a collaborative process that involved all stakeholders: faculty, administrators, students, and industry representatives. The stakeholders validated and prioritized the Coalition's original goals and identified a specific set of abilities, criteria, and activities associated with them. (The goals included, to facilitate: communication, teamwork, hands‐on facility with hardware, awareness of the social implications of engineering, modern industry practices, multi‐disciplinary design, and open‐ended problem solving.) The Coalition's industrial board provided written scenarios of “day in the life” challenges engineers face to help ensure that the values and goals the Coalition planned to assess matched those that industry felt were important. Next, course documents were analyzed to identify a set of assignments to use for developing authentic, performance‐based assessment tools. This approach assured that by participating in the Synthesis Coalition assessment project, each campus prepared a core group of faculty to assess (and train other faculty to assess) student learning and ultimately document evidence of student learning for ABET accreditation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The morbidity and mortality caused by epidemics threaten social functioning of complex societies. Societies mount a social response to epidemics in order to contain the potential damage from uncontrolled disease. Despite the threat posed by epidemics, social and contextual ‘vulnerabilities’ often impede efforts to contain epidemics. The AIDS epidemic provides an example of a ‘peculiar’ epidemic, in which threat to social welfare failed to provoke adequate social efforts at containment. In order to examine the miscarriage of epidemic response, we interviewed 31 AIDS providers in Alameda County, California, about the development of their AIDS-related services. According to the people interviewed, epidemic response in the County was marred by stigma associated with AIDS, lack of adequate funding, difficulties in building collaborative effort in a fragmented care system, and other political and social problems. In spite of these obstacles, social mobilization enabled directors of a wide variety of health care agencies to incorporate care and prevention into their services. The findings support the concept that ‘vulnerabilities’ can derail epidemic response, making widespread social mobilization an essential tool for epidemic control. The discussion centers on the implication of these findings for the theoretical understanding of social response to epidemics. </jats:p>",

During the late 1970s, pre-Halloween pranks in Detroit, Michigan, turned destructive when hundreds of fires were set deliberately throughout the city; in 1984, a record of 810 fires were set during the Halloween period. In 1985, a citywide anti-arson campaign that involved the mobilization and training of thousands of community volunteers was begun in Detroit. This report describes the multiple components of the anti-arson intervention from 1985 through 1996 and changes in the incidence of Halloween fires. Both the decrease in annual Halloween arson fires after the intervention began and the inverse relationship between the number of volunteers and the number of fires suggest a causal effect. This study illustrates the capacity of an urban community to mobilize its residents and stakeholders, the importance of community participation and multisectoral partnerships in program planning and implementation, and the challenges faced in retrospectively evaluating an apparently successful, complex, community-based intervention. </jats:p>",

METHODS: In this 3-arm randomized trial among 1800 nonsterilized married women, educational interventions targeting both spouses and targeting the wife only were compared with usual family planning care. RESULTS: Among women not using intrauterine devices (IUDs), the intervention with husband's participation had an effect in reducing pregnancy rates (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12, 1.1) and abortion rates (adjusted OR = 0.29, CI = 0.09, 0.94) compared with control subjects, and a significant effect in reducing pregnancy rates (adjusted OR = 0.29, CI = 0.10, 0.85) and abortion rates (adjusted OR = 0.24, CI = 0.07, 0.77) compared with wife-only subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Family planning interventions involving husbands may reduce pregnancy and abortion rates among non-IUD users. </jats:p>",

This is achieved by grouping (a) inspection features into feature families and (b) probe orientations into probe cells. This would result in minimal probe calibration errors and part installation errors for the relative tolerance features. This procedure would reduce the time for probe exchange and reinstallation of parts. An incidence matrix representation has been developed to represent the relationship between inspection features and their relative probe orientations. The incidence matrix which is used for grouping feature families and probe cells are similar in function to the concept of group technology (GT) as used in machine cell formation. The knowledge-based clustering algorithm possesses the flexibility for consideration of multiple constraints for grouping probe cells and feature families. The application of the developed clustering algorithm satisfies the requirement of the inspection feature grouping and provides efficiency and effectiveness in probe selection and inspection process planning for coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). </jats:p>",
