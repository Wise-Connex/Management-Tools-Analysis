      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            In recent years, various polymorphic loci and multicopy insertion elements have been discovered in the\n            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            genome, such as the direct repeat (DR) locus, the major polymorphic tandem repeats, the polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequence, IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            , and IS\n            <jats:italic>1081</jats:italic>\n            . These, especially IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            and the DR locus, have been widely used as genetic markers to differentiate\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            isolates and will continue to be so used, due to the conserved nature of the genome of\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            . However, little is known about the processes involved in generating these or of their relative rates of change. Without an understanding of the biological characteristics of these genetic markers, it is difficult to use them to their full extent for understanding the population genetics and epidemiology of\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            . To address these points, we identified a cluster of 7 isolates in a collection of 101 clinical isolates and investigated them with various polymorphic genetic markers, which indicated that they were highly related to each other. This cluster provided a model system for the study of IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            transposition, evolution at the DR locus, and the effects of these on the determination of evolutionary relationships among\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            strains. Our results suggest that IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns are useful in grouping closely related isolates together; however, they can be misleading if used for making inferences about the evolutionary relationships between closely related isolates. DNA sequence analysis of the DR loci of these isolates revealed an evolutionary scenario, which, complemented with the information from IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            , allowed a reconstruction of the evolutionary steps and relationships among these closely related isolates. Loss of the IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            copy in the DR locus was noted, and the mechanisms of this loss are discussed.\n          </jats:p>",
