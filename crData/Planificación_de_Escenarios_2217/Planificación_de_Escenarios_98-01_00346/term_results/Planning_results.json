It was observed that a program can be successful if management cadres can be motivated and involved in the process. Other findings suggest the importance of education and communication materials, supply of information, orientation of fieldworkers, and mobilization of resources including hands-on refresher training. Misconceptions about male contraception (particularly vasectomy) are rampant in traditional Bangladeshi society, thus ideas should be positively expressed through visual aids. Among the various communications materials, at least one must be for service providers. According to this report, motivation is important in getting men involved in FP, as are efforts to create a male-friendly service delivery system at existing service delivery centers. Specially scheduled hours should be set aside for the provision of information and services to men, from the Health and Family Welfare Centers and at the community level.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this article are to (a) identify features needed in a clinical tool in order to organize collaborative planning for the future between therapist and client; (b) describe the structure and procedures for use of the Community Adaptive Planning Assessment (CAPA), which was developed to meet these needs; (c) summarize research on the usability, trustworthiness, and clinical effectiveness of the CAPA; and (d) consider future work to further evaluate qualitative tools like the CAPA for clinical and research purposes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Method. Initial and revised versions of the CAPA were evaluated through several studies. Usability was examined through questionnaires completed by therapists who used the CAPA in acute care, rehabilitation, home health, and community programs with a total of 105 clients who had a variety of acute and chronic disabilities. Trustworthiness was evaluated through comparison of information gathered from 21 clients with that from their family members. Clinical effectiveness was evaluated for discharge planning through content analysis of community outcomes of goals and plans established before discharge.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results. Initial studies indicate that the CAPA has sound usability, trustworthiness, and clinical effectiveness for a variety of service delivery systems and with a variety of clients when used by experienced therapists. Findings support use of these three criteria for evaluation of tools designed to document qualitative consultation-based practice.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions. Results are related to broader issues in the profession, including a need for further study of collaborative planning for the future between clients and therapists, ways in which qualitative aspects of practice can be documented efficiently, ways in which outcomes of consultation-based practice can be evaluated, and establishment of criteria for evaluation of emerging qualitative assessments and intervention tools.</jats:p>",

The project was implemented in two phases. In phase I, qualified PMPs from urban areas were given training on FP. In phase II, nonqualified PMPs were given training on FP. PIACT Bangladesh, a local NGO, conducted two pilot projects to involve the PMPs in FP. The first one was to involve qualified PMPs in urban areas (Dhaka) and the second one was to involve nonqualified PMPs in rural areas (Komalganj Thana of Moulvibazar District). Qualified PMPs are medical graduates and nonqualified PMPs are rural medical practitioners (RMPs) who are not medical graduates. The overall objective of the pilot projects was to explore the feasibility of involving PMPs and RMPs in providing selected FP services on a commercial basis with emphasis on counseling and side-effect management. The findings of both projects are presented in this report.</jats:p>"

Population growth has declined from 2.32 percent (1971–80) to 1.98 percent (1980–90), and then to 1.66 percent (1990–95). The continued slowing of population growth is expected to bring expanded opportunities for economic development and improved quality of life. The success of family planning (FP) programs cannot be judged solely on reduction of population growth but should also be judged in terms of quality of care (QOC) and success in helping women achieve their reproductive goals. The Indonesian National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) has acknowledged the need for improved QOC and continuous quality improvement to increase satisfaction among clients. At the national level, there is a need to monitor quality of contraceptive services to ensure efficient use of government resources and evaluate the extent to which the Indonesian FP program has provided information and services of adequate quality. In this report, the value of five selected macro-level QOC indicators is discussed to highlight potential usefulness to program planners and managers in their efforts to improve quality of FP care.</jats:p>"

This surge is shown to have arisen from changes in retailing methods among leading nonfood retailers and in land-use planning regulations which have created concerns over scarcity of land for future off-centre development. The implications for both setup and exit sunk costs for retailers, and alternative-use values for their land holdings, are discussed. It is also suggested that off-centre retailing may be subject to rapid changes in the next few years as the potential for maximisation of value from existing retail parks is sought by developers and financial institutions. </jats:p>",

This report addresses the need for a greater understanding of how information from OR studies is utilized. The Africa OR/TA Project II undertook a study to assess the extent to which information from OR studies conducted under the Africa OR/TA Project I (1988–1993) was utilized. The study also examined the factors influencing how study results were utilized. Case studies of several OR projects were undertaken to explore both of these issues. The purpose of this report is to present recommendations to OR practitioners, donors, and users of OR of actions that will increase the likelihood that program managers will use OR findings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For as long as there have been family planning programs, there has been family planning research. At the theoretical level, researchers examine the effect of fertility on health and socioeconomic development and study the determinants of fertility for individuals and populations. At the policy level, studies explore the role of family planning programs in modifying fertility and health. The development of new contraceptives is accompanied by clinical and pre-introductory trials in program settings. Surveys measure changes in contraceptive use and fertility, and the results are used to make decisions affecting programs. Finally, programs themselves carry out operations research (OR) to improve service delivery. This book provides an overview of how OR is used by family planning programs. The readings illustrate many of the major issues and topics that have benefited from OR, as well as many of the research designs encountered among OR studies. The book also provides information about the problems that programs and researchers encounter in carrying out OR and the challenges faced in translating research findings into changes in day-to-day program operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) supported publication of “Clinic-Based Family Planning and Reproductive Health Services in Africa: Findings from Situation Analysis Studies.” The book reflects USAID's commitment to improving quality of reproductive health (RH) care and expanding access for underserved groups. Nowhere are these efforts more important than in Africa, where use of family planning (FP) and other measures of RH status are lowest among the world’s regions. Providing high-quality health services that meet couples' reproductive needs is a socially just and humane goal in itself. Moreover, higher-quality services can be expected to result in better outcomes with regard to measures of client satisfaction, continuation of contraceptive use, and RH, which in turn have positive implications for the individual client and the population at large. This book presents results from 12 Situation Analysis studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa between 1989 and 1996. By synthesizing these findings from nearly a decade of research, the book contributes to the understanding and improvement of FP and RH programs in sub-Saharan Africa and around the world.</jats:p>"

The two studies, generally referred to as Situation Analysis studies, were conducted in 1991 and 1996. The 1996 survey collected data from 192 health facilities spread throughout Zimbabwe. During this exercise, an inventory of physical facilities, equipment, and educational materials was taken. In addition, 758 provider–client interactions of new and revisit clients were observed. Exit interviews were conducted with service providers, and with family planning and maternal and child health clients. In this report, wherever possible findings from the 1996 study are compared to those of 1991 in which 181 health facilities were visited. However, the evolution of the Situation Analysis methodology since 1991 limits the degree to which comparisons can be made between the two studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Unsafe abortion constitutes a major public health problem throughout the world, leading to high levels of maternal morbidity and mortality. Abortion accounts for roughly one-third of maternal mortality in the world. Millions of other women experience short- and long-term morbidity, such as infertility and pain. The concept of postabortion care (PAC) has gained wide acceptance as a means to improve services provided to women with complications from spontaneous or unsafely induced abortions. One way to improve emergency treatment is through introducing manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), which has been shown to be safer and less costly than dilation and curettage (D&amp;C). Providing the second element, postabortion family planning, will enable women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. A study to test different ways of providing improved PAC services has been conducted by the Population Council’s Africa Operations Research and Technical Assistance Project II in collaboration with the Kenyan Ministry of Health and Ipas. As stated in this report, the study focused primarily on the first two components of PAC: improving emergency treatment through introducing or upgrading MVA services and comparing three models of postabortion family planning provision.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of reimbursement schemes for community-based distribution (CBD) programs in Tanzania, and answers whether agents who receive monetary incentives perform better and are more cost-effective than those that receive nonmonetary incentives. Fieldwork was undertaken in April and May 1997, and data forming the basis of the analysis was collected from four CBD programs. These programs vary in their remuneration schemes and status of their CBD agents, size, and geographical coverage; the range of activities undertaken by the agents; and supervision and management structures. As noted in this report, CBD agents who receive monetary remuneration see more clients and generate more Couple Years of Protection than those provided with nonmonetary incentives. The program relying on part-time volunteer agents who receive nonmonetary remuneration is the most cost-effective. There are a number of programmatic factors that account for variances in program-output performance and cost-effectiveness. Understanding these factors is important in guiding decision-making about future planning, resource allocation, and technical assistance for CBD programs in Tanzania. These factors and their programmatic recommendations are provided in this report.</jats:p>"

During the extension period of the ANE OR/TA project, four OR studies were implemented in the Philippines dealing with cross-cutting issues, including a study to assess the feasibility of integrating RTI management within FP/MCH programs; an intervention study dealing with improving quality of care via expanded FP counseling; an intervention to address high unmet need in Pangasinan Province; and an intervention study to increase male involvement in RH in Bukidnon Province. These efforts, along with a study of factors affecting use and discontinuation of the IUD, have generated demand for technical assistance, along with corresponding personnel needed to provide such assistance, thereby necessitating this initiative. Activities include providing advice on technical questions, serving as resource persons in training on research design and methodology, assisting in data analysis, disseminating project findings, traveling to project sites, and monitoring and coordinating activities. The report specifies activities undertaken to fulfill the objectives of capacity building and institutionalization of OR in the country covered under this contract.</jats:p>"

Chaos and uncertainty are (will be) market opportunities for the wise.Tom Peters, Thriving on Chaos, 1987 The analyst who attempts to build a mathematical model for a real world system is often faced with the problem of uncertain, noisy, incomplete or erroneous data. This is true for several application domains. In business applications noisy data are prevalent. Returns of financial instruments, demand for a firm’s products, the cost of fuel, and consumption of power and other resources are examples of model data that are known with some probabilistic distribution at best. In social sciences data are often incomplete-for example, partial census surveys are carried out periodically in lieu of a complete census of the population. In the physical sciences and engineering data are usually subject to measurement errors, as in models of image restoration from remote sensing experiments.</jats:p>",

Variations in  growth, outcome of regeneration, timber prices, costs and mortality  cannot be avoided, whereas the quality of inventory data and the models  used for estimation of the state and development of forests can be  improved. Methods have been developed for incorporating risk and  attitude toward risk in decision analysis, but there has been a lack of  good models for dealing with the various sources of risk. The aim of  this study was to estimate stochastic models for the variation in growth  of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch  (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens). The said models had to be  capable of generating growth scenarios, and thus correlations between  series had to be taken into account. ARMA models were estimated for mean  growth index series from Pohjois-Karjala, eastern Finland. Several ARMA  models, some of which had seasonal parameters, were found to be  adequate for each series. Non-seasonal AR(1) and seasonal AR(1,1) models  were used to produce growth scenarios in the case study, in which  variation in growth was integrated into forest planning.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNordwestdeutschland hat sich seit Ende der 80er Jahre günstiger entwickelt als das übrige westdeutsche Bundesgebiet. Damit hat sich ein langanhaltender räumlicher Entwicklungstrend umgekehrt. Die Ursachen hierfür liegen teils in der spezifischen Wirtschaftsstruktur Nordwestdeutschlands begründet, teils sind sie aber auch auf eine verbesserte Standortsituation zurückzuführen. So hat die deutsche Einheit und die Öffnung Osteuropas die Region besonders begünstigt. Nordwestdeutschland konnte seine Attraktivität für das Sachkapital steigern, allerdings nicht für das Humankapital. Unter anderem deshalb ist nicht sichergestellt, daß Nordwestdeutschland dauerhaft auf einen steileren Wachstumspfad eingeschwenkt ist. Hamburg ist seit Ender der 80er Jahre zur treibenden Kraft der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung in Nordwestdeutschland geworden. Die Stadt nimmt zunehmend eine Metropolfunktion für die Region wahr. Die administrative Gliederung in Stadtstaaten und Flächenländer stellt einen Nachteil für Nordwestdeutschland im Standortwettbewerb dar, da vielfach miteinander verflochtene Wirtschaftsräume administrativ zerschnitten werden. Dadurch sind die Bedingungen für eine optimale Standortpolitik in dieser Region weniger günstig als anderswo.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

There are some good reasons to construct a fully discretized model of this problem, to which we can apply the various row action algorithms and block-iterative methods discussed in earlier chapters. We will explain our reasons and also present some computational results. Radiation therapy maintains a prominent place in the treatment of neoplastic lesions (tumors). Over the past ninety years, medical experience and laboratory studies have established the principles whereby radiation can be used as an effective modality for oncological treatment.</jats:p>",

La ŝtata lingvoleĝo de 1989 kaj ĝia modifita versio de 1995 okupiĝas precipe pri aferoj rilataj al lingvo-ranga planado. Aldonaj rimedoj kun rilato al la lingvaro estas prenitaj, interalie direktivoj por leksika reformo kaj leĝoj regantaj la transiron de la cirila al la nova latinida alfabeto kiu estas akceptita. La celo de tiu ĉi artikolo estas kontroli la daŭran lingvoreforman laboron en Uzbekistano por vidi sur kiuj principoj kaj sintenoj la uzbeka lingvopolitiko baziĝas, kaj kiun influon ĝi eble havas ĉe la lingva situation en la lando ĝenerale. Ĝi povas esti karakterizata kiel centrita lingvoplanado, ne nur rilate decidofaradon, sed ankaŭ rilate la efektivigadon de lingvoleĝoj kaj la taksadon de la reformlaboro. Samtempe, ŝajnas ekzisti multe da malcerteco pri ĝuste kiu estas la fina celo de lingva ŝangado.</jats:p>",

This article examines the way decentralisation has enabled French local authorities to define and implement policy and how far actors within the system have modified their behaviour as a result of the changes. It explores the commentaries on decentralisation in France, and looks at land-use planning, which was one of the major powers to be transferred to the communes, examining how communes have used the powers and how central government has responded. The article concludes that there have been significant gains in local autonomy but that central government has struggled to redefine its own role. It also identifies a series of problems that have yet to be resolved for decentralisation to be fully effective.</jats:p>",

The Moon will provide firm and large base, very stable temperature and low background in some selected sites. In addition, the aids of human activities on the Moon can be expected in the near future. We have been discussing the small but realistic steps toward the future Moon-based astronomy, as part of Japanese lunar exploration plans with HI rockets. The fundamental Policy of Japan’s Space Development which was approved by Space Activities Commission in 1996 described that Japan will continuously promote unmanned lunar exploration and study the feasibility of a systematic exploration program for science and possible activities on the Moon, under a phase-by-phase approach. The plan includes a possibility of astronomical observations on the lunar surface.</jats:p><jats:p>Some pilot-type astronomical plans, starting from very small-size telescopes in optical/IR and mm-wave etc. are under discussion. We report here on the general background, discussion including proposed plans, and steps toward the future moon-based observatories.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RÉSUMÉ\n\t\tLa Cohabitation linguistique: \"Frenglish \" dans la presse mauricienne\n\t\t\"Frenglish\" se refère à l'emprunt fréquent de mots et d' expressions anglaises dans le français écrit. C'est un phénomène que repoussent les puristes linguistiques, particulièrement en France et au Québec. Dans la société multilingue de l'Ile Maurice, au contraire, le \"Frenglish\" est un fait commun et non controversé. Il est le résultat linguistique naturel d'un colonialisme diachronique et du développement postcolonial. Paradoxalement, peut-être représente-il aussi un havre pour l'anglophonie mauricienne.\n\t\tL'analyse de l'utilisation du \"Frenglish\" à travers la presse mauricienne a permis de distinguer dix catégories. Ainsi avons nous pu dégager le caractere unique de la sociéte locale en abordant sous l'angle linguistique les divers niveaux de la vie sociale, économique, politique, légale et administrative. La situation à Maurice est differente de celle des Seychelles puisque oux Seychelles la presse est de preference anglophone et donc le \"Frenglish\" réduit au minimum. L'américanisation, la globalisation, et \"l'anglais rampant\" se joignent actuellement aux héritages du colonialisme français et britannique pour expliquer le développement et l'extension du \"Frenglish\" mauricien.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa frangla en la maŭritania gazetaro\n\t\t\"Frenglish\", la frangla - la ofta uzado de anglalingvaj vortoj kaj terminoj en franclingvaj tekstoj - estas tabuo por lingvaj puristoj, aparte en Francio kaj Kebekio. Tamen, sur la multlingva insulo Mauritanio ĝi estas tiel nekontroversa kiel komuna. La frangla evoluis kiel la natura lingva rezulto de diakrona koloniismo kaj la postkoloniisma situacio sur Maŭritanio. Paradokse, ĝi ankaŭ reprezentas lingvan havenon por maŭritania anglalingveco.\n\t\tEsplorado ĉe la loka gazetaro dum naŭmonata periodo elmontris dek kategoriojn de la frangla. La frangla en la maŭritia gazetaro evidentigas la unikecon de la loka societo, donante lingvistikan kuntekston por vastaj gamoj de la socia, ekonomika, politika, leĝa kaj administra vivo. La frangla maŭritania diferenciĝas de la situacio sur la Sejŝeloj, kie la gazetaro estas pli anglalingva ol franclingva kaj la frangla minimumas. Hereditaĵoj de la koloniismoj franca kaj angla — nuntempe akompanate de usoniĝo, tutmondiĝo kaj \"angla alrampo\" — eksplikas la evoluon kaj kreskadon de la frangla maŭritia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With urban planning policy in transition in many parts of the world, the need to understand the theoretical bases for planning and to ground discussion about policy innovations on theory is as important as ever. This essay reviews the relevance of three economic paradigms to the theory of development control. It is written as a technical review with the purpose of explaining, contrasting and contextualising the contributions of these paradigms. Much has been written about the Pigouvian case for regulative planning. The Coasian literature is strong especially in the US but is not so well known elsewhere; and little has been written that draws together the diverse perspectives offered by the public choice school. This essay has been written particularly for academic planners and urban social scientists in the UK, and in other European and Commonwealth countries who are not familiar with the technical arguments underlying the Coase vs Pigou zoning debate. It is also an essay on the public choice theory of planning since it contextualises Coasian planning theory within that wider critique of welfare economics. Among other points, it argues that the relevance of Coasian planning theory is not by any means restricted to US-style zoning, nor is it purely a debate about deregulation. Coasian and other public choice perspectives generate a rich source of theoretical and empirical propositions which should be tested and developed, particularly as frameworks for comparative analysis of planning constitutions and policies. In this spirit, the essay concludes with elements of a research agenda. </jats:p>",

Ziel des Beitrages ist es, vor diesem Hintergrund abzuwägen, inwieweit kooperierende Lieferanten und Produzenten zur Bildung eines Unternehmensnetzes auf einem Gewerbegebiet angesiedelt werden können und als zusätzliches Kriterium in die Bauleitplanung integrierbar sind. Dieses kann eine erhebliche Verkehrsminderung, Emissionsreduzierung sowie eine Kostensenkung für Staat und Unternehmen bewirken. Im ersten Kapitel wird deshalb zunächst der Trend zur Bildung von Unternehmensnetzen erläutert. Im folgenden Kapitel werden Gründe der öffentlichen Hand zur Unterstützung solcher Unternehmensnetze aufgeführt. Die rechtliche Grundlage zur entsprechenden Gliederung der Areale schließt sich im dritten Kapitel an. Abschließend werden bestehende Unternehmensnetze betrachtet, ein entwickeltes, regionales Unternehmensnetzwerk beschrieben und eine entsprechende Schlußfolgerung abgeleitet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents the story of the beginning of a movement to improve the perinatal mental health of families in the South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service. The movement is made up of practitioners and consumers who want to improve services. An early initiative was to provide information on appropriate referral procedures for postnatal depression, for General Practitioners (GPs), early childhood nurses and others who may be asked for help by women. A second project was a submission for inpatient accommodation for women with acute psychoses or depression and their infants. The key theme that has emerged is that perinatal mental health is an issue with many disparate causes and effects, some of which health systems can address. The promotion and maintenance of perinatal mental health requires a great deal of collaboration between health professionals from various disciplines. Existing levels of collaboration between services are insufficient and approaches to perinatal mental health should be re-oriented in order to facilitate a move from fragmented care to continuity of care. Primary care is the most appropriate starting point for co-ordinating collaborative efforts. Currently, the focus is completing a Perinatal Mental Health Strategic Plan to be considered in planning mental health services for the South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service. </jats:p>"

Es kommen angebotsseitige Effekte hinzu. Dies können direkte Sogeffekte sein, weil andere wirtschaftliche Aktivitäten die räumliche Nähe zu einem Fußballbundesligaverein suchen. Es können indirekte Sogeffekte sein, weil die Qualität oder das Image eines Standorts durch die Existenz eines Fußballbundesligisten steigt und der Standort somit für andere Unternehmen an Attraktivität gewinnt. Schließlich sind Effekte zu erwähnen, die in das Klassifikationsschema nach Angebot und Nachfrage kaum einzuordnen sind—die Wirkungen auf den kommunalen Haushalt und Aspekte, die zu gesellschaftlichen, aber nicht zu privatwirtschaftlichen Kosten und Erträgen führen, sind Beispiele hierfür.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper briefly examines the business environment and challenges facing the Upstream (E&amp;P) Sector. It suggests that operational phase risks, which undermine a venture's economic success, have traditionally been understated and inadequately defined. This, in turn, has tended to shape a (reactive) problem solving culture vis-vis a (proactive) management of risk culture in the Industry. Failures of ventures to deliver the expected return on the capital investment have been an unwelcome result.Operations Business Planning (OBP) is a technique which encourages the venture to move into proactive modus operandi. It achieves this through systematically integrating a venture's assets, activities, resources, costs and employee knowledge into a practical dynamic model. This model can be used to constantly challenge the acceptability of the venture's performance and to proactively re-shape its strategies and tactics to successfully exploit the varying business climates it faces in its life.Examples are cited to demonstrate the success of OBP's application and the benefits achieved.</jats:p>"

His profound interest in planned languages had a significant effect on the development of his ideas on terminology. The article sketches the relationship between planned languages ([artificial] world auxiliary languages) and specialized technical languages, with particular reference to Esperanto, and analyzes its significance for several aspects of Wüster's work (the Encyclopaedic Esperanto-German Dictionary, his dissertation International Language Standardisation in Technology, the international dictionary of electrical technology, and the project of an international terminological code).\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tPri la rolo de planlingvoj en la terminologiscienca verko de Eugen Wüster\n\t\tLa fondinto de la terminologio-scienco estis ankaŭ grava interlingvisto kaj kunfondinto de la esperantologio . Lia profunda okupigo pri planlingvoj konsiderinde influis la evoluon de liaj terminologio-sciencaj konceptoj. La kontribuo skizas la faklingvan rolon de planlingvoj ([artefaritaj] mondhelplingvoj), aparte de Esperanto, kaj la rilatojn inter planlingvoj kaj terminologio-scienco en kelkaj partoj de la verko de Wüster (la Enciklopedia Vortaro Esperanto-Germana, la disertacio Internacia lingvo-normigo en la teknkiko, la internacia elektroteknika vortaro kaj la projekto de internacia terminologia kodo).</jats:p>",

For about thirteen years, the Rural Health Research Centre of the Indian Council of Medical Research and Johns Hopkins University’s Department of International Health was located in Narangwal, a village with a population of about 1,800 located in Ludhiana District of the Indian Punjab. The project worked in twenty-six villages with a population of 35,000 distributed according to a controlled experimental design in three community development blocks with a population of over 300,000.</jats:p>",

The task of transporting a micro-part in a partially unstructured environment, that includes obstacles whose locations are not initially known, \nis introduced with the optimal plan formulated on the basis of the observed environmental conditions. Fuzzy set theory, well-suited to the management of uncertainty, is introduced to address the uncertainty associated with the part-bringing procedure. A part-bringing algorithm for generating the optimal plan related to a part assembly, despite existing \nobstacles, is presented. It is shown that the machine organizer using a sensor system can intelligently determine an optimal plan, based on explicit performance criteria, to overcome environmental uncertainty. The algorithm utilizes knowledge processing functions such as machine reasoning, planning, memory, and decision-making. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm is applicable not only \nto a wide range of robotic tasks including pick and place operations and maneuvering mobile based robots around obstacles, but also to the control of unmanned aircraft.</jats:p>",

Yet, somehow, modern corporations have been constructed in a way that constrains, impedes, and sometimes kills this natural human instinct. Focused on maximizing short‐term static efficiency, most have been designed to extract as much value as possible from all their assets, including people.

Von den Hochschulen wird in diesem Zusammenhang erwartet, daß sie mit ihrem Bildungs- und Wissenschaftspotential Entwicklungsimpulse setzen und so langfristig einen stabilen Beitrag zur Stärkung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der regionalen Wirtschaft leisten. Diese Erwartung wird in der Literatur durch empirische Analysen gestützt. So haben u. a. Audretsch und Feldman nachgewiesen, daß in unmittelbarer geographischer Nähe einer Wissensquelle, wie z. B. einer Universität, verstärkt innovative Aktivitäten auftreten. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es, zu untersuchen, inwieweit auch im Umfeld der TU Ilmenau Spillovers der Wissensproduktion empirisch nachweisbar sind und welche theoretischen Implikationen sich mit diesen Effekten verbinden. Dementsprechend gliedern sich die folgenden Ausführungen in zwei Hauptabschnitte. Zunächst werden die Ergebnisse einer Unternehmensbefragung dargestellt, um auf Grundlage des empirischen Befundes die Frage nach einer theoretischen Erklärung für das Auftreten verstärkter Innovationsaktivitäten im Umfeld der Technischen Universität zu diskutieren.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Die Beispiele stammen von einem Korpus schriftlichen Kreols, der von in Großbritannien lebenden Schriftstellern mit karibischen Erbe produziert wurde. Orthographie wird hier im folgenden Sinn verwendet: eine Anzahl von orthographischen Praktiken die Autoren verwenden, um eine Sprache zu repräsentieren, für die es keine standardisierte Konventionen gibt. Ich argumentiere, daB, obwohl die Rechtschreibung des Kreol stark varieiert, die Schriftsteller/Verfasser der Texte — möglicherweise unbewuBt — wählen, die die Unterschiede zwischen Kreol und Standard Englisch hervorheben. Ich argumentiere daB, man sich Orthographie, wie literacy nach Street (1984), auf zwei Arten nähern kann: auf der Basis eines \"autonomen\" Modells oder eines \"ideologischen\". Ich argumentiere weiter, daB man die orthographischen Praktiken zeitgenössischer Britischer Kreolschriftsteller nur unter Annahme des \"ideologischen\" Modells verstehen kann.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tFonologio renkontas ideologion:\n\t\tLa signifo de ortografiaj praktiko] en la brita kreolajo\n\t\tTiu ĉi studo traktas la ortografion de nenormigita varianto de skribata lingvo, la anglaleksikona kreolajo uzata en Britio de karibdevenaj homoj.

La ortografio estas tie ĉi konsiderata aro de praktiko] farataj de verkistoj dum ili provas reprezenti lingvon por kiu neniu kutima skriba reprezento ekzistas. Mi argumentas ke dum la literumado de la kreolajo multe varias, verkistoj - eble senkonscie — elektas konvenciojn kiuj emfazas la diferencojn inter la kreolajo kaj la laŭnorma angla. Mi argumentas ke ortografio, kiel alfabeteco laŭ Street (1984), povas esti alirata en unu el du manieroj, surbaze de modelo aŭ \"aŭtonomia\" aŭ \"ideologia\", kaj ke nur ideologia aliro ebligas komprenon de la ortografiaj praktikoj de nuntempaj verkistoj en la brita kreolajo.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tFrom Duality to Complementarity: The Case of Bilingualism in Morocco\n\t\tBecause of the numerous cultural contacts it has undergone, Morocco has become a territory in which a large variety of languages intersect. In fact, it has always known one form of bilingualism or another. Among the dialects currently in use are Tarifit, Tamazight and Tashelhit. Although Arabic remains the only official language, it neither rejects the acquisition of French nor threatens the presence of Tamazight. The complexity of the situation regarding the diversity of languages in contact is one of the most striking characteristics of Moroccan society and culture. This linguistic mosaic reflects an important force in society despite the diversity of thought. The contact of cultures articulated through these various languages allows Morocco to assign value to a bilingualism that is not perceived as a kind of rivalry but rather as complementing the development of modern cosmopolitan Moroccan society.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tDe dueco al komplementeco: La kazo de dulingvismo en Maroko\n\t\tPro la multaj kulturaj kontaktoj kiujn gi spertis, Maroko farigis teritorio en kiu granda diverseco da lingvoj intertusigas. Efektive, gi ciam estis iel plurlingva, pro la ceesto de malsamaj etnolingvaj grupoj. Inter la dialektoj nun uzataj estas Tarifit, Tamazíht kaj Taselhit. Kvankam la araba restas la sola oficiala lingvo, gi nek forpelas la francan nek minacas la ceeston de Tamaziht. La komplikeco de la situacio rilate la diversecon de lingvoj en kontakto estas unu el la plej trafaj karakterizoj de la maroka socio kaj kulturo. Tiu lingva mozaiko konsistigas gravan forton en la socio spite de la multaj pensofluoj. La kontakto de kulturoj esprimita per tiuj diversaj lingvoj permesas al Maroko la atribuon de valoro al plurlingvismo, kiun oni ne perceptas kiel ian rivalecon, sed kiel komplementon al la evoluo de moderna kosmopolita maroka socio.</jats:p>",

In former times preoperative planning of interventions usually took place in the surgeons mind. Today&amp;apos;s new computer techniques allow the surgeon to discuss various operation methods for a patient and to visualize them three-dimensionally. The use of computer assisted surgical planning helps to get better results of a treatment and supports the surgeon before and during the surgical intervention. In this paper we are presenting our planning and simulation system for operations in maxillo-facial surgery. All phases of a surgical intervention are supported. Chapter 1 gives a description of the medical motivation for our planning system and its environment. In Chapter 2 the basic components are presented. The planning system is depicted in Chapter 3 and a simulation of a robot assisted surgery can be found in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 concludes the paper and gives a survey about our future work.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tOrthographic Reform, Planning and Linguistic Diffusion:\n\t\tThe Case of Portuguese\n\t\tGarcez'(1995) seminal paper on the 1990 Luso-Brazilian Orthographic Accord presents an opportunity to point to the arbitrariness of spelling reforms in Portugal and in Brazil, particularly with respect to the use of diacritic marks (circumflex, acute and grave accents). Evidence for this statement is based on the vicissitudes of rules for written accents in Brazilian Portuguese. Garcez (1995:159) concludes that the Accord is in fact \"a minor spelling reform\". It is the contention of this paper that the Luso-Brazilian Accord, although a diplomatic and political achievement as Garcez argues, is in fact a strategy, on one hand, to spread the Portuguese language in Africa, particularly in the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé e Principe, and, on the other, to construct and solidify a community of lusophone nations in geopolitical terms in world affairs. But as in the case of all instances of language planning and attempts to spread languages, the consequences of the use of Portuguese as an official language, particularly in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, must be considered in light of the use or non-use of one or more African languages as well as Creole in these nations (Phillipson 1992, Phillipson and Skutnabb-Kangas 1995). Specialists dealing with language planning in the PALOP countries (países Africanos de língua Oficial Portuguesa), must take into consideration the specific political, cultural, linguistic and ethnic situation of each nation.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tOrtografia reformo, planado kaj lingva disvastigo: La kazo de la portugala\n\t\tEn sia fekunda referajo de 1995 pri la Ortografia Interkonsento Luza-Brazila, Garcez prezentas okazon por indiki la arbitrecon de la literumaj reformoj en Portugalio kaj Brazilo, precipe rilate la uzon de diakritoj (cirkumflekso kaj kornaj strekoj). Tiun aserton atestas la sortosangoj de reguloj por skribaj diakritoj en la brazila portugala lingvo. Garcez konkludas, ke la Interkonsento estas efektive \"minora literuma reformo\". La nuna referajo pretendas, ke la Interkonsento, kvankam atingo diplomata kaj politika, kiel argumentas Garcez, estas fakte strategio por, unuflanke, disvastigi la portugalan en Afriko, precipe en la iamaj portugalaj kolonioj Angolo, Mozambiko, Gvine-Bisao, Verdkabaj Insuloj kaj Santomeo, kaj, aliflanke, konstrui kaj solidigi komunumon de portugallingvaj nacioj en geopolitikaj mondaj aferoj. Sed, kiel okazas en ciuj ekzemploj de lingvoplanado kaj klopodoj disvastigi lingvojn, la konsekvencoj de utiligo de la portugala kiel oficiala lingvo, precipe en Angolo, Mozambiko kaj Gvine-Bisao, devas esti konsiderataj en la kadro de la uzo au neuzo de unu au pluraj afrikaj lingvoj kaj kreolaj lingvoj en tiuj nacioj. Fakuloj, kiuj pritraktas lingvoplanadon en la landoj PALOP (países Africanos de língua Oficial Portuguesa), devas preni en konsideron la specif an politikan, kulturan, lingvan kaj etnan situacion de ciu unuopa nacio.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SOMMAIRE\n\t\tMort d'une langue, naissance d'une identité: Le cas de la Bretagne\n\t\tLe Duché de Bretagne fut officiellement rattaché à la France en 1532; aujourd'hui encore, il est considéré comme une des régions françaises. Cependant, même si, du point de vue d'un étranger, la Bretagne constitue une unité géographique, la situation est quelque peu équivoque car, en y regardant de plus près, la Bretagne n'est entitaire que par le nom. Le pays se divise sur le plan linguistique en une zone de langue romane et une zone bretonnante, cette dernière se divisant sur le plan historique en quatre diocèses. Ces frontières ont déterminé la répartition linguistique de la zone en quatre dialectes principaux dont chaque groupe de locuteurs prétend ne pas comprendre les trois autres. Pour ces bretonnants traditionnels, ils n'existe pas d'identité bretonne globale. En outre, beaucoup d'entre eux hésiteraient à considérer le diocèse comme leur foyer culturel. Par tradition, c'est la commune qui représente, pour la plupart des bretonnants, le siège de leur identité: c'était le breton de sa commune que l'on parlait, les danses de sa commune que l'on dansait et la coiffe de sa commune que l'on portait.\n\t\tLe déclin progressif de la langue pendant la deuxième moitié de ce siècle, suite à plusieurs décennies de politique jacobine des gouvernements français successifs, a eu un effet notable sur l'identité bretonne. A mesure que sont lancées des campagnes pour la sauvegarde de la langue, surgit l'idée d'une \"Breizh une et indivisible\", que se rassemble autour du drapeau breton. Les champions de la Cause bretonne sont les néo-bretonnants, pour la plupart des citadins d'origine bourgeoise, et qui parlent un breton standardisé, homogène, en général appris en classe. Ces locuteurs se distinguent nettement des bretonnants traditionels mais, et là réside le paradoxe, ils semblent jouer un rôle non négligeable dans la création d'une identité bretonne.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tMorto de lingvo, naskiĝo de identeco: Bretonio kaj la bretonoj\n\t\tLa Duklando de Bretonio estis oficiale unuigita kun Francio en la jaro 1532 kaj ĝis hodiaŭ estas daŭre rigardata kiel région. Tamen, kvankam eksterlandaj turistoj eble perceptas Bretonion kiel teritorian unuon, la situacio estas iom anomalia pro tio, ke, je pli proksima rigardo, Bretonio aspektas kiel unuo nur laŭnome. La lando estas lingve dividita inter romanid-parola regiono kaj kelt-parola regiono, kaj ĉi-lasta siavice dividiĝas historié en kvar diocezojn, kiuj formas limojn fundamentajn al la lingva disdivido de la regiono en kvar ĉefajn dialektojn, kiujn multaj parolantoj trovas nekompreneblaj inter si. Laŭ la vidpunkto de la parolantoj de la dialektoj, ne ekzistas iu bretona identeco. Multaj eĉ hezitus konsideri diocezon kiel fokusopunkton de sia lojaleco. Tradicie, ŝajnas, ke la commune (komunuma distrikto) estis la identecopunkto por plej multaj bretonoj: oni parolis la komunuman version de la bretona lingvo, dancis ties dancojn kaj portis ties coiffe (ĉapon).\n\t\tLa falo de la lingvo dum la dua duono de la nuna jarcento, rezulte de multaj jardekoj da centrigisma politiko fare de sinsekvaj francaj registaroj, havadas notindan efikon je la bretona identeco. Dum oni lanĉas kampanjon por savi la lingvon, iom post iom aperas koncepto de iu Breizh une et indivisible (Bretonio unueca kaj nedividebla) kun la bretona flago kiel kerna instigilo. La ĉefaj ĉampionoj de la Bretona Afero estas nova grupo de bretonnants (bretonianoj), precipe el mezklasaj kaj urbaj rondoj, kiuj parolas normigitan, tutbretonian version de la bretona lingvo, kiun kutime ili lernis père de la eduka sistemo. Tiuj parolantoj staras multrilate aparté de la parolantoj de la tradiciaj dialektoj; tamen, iom paradokse, ĝuste ili ludadas gravan rolon en la kreado de koncepto de bretona identeco.</jats:p>",

Closer analysis reveals a number of complex subtexts underlying the Utopian visions put forward by Chinese linguists and language planners like Qian Xuantong. As a linguistic model, Esperanto helped to catalyze new approaches to Chinese phonetical transciption and writing reform, and to the shaping of a common Chinese language. The Esperanto debate was also part of the wider battle over the Chinese classical tradition: Qian's provocative call for the abolition of the Chinese language must be regarded as a direct attack on the conservative Chinese literati.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tReformo de la ĉina lingo: Esperanto kiel provokilo kaj stimulilo\n\t\tInter 1916 kaj 1919 ardis debato en la avangarda cina revuo Xin Qingnian pri la pretendoj de Esperanto kiel internacia lingvo. Pli detala analizo montras, al kiaj komplikaj motivoj kaj ideoj respondis la ŝajne utopiaj proponoj de ĉinaj lingvoreformistoj kiel Qian Xuantong. Interalie, Esperanto kiel lingva modelo helpis katalizi novajn alirojn al la fonetika transskribo kaj skribsistema reformo de la ĉina lingvo, same kiel al ĝia socia funkciado. Aliflanke, la tuta Esperanto-debato nur eris en pli vasta batalo pri la klasika literatura tradicio: tiukadre necesas konsideri la provokan alvokon de Qian por abolo de la ĉina lingvo kiel rektan atakon al la konservativuloj.</jats:p>",

Diese umfaßt eine Unternehmensbeschreibung, Beschreibung der Merkmale ihrer Hauptstandorte, insbesondere auch deren Umwelt- und Freizeitqualität, sowie der geforderten Merkmale ihrer besser qualifizierten Mitarbeiter. Für uns unerwartet war, welche geradezu als drastisch zu nennenden Ansprüche diese Unternehmen an ihre Umweltqualität und an das Freizeitangebot für ihre Mitarbeiter stellen.

After 100 acquisition trials, participants performed a retention test in their own condition and then were transferred to each of the other two vision conditions. Both performance and kinematic data indicated that rather than becoming less dependent on visual information with practice, subjects learned to adjust their movement trajectories to use the visual information available in their particular vision condition. Although transfer to a degraded vision condition disrupted performance, when vision was augmented participants quickly adjusted their aiming trajectories to use the added information. The findings suggest that at least part of learning involves the development of rapid and efficient procedures for processing afferent information, including visual response-produced feedback.</jats:p>",

Most of these come from rural areas and are often considered separately from the planning of the urban area. Uncontrolled urban growth may sterilize resources or lead to contaminative activities occurring close to vulnerable aquifers. Foundation problems may influence both rate and costs of urban development and geological hazards may threaten property or public safety. Urban areas may grow across potential problems of their own making, such as waste disposal sites. Such problems can be minimized if (a) development takes place in the right places and is properly designed and executed; and (b) the implications of urban development are considered in the context of the availability and supply of minerals, water and land, and the environmental effects of exploiting these.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>To achieve balanced consideration of planning and development options, sound geological and geomorphological information is needed at (a) the site level, for specific developments; and (b) the regional level, to guide general allocations of land for particular uses and alert those designing site investigations to the range of problems to be considered.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Geological and related factors relevant to decision making are often neglected. There have been increasing efforts by geologists to secure adequate basic information for selected urban areas but results often have been presented in a form which does not meet the requirements of planners and other decision makers, who may have had no geological training. Whilst planning of land use in urban areas will always be led by economic, social and conservation pressures, it is important to involve planners in identification of relevant issues and the design and presentation of results.</jats:p>",

Voorgangers van die finale Grondwet van 1996 (die ANC Handves van Menseregte (1990) en die tussentydse Grondwet (1993) maak dit baie duidelik dat inheemse tale bevorder and ontwikkel moet word. Hierdie besluit het belangrike implikasies vir die Nasionale Weermag gehad, waar, soos algemeen aanvaar is, Afrikaans die de facto taal vir alle aspekte van militêre lewe was. As gevolg van massiewe demografiese veranderinge, was transformasie noodsaaklik. Hierdie verslag rapporteer oor taalhoudings en taalpraktyk by 6SAI in die Ooskaap, en dit kyk krities na hierdie aangeleenthede in die lig van die nasionale taalplan as geheel.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingva politiko en SANDF (Sudafrika Nacia Defendoforto): Ĉu ĉe decidopunkto?\n\t\tEn 1994 oni disanoncis novan nacian lingvan politikon en Sudafriko, kiu, anstataŭ preskribi nur la anglan kaj afrikansan kiel oficialajn lingvojn, deklaris 11 lingvojn oficialaj. La antaŭuloj de la fina Konstitucio de 1996 (la Deklaro de Rajtoj de la Afrika Nacia Kongreso, 1990, kaj la Portempa Konstitucio, 1993) plene klarigas, ke oni devas evoluigi kaj apogi la indigenajn lingvojn. Tiu decido havis apartan signifon ĉe la Nacia Defendoforto, kie estas vaste agnoskite, ke afrikansa estas la efektiva laborlingvo de ĉiuj aspektoj de la armea vivo, kaj kiu devis trairi grandegan transformiĝon rilate la lingvan kaj etnan originon de siaj soldatoj. La nuna referaĵo raportas pri lingvaj starpunktoj kaj lingvaj praktikoj en 6SAI (Sesa Sudafrika Infanteria Bataliono) en Orientkaba Provinco, kaj kritike pridiskutas la situacion en kunteksto de la nacia lingva piano kiel tuto.</jats:p>",

Nationwide multicentre trials provide protocols for the therapy of the children. The calculation of the chemotherapy according to the protocols is rather complex and the documentation efforts for the pediatricians are enormous. Thus, we developed as a first step an application system for Computer Aided Therapy Planning In Pediatric Oncology (CATIPO), that is in routine use in about 20 pediatric clinics in Germany. In order to support the physician comprehensively with the documentation that is necessary for the trials we currently develop a Documentation System for Pediatric Oncology (DOSPO) that comprises the functionality of chemotherapy planning according to the protocols released by the trial centres. Besides supporting the physician in clinical routine the major objective is to improve the quality of the documented data. To reach this aims DOSPO combines research aspects of decision support and clinical documentation: formal representation of general protocols, calculating of a particular therapy for a patient, data acquisition, communication interfaces for transferring the data to the trial centres. In order to support trial centres an authoring system and a central data dictionary will be developed. This will enable the trial centres to develop new modules for trial-specific data acquisition in the clinics.</jats:p>"

In particular, an attempt is made to unpack critical dimensions of the debate which surrounds the Department of the Environment's Planning Policy Guidance Notes 6 and 13 and the so-called ‘Gummer effect’ which is seen as having actively discouraged green-field out-of-town development and provided a mandate for reinvestment in town centre retail development. By exploring new evidence on the changing economics of superstore development, the impact of tightened land-use planning regulation, and shifting patterns of capital investment, I provide a conceptual framework in which to understand a radically transformed retail development picture. </jats:p>",

To illustrate the general model, we consider two specific applications: a blood bank and a health maintenance organization (HMO). The blood bank capacity planning problem involves determining the number of donor beds required and determining the size of the nursing and support staff necessary. Capacity must be sufficient to handle the expected number of blood donors without causing excessive donor waiting times. Similar staff, equipment, and service level decisions arise in the HMO capacity planning problem. To determine resource requirements, we develop an optimization/queueing network model that minimizes capacity costs while controlling customer service by enforcing a set of performance constraints, such as setting an upper limit on the expected time a patient spends in the system. The queueing network model allows us to capture the stochastic behavior of health care systems and to measure customer service levels within the optimization framework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Los Alamos code <jats:sc>MCNP4A</jats:sc> (M_onte C_arlo N_‐P_article version 4A) is currently used to simulate a variety of problems ranging from nuclear reactor analysis to boron neutron capture therapy. A graphical user interface has been developed that automatically sets up the <jats:sc>MCNP4A</jats:sc> geometry and radiation source requirements for a three‐dimensional Monte Carlo simulation using computed tomography data. The major drawback for this dosimetry system is the amount of time to obtain a statistically significant answer. A specialized patch file has been developed that optimizes photon particle transport and dose scoring within the standard <jats:sc>MCNP4A</jats:sc> lattice geometry. The transport modifications produce a performance increase (number of histories per minute) of approximately 4.7 based upon a 6 MV point source centered within a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8167-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8167:mp8167-math-0001\" /> lattice water phantom and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8167-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8167:mp8167-math-0002\" /> voxels. The dose scoring modifications produce a performance increase of approximately 470 based upon a tally section of greater than <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8167-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8167:mp8167-math-0003\" /> lattice elements and a voxel size of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8167-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8167:mp8167-math-0004\" /> Homogeneous and heterogeneous benchmark calculations produce good agreement with measurements using a standard water phantom and a high‐ and low‐density heterogeneity phantom. The dose distribution from a typical mediastinum treatment planning setup is presented for qualitative analysis and comparison versus a conventional treatment planning system.</jats:p>",

Twenty-nine registered occupational therapists who subscribe to the Mental Health Specialty Interest Section or the Physical Disabilities Specialty Interest Section completed treatment plans based on a single case study. The treatment plans were analyzed based on goal setting and treatment activities. Data indicated therapists frequently identified goals not addressed by the consumer and demonstrated limited consideration of the context in the selection of treatment activities. Therapists identified as many short-term goals not related to the consumer's stated goal as they identified goals that were related to the consumer's goal. T-test comparisons indicated that therapists significantly more often selected simulated over real activities and activities aimed at changing the person over activities aimed at changing the environment. These preliminary results from a small, self-selected sample suggest that current occupational therapy treatment planning is not consistent with consumer-oriented practice models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the Netherlands, public transport planning plays an important role in strategic planning. The Dutch government is pursuing policy changes to ensure sustainable development. The objectives are to raise transit’s share in the modal split and to improve operators’ financial performance. Dordrecht Municipal Authority has taken an integrated approach to public transport planning to complement its urban development strategy. In June 1997 the three-bus system was introduced with the objectives to stimulate ridership and increase revenue: the express bus provides direct, speedy connections with high frequency to serve commuter journeys; the city bus uses liquefied petroleum gas vehicles with 3- to 10-min headways to connect the historical city center with the Central Station; and the service bus improves the connectivity of neighborhoods and enhances accessibility between the suburbs and the city center. The service net is also designed to serve the mobility needs of elderly and handicapped passengers in wheelchairs. The integrated network aims to provide quality service to meet passenger requirements. To finance the new system, an extra fare zone was introduced in January 1998. A research program in three phases has been implemented to monitor and evaluate the effects. </jats:p>",

There we argued that there was still considerable variation in the provision of food retailing floor-space in the United Kingdom, with analyses presented at the regional (county), interurban, and intraurban levels. We concluded that saturation can only ever be a local phenomenon and that there was still considerable potential for retail expansion. However, we also suggested that such expansion was unlikely to occur without a notable degree of change in the complexion of the sector. The aim of this paper is to update that analysis and to present arguments pertaining to food retail change during the middle of this decade—that is, following the property crisis that halted the earlier ‘golden age’ of store expansion—by focusing on recent change in terms of both retail fascia and locality. </jats:p>",

This study examined the perceptions of top-level managers in these three institutions toward the role of external review agents in increasing the awareness of management to their responsibilities in DRP. The findings indicate that the managers surveyed perceive the influence of external DRP review agents to be relatively unimportant. This attitude represents a stark deviation from the recommendations provided in current DRP research literature.</jats:p>"

A literature study and a survey have been executed to assess the effectivity of the process and the contingency factors with regard to developing support in the group of participants for the plans. The process appears to be very effective. It appears to be important to use contingent processes and techniques: situations with a high technical complexity should be dealt with in a different way from situations in which the social complexity is dominant. The dynamics of mental images could be studied with the results of the survey. Recommendations for the approach of participative planning are derived from the analysis of these dynamics. The participants of the planning process appear to have undergone a learning experience that makes them more tolerant with respect to the planning product and more critical with respect to the planning process. </jats:p>",

Especially in information intense environments, short response times for service calls are essential to avoid disruptions to a business office or production facility. Managers must regularly assess their manpower needs, and ensure that their allocation and operational decisions lead to the best service at the lowest cost.</jats:p><jats:p>Xerox Corporation provides copiers, duplicators, and printing systems to an international market. Xerox operates a service network consisting of over 30,000 trained service personnel, each allocated to service regions by the service planning staff. Response‐time planning involves many challenging problems: requirements planning at the national level, allocation planning at the district level, and operational planning at the team level. Customer service is critical and is commonly measured by response time—the time that elapses from when a service call is placed to when a service engineer begins service. This paper discusses how Xerox Corporation has used simulation models and metamodels to improve response‐time planning and field service operations.</jats:p>",

The principal aim is to conceptualise the influence of three key dimensions of business service activity on internationalisation: the external relations and patterns of interfirm networking adopted by business service firms; their close relationships with clients; and the significance of these relationships in home-region markets, affording regional externalities which also strongly influence their propensity to export. Evidence from Scotland and the South East of England shows a regional influence on the mode of foreign-market entry, although few firms explicitly choose particular foreign markets to enter. The most common entry mechanism involves responding to particular orders. Similarly, the entry-mode decisions of 70% of the firms were made without consideration of any alternative modes. The evident importance of interfirm, including client corporate networks, and the influence of regional conditions upon internationalisation, leads to a conclusion in which we draw on a recent socially based interpretation of business behaviour. </jats:p>",

One category of locations confronted with these changes is seaports. Port-related activities are increasingly located in secondary centres at a distance from the port, resulting in the development of a ‘port network’. The rise of port networks is considered a new stage in the development of ports. To cope with the transition towards the new stage, port authorities need to revise their strategy. In this paper, the development of port networks is considered as an example of new spatial patterns and organisational structures in a borderless world. The factors behind the rise of port networks are identified and the contours of a new port strategy outlined. The theoretical model is illustrated by the case of Rotterdam. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Congestion (or variable) pricing can be described as the charging of more for goods or services during periods of peak demand. In theory, this practice would prove beneficial as a travel demand management tool when setting fares on toll roads and bridges. However, in practice, it has proven extremely difficult to implement in the United States. Many of the planning issues and solutions found during the early phases of a variablepricing pilot study currently being conducted in Lee County, Florida, are examined. Also examined is the electronic toll collection system being implemented in conjunction with variable pricing. The planned variablepricing scheme is detailed, along with how this publicly and politically palatable pricing scheme was derived. Data collection efforts, which include origin-destination surveys, focus groups, mail-back surveys, videotaping of traffic, and detailed traffic counts are described to emphasize the substantial effort undertaken to obtain accurate and meaningful variable-pricing traffic behavioral data that can be applied across the country. A summary of work to date and an overview of the next steps toward implementation of the variable-pricing program in Lee County are presented. </jats:p>",

This paper summarizes the findings of a programme of research, commissioned by the former Department of the Environment, which has aimed to assess the degree of hazard associated with this particular form of subsidence and to develop appropriate planning and engineering responses which might be applicable both to Ripon and to other affected areas. The paper draws attention to the sensitive nature of the problem and to the conflict which exists between the benefits of using hazard assessment to minimize the risk to future development within an area, and the possible disbenefits of widely publicizing the existence of a land instability problem.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In Ripon, the potential consequences of gypsum-related subsidence, in terms of building damage and road closures, can be significant. In addition, there may be a small risk of personal injury. It is therefore important that the planning of future development in the area should be guided by the results of the hazard assessment carried out in this study and that such development should be subject to controls and mitigation measures, where appropriate. However, the probability of this form of subsidence occurring at any given site is very low and the risk to individual properties is therefore generally very small, especially from the statistical viewpoint normally adopted by insurers. Taking account of these facts, forward planning and development control procedures have been recommended for use by the local planning authority.</jats:p>",

Traditional approaches are often based on methodology known as preimage planning, which involves worst-case analysis. The authors have developed a gen eral framework for determining feedback strategies by blending ideas from stochastic optimal control and dynamic game theory with traditional preimage planning concepts. This generalizes classical preimages to performance preimages and preimage planning for de signing motion strategies with information feedback. For a given problem, one can define a performance criterion that evaluates any executed trajectory of the robot. The authors present methods for selecting a motion strategy that optimizes this criterion under either nondeterministic uncertainty (resulting in worst-case analysis) or probabilistic uncertainty (resulting in expected-case analysis). The authors present dynamic programming-based algorithms that nu merically compute performance preimages and optimal strategies; several computed examples of forward projections, performance preimages, and optimal strategies are presented. </jats:p>",

In the same group of patients, we evaluated the type of correlation between the neoplastic recurrence rate and Astler-Coller’s classification. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; (1) In detecting hepatic metastases CEA levels furnished sensitivity and negative predictive value more than liver ultrasonography (83.3 vs. 77.8% and 98.4 vs. 98%, respectively); (2) in our series, we obtained a lower recurrence rate in classes A+B1 (7.5%) and B2 (20.8%) and higher in C1+C2 (44.4%) and D (66.7%) (p &lt; 0.01). &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; According to these data we decided to eliminate postoperative liver ultrasonography and customize follow-up protocol on tumor staging and timing of cancer relapse. The authors believe that these changes will not modify the results, but cause less psychophysical stress for the patients and reduce costs by 50%.</jats:p>"

The transportation professional is faced with the challenge of presenting technical analyses in a manner permitting others to make their own, sound, choices. Increasingly, the choice of a preferred alternative involves both technical aspects and seemingly intangibles or quality aspects. Technical analyses often appear to press in one direction, whereas other considerations give a different perspective on the preferred solution. Peer groups as well as administrators of programs are faced with the need to quickly understand complex planning relationships. Presentation of technical information in understandable terms has become increasingly critical to the decision-making process. Professionals develop significant quantitative data to compare and contrast alternatives under investigation, and there is a need to render the results comprehensible for those making recommendations and those making decisions. The application of simple but effective comparison techniques designed to provide high flexibility to individuals in comparing alternatives is addressed. The screening techniques used in recent studies for ISTEA high-priority corridors and feasibility studies are explored and how a matrix analysis technique has applications in many studies is illustrated. </jats:p>",

New approaches to housing, employment, and physical and social infrastructure were needed to meet the demands of the sudden influx of some 700,000 new immigrants. In addition to Soviet immigration, two other important factors influenced planning policy: the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, which changed the geostrategic importance of the peripheral regions of the country, and the development of the Israeli economy into an economy based on high-technology industry and producer services. The globalization of Israel's economy has reduced the capacity of public policy to influence the location of economic activity. The new planning doctrine is highly sensitive to the scarcity of land and is based on a view of the future map of Israel as an agglomeration of four metropolitan regions, strongly interconnected and sharply delineated by the open spaces and green areas between them.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A layered architecture for freight transportation demand modeling entails the construction of a statewide freight transportation demand model by separately simulating traffic for one commodity at a time. Layers can then be added together to construct a comprehensive model that includes the most significant freight flows. Most state or regional economies are dominated by a few economic sectors, and models can be constructed for those sectors that generate the most freight traffic and/or are the most important to the regional economy. Freight traffic demand modeling in intercity applications is more likely to focus on economic development, local infrastructure improvements, maintenance, and similar policy and planning concerns than on system capacity issues. Thus, it is more important to understand changes in traffic growth by economic sector than as the composite of all freight traffic. This method is less data intensive and more easily understood by transportation professionals than previous approaches. The layered approach is therefore more likely to achieve the desired objectives than would general models, which attempt to forecast heterogeneous freight transportation demands simultaneously. This approach is demonstrated through a case study using the meat products and farm machinery industries in Iowa. Other commodities will be added in the future to complete a model of Iowa’s statewide freight transportation demand. A framework is presented for organizing and identifying planning goals, key issues, and predominant commodities for intercity freight transportation. Although examples are provided, specific recommendations addressing the full range of issues, data collection activities, tools, and urban applications are suggested for further study. A case study demonstrates the approach used for one issue, one mode, and two commodities, which could be repeated elsewhere for similar applications. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS), as a metropolitan planning organization, developed an approach to integrate intermodal freight transportation into regional plans and programs. This process began with the establishment of the Intermodal Advisory Task Force (IATF) in 1994 and led to a series of freight-oriented activities and products, including the identification of regionally significant facilities, analysis of improvement needs, and the intermodal component of the 2020 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for northeastern Illinois. Task Force membership includes public- and private-sector representatives working cooperatively to develop and direct a work plan to address goods movement and inter-modal freight issues and needs. The intermodal planning process involved significant preparatory work. The IATF established four working groups that directed specific tasks, including development of a geographic information system–based intermodal facilities inventory, an outreach for industry needs, a review of proposed intermodal improvements, identification and analysis of intermodal connections to the national highway system, and analysis to estimate the economic value of the industry to the region. Ultimately, six policy statements were developed and incorporated as system-level intermodal recommendations in the RTP. The process developed by CATS through the IATF has “mainstreamed” intermodal freight issues, analysis, and policies into the transportation plans and programs of northeastern Illinois. Although the scale of the intermodal and freight industry in Chicago is enormous, the lessons learned and the technical and institutional approaches developed through the IATF offer valuable insight and direction to other regions seeking to support their intermodal freight industry through the transportation planning process. </jats:p>",

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the issues and concerns facing MPOs in Florida, each of the state’s 25 MPO long-range transportation plans was reviewed, and telephone interviews were conducted with each of the MPO executive directors or designated staff members. Following the telephone interviews, the plans were reexamined to determine the extent to which the issues or problems stated in the interviews were described in the plans. CUTR identified the concerns common to the majority of metropolitan regions, including funding shortfalls, determination of innovative financing strategies, involvement of the public, maintenance of a mobility/livability balance, and air quality conformance. Many of the metropolitan regions also identified the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act’s planning factors, the consideration of alternative land use scenarios, differences in project selection criteria, and intergovernmental coordination as other areas of importance during plan development. The study offered suggestions to improve integration of the various MPO plans with the FTP, and to suggest improvements to the MPO long-range plans. Items for future consideration include placing greater emphasis on policy trade-offs and less reliance on transportation planning models; applying the principles of strategic planning to the transportation planning process; and incorporating a strong visioning process. Additional recommendations include incorporating current issues and problems into the long-range plans; streamlining the reporting of performance measures; standardizing when plans are updated, as well as how costs and revenues are reported; and reporting financial information by responsible agency and facility type. </jats:p>",

Agencies around the country are beginning to use census data that have been adjusted based on newly released Federal Highway Administration publications. The recently completed Transportation Planner’s Handbook on Conversion Factors for the Use of Census Data has been published to assist planners in using the 1990 census to develop and calibrate local travel demand models. Collecting new data to complete the development of a local model is not always an option. The 1990 census provides another source of information to assist in traffic model estimation. Potential users of the census need to be aware that there would appear to be a variance between results obtained from the census journey-to-work files and locally developed home interview surveys, even after the use of the census adjustment factors. The project in Atlanta, Georgia, involved detailed traffic model development and calibration, in conjunction with factor-adjusted census data. Because of the intimate understanding of the data for the study area, and the development of the model set from the beginning, differences between the locally collected data and census were explainable. Possible problems that can arise when comparing the data as they relate to geography, data definition, and accuracy of the data collection process are detailed. </jats:p>",

A framework for the application of PTMS elements in the public transit capital improvement planning process is proposed. By using a PTMS as a part of the capital planning process, broad concepts such as needs fulfillment and performance improvement may be embodied in a systematic process to program transit bus capital investments. With data from the Federal Transit Administration’s National Transit Database (NTD), the practical applicability of this framework is investigated in the context of the capital planning process employed by the regional transit authorities and the state transportation agency in Massachusetts. Vehicle replacement needs for a Massachusetts regional transit authority are estimated for a 5-year planning window using the NTD data in conjunction with predictive condition models. These models, developed by Purdue University and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, use easily quantifiable and objective measures such as age and mileage to predict the future condition of a vehicle. NTD data are also used to identify opportunities for performance-based capital incentives among the Massachusetts regional transit authorities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present an empirical evaluation of assumptions about consumer purchasing behavior for gasoline. Previous research has developed a theoretical model of spatial pricing in oligopolistically competitive markets in which it is hypothesized that retail prices vary because of both consumer price sensitivity and the choice sets available to consumers as well as awareness of prices at competing locations. With the use of household survey data collected from St Cloud, Minnesota we evaluate the plausibility of these assumptions, finding evidence to support the consumer purchasing behavior assumed in the theoretical model. By means of a spatial time series of gasoline price data for the same metropolitan area, we develop an empirical model of spatial price variation that incorporates some of the hypotheses of the original model. The results suggest support for the proposition that spatial price variations depend on the service characteristics of individual retailers and the accessibility or locational advantage of individual gasoline stations within the spatial configuration of the urban market. There also is empirical support for the conjecture that those sites which are more accessible, have larger choice sets, and charge lower prices tend to be those which attract the most sales from other retailers. </jats:p>",

Further, thousands of firms in the Baltimore region are engaged in the handling and transporting of freight. A heightened awareness of the region’s freight movement needs and issues, combined with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act’s emphasis on intermodal transportation planning, resulted in the Baltimore metropolitan planning organization’s (MPO’s) designation of a public-private Freight Movement Task Force to work with MPO staff to provide guidance and advice on freight-related transportation issues and needs. As the Baltimore MPO pursued its aggressive freight movement planning agenda, it was recognized that addressing freight needs and issues would require MPO members and staff to assume roles and pursue transportation planning activities in markedly different ways than they had been pursued traditionally. An examination of the MPO’s efforts to incorporate freight movement issues into the regional transportation planning agenda is provided, with a discussion of the MPO’s progress to date, how various challenges were addressed and overcome, freight planning products developed, and lessons learned from this undertaking that may be instructive to other transportation planning agencies as they venture into the freight planning arena. </jats:p>",

Different from past solution methodologies focusing on conventional uncoordinated transit systems, this model addresses the design of transit networks with coordinated operations, using a transit center concept and incorporating a trip assignment model explicitly developed for coordinated (timed-transfer) systems. In addition, this model determines the appropriate vehicle size for each bus route and incorporates demand-responsive capabilities to meet demand that cannot be served effectely by fixed-route, fixed-schedule services. This model is composed of four major procedures: ( a) a route generation procedure (RGP), which constructs the transit network around the transit center concept; ( b) a network analysis procedure, which incorporates a trip assignment model (for both coordinated and uncoordinated operations) and a frequency-setting and vehicle-sizing procedure; ( c) a transit center selection procedure, which identifies the suitable transit centers for route coordination; and ( d) a network improvement procedure, which improves on the set of routes generated by the RGP. The model is demonstrated via a case-study application to data generated from the existing transit system in Austin, Texas. </jats:p>",

A time-series interview survey for the period 1989 to 1995 is used to review the Oslo toll ring scheme and determine and explain the public’s attitudes toward the scheme. A multivariate model is developed to isolate factors that affect users’ attitudes toward tolls. The results reveal that, although a majority of commuters oppose the toll system, the gap between those who are against and those who are in favor of the toll ring system is narrowing as the years go by. This narrowing process is analyzed. It is concluded that to achieve greater acceptability for tolling in road infrastructure funding, a more comprehensive range of targeted marketing efforts is required. Finally, a set of points of direct relevance for planning and marketing of future toll projects is proposed. </jats:p>",

The field is segmented into fault-bounded compartments, which exhibit differences in gas-water contacts of between 10 and 100m. Microstructural analysis of core samples has identified three principal fault types; cataclasites, developed from clean sandstones, framework phyllosilicate fault rocks created from impure sandstones and clay smears developed from phyllosilicate-rich units. The distribution of these has been linked to the phyllosilicate content of the undeformed Hugin reservoir at the time of deformation. Petrophysical property analysis has been used to quantify the representative permeabilities and threshold capillary pressures of the fault rocks and their undeformed equivalents. Juxtaposition/seal diagrams and detailed fault plane maps were also constructed and provide a basis for mapping sand-sand juxtapositions and the distributions of the different fault rock types with assigned permeabilities and capillary threshold pressures. The results provide an explanation of the mapped variations in gas-water contacts. An important correlation exists between the type of fault rock predicted to dominate the fault plane near the hydrocarbon-water interface and the difference in hydrocarbon depths across the faults. Compartments separated by faults with windows of juxtaposed clean sandstone cataclasites have small hydrocarbon-water level differences (7–11 m), suggesting that the low capillary threshold pressure (more permeable) cataclastic fault rocks control communication. Compartments separated by faults predicted to have extensive phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks (developed from impure sandstones and clay rich units) with high capillary threshold pressures correlate to larger hydrocarbon-water differences (&gt;39 m), reflecting the reduced communication.</jats:p>",

However, an adequate on‐line control of this coagulation technique requires an exact therapy planning. The latter is mandatory to interpret the MR‐monitoring data correctly to guarantee a precise laser irradiation. Moreover, it is a prerequisite for online decisions if modifications of the therapeutic regimen are required. In this work, we present a new simulation technique for LITT planning. The model accounts for the specific geometry of the treatment site, the exact configuration of the applicator, and the optical and thermal properties of the tissue, including changes during the heating process. The simulation results were compared with MR scans of laser‐induced lesions in three patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II astrocytoma. Special interest was directed toward the role of blood perfusion, which was studied parametrically. Good agreement between the simulation results and the MR data was found if the appropriate blood perfusion rates were taken into account. Thus, the model can generate valid therapy plans allowing a precise on‐line control of laser irradiation using MR techniques. Neglecting adequate perfusion parameters resulted in substantial errors with respect to the prediction of the final laser lesion.</jats:p>",

Incidents account for 60 percent of congestion-induced delay. As a low-cost approach to incident management, freeway service patrol programs have gained wide popularity. However, information on freeway incident characteristics is limited. In the current paper, incident data recorded by the Hoosier Helper program in north-west Indiana is analyzed. The distributions of incident frequency and clearance time by incident type and lateral location are reported. The variation of incident rate with time of the day is examined, and the influence of various factors affecting the frequency and clearance time of incidents is explored. Recommendations are made to improve the freeway service patrol program, based on the incident data analyzed. The information provided in this study may be useful for planning similar patrol programs in other metropolitan areas in Indiana and other states. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent technological advances in computer hardware, software, and image processing have led to the development of an automated license plate reader (ALPR). This equipment was developed primarily for enforcement and security applications, such as monitoring parking garages or border crossings. Because license plate data are used in several transportation planning studies, ALPRs have the potential to increase the quality and efficiency of many typical activities of transportation planning agencies. The key performance attributes of an ALPR with respect to the specific needs of transportation planning are determined. The following general needs are investigated: ( a) the specific license plate data requirements of transportation planning studies; ( b) the effect of the equipment on traffic operations and safety; and ( c) special equipment characteristics required because of the temporary nature of transportation planning and the constraints of transportation planning agencies. In addition, an existing ALPR was tested in situations likely to be encountered in transportation planning applications. Technical specifications for an ALPR for transportation planning are developed. These specifications can be used to provide motivation and direction for the future development of an ALPR for transportation planning. Finally, the technical challenges to developing the ALPR are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent welfare reform act requires most current welfare recipients to be employed within 5 years. For any program to find jobs for those previously on welfare, transportation services need to be in place before the job search process begins. Therefore, it is essential that the latent demand for commuting among welfare recipients be assessed when any public transportation service is developed. Such a planning effort is described by ( a) providing an overview of the relevant issues relating to welfare to work, ( b) proposing a regionwide planning process, and ( c) demonstrating the process by implementing the first three steps, which rely on creative data preparation and analysis. Because the most recent data sets are not currently available, the implementation phase is considered to be preliminary, but it is crucial in testing the proposed regionwide planning procedure. A full-scale study is currently under way. </jats:p>",
