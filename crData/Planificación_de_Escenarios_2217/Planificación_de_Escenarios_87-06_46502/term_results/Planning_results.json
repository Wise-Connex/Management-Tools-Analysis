With the life span's increasing length and standardization, these became obsolete and were abandoned. Today, almost all of us have the chance of living life to its maturity. In order to make full use of it, however, we must plan full-size life careers from a very early stage. Otherwise the years gained will largely be wasted.\nThe article starts by summarizing demographic development over the last three\ncenturies. These \"hard facts\" are then correlated with evidence from other\nsources, for example from fairy tales and sayings. Finally, recent developments in\nJapan, the country with the highest life expectancy in the world today, are discussed.</jats:p>"

In the 1970s A &amp; P, the largest chain at that time, was well on the way to oblivion until rescued in a foreign takeover by the West German firm of Tengleman. Safeway, the 1986 market share leader nationally, chose a leveraged buyout rather than a takeover and currently has many divisions in the U.S. up for sale. Within a year or two, Safeway will be a pale shadow of its former self, because it failed to adapt to intense competition. Kroger, the current industry leader, has already begun closing stores in many major markets. In the meantime, the strong regionals such as Food Lion, Shaw's, Hannaford Bros., Randall's, Smith's, Bruno's, Weiss, Albertsons, Publix, Giant Food, Pueblo International, H. E. Butt, and Hughes, are challenging the largest national chains for market share in carefully chosen fields of battle. Overall, the supermarket industry experienced an after tax return on net worth of 14 percent in 1986.</jats:p>",

Since there are many such fragmented manufacturing and service industries in the U.

We'll illustrate how it's done, using a case history describing the cooperative effort of the New York Market Radio Broadcasters Association (NYMRAD) — the trade association of the New York Metropolitan Area radio stations. Its members worked together to increase the total market through development of unexploited niche groups of advertisers. In less than two years, this plan has added significantly to total New York radio station advertising revenues.</jats:p>",

The submission was made in support of an objection by the Lower Hutt City Council to a proposed ordinance which prohibited building adjacent to the section of the Wellington fault in Lower Hutt City. The inadequacies of the proposed ordinance are examined and the issues analysed with particular reference to the protection of life and property, and the risks involved. Earthquake risks are further analysed and the risk of damage due to shaking compared with those due to fault movement. Comparisons of earthquake risk with other risks accepted by the community are made. The conclusion drawn is that the additional risk of earthquake damage in a potential fault zone is sufficient to warrant constraints to development, but not so large, in the context of overall risks, to justify prohibition of all development in a fault zone. Comment and recommendation is made as to appropriate constraints to building development in such zones.</jats:p>"

In this paper, an operational model for measuring planning system success is developed in terms of two interrelated dimensions—improvements in the capabilities of the planning system and extent of fulfillment of key planning objectives. Multiple items reflecting these dimensions are proposed. Construct validity of the two dimensions are evaluated by applying Jöreskog's analysis of covariance structures approach on data on the planning practices of 202 strategic planning units. Validated measurement schemes for the two model dimensions are offered for use in future research efforts on strategic planning effectiveness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains an examination of the fundamental assumption underlying the use of accessibility indicators: that an individual's travel behavior is related to his or her location vis-à-vis the distribution of potential activity sites. First, the conceptual and measurement issues surrounding accessibility and its relationship to travel are reviewed; then, an access measure for individuals is formulated. Using data from the Uppsala (Sweden) Household Travel Survey and controlling for sex, automobile availability, and employment status, the authors explore the relationship between both home- and work-based accessibility and five aspects of an individual's travel: mode use, trip frequencies and travel distances for discretionary purposes, trip complexity, travel in conjunction with the journey to work, and size of the activity space. From the results it can be seen that although all of these travel characteristics are related to accessibility to some degree, the travel–accessibility relationship is not as strong as deductive formulations have implied. High accessibility levels are associated with higher proportions of travel by nonmotorized means, lower levels of automobile use, reduced travel distances for certain discretionary trip purposes, and smaller individual activity spaces. Furthermore, the density of activity sites around the workplace affects the distances travelled by employed people for discretionary purposes. Overall, accessibility level has a greater impact on mode use and travel distance than it does on discretionary trip frequency. This result was unexpected in light of the strong trip frequency–accessibility relationship posited frequently in the literature. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1950s and 1960s, it seemed that our understanding of regional growth processes had progressed far enough for confident policy prescriptions to be advanced. From the vantage point of the 1980s, that assurance seems to have been misplaced. The paper contains a review of the debate on regional growth processes and the policy implications, in the context first of Britain and then more generally. It is shown that there has been a strong move away from the advocacy of traditional redistributive, and essentially zero-sum, policies to the view that intraregional policies to foster the supply potential are more appropriate. This shift in emphasis is partly attributable directly to the current high rates of unemployment. Probably more important has been the associated emergence of the monetarist/supply-side challenge to Keynesian demand-management orthodoxy. This macroeconomic debate is briefly reviewed and the implications for regional policy indicated. In the concluding section, an outline is provided of the supply-side approach to regional development that seems relevant for the foreseeable future, not as a replacement for traditional redistributive policies but as a necessary, and hitherto somewhat neglected, complement. </jats:p>",

In the analytical framework used, fiscal disability is measured vis-à-vis the most advantaged authority. The extent of the horizontal equalisation which occurs is shown to depend on whether this most advantaged authority receives a positive, zero, or negative per capita grant. It is concluded that in the United Kingdom, under the post 1981 unitary block-grant system, a deficiency principle or sequential approach to equalisation has been continued. In Australia, if the recommendations of the 1985 national inquiry are implemented by the local government grants commissions, the equalisation methodology employed by them will imitate the UK approach. It will thus ensure that maximum support is provided to the most disadvantaged authorities, given the constraints imposed on total funds available for equalisation. </jats:p>",

It has been proposed, in particular, that gentrification is caused by the rise of a ‘new middle class’, and this argument is evaluated in theoretical and empirical terms. There is, in fact, better evidence for the significance of women in the gentrification process, because of changing work patterns, changing patterns of reproduction, and the changing relationship between work and reproduction. In light of these arguments, issue is taken with the claim that gentrification is a ‘chaotic conception’ and it is suggested how, instead, the social restructuring that is currently being observed is closely related to an economic restructuring, and that both together involve a dramatic spatial restructuring of which ‘gentrification’ is one part. The new urban patterns now unfolding do involve the construction of ‘consumption landscapes’ in the city, and the emergence of an incipient ‘urban dream’ parallel to the suburban dream of the last decade, but this docs not imply that urban geographical change is now somehow demand led. </jats:p>",

Since coming to power in 1983, the Federal Government has introduced an incomes policy as well as a number of industry plans. However, it has rejected national allocative planning. In this article we discuss the differences between these forms of economic planning and analyse the reasons which might explain the Government's rejection of national allocative planning.</jats:p>",

A succession of five different systems of spatial order are examined, each replete with its own processes and forms of integration. It is further argued that exploring how one system gave way to another provides us with a geographical contribution to the wider debate on societal evolution, one in which the spatial structuring of the processes involved appears crucial to their operation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is often stated that the single most important influence on the quality of forecasts of behaviour is the set of predetermined exogenous variables (typically sociodemographic) that categorise the population. These variables are used to carry the sampled population into the future as a representation of the composition of future populations. Such variables or segmentation criteria are typically dictated by the limited set of descriptors projected by specialised forecasting agencies. Although the wisdom of their efforts is respected, from time to time it seems worthwhile to reappraise the set of exogenous variables which are subject to intense forecasting to see if there may be a case for considering additional variables (and even ‘resting’ the current set). It is argued that a desired segmentation set should be linked to preference stability, and that a suitable procedure for establishing such a link is via preference data derived from a controlled experimental design. From the empirical study it is illustrated how preference data can be combined with socioeconomic data to seek out the role of the ‘current’ set and the ‘new’ set of socioeconomic variables in a particular forecasting context. Since the selection of variables must be application specific, the main emphasis of this paper is on the methodology. The reported empirical findings are of illustrative use only. </jats:p>",

In 1984, Britain and The People's Republic of China (PRC) began negotiations which will determine the future of Hong Kong after 1997. The ensuing dialogue brings together the competing interests of two different cultures and modes of production. It also creates a theatre where the conceptual frameworks of radically different social histories coalesce as opposing ideological positions. These can only be resolved through the mediating principle of language. Within this context, two other agencies struggle for survival in their own terms. At the grass roots level, the identity and freedom of the Hong Kong people is at stake. In the stratosphere of global politics, the oblique yet strategic penetration of multinational corporate policy into the local marketplace demands both opportunity and protection. The problem is therefore presented as a confusion over incompatible realms of discourse, which both parties to the joint agreement are attempting to condense into one agenda. This materialises in the form of ‘the Basic Law’ as a monitoring system through which social and cultural assumptions and practices become codified. Implications for the urban process and the built environment, although seemingly unanticipated, are likely to have profound and enduring consequences. </jats:p>",

The paper has both substantive and technical foci. The substantive focus is to extend the authors' research on the links between housing and mobility and to provide detailed information on the way in which dwelling choices are made after the decision to relocate. The technical focus is to continue the authors' concern with building robust models of urban processes. The technical concerns are focused on special forms of automatic interaction detection and dummy variable multiple regression to estimate the influence of household characteristics and previous housing situation on dwelling choice. The data used in the analysis are part of a large sample taken in 1981 of all Dutch households. The automatic interaction detection method is used as a form of exploratory data analysis to identify the underlying ‘structure’ in the data. The results are used as input to the dummy regression process, which, in combination with the proportional reduction in uncertainty measures, establishes the importance of income and the role of regional variations, age, and type of house as major predictors of tenure choice. A main conclusion from the research is that, even though income is the most important predictor, age, size of family, type of house, and price also affect tenure choice. Even more important is the conclusion that it is essential to do separate analyses for separate tenures. </jats:p>",

Attention is focused on the 1981 labour-force share of information occupations at the level of standard regions. This occupation approach, as developed by Porat, is interrelated with Singlemann's sectoral classification in order to provide a new view of the information-based service economy in a regional context. </jats:p><jats:p> The spatial division of information labour in Great Britain is identified and its theoretical and policy implications are discussed. It is shown that, despite regional differences in industrial specialisation, job prospects in all parts of the country are increasingly dependent on information-based services. There is, however, clear evidence of Greater London's dominance of the information economy, particularly in higher-order information occupations related to management and control functions and specialised producer-services activities. It is suggested that innovations in information technology (computer-communications networks) will reinforce this uneven geography of employment opportunities, particularly with the further integration of Britain into the global information economy. In this light, theoretical approaches to regional economic policy must embody an international dimension and address the transsectoral nature of information-based development in which the new technologies play a central role. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper an argument is put for a reconceptualization of the theory of US industrial unionism. It reflects lessons learnt about the patterns and determinants of the electoral performance of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union and the United Auto Workers union over the period 1970–82. Empirically, the spatial and temporal diversity of unions' electoral performance is emphasized. Theoretically, it is suggested that unions' performances in representation elections are the product of a complex array of processes and their interrelationships. Diversity of patterns and complexity of processes makes forecasting the future of industrial unionism a risky project. Also considered are competing theories of unionism and the methodologies for analyzing union electoral performance. Based on these observations, a case is made for the necessity of a ‘new’ framework for understanding the geography of US unionism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1984 the Hawke Government appointed a National Inquiry to review the federal revenue-sharing grants for local government introduced eight years previously, and to propose desirable aims and a basis for future federal support. Australian local government is on a small scale and closely under the control of state governments; federal support raises complex issues of intergovernmental relations. In this paper, the wide-ranging Report of Inquiry, and its political outcome, are related to basic issues about federal-state relations and the rationale and extent of federal interventions. In particular, the Australian experience is interesting for its attempts at combining vertical redistribution of revenue with ambitious and detailed equalisation policies, financed at federal level but administered by independent state agencies. </jats:p>",

However, our knowledge of the scale and nature of the problem remains limited, particularly as regards the private sector. There is a dearth of reliable information on privately owned vacant property, which undermines local policy responses. One source of information which is available to local authorities are local rating records, which are often used as the basis for calculating a void rate. However, in this paper it is shown, by reference to recent work in one inner London borough, that such records are likely to provide a serious underestimate of the problem. In their present form, rating records, though potentially valuable, are a far from adequate data source for identifying and monitoring vacant private-sector dwellings. </jats:p>",

This article contains reviews of the experience of nine nations, between 1976 and 1982, in terms of the impact of slow economic growth on local expenditures, particularly in terms of changes in intergovernmental grants, and this is followed by an examination of the kinds of revenue and expenditure adjustments which local authorities have made in the light of these changes. </jats:p><jats:p> Generally speaking, the results reveal that although national government expenditure patterns vary during the latter part of the review period, in all cases grants were singled out as a target for expenditure reductions, and that there were few distinctions between federal and unitary systems. In most countries, local authorities responded by increasing local tax receipts, and most did not suffer any decline in total revenues in real terms, though revenues increased less rapidly during the latter part of the review period when economic growth was generally slower. Revenues were maintained largely by increases in nontax revenues and then by increases in taxes. However, the most intriguing finding is the variability in the behaviour of local fiscal systems in the nine countries studied. The paper is concluded with some tentative suggestions of explanations for this variability. </jats:p>",
