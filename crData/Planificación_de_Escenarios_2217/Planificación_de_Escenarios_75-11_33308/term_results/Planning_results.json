Prediction of environmental noise levels is an essential tool in assessing the impact of a proposed development on a community. Moreover, sound-level prediction can also aid the plant designer in identifying and abating environmentally significant noise sources. In view of recent sound level criteria proposed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, which are based on land use types, increased emphasis will be given to control of noise in new industries. The prediction of industrial sound levels and the implications to land use planning are discussed through two case studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Land-use planning is often used as a technique for achieving a suitable auditory living environment. Land use alone, however, cannot be the sole noise abatement measure; noise control at the source combined with compatible land-use planning can be most effective. Noise abatement strategies for planning in the environs of airports include operational changes, schedule restrictions, aircraft type restrictions, technological change, airport system change, traffic demand change, encouraging compatible land use, public use, relocation of incompatible use, sensitivity changes, airport environs planning, compensation legal action, regulation and administrative mechanisms, economic incentives, and information. Relative effectiveness and time effectiveness horizons of each are discussed. Alternate means of reducing conflicts between noise sources and surrounding activities are outlined. Implementation of noise abatement strategies and obstacles to implementation are addressed. Ten U.S. airports were studied, including several involved in the Metropolitan Aircraft Noise Abatement Policy Studies (MANAPS) jointly funded by the Department of Transportation and Department of Housing and Urban Development, in order to determine which noise abatement policies and strategies could be most productive.</jats:p>",

Management Sci. 9 (2) 310–322.] and others have proposed that regression models derived from a manager's past behavior can serve as a basis for future managerial decisions. This paper is concerned with a comparison of this approach to more traditional modes of decision making (intuition and mathematical optimization models) in an aggregate production scheduling context under various forecast error and forecast horizon environments. The regression models developed were also used to test Bowman's “Management Coefficients” theory at the axiomatic level, as well as to examine intuitive decision processes. To do this required verification that the regression models accurately specified an individual's decision process. A verification procedure, based on the concept of predictive testing, was used conjointly with statistical goodness of fit and cross validation to validate the regression models. The experimental results (1) supported Bowman's hypotheses, and (2) indicated the effects of forecast error and horizon length on the performance of the three decision making modes and on the formation of intuitive scheduling strategies. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. </jats:p>",

This and subsequently enacted federal, state, and municipal legislation has a profound impact on the land use planning process. Central to the theme of such environmental legislation is a concern for the preservation of land uses compatible with health and welfare objectives and the general quality of life. The acoustical quality of the human environment is becoming of paramount concern in the planing process. This paper outlines the established administrative and legal requirements pertaining to environmental impact, the application to land use planning, and the consideration of environmental noise. It is recommended that the assessment of environmental noise continue to be an integral element in identifying and solving land use planning problems. Examples of effective programs will be described.</jats:p>",

Two approaches are developed here for dynamic capacity planning problems with many locations. The first is an approximate approach based on an equivalent annual cost measure, and the second is a procedure for systematic improvement of the approximate solution. The method for improvement is called “incomplete dynamic programming” since it consists of an approximation to the first cycle of the dynamic programming policy iteration approach. Computational results are reported for tests of the methods against dynamic programming solutions for small problems. Applications are made to two versions of a large-scale problem of planning capacity expansion for India's nitrogenous fertilizer industry, and results are compared with those for other approaches. </jats:p>",

The guidelines created by this office utilize the general plane noise element as the central framework for development of a total noise control program at the local level which includes adoption of a community noise ordinance and enforcement of minimum noise insulation standards for residential dwellings in the vicinity of major noise sources. The overall purpose of the noise element is to cause environmental noise to become a mandatory consideration in the land-use planning process and to recognize severely noise-impacted areas within a city and develop a plan for mitigation of excessive exposure. A parallel objective to correction of situations of excessive exposure is that of protecting those areas whose present noise environment is deemed acceptable. The guidelines include advice on suitable standards for compatible land use (based upon exposure presented in terms of Day-Night Average Level Contours) and recommended procedures for community noise monitoring programs.</jats:p>",

Noise from both stationary and mobile sources was measured for a variety of land use categories. A digital data sampling technique was used to approximate CNEL values from measurements made during the three time periods: 0700–1900, 1900–2200, and 2200–2400 for each site monitored.
