Consequently, the problems that managers and planners must solve are increasingly complex. They are, in addition, ill‐structured and have many highly interrelated dimensions, each of which expresses a wide range of differing values, beliefs and knowledge. Compared with well structured problems—proving geometric theorems or solving Sunday supplement puzzles are examples—ill‐structured problems have no sure fire solutions. One can't tell whether the planning methods used and the solutions obtained fit the problem best or not.</jats:p>",

Because these planning programs are embedded in past social policy developments and institution-building, it is necessary to first compare the two countries' compulsory health insurance schemes. This is followed by a general profile of each health care system. A third section examines the formulation and implementation of the countries' hospital planning programs and participation patterns. Based on this comparison, inferences are drawn that are relevant to policy and research.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The analysis yields three major conclusions. First, despite abundant legal and administrative controls at the disposal of central health bureaucracies, the capability of the national leadership to influence the hospital system through innovative planning is limited by jurisdictional, institutional, functional and territorial fragmentation, and differentiation of control and public responsibility in health. However, the diverse goal orientations of participants may provide the necessary tension to allow for some change in otherwise highly structured political and administrative systems. Second, despite differences in historical, political and administrative developments, the decision making systems for health care policies in France and the Federal Republic, with the exception of health insurance, are strikingly similar to the fragmented decision making system in the United States. Third, the effect of government-mandated participation is empirically uncertain. Opening up the circle of participants seems to have reinforced alliances between public bureaucracies and corporate vested interests. Hospital planning continues to be carried out for rather than with the consumer and citizen. Hospital planning which is a mixture of goal and process-oriented planning does not change the basic orientation of health care systems, which are disease-oriented, and hospital- centered.</jats:p>",

The data suggest that a substantial majority of the councillors regard planning as an important policy-making activity. It is argued that in spite of the lack of success of local planning in terms of approved plans, it has been successful in encouraging local political debate and thereby contributed to the general decision-making process. </jats:p>",

Three is less than 4–519, the amount expected in a random assignment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The article reviews and assesses criticisms of the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, particularly after its 1968 reformed version. Focusing on the shift in planning values, it examines such factors as the unforeseen postwar changes in economic and environmental expectations in both the private and public sectors, and changes in local government structure and administration brought about by the 1972 Local Government Act. It con cludes that the problems which became evident after the 1968 reforms in the planning system—\"internal difficulties, local government changes, economic downturn\"— con tinue to affect planning values and provoke dissatisfaction with the planning process. The article looks ahead to the 1980s and concludes that planning will be characterized by professionalism; planners will implement policy, will act as facilitators, and will con centrate on regeneration rather than manage growth. </jats:p>",

It was deliberately written before most of the statistical results of various surveys were available in order to crystallise the less quantifiable impressions and features of the Aboriginal position in the town around a conceptual framework of societal relations. The few studies of urban Aborigines to date have been more descriptive than analytical. To this end, and based upon my own previous field experiences, I have borrowed from contemporary Third World studies the notions of marginality and marginalisation, and assessed the situation in Alice Springs in these terms. The reasons for this particular choice of concepts was partly because of the location of Alice Springs in ‘colonial’ Australia but primarily because of the etymological and philosophical links with the prevailing opinion of most Aborigines in Alice Springs as fringe dwellers—people on the margins of the town and its society. There have been few attempts to examine the position of Aborigines in contemporary Australia in conceptual terms and this effort will undoubtedly have many shortcomings. However, its purpose is not to be definitive but rather to stimulate further investigation and discussion. </jats:p>",

The model is adapted from a Danish slaughterhouse. Many organizations use budgets and/or transfer prices to set coordinated plans. But optimization as defined mathematically is not a major concern. Organizations do consider a few alternative plans in an iterative process. We investigate the efficiency of the decomposition models as organizational analogues during the first five iterations to simulate organizational planning cycles. A changing environment for prices and availabilities is generated experimentally by perturbing these environmental parameters. A random number generator is used to yield the statistical sample. The experimental results are compared in terms of relative profitability for the organization. A nonparametric statistical test is used to analyze the experimental data. </jats:p><jats:p> The results, are, in part, surprising. For a changing environment, historical information, (i.e., a past solution) is generally inferior to a combination of less precise information on current transfer prices, reasonable rules of thumb, and capacity constraints. However, more current information on prices and budgets yields better plans. Further, we found the transfer price approach yields more nearly optimal plans in the first few iterations than a combination of prices and budgets which in turn, is more efficient than budgets only. </jats:p>",

Recent work by Steinnes (1977), who used a regression analysis of a sample of Chicago census tracts, supports the tipping-point concept. The present replication with Cleveland, Ohio, data differs from the earlier work in three ways: (1) control for sectoral growth patterns; (2) use of the entire population of Cleveland's tracts, rather than a sample of tracts, to determine whether the model is generalizable to the entire city; and (3) an expansion of the time frame of the study. The tipping-point model does not appear to be generalizable to the entire city of Cleveland.

The Salinas‐Monterey (California) Urban Study sought to identify and determine cost of combinations of water source, transmission, and treatment to meet an array of water needs in future years. The Nashville (Tennessee) Urban Study had similar objectives but the output was prepared on a service area basis for more than 40 such units. Using MAPS it was possible to prepare planning level design and cost estimates for a very large number of alternatives.</jats:p>",
