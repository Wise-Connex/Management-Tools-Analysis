At the same time, community organizations depend on participation for the legitimacy, effort, and money needed to govern and carry out work. Organizations encounter predicaments when they cannot find one group that provides all three. They must choose among imperfect and conflicting participation arrangements, with risks of acting ineffectively or not at all. The article analyzes participation predicaments in planning in a working-class white ethnic community organization and an upper- middle-class Jewish community federation. The latter can raise more money from community members, but both face similar problems in organizing the participation needed to act. </jats:p>",

To determine whether such neglect has had serious consequences, we present a case analysis of pedestrian-auto crashes in Orange County, Florida. Orange County's major city, Orlando, is typical of post-World War II development throughout the United States, and findings from that area may be taken as representative. Drawing on law enforcement information on pedestrian- motor vehicle collisions, the case analysis relates the geographic distribution of pedestrian/auto crashes to different types of streetscapes and the alcohol impairment status of pedestrians. The analysis implicates those segments of arterial roadways that are lined with strip commercial activities as an important factor in pedestrian injuries and deaths. The problems are worsened where strip commercial activities include establish ments selling or serving alcohol. We conclude by calling for a reevaluation of planning practice that designates urban arterials as traffic-moving facilities and nothing else. </jats:p>",

An investigation of why male and female respondents in a survey conducted in Bangladesh often gave conflicting answers about which methods they were currently using, particularly about “traditional” methods and condoms, showed that inconsistency in their reports arose because these methods are used in combination to such an extent that they are difficult to distinguish. In order to obtain reliable responses about these methods, a survey approach different from the long‐established one is required.</jats:p>",

A desire to create more certain conditions for developers, the public, and investors through greater use of plans has both decreased discretionary decision making and shifted it from some parts of the spatial planning process to others. Since certainty has formed the underlying tenet to statutory changes to the planning system after 1990 and has found policy expression through national planning guidance, British planning could now be at the juncture of an unhappy ideological conflict between the discretionary nature of British planning and the more certain, less pragmatic forms of spatial planning. In this paper, I suggest that the changing political context of planning in the 1980s and 1990s has led to an ideological conflict in the operation of spatial planning, which involves issues related to administrative law, professionalism, and flexibility and certainty. </jats:p>",

This article reports the results of a survey of senior planning professionals regarding the skills and competencies they seek in entry-level planners. The results provide strong support for communicative planning theories and suggest a recasting of traditional conceptions of what constitutes core graduate planning curricula. </jats:p>",

The 1995 Morocco DHS also collected information on the source of supply for each episode of use of a modern method recorded in the calendar, allowing study of the association between the source of supply and discontinuation and switching rates. Multilevel event‐history models are used to evaluate the impact of individual‐level sociodemographic characteristics and community‐level indicators of family planning service provision. The findings show that the presence of a nearby public health center is associated with higher modern‐method adoption after a birth and lower method‐failure rates; the presence of a pharmacy is associated with lower discontinuation due to side effects or health concerns. The degree of method‐choice potential has a positive impact on both the rate of switching from the pill to another modern method and on modern‐method adoption after a birth.</jats:p>",

Although a good deal of attention has been paid to improving emergency treatment of abortion complications, the other elements of postabortion care, including providing postabortion family planning services, have received less attention and are rarely found in health‐care settings around the world. This report describes a study that was conducted in Kenya to test three different models of ways to provide postabortion family planning. The study shows that these new services are both feasible and acceptable to providers and patients, and also shows how effective they can be. Whereas only 7 percent of women received family planning counseling according to the baseline survey, this proportion increased to 68 percent in the postintervention period. In addition, 70 percent of women who decided to begin using contraceptives received a method, compared with only 3 percent at baseline. The provision of postabortion family planning counseling and methods on the gynecological ward by ward staff was found to be the preferred and most effective model.</jats:p>",

Simultaneously, however, evidence suggests that newly introduced family planning services and contraceptive availability can activate tension in gender relations. In this society, where payment ofbridewealth signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, there are deeply ingrained expectations about women's reproductive obligations. Physical abuse and reprisals from the extended family pose substantial threats to women; men are anxious that women who practice contraception might be unfaithful. Data from focus‐group discussions with men and women are examined in this report and highlight the strains on gender relations resulting from contraceptive use. The measures taken to address this problem and methods of minimizing the risk of adverse social consequences are discussed.</jats:p>",

The study shows that marginal spaces, defined as open spaces between buildings and the street, are generated as inevitable by-products of urban spatial development. Changes in both societal values and the regulatory processes of urban spatial development can transform marginal spaces into undesirable areas. In this paper, I argue that incidental generation and transformation of marginal spaces is inappropriate.

Using a case‐study of site visit planning, teaching and learning in an age 5‐11 rural primary school, it argues that, despite major centralizing initiatives such as the English National Curriculum and OFSTED inspection systems, teacher planning remains a complex, variable and necessarily individualized activity. The teacher planning discussed has been highly commended through a local school inspection under the OFSTED system; but the teachers’ organically influenced views of planning contrast with the more mechanistic written guidance from governmental and advisory bodies. Such centralized advice, driven by the assumption that educational improvement means ‘raising standards’, tends to model formulaic planning procedures which ignore evidence of how rich teacher thinking and planning can be in practice. The argument is made not simply to undermine nationally agreed curricula or inspection systems, but to advocate that policy‐makers should build from teachers’ natural diversities and avoid the over‐ambitious, even dangerous task of attempting to standardize their planning.</jats:p>",

The project encourages a collaborative process between researchers, community members, and public health managers to diagnose service‐delivery problems, to design and implement interventions, and to evaluate their effectiveness. Findings from the baseline evaluation revealed major constraints in availability of and access to family planning and reproductive health services for women, as well as severe deficiencies in quality of care. Interventions designed to address these weaknesses, bound by the limited resources of the public sector, focused on training, restructuring of providers' roles and service‐delivery patterns, the management process, the creation of a referral center, and the introduction of injectables, vasectomy services, and a program for adolescents. Evaluation results show the project's considerable impact in broadening reproductive options, although not all issues, especially those related to sustainability, have been resolved.</jats:p>",

A total of 1,516 randomly selected women aged 15–45 responded to a pretested structured questionnaire designed to elicit information concerning previous unwanted pregnancies and induced abortions in a value‐free manner. Nearly 20 percent of the women reported having had an unwanted pregnancy. Of these, 58 percent reported that they had successfully terminated the pregnancies; 32 percent continued the pregnancies; and nearly 9 percent stated that they had attempted termination but failed. Overall, the prevalence of self‐reports of induced abortion was 11 percent. The results reveal that information can be obtained on abortion in areas with restrictive abortion policies if an indirect interviewing approach is used.</jats:p>",

People knew what hearts were, or what the word ‘heart’ meant, before it was discovered that the heart is a pump whose function is to circulate the blood, So the function is not implicit in the meaning. Nevertheless, the heart does have this function. It does not much matter to which of these classes we assign the word ‘city’. Actually I think that it belongs to the second: one could know what a city is without knowing the function of cities (indeed many of our most vocal Greens are in this position); but they do have a function, and we can ask what it is. In other words, we can ask what good it does to have cities in which people live and work in proximity to one another, instead of living and working scattered uniformly over the countryside. I asked and answered this question in 1969b. I said that the reason why we have cities is in order to facilitate communication with one another.</jats:p>",

The power of PR has been recognised, and PR has earned its place, along with other communications disciplines, at the strategic table. As organisations and their brands/services gauge their susceptibility to good and bad PR, so too do they need to plan and manage the process. PR practitioners need to gain a better understanding of all the facets that touch the reputations of the organisations they serve. To achieve this they must have an intimate knowledge of the customers on whom their reputations depend. This paper sets out a process for achieving this, and a process for measuring the impact and influence of the resulting PR activity. A case study has been woven into the text to illustrate the process at each stage.</jats:p>",

The idea of the rational selection of ends as well as means makes land‐use planners reluctant to take goals as given even if they insist on a difference between planning and politics. A retrospective outline shows how three prominent planning theorists handle the controversial question of rational ends. By applying Habermas’ communicative rationality and the bounded/unbounded distinction, the range of rationality concepts becomes sufficiently wide to serve as a basis for classifying most popular planning modes. With multiple forms of rationality, some new problems arise. How are we, for instance, to rationally choose among forms of rationality in a given situation, and how can the various forms be applied simultaneously?</jats:p>",

The lack of political control has become extremely striking. Indeed, those tendencies which are apparent tend to be destructive: examples of “regionalism” in Europe are discouraging. Nonetheless, the region does still have a future.

Hitherto no comparable studies have been available for the field of social infrastructure, and in particular relating to facilities dedicated to helping, nursing and caring for people with disabilities. In the first empirical study of this type the focus is on the economic significance of larger-scale facilities for the disabled for the economy of the surrounding area, in this case based on the example of the Dominikus Ringeisen-Werk (DRW) in Bavaria. The key finding resulting from this study is that major facilities for the disabled of this type are indeed the source of a very considerable stimulus for the region in which they are located.  </jats:p>"

The comparison between the performance of conventional and two-phase flow drilling has shown the second technique presents several advantages to the last one1: (1) minimum or no damage to sensitive pay zones, (2) immediate and continuous evaluation of cuttings for hydrocarbon shows, (3) avoidance of lost circulation, and (4) higher penetration rates in hard formations. Advantages of air/mist/foam drilling regarding penetration rate in hard formation have been pointed out in previous technical papers. Few questions remain regarding the improvement in penetration rate when using this technique. However, questions arise when the main topic is savings attributed to two-phase flow drilling operations. The answers for those questions are not easy because many of the economical factors involved depend on each particular case. There are situations, mainly in wild cat wells, where the operator may not have all necessary input data for choosing the best option between an aerated or conventional drilling technique. Some data are within the direct control of the operator. Others, however, are beyond its influence and control, like the geological uncertainty and equipment performance. The necessary data for an appropriate cost analysis of an aerated operation includes the spread daily rate of drilling rig, the air drilling equipment day rate, the air equipment diesel supply, the air equipment rig up and rig down time, the hard formation thickness, and the expected penetration rate.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper focuses on the economics and operational results of using a two-phase flow drilling technique. The intent of this text is to demonstrate how, when, and why an oil company should implement an air/mist/foam operation in hard formation to accomplish the expected economical results. It describes an analysis performed for a wildcat well in Colombia, Los Mangos 60, using all the previous cited necessary data. In that location there were uncertainties related to hard formation thickness and expected penetration rate, so a cost analysis was performed to support a decision about the drilling technique to be used. The analysis used equations and graphs to represent almost all the involved costs, giving support for an appropriate decision. The paper also presents field results collected during the aerated drilling operation, showing that the decision to use this technique was the most appropriate.</jats:p>",

For the GOM, shallow water flow intervals typically occur between 300 ft to 2500 ft below mudline (BML) and in water depths greater than 1500 ft. If left unchecked, the disturbance from the water flow can cause loss of soil strength surrounding the wellbore, thereby compromising the structural integrity of the well. In industry, extreme cases have led to collapsed casing and/or total loss of wellbores.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Titan No. 1 exploration well was drilled in Garden Banks Block 785 (GOM), in 4640 ft of water. At Titan, the planning and successful implementation of operational procedures designed to mitigate the risks associated with SWF hazards included: performing a shallow hazards assessment, preparing and implementing SWF contingency plans, identifying the SWF zone quickly, immediately controlling the water flow zone with weighted mud (while drilling riserless), and using nitrified foam cement to seal off the water flow behind 20\" conductor pipe. Operations at Titan were based on the philosophy of quickly identifying the SWF, and immediately stopping the flow with weighted mud, as the chance of successfully mitigating the flow and maintaining the structural integrity of the wellbore will likely decrease with time if the sand is allowed to produce water, sand and/or sediment.</jats:p>",

Critical tolerances at several locations on the sheet metal part impose limitations on bending operations and sequences. The lack of success up to now in embedding accuracy in process planning for sheet metal products has resulted mainly from the fact that tolerance analysis usually requires simulating the manufacturing process. This paper discusses the issue of automatic determination of the bending sequence in sheet metal products subject to critical tolerance constraints. It proposes conditions for identifying cases where the problem of determining the bending order which results in the best accuracy at specific locations is, in fact, a topological problem. Two explicit rules for achieving the best accuracy in such cases are formulated and then demonstrated by using these rules to construct a precedence graph.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is concerned with enlarging the traditional view of rationality that has dominated management and planning in modern times. The inquiry begins by re‐examining Weber’s discussion of rationality as interpreted by contemporary analysts. Weber saw rationality as multi‐faceted and included notions of a social rationality involving more than simple instrumental or “practical” rationality. Habermas’ ideas concerning communicative action are then introduced as the basis for parsing out Weber’s differing conceptions of rationality based on the dual underlying motivations of pursuing social agreement along with technical or instrumental goals. In dialectical fashion, the paper introduces the concept of adaptive rationality involving a synthetic form of reason that mediates between substantive, or social, rationality and instrumental, or technical, rationality. This adaptive form of reason is seen as the heart of management and planning and requires a combined technical, political and moral imagination in the service of creating new forms of social practice and marshaling both the collective will and resources for their fulfillment. Thus, the paper argues for a wider conception of rationality that explicitly acknowledges social norms and the distribution of power and concludes with the hope of a renewed focus of research for a richer understanding of rational action.</jats:p>",

How was the spill managed in the subsequent weeks?, The main content of the paper will be given to discussion about how the refinery's staff and support organisations initial response and how—with the adoption of simple but workable management systems—the situation was brought under control. More specific issues such as how a small volume of a persistent oil can be more problematic than first understood by less-experienced responders; Actually understanding the numbers of personnel and equipment resources that are required; and resources necessary for shoreline cleanup, especially in an area of difficult foreshore access and differing shoreline types. The importance of resource management and financial control from the very outset of the response activities will be highlighted in the paper. Conclusions will be made on cost comparison of cleanup of other spills at the time and whether large response management systems are effective in certain situations.</jats:p>",

Even though living conditions in the cities were impoverished, urbanisation nonetheless repeatedly unleashed waves of migration from the countryside into the cities. Chinese society was split into a rural population and an urban population. Only with the economic reforms of the late ’70s did these structures slowly begin to dissolve.  </jats:p>"

It is shown that the objective function defined for the optimization of external beam intensities has a unique minimum. A corresponding algorithm is then designed to generate a sequence of intensity functions that converge to the minimum. The algorithm is applied to a test geometry where the target volume has concavity and there are adjacent critical organs. The cumulative dose–area histogram, the two‐dimensional version of the cumulative dose–volume histogram, is used to evaluate the outcomes of this new inverse planning method.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current state of human resource planning in South Africa is that many companies conduct virtually no such planning or provide it only for senior managerial positions. Employment equity legislation will, however, force the hand of managers and human resource practitioners in the public and private sectors alike to engage in regular human resource planning. The Employment Equity Act (1998) seeks to address the existing discrepancies in the distribution of jobs, occupations and income amongst South Africans by not only eliminating unfair discrimination in employment, but also making provision for affirmative action measures to promote a diverse and representative workforce. The employment equity audit requires the preparation of a workforce profile and consequent employment equity plan to address discrepancies. The main purpose of human resource planning is to identify future human resource requirements (in terms of numbers, skills, and particular characteristics, inter alia gender, race and disability) and to develop action plans to eliminate any discrepancies between the demand and supply of labour that are forecast. The article presents a comprehensive model of human resource planning, incorporating the practical implications of the Employment Equity Act, as a workable guideline to assist managers in compiling thorough forecasts and action plans in fulfilment of organizational and employment equity requirements.</jats:p>"

Todays production is characterized by low average oil rates, high water cuts and increasing sand problems, which adversely affect the economics. Even after steam drive operations were started 18 years ago to mobilize the viscous oil (120 mPa ⋅ s, 25 °API), total recovery is still less than 25%, leaving considerable potential for additional reserves. With the objective of sustained profitability improvements a comprehensive study was carried out in 1994-1996. Based on re-evaluations of the reservoir, all surface facilities, and the cost structure, various development scenarios were analyzed by a multi-disciplinary team. A number of cost cutting measures were recommended and mostly realized. However, it turned out that a purely cost saving approach would improve the economics only for a short term.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Treatments like frac packs and water shut-off were tested with limited economic success. Cost effective infill drilling (re-entry) was identified as the most economic means to accelerate production and increase reserves in Rühlermoor.

The article concludes by advancing a number of ideas which demonstrate how — notwithstanding certain reservations — the milieu approach might still be applied to good effect in regional development.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This is particularly true within local authorities, which were named explicitly in Agenda 21 as major agents of implementation. One important approach toward continuous monitoring of the implementation of a concept of development aimed at achieving sustainability is considered to lie in the use of indicators, which are currently a subject of discussion at all levels of spatial planning. The present contribution develops building blocks for a system of local indicators of sustainability. A case study on implementation of the indicator system provides the basis for outlining the problems and shortcomings associated with current information and data systems at local-authority level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In this paper, attention is focused on the unemployment flows behind these stocks. By using data for the British regions over the 1980s and 1990s, we show that regional unemployment-rate disparities are a direct reflection of different underlying regional unemployment ‘flow regimes’; that is, different patterns of inflows into, and outflows from, unemployment. In the 1980s these differences in regional flow regime were marked, but since the beginning of the 1990s they have narrowed. In addition, there appear to have been distinct ‘switches’ in regime in particular regions. These trends and shifts are considered alongside the debates surrounding the end of the ‘north—south’ unemployment divide in Britain; the claim that the British labour market is moving towards a US-style flexible, high-unemployment-turnover model; and the effects of various changes to the unemployment benefit system designed to restrict the numbers of claimants on that system. </jats:p>",

TAP users choose from countless spill sources with the movement of the ship-shaped cursor throughout the mapped water body.

TAP will use these along with the database of probabilities to calculate various estimates of spill significance relative to the user's specific concerns, such as feet of boom required to protect a site, or number of birds impacted at each site. TAP also helps users account for pollutant that is removed from the spill zone (skimming, booming, dispersants, etc.).

To seek regulatory approval for offshore oil production, industry responders joined agency regulators and made plans to clean up as much as 225,000 barrels of oil from potential blowouts over 15 days. Response technicians are configuring new and existing skimmers, vessels, and barges on the North Slope to implement those planning standards. This paper outlines the oil spill tactical plans and equipment that Alaska's North Slope oil industry recently assembled in seeking regulatory approval for the first offshore production islands in the Arctic. The operators of North America's largest oil fields are beginning the first production from oil wells separated from roads and most spill response vessels. For example, the new Badami production pad lies on the Arctic coast more than 25 miles from the Prudhoe Bay facilities, across river courses and roadless tundra. Eight miles of ice-infested sea will separate the proposed Northstar and Liberty production islands from response vessel berths. The new fields regularly experience waves, cold, and ice invasions that constrain oil recovery efforts. Yet regulatory approval to begin oil production requires that the industry have plans and equipment to clean up all the oil that may enter open water, even from the largest spills, within 72 hours.</jats:p>",

The fields of action within spatial planning and their spatial impacts quite naturally pervade all fields of research. Consequently, these questions clearly have to be seen as displaying an overarching character. The special quality of this relationship is found in the evaluative reflection of spatial research which is carried out through the action fields of spatial planning practice. This article provides an application-based insight into the activities of the ARL workshop on this field of research and into the research findings which have so far been forthcoming.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This paper describes the development of an integrated contingency planning, decision support and data management system that has benefited from application during a major spill. The system is able to store and visualise via GIS, the key data elements from the contingency plan. This data is then used within an expert system to provide decision support for cleanup activities and resource allocation costing. The data management databases generates field reporting forms which are reflected in the database so that information can be directly transferred into the computer on a daily basis. The resulting database is available on an on-going basis for response staff to access and at the end of incident, forms a definitive record of response activity and resource usage.</jats:p>",

Although this estimate is widely and authoritatively repeated, it rests on a handful of preliminary studies, chiefly of the United States and performed by a select group of economists. We examine the methods and assumptions of these studies and consider the social and political commitments built into their analytical techniques. We conclude that the prevailing methods of economic damage assessment and valuation provide a highly conservative estimate of the potential costs and risks of future climate change. We suggest that the IPCC scientific assessment process has been organized in such a way as to foreclose public debate about the moral and political judgments built into the technical details of its reports. </jats:p>",

The Plan is contained in a field handbook with six clearly defined stages. Implementation of the Plan commences with a definition of the impacted area, supported by use of oil spill models. The overall priority of the region, followed by the priority of individual resources is then assessed with supporting data provided by a detailed GIS. This permits individual resources to be assessed through sensitivity summaries, key consideration summaries, priority decision trees, response guidelines, and finally, guidelines for monitoring and assessment. The Plan has been specifically designed to provide rapid advice to response teams during emergency incidents ensuring that sensitive resources receive the optimum response to minimise damage and enhance recovery.</jats:p>",

It seems that IS sophistication is directed more at improving competitiveness, even though this may result in less efficient resource management due to bureaucratic procedures. However, at higher levels of IS sophistication, competitiveness stagnates and may even decrease, possibly due to bureaucratic bottlenecks. Implications of our results are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most histories of urban planning, urban politics, and the development of the welfare state have largely neglected both the existence and the importance of citizen participation in any period prior to the 1960s. The establishment of the Toronto Reconstruction Council/Civic Advisory Council in 1943, and the Community Council Coordinating Committee (4C's) in 1947, however, illustrates the importance of popular involvement in city and social planning during a crucial period in the history of Toronto and Canada as a whole. Organized by the local state both the Reconstruction Council and the 4C's tried to harness the tremendous surge of local activism and social idealism engendered by Torontonians' own attempts to tackle the social problems caused by a decade and a half of depression and war, as well as by their hopes for post-war reconstruction. Intended in many ways to manufacture consent for civic reconstruction plans, the agenda of these two organizations was often captive to the demands made by ordinary Torontonians out of necessity and self-interest. This article examines Toronto's unique experiment to harness citizen and community participation in aid of social and urban planning schemes. It argues that the rise and subsequent fall of the community organization movement represented a crucial turning point turning in citizen participation in urban planning politics. The formation of the TRC/CAC and the 4Cs represented a plastic moment in Toronto urban planning politics when the ideals of local democracy and citizen participation seemed achievable. However, the community organization movement foundered on the very divisions it hoped to overcome: class, ethnicity, and most importantly political Ultimately the failure of these two organizations to incorporate genuine citizen participation in social and urban planning schemes, as the case of the Regent Park slum clearance and public housing project illustrates, haunted city planning politics for the next two decades. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that in both scenarios a large share of the economic benefits accrue to other regions, but that the pipeline scenario yields greater benefits for the Northwest Territories. Differences between the two scenario results are explained in terms of the spatial and sectoral patterns of input requirements and differences in capacity expansion effects. </jats:p>",

The modeling work relies heavily on past and planned future field and laboratory work for calibration and verification data. Because these data remain incomplete, the results presented are tentative. The deepwater blowout model DeepBlow includes hydrate formation, gas dissolution, and separation of bubbles and oil droplets from the oil-gas-water plume as key processes which have been ignored in previous models, and which appear extremely important in determining the dynamics of the blowout plume. Time-variable vertical current profiles and the vertical density profile affect the depth of penetration of the plume. The oil droplet distribution in the blowout plume, combined with the above factors, determines to a large extent the time-varying footprint of the oil on the sea surface. Oil Spill Contingency And Response (OSCAR) model simulations demonstrate that mechanical response may be reasonably effective, or not, depending on the eventual correct values of key underlying parameters. Future field trials will be critical in establishing such values. The results demonstrate the usefulness of these models as tools for guidance of environmental monitoring and response activities during an actual blowout event.</jats:p>",

However, continuous variables are not suffcient to accurately represent discrete phenomena encountered in many practical decision situations, such as the power generation expansion problem. This paper presents a new approach based on a mixed 0–1 MOLP model and applied to the Greek electricity generation sector for identifying the number and output of each type of power units needed to satisfy the expected electricity demand in the future. The core of the model is a branch and bound algorithm, which has been properly modified for the multi‐objective case and is capable of generating the whole set of effcient solutions. The results provided by this method is the extraction of the effcient combinations of the power generation units, and for each combination the effcient solutions determining electricity production from each unit.</jats:p>",

In recreational pursuits, for example, spatial interaction is often marked by a confounding distance effect in which nearby and more distant destinations are equally attractive. The research reported in this paper concerns an examination of the distance effect in the spatial demand for a specific type of recreation: the use of national parks in the USA. The paper contains a review of the related spatial demand literature, including the travel cost model used in calculating economic values of national parks and related places. A central-place-type model of park use is described and put into operation in the form of two linear spatial demand models. One focuses on regional demand for park use and the other focuses on a national market. The initial model specifications are expanded in order to examine the drift of their distance parameters over two variables intended to quantify park quality: age and area. Empirical tests of the models indicate distance decay in the demand for park use is pronounced when distance is considered in the context of park quality. </jats:p>",

Results of experiments were compared to calculations done using three treatment planning systems.

The measured interface dose decreased by 55% for a 5 cm air gap, 5×5 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> field size, and 6 MV photons. This has been attributed to a lack of electronic equilibrium and dispersion of secondary particles transported through the air gap. These results are at variance with predictions of calculations using three treatment planning systems, for which only a 10% decrease was calculated. This is because the calculation algorithms employed do not incorporate electron transport. Further experiments were conducted to study the contribution of scatter from sides of the walls of the cavities. Dose measurements as a function of depth were also performed to investigate the effect of primary fluence attenuation. The Batho algorithm did not show any sensitivity to the position of air gap sidewalls. This points to the need for proper inclusion of disequilibrium effects and shape of inhomogeneity.</jats:p>",

However, this approach, which assumes that a deterministic model can be used to predict emissions reductions that will result in no exceedance of a probabilistic standard is very questionable. Further, in reality, the requirements do not encourage agencies to explore the ramifications of different strategy options, beyond that of the attainment strategy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recent work suggests that the new 8-hour ozone standard may be impossible to attain for a number of areas, including the oil production area in the San Joaquin Valley. Consequently, decisions on emissions reduction strategies for these areas need to be based on considerations other than demonstrating attainment. Among these considerations are maximizing reduction of population exposure, reduction in the areal extent of ozone concentrations above the standard, and reduction of the peak.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Also, because recent studies have highlighted some real concerns with the adequacy of ozone modeling, a new approach to planning is recommended. This would utilize a process that would use both modeling and non –modeling information to develop a plan, along with an iterative review of the modeling and analysis of changes in ozone over 5 to 6 years after enactment of the plan to determine if the original strategy was on target.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition, the issues described for ozone modeling also are relevant for other planning requirements such as for the PM 2.5 standard and regional haze regulation.

Results indicated that effective planning increased the SMM among team members, allowed them to utilize efficient communication strategies during high-workload conditions, and resulted in improved coordinated team performance. In addition, the communication strategy alone affected the degree of coordinated performance attained by teams during periods of increased workload.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we propose a methodology to study the scale effect and zoning effect of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Instead of aggregating basic spatial units by the neighborhood criterion, we suggest placing a square lattice over the centroids representing the enumeration units in the study area. Areal units are aggregated if their centroids are in the same square. By changing the size of the square in the lattice, we can study the scale effect. By randomly placing the lattice, we can study the zoning effect. This methodology links the MAUP effects to specific scale reflected by the size of grids. We use this method to study the MAUP effects on the segregation index D. Among the thirty selected cities in the USA, values of D respond to the MAUP in a diverse pattern. We assess the scale effect on D by examining the changes of averaged values of D over the range of scale levels. We also borrow concepts from fractal analysis to assess the scale effect on D and to measure how sensitive the D values of these cities are to different zonal patterns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A method for calibrating the total annual cost function of a single firm is developed by using optimal control and assuming rational behavior of the firm. The method is applied to peat-harvesting firms in New Brunswick, but has wider applicability. Information on the exogenous variables is available without resorting to surveys of individual firms, leaving as endogenous the variables specific to a firm. The results are sufficiently promising that the approach suggested herein may serve as a useful set of parameters for individual firms in follow-up work. </jats:p>",
