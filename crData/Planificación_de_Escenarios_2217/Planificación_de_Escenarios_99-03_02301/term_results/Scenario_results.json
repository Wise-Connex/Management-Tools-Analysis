      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent computational studies of models for manganese oxides have revealed a rich phase diagram, which was not anticipated in early calculations in this context performed in the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, the transition between the antiferromagnetic insulator state of the hole-undoped limit and the ferromagnetic metal at finite hole density was found to occur through a mixed-phase process. When extended Coulomb interactions are included, a microscopically charged inhomogeneous state should be stabilized. These phase separation tendencies, also present at low electronic densities, influence the properties of the ferromagnetic region by increasing charge fluctuations. Experimental data reviewed here by applying several techniques for manganites and other materials are consistent with this scenario. Similarities with results previously discussed in the context of cuprates are clear from this analysis, although the phase segregation tendencies in manganites appear stronger.</jats:p>",

Among such disadvantages, changing traditional joint family structure is the one which is having more repercussions on the elderly. Due to the industrialisation, urbanisation and modernization, within the society several structural changes are taking place and the ascribed status is replaced by the achieved status. Thus, filial responsibilities are weakening and the inter-personal and inter-generational relations are also getting strained. In this paper all such issues are discussed based on the accumulated references. </jats:p>",

The approach uses a Monte Carlo simulation model, which is described, that simulates a play containing multiple prospects. The play evaluated can consist of pure exploration prospects, or may contain a mixture of discovered reserve opportunities (DRO's) and exploration prospects. Resource (reserve) size distributions, dependent geologic prospect risks, risk tolerance, stand-alone commercial threshold sizes, and tie-back thresholds are some of the key drivers of the play simulation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The simulation generates expected commercial reserve levels and commercial risks for each prospect included in the play, as well as an overall project commercial reserve distribution and risk level. In addition, and more importantly, discrete development scenarios for high (P90), mid (P50), and low (P10) reserve cases can be generated. These development scenarios can then be used to determine a valuation range for the prospects.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The value of this approach is that it provides a consistent methodology to generate a range of discrete development scenarios that span the reasonable range of project success - case expectations. Development plans for those scenarios can then be applied and the scenarios can be deterministically evaluated to determine the range of the project's economic value. This hybrid approach of a stochastic play model combined with deterministic economic evaluations avoids some of the common pitfall of most pure stochastic or pure deterministic approaches.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methodology is also described for logically grouping discrete prospects into \"super-prospects\" for the purpose of evaluating projects that contain an unwieldy number of small prospects.</jats:p>",
