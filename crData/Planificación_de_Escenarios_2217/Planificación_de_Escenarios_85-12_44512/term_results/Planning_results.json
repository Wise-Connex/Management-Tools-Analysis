The problem is to determine the joint probability density for the collection of events. In this paper, the joint probability function is estimated using an extended entropy model, constrained by additional information on the entropy of aggregated events. The resulting models are compared with existing formulations, based either on entropy maximization or on utility maximization. It is also shown that models which are used for predicting demand can be generalized to allow for the dependence of demand on supply, allowing for nonhomogeneous zonal supply and supply – demand imbalances. </jats:p>",

This study focuses upon an analysis both of the environmental preferences of recreators and of the social conditions present at facilities which affect visitor satisfaction and use. Preferences for five attributes of trail areas within Chicago forest preserves were examined so that a predictive model for visitor satisfaction could be derived and used to evaluate alternative management strategies for trail design. The number of changes in views contributed more to visitor satisfaction than the type of trail surface, trail length, and the type of terrain on the trail. Proximity to residence was more important than the combination of all other physical characteristics. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the level of social interaction that one might experience and one's preference for a trail area. Neither one's choice of activity nor the characteristics of the person or persons encountered with regard to age, race, or behavior along the trail areas significantly affected concerns for social interactions or use of trail areas. However, differences did exist among the recreators with regard to the perceived effectiveness of alternative management strategies designed to mitigate social interactions. Last, the joint effects of recreators' preferences for environmental attributes and the effect of environmental management policies aimed at controlling social interaction were examined and shown to have interlocking and, sometimes, offsetting effects. </jats:p>",

Giddens proposes a ‘general theory’, centered on the notion of ‘structuration’. He is particularly important to geography because he suggests that the spatiality of social practices belongs at the center of social theory and historical analysis. Systems of social practices are defined by their time–space characteristics. There are problems in the corpus of Giddens's work that require attention, however, before such a theory can be fully viable. These include: Giddens's derogation of intentional action in favor of practical knowledge; his notion that structure is ‘instantiated’; his concept of power; his treatment of material resources; and his lack of attention to discursive strategies. From an examination of these areas of Giddens's work, it can be seen that he advances several, inconsistent, theories of social change. In a reinvigorated theoretical human geography, based on the analysis of interaction in time and space, these problem areas must be tackled. </jats:p>",

In the absence of synergy, each potential acquisition should be evaluated on its own merit, independent of the other businesses in a company's portfolio.

All metropolitan and Greater London lower-tier authorities and a sample of one in five shire districts were investigated. The results show that Labour control was linked with reduced sales levels, even after allowance was made for council housing characteristics, tenants' wealth, and other relevant demand factors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At the beginning of the nineteen eighties the observers of Italian local government system were divided between those who, looking at the unexpected social and economic development of the peripheral areas, labelled the situation as ‘neolocalism’ and those who, emphasizing the total dependence of the municipalities on the central government grants, spoke of ‘neocentralism’. The difficulty in assessing the centralized or decentralized nature of the Italian system—it is suggested in this paper—depends on the inadequacy of such concepts to cope with the complexities of contemporary political systems. From a reconstruction of the local finance reforms, which is able to show the possible objectives of such a policy, the outcomes of its implementation, as well as the actors of the process, their rationales, and their interactions, it is concluded that the intergovernmental relations have not been altered in favor of the central power and that the traditional fragmentation of the Italian political administrative system has been strenghtened. Conceptualizing intergovernmental relations as policies gives a much more realistic and promising way to depict the issue than does the simplistic zero-sum assumption implied in the traditional centralization-decentralization debate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The work of Michel Foucault has recently been subjected to considerable scrutiny. This paper is an examination of his book, Discipline and Punish, which describes an historical transformation in the exercise of power. The themes (section 2) and the significance (section 3) of the book are discussed in terms of Foucault's conception of history and power. In the rest of the paper, its implications are examined more closely, through four categories: ‘institutions’, ‘the economy’, ‘law and the state’, and ‘struggle and strategy’. Under these headings are discussed the connections and contradictions between Foucault's analysis and more conventional Marxist or Weberian approaches. Although Foucault's perspectives cannot be ‘incorporated’ within such theories of power, they are far from being completely incompatible with them. </jats:p>",

The findings suggest that relative economic deprivation does precipitate political unrest. Social deprivation, as measured by repression of the population, also incites a demand for political change, although repression has a predictable supply-side effect of dampening the population's ability to translate demand for political change into actuality. </jats:p>",

Particular attention is paid to the impact of various types of central government grants on the local government budgets. This is an important issue in a nation like Japan, where the fiscal system is strongly centralized. First, a model is constructed to express the local fiscal behavior under the present grant policies, following the past attempts developed in the United States of America. Then, the estimates of this model are attempted using available data, and some policy questions are examined. The main empirical conclusions that are drawn from the Japanese experience are much more plausible than those in the US case. This implies that the control of central government via various grant policies is more dominant in Japan. </jats:p>",

In the actual case presented below, the magnitude of the active storage was prescribed by a legal procedure, so that the planning issue became that of determining the reservoir yield given the hydrological information. A stochastic dynamic programming model was formulated to derive a schedule of seasonal optimal reservoir releases and their respective probabilities of occurrence. This schedule is the reservoir yield. The yearly cycle was divided into three seasons representing the actual climatic conditions, and conditional probabilities linking streamflows in consecutive seasons were estimated. An operating policy was postulated, based on the same set of legal decisions that prescribed the active storage volume, and target reservoir releases were assumed. Similarly, target storages at the end of each season were set up. The optimizing/ minimizing criterion in the dynamic programming formulation was the sum of squares of deviations of actual releases and final storage volumes from their respective targets.</jats:p>",
