      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the introduction of Scenario-based Learning (SBL) online and its impact on the roles and identity of the learners and academic staff involved in its adoption, as well those like myself who are in transition from ‘pedagogical developer’ to ‘pedagogical researchers’ with a focus on this pedagogy. The many issues involved are considered and their analysis presented as an ordered situational map (Clarke, 2005). A key factor that has become apparent through this reflective process is the recognition that pedagogical research is essentially individual and competitive, and that the collegiate approach so successful in pedagogical development is no longer always appropriate. A parallel is drawn with the collaborative strategies now being adopted by commercial freelance workers through such emerging online communities as Ecademy.com and OpenBC.com. These provide both a model for future pedagogical research collaboration and an example of the kind of entrepreneurial endeavor which SBL is expected to inspire in students. Universities in the UK are tasked by the UK Higher Education Funding Council to “enable people to develop their capabilities and fulfil their potential, both personally and at work” (HEFCE, 2005). The challenge to a university such as Coventry is to provide a learning experience that anticipates the needs and expectations of potential employers while satisfying the academic requirements of subject benchmarks and programmes of study. Inevitably, the emphasis on employability will create tensions for those academic staff who see this as a change in their role and/or identity. SBL also challenges learners since it requires them to adopt roles within a pre-defined situation and hence to alter their perception of the subject matter, their identity as a potential member of a community of practice and to re-frame their understanding of the boundaries of study, work and leisure.</jats:p>"

Yield enhancement has several  requirements such as the root cause analysis of yield loss,  the reliability of defect density data, and the demand for a  link between yield models and APC. For root cause studies  chemical analysis uses different preparation techniques to  describe the nature and location of contamination or defect  densities, e.g. copper bulk contamination or wafer edge  effects. The reliability of defect density data and the  matching of defect inspection tools improve by the reduction  of noise. In combination with a process model this is the  prerequisite to set up a random defect-based yield scenario  which describes single processes. The combination of this  scenario with methods for data acquisition and tracking from  APC enhances the prediction of yield.</jats:p>",

Model simulations of both actual and potential evaporation produce realistic temporal patterns in comparison to those estimated from field data; as evaporation from the surface increases with increasing irrigation, potential evaporation decreases. This is in accordance with the Bouchet–Morton complementary relationship and suggests that actual evapotranspiration can be readily computed from routine meteorological observations. The driving mechanisms behind irrigation-related changes in actual and potential evaporation include reduced wind velocities, increased atmospheric stability, and depressed humidity deficits. The relative role of each in preserving the complementary relation is assessed by fitting a potential evaporation model to pan evaporation data. The importance of reduced wind velocity in maintaining complementarity was unexpected, and thus examined further using a set of perturbation simulation experiments with changing roughness parameters (reflecting growing cotton crops), changing moisture conditions (reflecting irrigation), and both. Three potential causes of wind velocity reduction associated with irrigation may be increased surface roughness, decreased thermal convection that influences momentum transfer, and the development of anomalous high pressure that counteracts the background wind field. All three are evident in the mesoscale model results, but the primary cause is the pressure-induced local wind system. The apparent necessity of capturing mesoscale dynamical feedbacks in maintaining complementarity between potential and actual evaporation suggests that a theory more complicated than current descriptions (which are based on feedbacks between actual evaporation and temperature and/or humidity gradients) is required to explain the complementary relationship.</jats:p>",

The Dorges and McCoy blades did not perform any better than the standard Macintosh blade in either the easy or difficult tracheal intubation settings.
