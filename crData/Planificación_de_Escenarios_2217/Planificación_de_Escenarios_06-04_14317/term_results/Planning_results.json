The existing literature in this field is dispersed throughout different subjects, such as planning, geographical information systems (GIS), decisionmaking, or computer systems. The compilation, analysis, and comparison of the different models have allowed us to draw a series of conclusions for the development and implementation of strategic plans for rural land use. Because GIS have become an essential tool in rural land-use planning, special attention has been paid to the models and methods integrated into GIS. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the key challenges for municipalities provided by Agenda 21 is the management of water resources. A central aim of the Agenda is for municipalities to take increased responsibility for the planning of wastewater handling. This implies finding proper decisionmaking methods with which to assess and handle conflicts of interest due to the multiple criteria and multiple users. The author describes the development of a process-guided multicriteria analysis (MCA) method and discusses its use as a decisionmaking tool for wastewater planning in a Norwegian municipality. A number of alternatives and criteria considered to be relevant in the evaluation of wastewater planning were developed in a dialogue between a decisionmaker, an expert, and the author. Various techniques for the aggregation of alternatives, criteria, decisions, and actors preferences with different claims to comparability and commensurability were used. The decision actors found it easier to rank then to weigh criteria. The use of process-guided MCA in decisionmaking provides a structured way of articulating alternatives and preferences and a transparent way of showing the success and the robustness of the alternatives. The preferences were articulated after the calculation of scores, implying that the decisions were less generalisable but better informed than those achieved through prior articulation. By integrating the decision actors in the decisionmaking process, uncertainties about the relevant preferences and alternatives may have been reduced—thereby increasing the robustness of the results. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies in several cities have shown that inner-city residents travel shorter distances and use cars less for local transport than suburbanites do. However, according to some authors, a low daily amount of travel is likely to be compensated through more extensive leisure mobility at weekends and on holidays. On the basis of a study of residential location and travel in the Copenhagen metropolitan area, this paper addresses the phenomenon of compensatory travel. For travel within ‘weekend trip distance’ from the residence, inner-city living appears to have a certain compensatory effect in the form of a higher frequency of medium-distance leisure trips. Probably, this reflects a shortage of nature in the immediate surroundings of the dwelling as well as less leisure time tied to gardening and house maintenance. These compensatory trips imply a slight reduction of the transport-reducing effect of inner-city living, but are far from sufficient to change the overall tendency towards less travel and reduced car dependency among inner-city residents. The frequency of flights is somewhat higher among respondents living in dense inner-city areas, but this relationship is hardly causal, as the correlations of flights with daily travel time or distance, access to local green areas, housing costs or car ownership that might be expected if the hypothesis of compensatory air travel were true, are not present. </jats:p>",

To a certain extent, the existence of such a system can explain the perennial interest of the architectural field in applying conceptual ideas about nature to architectural theory and in integrating natural form in architecture. Yet, owing to the decreasing contact with natural form in the modern world, this system is becoming less stimulated and, ultimately, underdeveloped. A probable effect of this trend is that the architectural field will become increasingly disinterested in adopting natural morphologies. It is argued that this can lead to three interrelated types of impoverishment. These underscore the importance of integrating natural form in architectural design. </jats:p>",

Despite the frequent use of metaphors in design practice, no empirical work has studied in depth the role played by metaphors during the whole design process. In this research the aid and complexity of the use of metaphors are explored in the different phases of the design process. These phases deal with the definition of design concepts and framing of design situations, the generation of goals and constraints, and the mapping and application of structural relationships to the design problem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One of the most important components of health care systems is human resources for health (HRH)—the people that deliver the services. One key challenge facing policy makers is to ensure that health care systems have sufficient HRH capacity to deliver services that improve or maintain population health. In a predominantly public system, this involves policy makers assessing the health care needs of the population, deriving the HRH requirements to meet those needs, and putting policies in place that move the current HRH employment level, skill mix, geographic distribution and productivity towards the desired level. This last step relies on understanding the labour market dynamics of the health care sector, specifically the determinants of labour demand and labour supply. We argue that traditional HRH policy in developing countries has focussed on determining the HRH requirements to address population needs and has largely ignored the labour market dynamics aspect. This is one of the reasons that HRH policies often do not achieve their objectives. We argue for the need to incorporate more explicitly the behaviour of those who supply labour—doctors, nurses and other providers—those who demand labour, and how these actors respond to incentives when formulating health workforce policy.

Clusters are defined as contiguous built-up urban areas. We present characteristics of clusters, including their morphology. Previous work that analyzed urban clusters focused on the Pareto distribution of clusters and on the behavior of the biggest cluster. Our work presents a more thorough description of the characteristics of urban clusters. By means of historic data of the Tel Aviv metropolis we present cluster statistics and we study their dynamics. We present characteristics of the clusters from 1935 to 2000, including their number, rank-size distribution, and morphology through the area–perimeter relation. These indicators present important anomalies in 1964 and 1985. Our study suggests that the urban cluster approach can be used as a tool to study urban phenomena and we hope that through them we shall be able to investigate economic and social phenomena as well. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Surface mining operations constitute one of the most visible and significant landscape offenders because of their geomorphologic and aesthetic effects. In recent years, the disturbance of the landscape owing to surface mining activities seems to be one of the most significant issues to deal with, as it raises serious conflicts between the public and the extractive industry. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt an environmentally friendly design for an excavation of any possible degree. Thus far, existing visual-impact assessment methodologies provide little support towards this direction as a consequence of their, mainly, qualitative character. In this paper we describe a new, more quantitative, methodological approach which is based on the measurement of topographic relief alteration caused by mining and quarrying works, and which makes use of modern mining software and geographic information systems tools. The methodology provides the means to adjust the excavation design in a way that minimizes visual impacts caused by the landform reprofiling. It can be applied in every stage of the life of a mine project. Moreover, if modified, it can also be used for the estimation of topographic relief alteration in projects within the construction sector that involve significant earthmoving works. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In many developed countries forest cover is growing and forestry policy is increasingly focused on the provision of nonmarket benefits such as recreation, biodiversity, and visual amenity. The amount of benefit provided by new woodland is not only dependent on the (site level) design of the woodland, but also on its location in the wider landscape. This poses a challenge for policymakers, who, in order to allocate limited resources efficiently, have to target areas in which the efforts or costs of planting are relatively low and the benefits of planting are relatively high. The adoption by policymakers of such methods of spatial targeting has been hampered by a lack of established methods with which to map the various nonmarket benefits in a policy-relevant way. In this paper I develop a new GIS (geographic information system)-based method to map the potential visual-amenity benefits of new small-scale woodlands, on the basis of criteria of visibility, size, and location of the viewing population, and public preference for wooded landscapes. A case study in Scotland, relating to an existing publicly funded afforestation scheme, is used to demonstrate how this map can serve as an important criterion for the selective allocation of planting subsidies, thus helping to provide a better (visual-amenity) value for (taxpayers') money. </jats:p>",

We hypothesize that SID, operating in the form of mutual cross‐specialty referral, will cause earnings to increase with total physician density (all specialties taken together), but simultaneously, decrease with increasing competition within specialties. We used multiple regression analyses controlling for high‐user population, physician demographics and practice type. The evidence supports our hypotheses. Increasing total physician density (all specialties) is positively associated with earnings. Concurrently, within specialties, increased competition is associated with reduced earnings. The medical appropriateness of increasing health care utilization with increasing physician supply cannot be directly determined from the data. However, evidence of a steady earnings increase with increasing total physician density, which precludes a saturation point (of appropriate care levels) at some optimum physician density, substantiates SID in the office‐based practice market. Empirically, our data suggest that the average market effect of physicians on one another is synergic when all specialties are considered together, but competitive within each specialty.

The motivation for the study is to understand the implementation of performance‐based management systems which is an element in the international New Public Management (NPM) reforms waves now affecting the hospital sector. The theoretical framework is based on the description of hospitals as complex and decoupled organizations. The use of benchmarking is discussed, and the focus is put on the information biases that exist in such data. The main finding in the empirical study is that the ambiguous information which exists in the performance measures used at the hospital department level, maintains the decoupling between the clinical activities and the management control practices. This decoupling creates management control problems because it hampers the knowledge on the cause‐effects of actions, which is important in order to undertake strategic decisions and diagnostic action. In order to increase transparency, cost information should be decomposed as to develop practical indicators for interactive control purposes in clinical departments.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we compare the sketch-map technique with a spatial modelling task based on a set of eight separate items. The aim of the comparison is to verify, thanks to a special spatial reconstruction set, Jeu de reconstruction spatiale (JRS), whether the difficulties often encountered by unskilled persons when asked to draw a sketch map can be avoided. If so, the JRS could help to improve comparisons between different social groups. Thirty university students majoring in geography and twenty-one unskilled staff members were asked to represent the centre of Strasbourg both by drawing a sketch and with the JRS. The results show that, on one hand, the difference between the two groups regarding the number of items mentioned is smaller with the JRS than with the sketch map. On the other hand, in both groups, the same proportion of respondents increased the number of urban elements produced in the second trial with the JRS. This was not the case with the sketch map. Also, the JRS is more stable than the sketch map from one trial to the next. Furthermore, the respondents preferred the JRS to the sketch map. However, the JRS is more suggestive than the sketch map, but only for elements which are more rarely represented (railway tracks, etc). Thus, in terms of scientific research, the JRS makes it possible to improve comparisons between social groups. In terms of applications, it offers interesting possibilities for promoting citizen participation in urban planning. </jats:p>",

In early stages of this development, the operations centers have been utilized for conducting, e.g., morning meetings and increase the communication between the asset and operational teams (e.g., between onshore and offshore teams). In this paper we will address how existing work processes can be implemented in new ways in such environment, in an attempt to take advantage of the new communication opportunities and data and model availability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our focus is on parts of the production optimization work process, namely that connected with production planning. Production optimization requires knowledge of well behaviour and topside processing constraints. The production engineer must consider all wells simultaneously in order to optimize the production from the wells to the processing plant. The objective is to use the equipment effectively to maximize oil and gas production. Finding the operating conditions where this is achieved, requires an integrated production planning-with participation from production engineers, reservoir engineers, offshore operators, and topside processing engineers. A typical challenge related to this is the lack of a common framework for integration of work processes between the disciplines, preventing decisions to be made based on a common view of the status and challenges ahead. This paper outlines how this challenge can be addressed using a real time system approach to production optimization work processes. Features of the real-time system will be described and a new work process for production planning using this system will be outlined.</jats:p>",

The purpose of treatment planning is to design treatment strategies to best achieve such goals, and to estimate the radiation dose throughout the irradiated volume before the start of the treatment. Thanks to the rapid developments in computer and medical imaging technologies, treatment planning can now be done efficiently under the guidance of the patient’s internal anatomy in three dimensions, incorporating possibly functional and metabolic information with ever increasing resolution and clarity. This article reviews key components in the computer‐aided radiation dose planning, including virtual simulation, image registration, three‐dimensional dose calculation, treatment plan optimization, and treatment plan evaluation, emphasizing specifically the impact of computer technology on these recent developments. As we are ascending into an era of image‐guided radiation therapy with computer‐controlled delivery and real‐time image guidance and feedback, advanced computer technology will play an ever increasingly significant role in radiation oncology.</jats:p>"

This paper reports on three case studies from southern Europe where conflicts over water exist. In each a different method for participation was experimentally employed: scenario workshops, mediated modelling, and social multicriteria evaluation. Scenario workshops and mediated modelling proved well suited to the early stages of a planning process (problem solving and identification of goals and alternatives) and to be good at educating participants and supporting capacity building. Their performance was less satisfactory with respect to resolving long-standing conflicts and achieving consensus. In comparison, social multicriteria evaluation was better able to address the evaluation of alternatives, reveal trade-offs, and aid convergence between divergent stakeholders' views, but it relied more heavily on experts and allowed less participation and deliberation in goal-setting than the other two methods. These results show complementarities amongst methods which imply that hybrid or combined approaches would be best for aiding the water planning process. They also reveal problems confronting the use of participatory approaches and constraints which prevent theoretical promise from being converted into practical results. </jats:p>",

Since many strategy planning frameworks implicitly assume that their underlying assumptions are not changing overtime this stands in some contradictory relation to growth transitions in rapidly growing firms. Hence, this paper proposes an approach called “Growth Scorecards” which is based on the Balanced Scorecard methodology and enables decision makers of high‐growth enterprises to identify the necessity and approximate scope of strategic revisions associated with a growth transition. The described approach therefore employs complexity‐theoretic concepts in order to classify the management’s propensity for growth measures as the internal likelihood of a growth transition. As a prerequisite for this the paper starts with a disquisition of the theoretic framework underlying this approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents a mathematical method to design complex trajectories for three-dimensional (3D) wells. Three-dimensional cubic trajectories are obtained for various end conditions: free end, set end, free inclination/set azimuth, and set inclination/free azimuth. The resulting trajectories are smooth continuous functions, which better suit the expected performance of modern rotary steerable deviation tools, in particular point-the-bit and push-the-bit systems. A continuous and gradual change in path curvature and tool face results in the smoothest trajectory for 3D wells, that in turn results in lower torque, drag, and equipment wear. The degree of freedom and the associated parameters of the 3D curves express the commitment between the average curvature to the final length of the path, which can be adjusted to fit the design requirements and to optimize the trajectory. Several numerical examples illustrate the various end conditions. The paper also presents the full mathematical results (expressions for the 3D path, actual curvature, and actual tool face). The method is directly applicable to the well planning cycle as well as to automatic and manual hole steering.</jats:p>",

The geometry can be the machine that produces the radiation or the 3D images of the patient under treatment. In a Monte Carlo calculation for radiation therapy treatment planning, radiation particles are generated and tracked through various components in the machine head and followed into the patient body, inside of which the relevant physical events are simulated and energy deposited.</jats:p><jats:p>Several examples are given to illustrate the application of Monte Carlo calculations in radiation therapy treatment planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the birth of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—a noninvasive tool able to visualize brain function—now 15 years ago, several clinical applications have emerged. fMRI follows from the neurovascular coupling between neuronal electrical activity and cerebrovascular physiology that leads to three effects that can contribute to the fMRI signal: an increase in the blood flow velocity, in the blood volume and in the blood oxygenation level. The latter effect, gave the technique the name blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. One of the major clinical uses is presurgical fMRI in patients with brain abnormalities. The goals of presurgical fMRI are threefold: 1) assessing the risk of neurological deficit that follows a surgical procedure, 2) selecting patients for invasive intraoperative mapping, and 3) guiding of the surgical procedure itself. These are reviewed here. Unfortunately, randomized trials or outcome studies that definitively show benefits to the final outcome of the patient when applying fMRI presurgically have not been performed. Therefore, fMRI has not yet reached the status of clinical acceptance. The final purpose of this article is to define a roadmap of future research and developments in order to tilt pre‐surgical fMRI to the status of clinical validity and acceptance. J. Magn. Reson.

A computer-based physician requirement planning model is a user-friendly approach in response to such demands. This article presents a new method-ology based on a Graphic User Interface (GUI) using Java. Information on work days/hours, activity-wise standard times and annual workload information, bed capacity and occupancy figures are inputted in a visual display screen and the model generates activity-wise and overall physician requirements. Current availability is entered and prevailing productivity levels are estimated. An institutional summary presents overall and specialty-wise current availability and requirement of physicians. Computerisation empowers policy makers/planners to respond promptly to requests by hospitals for manpower assessment and decide objectively on additional posts. It enables health administration to visualize human resource implications of changing utilisation scenarios and variation in model parameters. </jats:p>",

Much of the extensive literature relating to the British regime contained in Part IIA has focused on the regime’s ‘strict and retroactive’ rules for apportioning liability among ‘appropriate persons’. Liability within this framework is clearly of considerable interest in theory, yet it is dependent in practice on effective administration by local environmental health authorities (the principal enforcing agents), who are responsible for inspecting land in their area, identifying land falling within Part IIA and issuing remediation documentation by which liability for remedying contaminated land is apportioned. As the regime enters its fifth year in force, it is timely to reflect on how these pivotal aspects of what is a public law approach to environmental remedies are being enforced in practice. The historical emphasis placed by the British Legislature on controlling pollution to air and water has bequeathed a substantial legacy of land contamination in need of attention today. Part IIA tackles this legacy through the obligations that are imposed on local authorities to identify and secure the remediation of the sites which present the most immediate and pressing risks to health and the environment. Reports emerging from the environmental consultancy sector suggest that this legacy is being addressed on a potentially major scale. What is in need of closer analysis, however, is the contribution to this clean-up effort that is being made by regulatory law and Part IIA in particular. Is land being remediated in spite of, rather than because of, the enactment of a specialist regime?</jats:p>",

Formal deliberative processes have also been successful in aiding understanding and meeting consensus in complex and difficult decision problems which involve more than one decisionmaker. Here, both approaches are combined in a new technique called ‘deliberative multicriteria evaluation’ to assist a group of natural resource managers to decide on a suitable option for recreation and tourism activities in the upper Goulburn–Broken Catchment of Victoria, Australia. This approach is an attempt to combine the advantages of MCE, providing structure and integration in complex decision problems, with the advantages of deliberation and stakeholder interaction provided by a ‘citizens' jury’. An important outcome of the process was the discovery of some crucial aspects of the decision problem that required deeper understanding and assessment if that preferred strategy were to have the desired results. Some suggestions for improving the process are provided but, in general, the stakeholder jury was regarded as a helpful and useful procedure by the decisionmakers and one which aided them in their understanding of the issues of a complex decisionmaking problem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Gender has long been recognised as important within environmental issues, but there has been considerable debate over how to conceptualise the gender–environment nexus. As feminist theorising around women and gender has changed, so have conceptualisations about gender and environment, leading to a key debate within ecofeminism and related literatures about whether there is an essential or a contingent relationship between women and natural environments. Within geography, most political ecologists work with the assumption that the gender–environment nexus is a contingent relationship, and thus investigate how gender relations are salient in the symbolic and material construction of environmental issues. In this paper I seek to build from this work and again raise the issue of how gender is conceptualised in relation to environment. I begin by briefly reviewing some of the work that has been done on gender and environment and then draw from poststructural feminism to suggest that gender itself has been undertheorised in work on environment. Once gender is reconceptualised as a process, the dynamic relationship between gender, environment, and other aspects of social and cultural life can be brought into view. What emerges is the need for political ecologists to examine gender beyond the household and community and the need to reconceptualise the gender–environment nexus. A case study of community forestry in Nepal is used to illustrate the importance of interrogating the processes by which gender relations become salient and are reproduced symbolically and materially. </jats:p>",

It reviews the South African government's current and planned investment in urban infrastructure, both to enhance economic growth and to contribute to poverty reduction, and what this implies for Cape Town. It highlights the lack of attention given to ecological issues and the dangers of assuming that the resources will be available to support it, and that prices for fresh water, fossil fuels and food will not rise. It also points to Cape Town's large ecological footprint (comparable to that of Canada, per person) and its heavy dependence on non-renewable resources, especially oil – which means that every oil price rise transfers money from the Cape Town economy to national and global financial circuits. Housing lower-income groups in conventional housing with no attention to a more compact, less automobile-dependent city form exposes them to high water and energy costs. The paper ends by pointing to the advantages for the city and for lower-income groups of including ecological issues, and outlines the possibilities for doing so. </jats:p>",

In so doing, they propose that the use of narratives must be part of the repertoire of approaches used to represent complex urban systems. This does not imply an abandonment of interest in or search for causal generative mechanisms in system change. Rather, it is a recognition that narratives enable human actors to express the meaning that underlies their own agency as part of their account of the trajectories of places. </jats:p>",

This paper sets out the benefits of the concept, indicates its history and use, and offers a sympathetic critique of both the theory and practice of Ecological Footprints.

Husband questionnaires were completed by 1971 men. It was found that 88·9% of the couples had not talked about family planning with each other in the last two months. The percentage of answers on current contraceptive use for all methods that were consistent for husbands and wives was 70·2%. The consistency among partners who stated they would like to have children in the future was found to be 94·8%, and that among partners who were planning to use a contraceptive method was found to be 88·3%.</jats:p>",

Numerous decisions have to be taken to obtain an accurate, comfortable, and high-quality service. Effectively, the optimization algorithm is a key factor in the design process, but so are the number of cars being installed, their technical characteristics, the kinematics of the elevator group, and some other design parameters, which cause the selection task of the elevator system to be a complex one. In this context, the design of decision support tools is becoming a real necessity that most important companies are including as part of their strategic plans. In this article, the authors present a user-friendly planning and simulating tool for dynamic vertical traffic. The tool is conceptualized for giving support in the planning and design stage of the elevator system, in order to collaborate in the selection of the type of elevator (number, type of dynamic, capacity, etc.) and the optimization algorithm. </jats:p>",

However, these activity reports are based on human observations and judgment. This fact implies a number of limitations such as the coarse level of detail and subjective coding systems. To overcome these problems a rule-based system has been applied to autonomously analyze real time surface sensor data. The system evaluates the sensor data stream and acquires crucial process information as a basis for further analysis. Scope of the system is the recognition of drilling operations, such as tripping, making connections, reaming, washing etc. to extend and enhance standard reporting. This way a standardized and objective categorization of the drilling process can be achieved at a level of accuracy and detail not reached so far.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Another benefit is the automated reporting feature. By the recognition of the rigs current state, the system is able to propose an impartial process description. This automatism leads to a reduction of the time spent on reporting and leaves more time to focus on unexpected events and lessons learned. Analysis of field data allowed introducing new key performance indicators (e.g. wellbore treatment time per depth interval) for benchmarking, which are determined automatically during the evaluation process. This type of benchmarking does not rely on company specific activity coding systems. This way cost and time-consuming data management effort e.g. to compare operated and non-operated wells are eliminated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The new system was applied to wells drilled in the Vienna Basin during the past year. As a conclusion it can be stated that the application of this system significantly improves the accuracy and resolution of the drilling process description reducing data management effort. The objective categorization of process information is a key enabler for benchmarking specifically when identifying hidden lost time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the early 1970s, the notions of space and place have been located on the two sides of a barricade that divides what has been described as science's two great cultures. Space is located among the ‘hard’ sciences as a central term in the attempt of geography to transform the discipline from a descriptive into a quantitative, analytic, and thus scientific, enterprise. Place, on the other hand, is located among the ‘soft’ humanities and social philosophy oriented social sciences as an important notion in the post-1970 attempt to transform geography from a positivistic into a humanistic, structuralist, hermeneutic, critical science. More recently, the place-oriented geographies have adopted postmodern, poststructuralist, and deconstruction approaches, while the quantitative spatial geographies have been strongly influenced by theories of self-organization and complexity. In this paper I first point to, and then explore, structural similarities between complexity theories and theories oriented toward social philosophy. I then elaborate the thesis that, in consequence, complexity theories have the potential to bridge the geographies of space and place and, by implication, the two cultures of science. Finally, discuss in some detail conceptual and methodological implications. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Making existing cities and new urban development more ecologically based and liveable is an urgent priority in the global push for sustainability. This paper discusses ten critical responses to this issue and summarizes them in a simple conceptual model that places the nexus between transport and urban form at the heart of developing an eco-city. This involves compact, mixed-use urban form, well-defined higher-density, human-oriented centres, priority to the development of superior public transport systems and conditions for non-motorized modes, with minimal road capacity increases, and protection of the city's natural areas and food-producing capacity. These factors form the framework in which everything else is embedded and must operate, and if they are not addressed only marginal changes in urban sustainability can be made. Within this framework, environmental technologies need to be extensively applied. Economic growth needs to emphasize creativity and innovation and to strengthen the environmental, social and cultural amenities of the city. The public realm throughout the city needs to be of a high quality, and sustainable urban design principles need to be applied in all urban development. All these dimensions need to operate within two key processes involving vision-oriented and reformist thinking and a strong, community-oriented, democratic sustainability framework for decision-making. </jats:p>",

The main challenge is to deal with 3D collision avoidance while preserving the believability of the agent's behaviors. To accomplish the coordinated task, a geometric and kinematic decoupling of the system is proposed. This decomposition enables us to plan a collision-free path for a reduced system, then to animate locomotion and grasping behaviors independently, and finally to automatically tune the animation to avoid residual collisions. These three steps are applied consecutively to synthesize an animation. The different techniques used, such as probabilistic path planning, locomotion controllers, inverse kinematics and path planning for closed kinematic chains are explained, and the way to integrate them into a single scheme is described.</jats:p>",

Rapid urbanization and the backlog in constructing needed environmental infrastructure have resulted in severe environmental issues for many peri-urban towns, affecting their sustainable development. In Xiamen, a coastal city, town-level environmental planning was proposed in 2003 as an important tool to control pollution and conserve ecosystems. But for environmental planning to work, it needs to be more adaptable to local circumstances and decision-making processes. This paper presents a framework for adaptive environmental management and discusses how it was implemented in Dongfu Town, one of the peri-urban towns around Xiamen. It describes the principles of adaptive peri-urban town environmental planning and how this process integrates information from multiple sources and different stakeholders. This experience shows how science can be integrated into the decision-making process, avoiding both the narrow-minded viewpoints of planners and the natural resource use conflicts among a variety of stakeholders. It also shows how the environmental planning process can propose results that are acceptable to local communities and decision makers, even when they suggest directions that were not in accordance with the public's initial priorities. Finally, it shows that sustainable development of targeted areas can be achieved through well-designed environmental planning. </jats:p>",

Maintaining critical foraging and breeding habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) requires an uninterrupted supply of old-growth forest. We constructed and optimized a dynamic forest growth model for the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (Georgia, USA) with the objective of perpetuating a maximum stream of old-growth forest habitat. Our model accommodates stochastic disturbances and hardwood succession rates, and uncertainty about model structure. We produced a regeneration policy that was indexed by current forest state and by current weight of evidence among alternative model forms. We used adaptive stochastic dynamic programming, which anticipates that model probabilities, as well as forest states, may change through time, with consequent evolution of the optimal decision for any given forest state. In light of considerable uncertainty about forest dynamics, we analyzed a set of competing models incorporating extreme, but plausible, parameter values. Under any of these models, forest silviculture practices currently recommended for the creation of woodpecker habitat are suboptimal. We endorse fully adaptive approaches to the management of endangered species habitats in which predictive modeling, monitoring, and assessment are tightly linked.</jats:p>",

In answering these questions, we argue that, although complexity offers much to the study of place and space, research in these areas has a number of strengths that enhance complexity research. </jats:p>",

Power-law distributions of advancing deforestation are found, which are indicative of possible complexity. Alternative approaches in self-organized complexity, including self-organized percolation and the inverse-cascade model, and an approach to complexity involving optimization—highly optimized tolerance—are considered.

Real-time downhole pressure data and surface flow rate information can provide a significant set of calibration information early in the life of the reservoir.

Based on a comparison of downhole pressure data, with data from simulation models, the operator concluded that a connected aquifer was present and estimated its size. This information was sufficient for the operator to know that the well would not be needed as a water injector and to justify a sidetrack from the downdip location to an updip location.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>When the updip sidetrack well was drilled, reservoir rock quality was below the minimum for a commercial completion. This brought into question the viability of any hydrocarbon storage capacity in the northern portion of the field. As soon as the updip sidetrack well was logged, a \"what-if\" reservoir model was run to simulate a no-hydrocarbon-reservoir scenario in the northern portion of the field. This reduction represented approximately 25% of the reservoir hydrocarbon pore volume. The model results clearly indicated that this was not a reasonable model and gave the operator confidence to sidetrack the well directly to the west, to a slightly downstructure position, whereby a successful completion was made. Without this \"quick-response reservoir model\" the well may have been sidetracked to the south, resulting in a less-than-optimal well location.</jats:p>",

This article reviews the choices about artificial nutrition and hydration that are possible using conventional advance directives such as the living will, the instructional directive, values histories, and combination directives. It summarizes the legal basis for such documents. It also describes the ways that physicians' orders to limit treatment can help implement decisions about the use of artificial nutrition and hydration.

Such an approach has been questioned on both methodological and empirical grounds. Furthermore, in applications to smaller populations, conventional population projections have repeatedly yielded poor results. The simultaneous projection of population and households, on the other hand, regards households as population units of reference, but, in applications based on the notion of the household composition matrix, it has occasionally yielded analytically infeasible results. In the present study I examine the simultaneous projection of population and households in a etropolitan area, under feasibility constraints. A housing-market specification is expressed as a feasibility condition against multipliers of the household composition matrix, extracted here for the Cleveland Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), 1990. The feasibility condition is shown to function as a gateway to exogenous considerations regarding the transfer of headship in households, and is exemplified in a forecast of population and households for the Cleveland CMSA. </jats:p>",

It illustrates how residents experience their living conditions as being reduced by heavy car traffic, and how they oppose the multidimensional side effects caused by traffic overload. To increase the welfare of everyday life, urban policies thus ought to focus much more on the spatial distribution of mobility and the ways that mobility influences place-bound living conditions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most theorists understand gender geographies as highly differentiated and shifting, in terms of both time and space. If gender is historically and geographically contingent then the analysis of gender should be attentive to the particular conditions that materialize the very idea of gender, giving it the appearance of being fixed and natural. The physical landscape, or waterscape in the case of southeastern Turkey, is potentially central to the ways that gender is invoked and lived in particular settings, with important effects. Using case-study work on irrigation-related changes in southeastern Turkey, I consider gender in relation to livelihoods and work practices, landholdings, and ethnicity revealing that, in addition to conditioning differential outcomes for residents of the plain, these categories of social difference are themselves fundamentally renegotiated and recast in relation to waterscape change. I argue that explicit consideration of environmental conditions and practices is central to understanding the operation of gender in certain contexts, as well as to understanding the lived experiences of women and men, providing insights for gender theory and politics. </jats:p>",

Despite their popularity, choosing which of the many multicriteria methods to use is tricky. Different methods may yield different results and therefore the decision may depend on the method selected. In this paper we review a number of experiments conducted to compare the results of different MCA methods when applied to the same decision problem. I compare and critically examine the hypotheses postulated and the results obtained from these experiments. Despite the equivocal results yielded in some experiments, many authors recommend applying two or more MCA methods, especially in the case of unstructured decision problems. This multimethod MCA application may be regarded as a type of validation which is more extensive than standard sensitivity analysis and which enables the decisionmaker to review the preferences and judgments previously elicited by a single method. </jats:p>",

The three algorithms include: An improved point‐in‐polygon algorithm, incremental voxel ray tracing algorithm, and stereographic projection of beamlets for voxel truncation. The point‐in‐polygon and incremental voxel ray‐tracing algorithms have been used in computer graphics and nuclear medicine applications while the stereographic projection algorithm was developed by our group. These algorithms demonstrate significant improvements over the current standard algorithms in peer reviewed literature, i.e., the polygon and voxel ray‐tracing algorithms of Siddon for voxel classification (point‐in‐polygon testing) and dose computation, respectively, and radius testing for voxel truncation. The presented polygon ray‐tracing technique was tested on 10 intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning cases that required the classification of between 0.58 and 2.0 million voxels on a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9712-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp9712:mp9712-math-0001\" /> isotropic dose grid into 1–4 targets and 5–14 structures represented as extruded polygons (a.k.a. Siddon prisms). Incremental voxel ray tracing and voxel truncation employing virtual stereographic projection was tested on the same IMRT treatment planning cases where voxel dose was required for 230–2400 beamlets using a finite‐size pencil‐beam algorithm. Between a 100 and 360 fold cpu time improvement over Siddon's method was observed for the polygon ray‐tracing algorithm to perform classification of voxels for target and structure membership. Between a 2.6 and 3.1 fold reduction in cpu time over current algorithms was found for the implementation of incremental ray tracing. Additionally, voxel truncation via stereographic projection was observed to be 11–25 times faster than the radial‐testing beamlet extent approach and was further improved 1.7–2.0 fold through point‐classification using the method of translation over the cross product technique.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider the problem of radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. During radiation therapy, beams of radiation pass through a patient, killing both cancerous and normal cells. Thus, the radiation therapy must be carefully planned so that a clinically prescribed dose is delivered to targets containing cancerous cells, while nearby organs and tissues are spared. Currently, a technique called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer. In IMRT, the patient is irradiated from several beams, each of which is decomposed into hundreds of small beamlets, the intensities of which can be controlled individually. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a treatment plan for IMRT when the orientations of the beams are given. We propose a new model that has the potential to achieve most of the goals with respect to the quality of a treatment plan that have been considered to date. However, in contrast with established mixed-integer and nonlinear programming formulations, we do so while retaining linearity of the optimization problem, which substantially improves the tractability of the optimization problem. Furthermore, we discuss how several additional quality and practical aspects of the problem that have been ignored to date can be incorporated into our linear model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on clinical data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The distribution of public investment within federal states is often subject to significant political discretion. Yet one of the possible consequences of such discretion is the appearance of path dependency in the way in which public investment is distributed. Mexico offers a unique example of the effect of path dependency in resource allocation, as there has been no political competition over more than seventy years. The authors seek to examine the dynamic structure of the regional distribution of public investment empirically, to test for the existence of path dependency and the influence of the different federal governments in Mexico. They use time-series intervention analysis methodology to study the structure of, and the influence of government change in the allocation of, public investment in Mexico between 1971 and 1999. Findings suggest the existence of path dependency in the distribution of public investment in Mexico during all except for the most recent governments. In other words, federal government change made little difference to the way in which public investment was allocated. Path dependency was only broken in the 1990s, coinciding with the setting up of the North American economic integration process, which in turn led to the loss of public support for the single political party, the Partido Revolitcionario Institucional or PRI, which had been in power in Mexico over the last seventy years. </jats:p>",

It is demonstrated that urban techniques can be used for incorporating spatial competition effects into such models in novel ways, and that the complex dynamics can then be effectively interpreted. Urban systems have contributed significantly to complexity theory in the past—because they are complicated enough to be interesting but simple enough to be solvable. These insights can now be transferred to complex (spatial) ecosystems. The possibility of joint eco-urban models is explored. </jats:p>",

By means of a proposed dynamic space–time empirical model, the competition structure within a multiregional economic system is developed. Cointegration and error-correction modeling techniques are used to support the existence of this competition structure over both the short and long term. As an application, we show the dynamic effects on the evolution of the regional performance of Spanish regions over the period 1972–2000. Our results indicate that some macroeconomic forces are operating through time on this Spanish system because positive and negative effects are detected both at economy-wide and at neighborhood levels. Further, the findings show that a new taxonomy of the Spanish regions could provide some guidance for the development of appropriate measures for regional economic policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Integrated assessment of decisions under uncertainty for sustainable development (IANUS) is a method for aiding public decisionmaking that supports efforts towards sustainable development and has a wide range of applications. We introduce the main features of IANUS and illustrate the method by using the results of a case study in the Torgau region (eastern Germany) with conflicts over economic development and groundwater protection in the Elbe River basin. IANUS structures the decision process into four steps: scenario derivation, criteria selection, modelling, and evaluation. Its overall aim is to support the finding of policy solutions in a participatory setting and to extract the information needed for a sound, responsible decision in a clear, transparent manner. The method is designed for use in conflict situations where environmental and socioeconomic effects need to be considered and so an interdisciplinary approach is required. Special emphasis is placed on a broad perception and consideration of uncertainty. Three types of uncertainty are explicitly taken into account by IANUS: development uncertainty (uncertainty about the social, economic and other developments that affect the consequences of decision), model uncertainty (uncertainty associated with the prediction of the effects of decisions), and weight uncertainty (uncertainty about the appropriate weighting of the criteria). The backbone of IANUS is a multicriteria method with the ability to process uncertain information. In the case study the multicriteria method PROMETHEE is used. As PROMETHEE in its basic versions is not able to process uncertain information an extension of this method is developed here and described in detail. One methodological lesson to be learned from the experience of the case study reads that the design of the participation process must be planned and executed carefully to prevent important stakeholders backing out of the participatory evaluation process—as happened with the decisionmakers in the Torgau case study. </jats:p>",

These principles attempt to minimize organizational conflict by ensuring that partnership leaders delineate joint work purposes and expectations, form collaborative work processes, clarify respective financial and logistical obligations, and specify decision responsibilities and job duties. These principles call for development of internal structures and processes that identify potential conflict points and establish measures for resolution when conflicts arise.

Both countries have seen a shift towards policy discourses that stress ‘participatory’ approaches to NRM, and a search for legitimate and authentic cultural institutions at a local level that can act as a vehicle for implementation of this new policy approach. Yet, engagement with a range of local institutions has often conflated terms such as ‘indigenous’ and ‘traditional’ with ‘local’, ‘community’, and ‘communal’, missing contestation over their social and cultural authenticity and making mistaken assumptions about the rootedness of institutions in geographical space. Examples of forest management initiatives in Manica Province, Mozambique, and land and water management in Borana, southern Ethiopia, are contrasted to consider the differences and similarities in the nature and outcomes of such external interventions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a multilimbed robot in order to “free-climb” vertical rock surfaces. Freeclimbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might have future consequences. In this paper, this process of reasoning is broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a freeclimbing robot's configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact between the robot and its environment. A multistep planning framework is presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called LEMUR (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at NASA–JPL). Using the planner presented in this paper, LEMUR free-climbed an indoor, near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features. </jats:p>",

He engages with James Mitchell's application of Ted Lowi's seminal analysis of ‘policy types’ to Scottish devolution. These concepts are used to frame a case study of Welsh early childhood education and care (ECEC), demonstrating extensive innovation in Wales concerning the form of ECEC and its impact on compulsory schooling. However, there is some evidence that innovation in the form of ECEC has not been matched by sufficient increases in spending. Although echoing Mitchell's account of the fiscal limits to devolution, the author suggests a greater scope for policy innovation than Mitchell detects. The discrepancy suggests that there is room for refinement of the ‘policy-types’ framework, to draw attention to ‘regulatory’ aspects of public service provision; it may also hint that, although formally weaker, the WAG has more potential for policy innovation than the Scottish Executive. </jats:p>",

Various metaphors, analogies, conflations, and externalisations shaped notions of soil productivity, the producing subject, and the nature of soils. Their legitimacy and justification emerged from the evolving interplay of rural processes, the economic policies of succeeding regimes, and capitalist world-system dynamics. The results of the study suggest that physical scientists have actively promoted regime ideologies, that gendered scientific constructs need not be grounded in dualistic syllogisms, and that industrialised state-socialist scientific practices largely conformed to bourgeois principles. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In many countries the provision of hospital services has changed from a cottage industry with many small operators to an industry in which large corporate chains are now starting to predominate. Transnational corporations have increasingly invested in the provision of hospital services when traditional areas of investment have become no longer attractive. Although corporate involvement in the provision of hospital services has become an issue of considerable significance in recent years, geographers have paid little attention to such trends. Within Australia, changes in access to capital and shifts in investment, the role of the state regulatory environment, and, to a lesser extent, the emergence of corporate managerialism are the key factors underpinning corporate transformation. A case study of Mayne Health Ltd, formerly the largest corporate provider of hospital care, is used to illustrate such trends. The corporate transformation has been geographically uneven at both the state and local levels and reflects local variation especially in state regulatory environments and the extent to which corporate providers have entered into new public–private partnerships at the local level. We suggest that the implications of such trends are far from clear and that more research is needed on this fundamental restructuring of hospital services. </jats:p>",

Phase II trials are also to explore appropriate primary efficacy endpoint(s) or patient populations. When the biology of the disease and pathogenesis of disease progression are well understood, the phase II and phase III studies may be performed in the same patient population with the same primary endpoint, e.g. efficacy measured by HbA1c in non‐insulin dependent diabetes mellitus trials with treatment duration of at least three months. In the disease areas that molecular pathways are not well established or the clinical outcome endpoint may not be observed in a short‐term study, e.g. mortality in cancer or AIDS trials, the treatment effect may be postulated through use of intermediate surrogate endpoint in phase II trials. However, in many cases, we generally explore the appropriate clinical endpoint in the phase II trials. An important question is how much of the effect observed in the surrogate endpoint in the phase II study can be translated into the clinical effect in the phase III trial. Another question is how much of the uncertainty remains in phase III trials. In this work, we study the utility of adaptation by design (not by statistical test) in the sense of adapting the phase II information for planning the phase III trials. That is, we investigate the impact of using various phase II effect size estimates on the sample size planning for phase III trials. In general, if the point estimate of the phase II trial is used for planning, it is advisable to size the phase III trial by choosing a smaller alpha level or a higher power level. The adaptation via using the lower limit of the one standard deviation confidence interval from the phase II trial appears to be a reasonable choice since it balances well between the empirical power of the launched trials and the proportion of trials not launched if a threshold lower than the true effect size of phase III trial can be chosen for determining whether the phase III trial is to be launched.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Researchers are divided on the trends and causes of internal migration in postsocialist Central and Eastern Europe. Theories run in opposite directions: some scholars argue that increasing similarities with Western market economies are explaining the migration processes, whereas others claim that specific developments during the postsocialist socioeconomic restructuring are playing a major role. In this paper we contribute to the existing discussion by providing an analysis of personal and contextual determinants of migration to urban and rural destinations in post-Soviet Estonia. We base our study on the data of the Estonian Labour Force Survey from 1995. Our research population consists of 8480 people aged 15 years to 68 years in early 1989. We analyze the intensity of urban-bound and rural-bound migration from January 1989 to December 1994, using the techniques of multilevel event-history analysis. We show that personal characteristics (age, marital status, employment status, education, and ethnicity) and contextual factors (unemployment level and the share of ethnic minorities) are both important in shaping the intensity of migration to urban and rural destinations in post-Soviet Estonia. Although the differences in migration behaviour by demographic characteristics in Estonia are in line with universalistic explanations, the regionally varying effect of socioeconomic status on migration is specific to developments in postsocialist countries, as a result of general economic hardship during the socioeconomic transition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is a predictor of radiobiological effect for organs at risk (OAR). The calculation of the NTCP is based on the dose‐volume‐histogram (DVH) which is generated by the treatment planning system after calculation of the 3D dose distribution. Including the NTCP in the objective function for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan optimization would make the planning more effective in reducing the postradiation effects. However, doing so would lengthen the total planning time. The purpose of this work is to establish a method for NTCP determination, independent of a DVH calculation, as a quality assurance check and also as a mean of improving the treatment planning efficiency. In the study, the CTs of ten randomly selected prostate patients were used.

The results show that there are statistically significant differences in the dynamics of low pay across urban and rural labour markets, particularly in terms of exits to higher pay and out of the labour force. After controlling for different personal and job characteristics across markets, urban low-pay durations are somewhat shorter on average, with a higher probability of movement to a higher-paid job. The results suggest that any urban–rural differences in the typical low-pay experience are concentrated among certain types of individuals, such as young workers and women without qualifications. </jats:p>",

Planning and providing end‐of‐life (EOL) care in rural areas presents some unique challenges. <jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> In order to understand these challenges, and other important issues or circumstances, a literature search was conducted to assess the state of science on rural EOL care. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The following databases were searched for articles published from 1988 through 2003: EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, AHMED, Psychinfo, ERIC, HealthStar, Sociological Abstracts, and Cochrane. All articles were systematically reviewed. <jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> Thirty‐six research articles were identified. Only 1 randomized controlled trial was located. Most research was single site, small sample, and exploratory/descriptive in design. Four distinct foci in this body of research were noted: (1) identifying and describing differences between urban and rural EOL care; (2) exploring rural EOL care; (3) assessing the EOL needs and wishes of terminally ill or dying persons, their family members, and health care professionals in rural areas; and (4) exploring EOL education for rural EOL care providers. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Although rural EOL care research is not extensive, the existing literature is helpful for realizing the importance of EOL care in rural communities, as well as for conceptualizing and planning EOL care in rural communities. One of the chief considerations for rural EOL care is that dying at home is a common wish, with home‐based nursing care a key factor for this to become a reality. Another chief consideration is ensuring all rural health care professionals are both prepared for and supported while delivering EOL care.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

In this paper, a hybrid implantation approach is presented in which additional angulated needles can be used to avoid PAI. This approach can be applied in prostate brachytherapy using a robotic assisted device. To examine the feasibility of this approach, volume data from three prostate seed implant patients were selected, which represent small, medium, and large prostates. As the blocking area was artificially increased simulating pubic arch overlap, the dosimetry outcomes and ratio of number of angulated needles to the total number of needles were analyzed. The hybrid dosimetry broke down when blocking is over 42%. As the percent of blocking increased, the ratio of the number of angulated needles to the total number of needles increased, while the dosimetry outcomes only had a slight trend of worsening. When close to the breakdown point, the dosimetry outcomes worsen drastically. Therefore, for moderate PAI the hybrid dosimetry is feasible.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the results and conclusions from an extensive response planning project in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Oil spill response for the operation was planned by a group comprising the operator, the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies, the Norwegian Coastal Authority, regional oil spill response groups and consultants. Drawing on these resources, the contents of the oil spill response plan were defined, as well as the need for training.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>From the findings of this group, field surveys were made, identifying sensitive areas, access points and bays suited for oil containment. A baseline environmental survey was made to ascertain the current status of the environment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Information from these surveys were integrated with national geographic databases on topography, bathymetry and shoreline sensitivity, and access to the integrated system is provided to all parts of the response organization through an Internet Map Server Interface.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The oil spill response plan is primarily web-based, and provides access to information on personnel, equipment, vessels, methods, training, exercises and organization. Also included are checklists for all functions, as well as standard forms for all relevant actions, from notification to shoreline cleanup operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In our experience, the combination of local knowledge and technical skills provided the basis for proper response planning. Georeferenced photos are essential in discussions of response options, and internet based response maps are an efficient way for different parties to get familiar with detailed response issues. Sharing information is required for proper functioning of oil spill response operations, and dealing with it in this manner has been a positive experience for the parties involved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Unlike computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) systems which have been used in industry for a long time, computer aided process planning (CAPP) systems are yet to be transferred from research laboratories to industry. Aircraft industries are trying to improve their performance by developing CAPP software, and the present study contributes to this effort. Aircraft parts are specific mainly because of their complex geometry, which generates many accessibility problems, and their thin shells, which generate machining deformation and vibration problems. New CAPP approaches have been specified and developed for aircraft structural parts. Machining features are defined as machining faces. The part is split up into a set of machining faces with accessibility, adjacency, and rigidity properties. New set-up strategies are defined. These highlight three particular features in the machining of such parts: the categorization, which is a strict guide as to how the part should be machined; the best-fit blank orientation relative to the part; and the potential machining directions of the part which are the main elements for decision making. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Spinal deformities are a common feature of Marfan’s syndrome and can be a significant cause of morbidity. The morphology of the scoliosis associated with this condition was previously described by Sponseller, but no correlation with the pelvic parameters has been seen. We performed a retrospective radiological study of 58 patients with scoliosis, secondary to Marfan’s syndrome and related the findings in the thoracolumbar spine to the pelvic parameters, including pelvic version (tilt), pelvic incidence and sacral slope. Our results showed marked abnormalities in the pelvic values compared with those found in the unaffected population, with increased retroversion of the pelvis in particular. In addition we found a close correlation between the different patterns of pelvic parameters and scoliosis morphology. We found that pelvic abnormalities may partially dictate the spinal disorders seen in Marfan’s syndrome. Our results supplement the well-established Sponseller classification, as well as stressing the importance of considering the orientation of the pelvis when planning surgery. </jats:p>",
