It is based on work that began in 1976 at the Architectural Research Laboratory of the University of Michigan. This effort, which was the work of many individuals, had as its goal the construction of an integrated computer-aided building design system. Many of these ideas have been implemented in a working experimental modeling system, ARCH:MODEL. From a series of both practical and theoretical experiences using and building this system several difficult questions have come up that need research attention. Among these are: how can a design database be made consistent and how can consistency, both spatial and nonspatial, be maintained as the design develops? These questions are related to the general problem of what is the relationship between the design process and the designed object. It is not the intent of this paper to provide answers to these problems but to argue for their importance and to provide some direction for research. </jats:p>",

The use of these systems relies on manual decomposition of complex problems into more limited, well-defined ones and the subsequent recomposition of the solutions into comprehensive ones. In this paper a formal representation is developed for the process of problem structuring to enable decomposition and recomposition of architectural problems. This consists of a heuristic method for manipulating the parameters of a general purpose generate-and-test mechanism which is capable of solving well-defined problems. </jats:p>",

Orthogonal structures are introduced to represent these arrangements and the conditions of well-formedness for these structures are established. A grammar to enumerate orthogonal structures is presented and it is suggested that best use is made of the grammar if it is incorporated into a generative expert system, able to serve as a vehicle to discover, encode, and utilize a broad range of constraints and criteria in the generation of layout alternatives. </jats:p>",

A retrospective glance will show that this is an old problem and not a new phenomenon. The Nordic Sami Institute has carried out a research project with the following objectives: 1.to give an account of the terms of planning for the reindeer husbandry, 2.to find out how the S&amp;aring;mi (Lapp) community's and so the reindeer husbandry's interests are taken into account in local planning. 3.find ways for how the reindeer husbandry's use of land can be described. 4.give suggestions as to how the interests of the Sami community can better be taken into account or how it can increase its influence in relation to planning. The suggestions based upon the results from the research project are: &amp;mdash;that the Sami community aquire competence by preparing itself for the changes in its environment. &amp;mdash;that it builds up its own organization. &amp;mdash;that it aquires a more noticeable influence in community planning and decision making.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A small firm, like Key Pharmaceuticals, pioneers niche businesses by developing novel ways of delivering medicine to a patient's bloodstream—for example, nitroglycerine absorbed through adhesive pads on cardiac patients' chests. Key Pharmaceuticals is viewed as an ally by the large pharmaceutical firms as long as it stays out of their drug discovery businesses. • A small company refuses to abandon loyal customers when other firms stop producing products that face declining demand. For example, Beaunit makes cupramonium‐process rayon, which is needed by the small casket‐velvets market; enterprising electronic component distributors buy out inventories of obsolete vacuum tubes to supply a few good customers who don't want to retire their equipment before it wears out. Neither firm is challenged in its market niche because competitors don't consider the rewards worth the effort. • The “new company on the block” demonstrates its credibility by investing aggressively in a pioneering idea—as Archer‐Daniels‐Midland did with high fructose corn syrup in the maturing corn wet milling industry. The gamble succeeds because its larger rivals ignore its activities—perhaps because they don't consider the pioneer a threat; or because they believe that they can easily copy the pioneer's successes; or they're busy with more important battles in other markets.</jats:p>",

Technostress is conceptualized as a dynamic state of adaptation, thus requiring strategic choices, such as technology strategy, focussing not only on the parameters of hardware but also of the motivations, skills and incentives of the people utilizing the information in their work. A number of research hypotheses are proposed as examples of potential research in the area of organizational technology strategy.</jats:p>",

Not only is access to consumption locations structured by factors such as household composition, life cycle, and the use of state power, as well as by class location, but consumption may also generate its own independent effects on the distribution of life chances, Furthermore, the cultural significance of consumption location is underemphasised by both writers, The public–private division is not simply ideologically constituted, as Dunleavy suggests, but reflects real and important variations in people's capacity to exert control and autonomy in crucial areas of their everyday lives, The division now opening up between private-sector and public-sector consumers thus has real and far-reaching economic and cultural foundations. </jats:p>",

However, it is also a model with significant limiting assumptions that have not been adequately taken into account when it has been used. In this paper the problems and limitations imposed on the model by the assumptions it contains are outlined. Six broad aspects of the model are addressed: the ambiguity of the enterprise context implied in the model; its treatment of the processes of invention and innovation; its simplification of the nature of products; assumptions about scale, labour, and relocation to less developed countries; location-specific advantages; and the relationship of the model to other cycles operating within the business environment. The limitations of the product-cycle model, as it is used in geography, are attributed to the inadequate conceptualisation of the firm, that still persists in the discipline. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper investigates the principal architectural considerations that governed the evolution of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, the three British colonial port cities of India, and seeks to answer the question of whether and to what extent these cities were planned. The extreme view in this debate on planning is taken by Sten Nilsson in his European Architecture in India, where he claims that the cities were based on strict symmetrical grid planning and were inspired by the Renaissance urban ideal, unlike traditional \"organic\" Indian cities. The paper questions this in view of the clear evidence that the British East India Company, unlike the French, was hostile to any ambitious urban planning on the part of the settlements. The hypothesis is further strengthened when one analyzes the ground plans of these cities, which show that defense considerations discouraged any symmetrical central planning, even though the streets were laid out in straight lines. In the absence of a central planning code, like the Royal Ordinance of 1573 for Spanish colonies, the building projects proceeded from the growing urban requirements of these settlements. The projects themselves were modest and defense naturally dominated building activities, mainly because these tiny enclaves were surrounded by hostile local and European powers. The growing needs of the inhabitants could not be neglected, however, and churches and hospitals came next in order of priority. The governors' mansions, on the other hand, had a position of peculiar importance in these port cities as they were meant to be a clear and visible symbol of authority. Not least interesting in these conurbations was the confluence of two traditions, Western and Eastern, though it must be added that the predominant style tended to be European, and mostly contemporary Tuscan. The conclusion reached is that while there was hardly any grandiose, symmetrical, total planning in these port cities, the city fathers did not neglect to make them habitable and even pleasant by developing gardens and parks in them.</jats:p>",

It first describes three stages in an organization's development of a succession system which promotes the attainment of a firm's objectives: 1) oneposition staffing, 2) replacement planning, and 3) succession planning. Then we examine the other piece to be connected to succession planning: executive learning. It is argued that most planned executive development is aimed at task learning, not personal learning. Consistent with this condition, most executive education activities overstress classroomstyle receptive methods, while neglecting active learning. Reasons for this state of affairs are proposed. The paper concludes with recommendations for enhancing personal learning for executives and for better integrating this learning with the strategic succession planning of the organization. This sort of strategic approach to executive succession is seen as the “acid test” in a firm's strategic planning process.</jats:p>",

Women in these four samples planning home births were compared as to whether they were doing so primarily for financial reasons. Women planning home births for financial reasons were much less likely to report having health insurance or welfare benefits or to be receiving prenatal care than those planning home births for nonfinancial reasons. Women planning home births for financial reasons were more likely to be receiving prenatal care from a county clinic or private physician and planned to have a private physician or one‐time‐only birth attendant for delivery. By contrast, the nonfinancially motivated group was more likely to be receiving prenatal and intrapartum care from a lay midwife, naturopath. or chiropractor.

Multiple objective programming (MOP) methods have been applied to this problem, but public forests have multiple users whose relative preferences for forest products often cannot be determined, so preference-based goal programming and multiobjective linear programming solutions may be inaccurate or inflexible. The use of noninferior set generating algorithms to solve MOP's encourages more flexible planning by providing a range of possible solutions (the noninferior set), but requires or generates too much information. The NISE (noninferior set estimation) method is an MOP solution technique that uses repeated linear program (LP) solutions to generate an estimate of the true noninferior set, with a known error. The method provides explicit tradeoffs between objectives and requires little interaction with forest users. The NISE method is illustrated for a problem of forest management in Tanzania, and its applicability to centralized forest planning in the United States and developing countries is discussed in the light of legal, political, and institutional constraints.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In 1981, the Labour Minister for Health in a coalition government, Mrs Eileen Desmond, set up a study group ‘to examine the main components, both institutional and community, of the psychiatric services; to assess the existing services, to clarify their objectives and to draw up planning guidelines for future development of the service with due regard to cost implications; to carry out such studies and to take part in such consultations as are necessary to assist this examination’. The result appeared in December 1984 in the form of a report <jats:italic>The Psychiatric Services: Planning for the Future.</jats:italic> The text of the response of the Irish Division of the College, reproduced in full here, was sent to the current Minister for Health, Mr Barry Desmond, (also a Labour Minister in a coalition government) in October 1985. Meanwhile, in February 1986, Mr Desmond caused widespread alarm in political circles by the sudden announcement of the closure of two of the 22 psychiatric hospitals in the Republic without prior provision of alternative community services. British readers will detect a close parallel between this Irish report and the series of DHSS reports exemplified by <jats:italic>Better Services for the Mentally Ill</jats:italic> (HMSO, 1975). Perhaps the only significant difference between these two reports is that sectorisation (a mental health team headed by a psychiatrist and assigned to a ‘sector’ of 25,000 to 30,000 persons) is advocated rather more firmly in <jats:italic>Planning for the Future.</jats:italic> It is also worth remembering that the Republic of Ireland, in its population size and urban-rural distribution is comparable to the whole of Yorkshire. Half the population lives in Dublin. Elsewhere, psychiatric services must cope with widely scattered rural populations, with a minority only of working adults. There is a large private sector in Irish medicine and 20% of psychiatric admissions are to one or other of five private psychiatric hospitals. Despite these social differences from the UK, several comparative studies have shown a remarkable similarity in declared attitudes and practice amongst Irish compared with British psychiatrists. Finally, the method of remuneration of Irish family doctors differs from the UK: Irish GP's are paid, not on a capitation basis, but on a ‘fee-per-item-of-service’ basis with a majority of the population availing of this service free: patients tend to move from doctor to doctor and many use private health insurance to opt for private care. Psychiatric referral rates from general practice are low as in Britain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Italian local authorities share with those of other European countries a considerable degree of fragmentation. In addition, they suffer from the well-known North-South differential in economic conditions. On top of this, their management has long been split between the left-wing (mainly Communist) and the conservative (mainly Christian Democrat) political philosophy. This has rendered their performances and behaviour quite heterogeneous and has complicated the task of securing an equitable system of central-local financial relationships. For decades most of the southern authorities and the ‘red’ fraction of the centre-northern authorities have taken advantage of the possibility of borrowing for balancing the budget on the current account. This was a major loophole in the system until 1977. Bankruptcy was avoided ony through ‘entente’ between the Christian Democrats and the Communists in early 1978 (at the time of Mr Moro's murder), whereby all outstanding debt of local authorities was cancelled and transferred to the Central Government. In spite of an officially proclaimed ‘restraint’ there followed a period of real ‘Renaissance’ in local budgets, especially on the capital side. Borrowing—this time for capital expenditure—was again at the root of this development. Part of the deal was a revival of the ‘fiscal effort’ on the local side, making use of the few sources of own revenue left to local authorities after the fiscal reform of 1973–1974. Meanwhile, the ‘equalisation issue’ was raised with regard to the distribution of the general grant. Distribution criteria have been constantly changing since 1982. A completely new approach is now under consideration at the Ministry of Interior, based on the notion of ‘equal grant’ for ‘normal’ local authorities. Such an approach will eventually put aside the ‘past expenditure’ criterion which is still at the core of the grant distribution. While waiting for this reform, local authorities will almost certainly get a new local tax (‘tax for the financing of services’) starting in 1986. </jats:p>",

It is argued that temporal based scenic information is essential given the dynamic nature of forest management and planning. Temporal distributions of scenic beauty, which represent the level of scenic beauty at each year during the planning horizon, were simulated in order to evaluate the scenic impacts of proposed management actions. Four general loblolly pine stand management practices (unthinned natural, unthinned planted, lightly thinned planted, and heavily thinned planted) were compared with respect to their impacts on scenic beauty. Overall, natural stands were of highest scenic quality followed by unthinned planted and heavily thinned planted stands, which were not significantly different from one another. The lightly thinned stands were least scenic. These findings are consistent with results of past research. Also examined were the scenic impacts of management actions such as rotation age and initial density. In general, decreasing stand density increases scenic beauty, less productive sites have more scenic beauty, and increasing stand age increases scenic beauty. Information about initial stand conditions was found highly predictive of how scenic beauty temporal distributions perform over a 50-year horizon. It was concluded that the scenic beauty temporal distribution method provides managerially relevant information and has the potential to be a useful forest management decision-making tool.

In economic explanations the shift is attributed to the changing economic imperatives of capitalist economies in the new world recession, In ideological explanations it is argued that governments have tried to reestablish the predominance of market disciplines and allocation systems in social life, more indirectly responding to business pressure and fiscal strains. The economic approach does have a causal account of how these changes are translated into state policy via business pressure on governments undergoing monetary or fiscal crises. But neither approach can adequately explain how electorates are persuaded to convey functionally appropriate signals to governments in making their political choices, nor the apparently central, partially autonomous role played by political institutions in triggering major policy changes. By contrast, attention to the impact of state intervention in creating sectoral cleavages in consumption and production does offer a set of detailed causal mechanisms which would have the effect of rendering welfare state growth politically self-stabilizing. A brief theoretical model is provided of the main influences involved. </jats:p>",

In this system, solid models are built by performing set operations such as addition, subtraction, intersection between several primitives or solid models. Processing is made for a solid model represented by B‐rep (boundary representation). To ease the processing, curved faces such as spherical, cylindrical, or conical surfaces, are approximated by several flat planes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A one percent stratified random sample of all Dutch households (comprising 62 000 households) is used to examine mobility in the Dutch housing market. Two techniques, proportional reduction in uncertainty (PRU), and logit analysis are used to evaluate the relative contribution of independent variables in explaining mobility across the tenure types and by housing market regions. The PRU technique is used to select the best variables and to simplify the categories of those variables before logit analyses. Given a reduced set of variables and combinations of categories, logit models are utilized to provide parameter estimates of the contributions of the independent variables. The PRU technique shows that it is possible to make considerable simplifications in the combinations of categories for variables, and the logit models (for owners, public renters, and private renters) indicate distinct differences in the combinations of variables which are most appropriate in each of these sectors. In particular, the logit analysis shows that the relationship between age and mobility is almost linear, but between income and mobility it is curvilinear, and that evaluating interaction effects adds significantly to our understanding of the reason to move or to stay. The models show that it is necessary to treat the three tenure sectors separately, even though age, just as we expected, dominates all sectors in terms of its explanatory power. Although there are not large regional effects, the models change for different regions of the country. </jats:p>",

At present, changing retail conditions have brought the state, through the Act, into conflict with some sectors of the retail trade who often openly defy the law, The state is forced simultaneously to redefine its intervention within the market and to preserve its legitimacy as an independent law-making and law-enforcing body, The inertia of the state apparatus, coupled with the influence of certain fractions of retail capital who perceive major change in the law as being deleterious to their interests, has prevented legislative change, despite numerous attempts at repeal and reform. The problem is aggravated by the contradictions involved between the preservation of the concept of the ‘rule of law’ and the moral ambivalence felt by consumers, retailers, and enforcement agents toward the law itself. </jats:p>",

Various families of indifference curves indicating preferences between expenditure and local tax rate increases have been tested for consistency with the actual spending decisions of the authorities, and evidence found to support such a model.

In this Focus we examine how this development has occurred and consider its implications. We conclude that the recent figures represent a temporary deterioration in the costs of manufacturing industry and that, once output picks up again and as long as wages respond to the current low rate of inflation, there should be no severe adverse consequences on either inflation or output. If, however, costs are not controlled then the outlook for either inflation or output and unemployment is worse than our central forecast suggests.</jats:p>",

The Government has restricted grant aid to local authorities in an attempt to secure restraint in the expenditure of these authorities, but (until recently) local authorities have had the opportunity to make good any loss in grant income by increasing local taxes. A central issue is, then, how much restraint in local authority expenditure is secured by a given reduction in grant aid. Reduction in grant aid is measured in this paper in terms of its impact on the local tax rate (and the average local domestic tax bill) if a local authority is to maintain the real value of its spending. An incremental budgeting type model is developed and the empirical work is concerned with the financial years 1982–1983 and 1984–1985. It is found that in the later year local authorities have been less willing to reduce their expenditure in the face of loss of grant aid. It is also found that the response of the local authorities has become more political in the sense that a statistically significant difference has developed between the responses of Labour and those of non-Labour controlled councils. </jats:p>",

Gains in admission rates of minority students that have been made over the past decade have been eroded by their higher attrition rate. From a policy perspective, the most important issue is not merely why students drop out, but what can be done to prevent withdrawal.</jats:p><jats:p>This study examined programs and policies at four four‐year predominantly White institutions with good minority retention in an attempt to identify variables that enhance minority retention. The institutions studied were: Boston College, California State University‐Fresno, University of North Carolina‐Greensboro, and Purdue University. These schools varied in terms of institutional environment, including selectivity, size, and proportion of minorities on campus; rationale for developing minority retention efforts; grade level of students served by special programs; and scope and type of services. The differences we found across institutions demonstrate that retention efforts for minority students can be developed and carried out successfully in many different ways, at different types of institutions.</jats:p><jats:p>Although we found much diversity among the programs, we also found that there were certain common characteristics across programs–characteristics that appear to be elements of successful retention efforts. These characteristics are: the presence of a stated policy on minority enrollments; a high level of institutional commitment; a substantial degree of institutionalization of the program; comprehensiveness of services; dedicated staff; systematic collection of data, monitoring, and follow‐up; strong faculty support; and non‐stigmatization of participants.</jats:p><jats:p>From our study, we developed a general model that represents steps needed to formulate a retention program. The steps are: making a policy decision to enhance minority retention, conducting a needs assessment and developing a data base to examine minority enrollment patterns, implementing a program and monitoring and evaluating this program. This model emphasizes that retention efforts include all parts of the institution and constitute an ongoing process in which changes are made as needed.</jats:p><jats:p>We hope that other colleges and universities will view the programs described in this report as models from which to gain ideas for adaptation in their own settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a description and critical analysis of the nature and scope of policies concerning the employment and treatment of foreign workers and their families that have been pursued by the national governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Elements of a materialist theory of the state are drawn on to unravel the forces, interests, and conflicts which have shaped migration policies at different times in these countries. Emphasis is placed on the processes of transformation, whereby demands upon the state apparatus are translated into political and administrative action. Analysis reveals that a dominant trend throughout has been the pursuit of the economic goal of providing a low-cost flexible labour force. Confronted with human beings rather than economic units, concerns of integrating the migrant population and maintaining the nations' cultural integrity entered into play in the determination of policies; but essentially only as secondary goals. It is concluded that neither the overriding goal nor the ad hoc nature of migration policies will change in the near future. </jats:p>",

The case of the N.9 alpine freeway linking the Geneva Lake area to Northern Italy is presented. A fully new consultative approach of freeway project planning is considered essential in an environment of direct democracy and strong citizen participation. The study procedures are based on iterative sequences of analyses, participative multi-criteria evaluations and design improvements of alternatives generating a dynamic process to attain the broadest local and regional consensus.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">Diverses démarches méthodologiques ont été développées en Suisse pour répondre aux problèmes conflictuels posés par la réalisation des maillons manquants du réseau autoroutier national. La présente communication traite du cas de l'autoroute alpine n° 9 de liaison entre la Suisse romande et l'Italie. Elle présente une approche intégralement participative de planification autoroutière dont l'objectif essentiel est de favoriser la dynamique de recherche de solutions susceptibles de réunir le plus large consensus possible. L'élément moteur de la démarche est l'évaluation multicritère de variantes proposées et examinées par un groupe consultatif ad hoc réunissant les représentants des collectivités locales, régionales et cantonales ainsi que les «opposants».</jats:p>"
