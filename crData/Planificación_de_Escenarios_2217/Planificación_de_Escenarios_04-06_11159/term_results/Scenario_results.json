      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Environment Agency's 2001 national water resources strategy, Water resources for the future, provides a secure framework for the management of water that protects the long-term future of the water environment while encouraging sustainable development. Underpinning the strategy are a suite of scenario based forecasts developed to explore the impact of key drivers of demand within different sectors of water use across England and Wales. This paper explains the approach used to produce these forecasts, summarises how the individual components of demand were considered and highlights opportunities for future application and development of this approach. Using the premise that total water demand can mask conflicting trends between sectors, it is essential to consider each sector and its micro-components independently to understand the specific drivers of demand and consequently determine how these might best be managed. Four scenarios reflecting different possible futures of socio-economic and governmental structure were created to test “how”, “why” and “where” these water demands may change by 2025. Such an approach provides an opportunity to test the implications of macro drivers of demand, such as, economic growth and regulatory reform, on the micro-components of water use, linking disparate sectors to a common set of assumptions about the future.</jats:p>",

Information services/products of all kinds are being generated by various agencies in the government, public and private sectors and are emerging out into the Indian information marketplace. There are a number of abstracting journals, which, in a natural process of migration, are now available in dual formats – print as well as machine readable.

The study presented here has developed an innovative triple layer framework for analysis of wetland management. This approach provides support for spatial matching between physical planning, hydrological and ecological processes, and economic activities. The authors describe how integrated modelling at the regional scale can be achieved in practice. Following an introduction to wetlands, theoretical aspects of the contributing disciplines are discussed, as well as various aspects of integrated and spatial modelling. An applied integrated assessment of spatial wetland management for the Vecht area between Amsterdam and Utrecht is then presented. This assessment has resulted in a set of linked hydrological, ecological and economic models, formulated at the level of grids and polders, and various types of evaluations and rankings of scenarios. The results indicate the value of maintaining spatial detail for as long as possible.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Statistical downscaling models for precipitation in Scania, southern Sweden, have been developed and applied to calculate the changes in the future Scanian precipitation climate due to projected changes in the atmospheric composition. The models are based on multiple linear regression, linking large-scale predictors at monthly time resolution to regional statistics of daily precipitation on a monthly basis. To account for spatial precipitation variability within the area, the precipitation statistics were derived for different regions in Scania. The final downscaling models, developed for different regions and seasons, use atmospheric circulation, large-scale humidity and precipitation as predictors. Among the precipitation statistics examined, only the models for estimating the mean precipitation and the frequency of wet days were skilful. Based on the Canadian Global Circulation Model 1 (CGCM1), a future scenario of these two statistics was created. The downscaled scenario shows a significant increase of the annual mean precipitation by about 10% and a slight decrease in the frequency of wet days, indicating an increase in the precipitation amounts as well as in the precipitation intensity. The main increase of precipitation amounts and intensity occur during winter, while the summer precipitation amounts decrease slightly. The seasonal changes found in precipitation are likely attributed to changes in the westerly flow of the atmospheric circulation.</jats:p>",
