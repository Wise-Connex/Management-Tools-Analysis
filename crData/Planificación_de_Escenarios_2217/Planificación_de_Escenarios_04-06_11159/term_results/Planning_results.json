It examines the creation of a political space for food justice from three perspectives: first, food security from below—the projects and initiatives that serve as alternative practices and precedents for policy change; second, the ways in which agencies of the local state develop policy and change planning; and third, the emergence of food networks at local and regional scales. Food justice movements provide grounded case studies of resistance to globalization through delinking strategies, citizen planning in relation to Toronto’s official plan, and new forms of democratic practice. </jats:p>",

Two recent surveys illuminate the reasons for this neglect: they range from turf problems, to a lack of perception that any problem exists, to a lack of funds. Given these barriers, the author suggests that food system advocates engage planners on specific, well-targeted issues at the local or regional level and join forces with other organizations that have common concerns, such as “sustainable communities,” to approach planners for their collaboration and assistance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Community food assessments (CFAs) constitute a first step in planning for community food security. Community food security is a situation in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that also maximizes community self-reliance and social justice. Through a study of nine CFAs, this article discusses their common threads to planning, how a planning approach might strengthen CFAs, and what planners might learn from them. Four CFAs led by professionals with planning backgrounds employed spatial mapping techniques to analyze a variety of issues, explored more and diverse community-food linkages, used multiple sources and methods, envisioned a key role for community planning agencies, distributed their findings widely to a local and national audience of professional planners, and helped place planners in leadership positions of the national community food security movement. Implications of this study for planning education, research, and practice are discussed. </jats:p>",

Some tensions are based on differences in scale, fundamental values, power, or conflicting stakeholder frames, while others are a function of stakeholders with compatible interests failing to develop a common language and agenda. This article investigates the nature of these and other emerging food systems conflicts by exploring the major stakeholder groups and their values, interests, and positions. Applying environmental and public policy dispute resolution theory and techniques, the article explores opportunities for planners to bridge food systems tensions. The article recommends specific actions that planning practitioners and planning academics can take to foster food systems discourse and to build a more economically and environmentally sound and socially just food system. </jats:p>",

The motivations and rationale behind travel and provisioning choices of the working poor and the resources available to them are examined by means of a series of semistructured interviews conducted with members of twenty-six low-income house-holds residing in the Austin, Texas, area. The ways that these households cope with their mobility and economic disadvantage are complex, logical, and varied; depend on their resources and circumstances; and must be flexible to deal with day-to-day occurrences. Evidence from this study shows that the flexibility afforded by the automobile widens the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility, allowing for a more extensive search for goods and services. The automobile is an important mode for nonwork travel, even among those households that do not own one. However, the transit and walking remain critical in providing the mobility needed to access food-shopping destinations for these families. </jats:p>",

Results suggest that Americans shop for groceries by car and that attributes of potential customers influence grocery store sizes. The association between household income and average store size is significantly positive. Indicators of individual and house-hold transportation disadvantage, by contrast, are associated with smaller average store sizes in Atlanta, indicating that small stores are likely to be most successful where they are most needed. </jats:p>",

Part A of this chapter presents a marketing planning framework that gathers and organizes the information in this book. The framework contains a number of feedback loops to reflect the fact that a great deal of the process of planning involves a compromise between what is desirable and what is feasible. Part B looks at the issue of making marketing work. While there has been a great deal written about designing marketing strategy and programmes, there is much less known about actually implementing marketing. The process of planning is a good way to capture and organize the knowledge about customers, competitors, and markets that is distributed throughout the organization. Also, the process of planning acts as a form of collective decision-making.</jats:p>",

Interpretations of the results lead to several implications for the tourism industry stakeholders and tourism research. (original abstract)</jats:p>"

Countries like Iran, which are located in arid and semi-arid regions of the world, since they are in permanent water crisis condition, must react by concentrating on research, pure studies and striving as far as possible to utilize water as optimally and manage water consumption. Lack of precipitation, inadequate infrastructure for collection, storage and recycling of water and above all, lack of public awareness regarding such issues as standard consumption patterns, force all countries like Iran to adopt strategic management policies and techniques toward such issues as water resources, maintaining and upgrading water quality, recharging of water resources and also other concepts, such as, “defined consumption”.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although Tehran province enjoys having various surface and underground water resources, and also so-called scattered and undirected water resources such as Qanats, springs, treated waste water, etc., adding all these resources together, it still cannot quench its thirst. Average annual temperature and rainfall, and also explosive rate of population migration to the province, are main reasons of existing and widening gap between supply and demand. It seems the only alternative left is to capitalize and utilize various techniques to reduce consumption, otherwise Tehran will face a continuous and uninterrupted water crisis. Proposed strategic management viewpoint should also cover other areas such as supply, transfer, treatment, storage and also distribution and consumption. For each of above topics, special operational management should be considered and executed. Although, there were many reasons behind the recent water crisis, one of the main reasons was uncoordination among various management divisions which ended up in rationing. Tehran's water crisis was handled successfully by utilizing various strategic management techniques, but in order to prevent such crisis repeating itself, we must adopt long-term strategic policies and demand management, also various techniques of efficient use of water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines how consumers in China perceive and respond to company‐sponsored environmental advertising claims. Based on a survey of 914 Chinese respondents in Beijing and Guangzhou, the study has derived some important findings. First, it confirms the casual observation that environmental advertising has already been widely used in the country. Second, it indicates that Chinese consumers, in general, rate print environmental advertisements more favorably than broadcast ones. This is probably due to the pragmatic orientation of Chinese consumers, who consistently seek concrete and substantiated product information from advertisements to guide their shopping. Regression analyses on the collected data further reveal that “perceived credibility of the claim”, “relevance of the advertised product to daily lives”, “education level” and “media type” are all significant factors that would positively affect green purchase intention of Chinese consumers. In addition to providing researchers with further understanding of Chinese consumers' attitudinal and conative responses toward environmental advertising, these findings provide advertisers with useful insights into fine‐tuning their environmental advertising strategies in China.</jats:p>",

In a manufacturing environment, layouts are often needed for the manufacture, storage and shipment of specific product types within specific time periods. This is especially true in metal fabrication plants, as the dynamic nature of product storage and manufacture dictates the need for effective layout generation to achieve cost reductions. The system described in this paper integrates raw material storage, inventory management, scheduling and rack system design with facility layout development for the most satisfactory dynamic response. The research addressed in this paper has resulted in the development of a computer‐based model that focuses on the concept of integrating the domains of plant layout, material handling and warehousing in terms of raising overall effectiveness.</jats:p>",

The number of contributions per million inhabitants is related to the main language of the country, the gross domestic product per capita and whether a country is a former socialist country or not. The social sciences, the arts and humanities, and the natural sciences are studied separately. It turns out that there is a tendency for a higher publication rate for English-language countries, slightly lower for countries with small languages, and even smaller for countries with large non-English languages. This is consistent with the hypotheses that there is a bias in the data bases from the ISI such that English-language journals tend to be overrepresented, that scholars from English-language countries write almost exclusively in English, and that scholars from other countries tend to publish less in English and more in their domestic language the larger their domestic language. This calls for caution in using these databases for international comparisons of research activity.</jats:p>",

The main objective is to determine the various demographic variables and to profile complainers and non‐complainers with regard to psychographic variables, attitudes towards businesses in general, product attributes and attribution of blame. It provides a comprehensive comparison with the other studies in the literature which were mainly conducted in Northern America and Europe. The research suggests that complainers in Indonesia had a higher level of income and education. Complainers tended to exhibit greater self‐confidence and individualistic characters. They were more willing to take risk and had a positive attitude toward complaining. Consumers were more likely to complain when the unsatisfactory product was expensive, and used frequently and over a long time. In addition, complainers were more inclined to make a complaint when they blamed sellers and manufacturers for their bad purchase experiences. It was also noted that both complainers and non‐complainers possessed poor attitudes towards businesses in general. Managerial implications are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate tumor delineation is crucial to achieve successful radiotherapy (RT). While CTs are clinically used to plan 3D–RT, multimodality imaging (MMI) promises to aid accurate delineation of the tumor. This thesis examined delineated MMI volumes and studied their role in RT planning. A prostate modeling study evaluated the dose reductions in conformal and intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (CRT and IMRT) due to interfractional gross tumor volume (GTV) motion and variability in delineation. In both CRT and IMRT, a 10 mm margin was adequate to account for interfractional GTV movement. However, 10 mm (CRT) and 5 mm (IMRT) GTV misdelineation produced unacceptable dose distributions. IMRT plans were more affected by delineation errors when compared to CRT plans due to their steep dose gradients. Methods were developed to use MRI only in RT planning. Water and bone electron density values were assigned to the image and a low‐distortion MR‐sequence was used. MR‐delineated prostate volumes were in general smaller than those on CT by 10%. Patient data were separated into those that were affected by organ motion from those that were not. An independent‐organ registration technique was developed to relate CT‐ and MR‐delineated volumes that were affected by organ motion between the scans. The dosimetric study showed that unacceptable CRT was planned using planning target volume delineated using CT <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8171-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8171:mp8171-math-0001\" /> when <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8171-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8171:mp8171-math-0002\" /> volumes were assumed to be true.

The addition confirmed the inferior disease extension in 60% of the cases studied and in 20% of cases, presented a large inferior difference. The addition of FDG–PET would affect the field sizes and the extension of lead blocking. A theoretical CRT study showed that greater than 50% decrease in lung dose was achievable with <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8171-math-0009.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8171:mp8171-math-0009\" /> when compared to the original plan. This thesis highlighted not only the importance of using MMI in RT planning but developed methods to cope with the additional information. Though not all the imaging modalities added a significant dosimetric benefit, they added new information regarding GTV determination and decreased the subjectivity of GTV delineation with minimal technical difficulty, which will benefit current RT planning.</jats:p>",

This paper tests the relationship between cultural values and advertising message strategies employed in service advertising using the affective response approach, rather than content analysis. The results show that Hong Kong advertisers use significantly more transformational messages than in US services advertising. Advertising message strategies and cultural values often relate in a non‐random way. Informational message strategy and realistic culture are found to be strongly associated. When societies are more materialistic, advertisers are more likely to use transformational messages due to the high correlation between materialism and brand image. The result also shows that masculine culture, and cultures with long‐term orientation, idealism or low individualism are more likely to adopt transformational message strategy.</jats:p>",

Officially founded in December 1908, it was sold as early as 1912 to Hector Hodler, director of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) in Geneva. After Hodler’s untimely death in 1920, UEA became the owner of the collection. For the duration of a dispute about the headquarters of the Association, the UEA Library was successfully stored at the Palais Wilson, in Geneva, where it survived World War II. For personal reasons, the longtime functionary of UEA Hans Jakob held off on transferring the library to Rotterdam, where the Association established its headquarters in 1955. It was not until the period 1960–67 that the bulk of the books arrived. During that time many items of various kinds and various sources had been added. Now the Hector Hodler Library — its exact name as of 1980–serves as a working library for the Association and for many researchers interested in interlinguistics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Algerian National Constitution stipulates that Classical Arabic is the only official language of the nation, which is supposedly used by all members of the speech community. French is regarded as a foreign language and is taught starting from the fourth year of the primary level. The Algerian diglossic situation is characterized by the use of Classical Arabic and French as high varieties used in formal and public domains, and colloquial dialects, namely Algerian Arabic and Berber, as low varieties for informal and intimate situations. In public domains, Classical Arabic is present virtually everywhere and used (especially at the written level) in varying degrees. In some domains, such as education or the physical environment, Classical Arabic dominates; in other domains such as the economy, Classical Arabic is used in parallel with French. This linguistic reality is primarily the outcome of many years of intensive campaigns of Arabisation and major political and even financial decisions, beginning right after independence, aimed at promoting the status of Classical Arabic and giving to Algeria its Arabo-Muslim identity.\n</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>The present paper examines the process and outcomes of Arabisation and its effects on language use, providing a brief historical sketch of the Arabisation process in various domains, including its application in public life, notably in administration, the physical environment and education. The Arabisation process has touched practically all spheres of public life previously characterized by the sole use of the French language. Also discussed is the impact of Arabisation on language use at the institutional and individual levels. The impact of Arabisation has been significant in some domains, namely education and the physical environment, but less evident in others, such as in university studies, especially in scientific and medical departments, where French remains the main medium of instruction and communication. The paper also encompasses a brief survey of the linguistic rights of Berbers under the Arabisation process, and at the same time it also attempts to address the issue of the Arabisation process in relation to other concepts, notably Islam and Islamism; ‘Arabisation’ does not mean ‘Islamisation.’ Finally, the results of the Arabisation campaigns are analyzed and critiqued. Arabisation has faced many criticisms, among them paucity of human and financial means, as well as the lack of a coherent strategy of implementation in which the political and sociolinguistic realities of the Algerian speech community are taken into consideration.</jats:p>",

Las naciones “unidas” (“undivided”), e.g. Uruguay y EEUU, adoptan una política constitucional de “manos abiertas” (“hands-off”) con respecto a sus obligaciones y derechos lingüísticos ya que estas naciones tienen (o declaran tener) un gran sentido de identidad nacional y, además, en su territorio no habitan grupos de ciudadanos que buscan la autonomía o la secesión. Por otro lado, las naciones “desunidas” (“divided”), e.g. Bélgica, Canadá y Sudáfrica, adoptan una política constitucional de “manos a la masa” (“hands-on”) ya que en estas naciones habitan grupos lingüísticos difíciles de asimilar o grupos que tienen o buscan la autonomía o la secesión.\n</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>\n                        <jats:bold>Resumo</jats:bold>Lingvaj rajtoj kaj lingva justeco en la konstitucioj de la mondoTiu ĉi klasifo kaj analizo de konstitucioj tra la mondo celas helpi naciojn, kiuj malnetigas lingvajn leĝaĵojn en la propraj konstitucioj.

Including income as a covariate, MANCOVA was performed to determine how innovators/early adopters and non‐innovators differed in their attitudes about new food purchases. The findings revealed some important characteristics of food innovators/early adopters: they tend to be opinion leaders, seek variety in food types and brands, and are more responsive to sales promotions and advertisements. Food prices are relatively important to both consumer groups. Marketing implications for food businesses are discussed.</jats:p>",

Managers need only limited training to quickly generate visualizations depicting a specific stand or an entire landscape in its current and potential future states under a variety of silvicultural treatments.

This paper reports results of exploratory qualitative research to investigate perceptions of SFA among both salespeople and their customers in the insurance industry in Thailand. Results suggest that customers want technology to be integrated into interpersonal relationships, not to replace them. Most customers, even those with extensive IT background, are not willing to interact with technology‐based self service only. Much of the relationship with the company comes from trust in the salesperson, which is built up through the development of the relationship. This is probably more important in the relationship‐based cultures of Asia, which are strongly familiar with interpersonal service.</jats:p>",

First, an anti-swing regulating control law is proposed based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, where the proposed anti-swing control drives trolley velocity regulating error asymptotically to zero while suppressing load swing rapidly to zero for given arbitrary high-speed hoisting motions. Then a motion-planning scheme is designed based on the concept of minimumtime control, the proposed anti-swing control law, and typical anti-swing crane-operation practices. The motion-planning scheme is free from the usual mathematical constraints in anti-swing control such as small swing angle, small hoisting speed, and small hoisting distance. The effectiveness of the proposed motion planning is shown by generating high-performance anti-swing trajectories with high hoisting speed and hoisting ratio.</jats:p>",

In this paper I illustrate the inadequacy of current management policies by drawing upon Deleuzian notions of immanence and movement and applying them to the specific case of Yellowstone bison. Modes of representation that define nonhuman ontology in terms of genetics are shown to be inadequate for they separate essence from experience and facilitate the removal and exclusion of nonhumans. In contrast, a Deleuzian theory of wildlife accentuates the importance of movement, contact, and contingency in the constitution of nonhuman ontology, thus outlining an approach that can also lead to a revision of human–nonhuman relations. In particular, movement provides a physical mechanism to bridge the theoretical gap that separates human from nonhuman, and suggests a means to link together ethical and evolutionary concerns regarding nonhumans. With the distinctions between Deleuzian theory and common wildlife-management practices in mind, the paradigm of sustainability is criticized for prioritizing demographic and genetic stability over spatial transgression, thereby minimizing the developmental capacities of nonhumans and legitimizing existing spatial structures of exclusion and control. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Airlines are continually faced with the challenge of efficient utilization of their cockpit crew resources. In addition to regular flying crews, airlines maintain significant reserve staffing levels to meet contractual obligations and provide smooth daily operations. Most airlines also depend on voluntary and involuntary flying by regular crews to cover trips that fall out of work schedules due to conflicts and disruptions (open time trips). These open time trips, combined with expected levels of voluntary and involuntary flying, affect reserve staffing levels; airlines must plan crew staffing in advance to meet resulting training and new-hire requirements. Inefficient operational reserve utilization can further affect long-range crew staffing, resulting in higher training and new-hire costs. The proposed optimization strategy to estimate long-range crew staffing combines operational reserve utilization and premium operational costs due to voluntary and involuntary flying with long-range business needs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Robotic arms often perform industrial tasks requiring complex dextrous manipulation within constrained spaces. For example, automobile unibody assembly can require more than 5000 welds, with many performed within the vehicle’s interior. An arm can be designed specifically for this type of task by permuting link lengths and degrees of freedom (DOF) to find a set of feasible designs. Each design can be evaluated for joint-angle displacement, dexterity, simulated speed, and consumption of available redundancy. A heuristic search increases the probability of having the needed kinematic structure. Hyperredundant designs of up to 10 DOF can be created, and searches often yield minimized-DOF designs. The path-planning technique combines pseudo-inverse velocity control with the concept of attractive poles to allow maneuvering through complex enclosures while avoiding many obstacles. This research provides a means of rapid-prototyping robotic arms for enclosed spaces and can yield many designs locally optimized for given tasks and environments. </jats:p>",

Although understanding the basic characteristics of these shifts is a critical step toward understanding the brain mechanisms that produce them, the literature remains unresolved on a very basic and potentially revealing characteristic of these shifts—namely, whether attention takes longer to shift a farther distance across the visual field. We addressed this question using a series of behavioral tasks involving the voluntary orienting of attention to locations in the visual field. The findings support a model in which attentional shifts include separate “planning” and “execution” stages and in which only the planning stage requires more time for shifts of a greater distance. These results offer resolution to the longstanding debate concerning the effect of attentional shift distance on shift time and provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of attentional shifting.</jats:p>",

Developing such a strategy that is also adaptable to unexpected test results is even more difficult. The author investigates a reliability requirement verification example from the automobile industry for cost optimization and adaptability to unexpected failures using classical methods. Verification strategies for this example are then developed using conditional methods. These conditional verification strategies demonstrate significant cost efficiencies, and provide easy adaptability to unexpected failures. These strategies further provide understandable decision criteria for test success or failure. Using conditional methods for verification of performance requirements provides opportunities for cost savings, adaptability to unexpected test results data, and clear decisions for product acceptance.</jats:p>",

Capital costs (replacement, rehabilitation and repairing costs), benefits (by the reduction of pumping cost and leakage cost), and hydraulic reliability are used for making an optimal decision for the rehabilitation plan of a water pipe network. KYPIPE is used for checking the hydraulic reliability. A multi-objective optimization model is successfully developed in this study. And the task is tackled using a new meta-heuristic algorithm, Harmony Search, for solving a large optimization problem to which conventional optimization techniques are poorly suited. Five different models with different objective functions are developed and tested according to various conditions considered in this study. These models provide more options for the rehabilitation of pipe network systems compared to previously suggested models in the literature.</jats:p>",

These organizations represent climate change in ways they hope will make the problem relevant to people and thereby inspire political action. The strategies require a choice of objects to bring climate change home to constituents. Some objects are ‘more local’ to certain constituencies—that is, they are more meaningful. Greenpeace Canada represents the impact of climate change via the object of the hungry polar bear. The Cities for Climate Protection campaign makes climate change relevant, in part, by its focus on the cost-saving benefits of energy efficiency. The process of localizing climate change constitutes society. I use feminist science studies as a theoretical basis to support my argument that organizations localizing climate change might choose objects that are more accountable to their constitutive effects on societies. I point out potential pitfalls in the choice of the polar bear and energy efficiency, and suggest some possibility in these objects. </jats:p>",

Patients in hospital discharge planning units are often described as waiting for placement, implying a passivity that is not necessarily part of their experience. The anthropological concept of liminality, which refers to both a state of being and a process during which people are suspended between former and future selves, offers a framework for exploring patients' experiences of a discharge planning unit as a transitional space. Methods. This pilot qualitative study incorporates participant observation and ethnographic interviewing to explore how two patients living in the discharge planning unit of a large urban hospital use weekly bus trips into the community to actively renegotiate their sense of self. Results. An interpretation of the findings using the concepts of emplotment and occupation reveals how patients in a liminal environment work to create meanings through disruptions in their lives. Practice Implications. The renegotiation of identity through occupations highlights the transformative potential of these experiences, suggesting possibilities for occupational therapists to support their clients in that process of change. </jats:p>",

At its most basic, biosecurity refers to simple cleansing and disinfecting, but during the FMD epidemic it became associated with a powerful system of surveillance. We characterise surveillance as a thing in itself, a mode of ordering that can be added to others. The establishment and maintenance of categories are fundamental to the practice of surveillance, but social studies of surveillance have not yet fully realised the way such categorisation operates within the nonhuman and the spatial. Strange materialities are those things which do not quite belong within a particular order. We examine the actions of surveillance in the world of strange materialities that was the FMD epidemic. Here we see that surveillant practices acted on the nonhuman FMD virus by constructing territories to control humans. Surveillance seems to proceed as the translation of a worldview (a system of categorisation) into materiality and we conclude with some thoughts on what this may mean for geographical studies of technical, biological, and human materialities in which surveillant processes are at work. </jats:p>",

This iterative planning technique offers an effective method for the deeper integration of V&amp;V planning with other systems engineering disciplines and supports the maximal fulfilment of the project goals and objectives. Since V&amp;V is an important means to reduce project risk, the new VVT strategy &amp; planning procedure assists the risk management efforts by feeding the results of risk analysis directly into VVT planning and the systems engineering measurement process. VVT planning defines the optimal risk reduction strategy in form of the VVT process and a measurement system to track project risks throughout the lifecycle. The three stages of the <jats:italic>SysTest VVT Process</jats:italic> are introduced in the first part of the paper and then the major steps of the VVT strategy &amp; planning procedure are described in detail.

It has been said that “change is the Army's steady state; the Army is always in transition.” To ensure that U.S. military forces can continue to perform their current and future missions without being constrained by environmental issues, the current “stovepiped” installation planning processes for infrastructure, budget, military training and deployment, and environment must become interdependent and integrated. Integrated planning is inherently tied to the concept of living within the limits of available resources, both natural and manmade. This article highlights a developing approach to resource and planning processes at Army installations. The Army Installation Sustainability Program focuses long‐term resource planning and execution on an installation's ability to support the Future Force and coexist with the communities that grow on its borders. The authors discuss the overall process and specific accomplishments of Fort Bragg's sustainability program and demonstrate how this paradigm shift toward a sustainability management system is successfully helping the installation staff prepare for the future. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

These decisions will lead to either conservative or aggressive production. In this work, we propose a novel analysis and optimization framework to address this problem, with which the relationship between the profitability and reliability of a planned operation can be quantified. By using probabilistic programming, the solution of the problem provides comprehensive information on the economical achievement as a function of the desired confidence level of satisfying process constraints. The feasible region will shrink and the profit will decrease when increasing the confidence level. For complex plant operations under multiple uncertainties, the sources of risk that have the most significant impacts on the profitability can be identified. Through this approach, an optimal as well as reliable decision for operations can be made, from which a suitable compensation between the profit and the probability of constraints violation can be received. The approach is applied to three problems of production planning under uncertainty and various issues in planning these operations are discussed.</jats:p>",

For the second set of visual signals, most ventral dl-PFC neurons reflected either the sensory properties of the signals or the information retrieved from each signal. By contrast, dorsal neurons were involved more in integrating information about the target location and which arm to use to reach the target, thereby generating information that could be used to plan future actions.

The new device has been termed a ‘cryoheater,’ and it can work with any cryosurgical cooling technique. A prototype computerized planning tool has been presented recently by this research team, which helps to determine the best locations in which to insert the cryoprobes. This prototype was designed for cryoprobes only. The planning procedure utilized a novel iterative optimization technique, based on a force-field analogy. The combination of cryoheaters with computerized planning is the subject matter of this report. The current report includes a review of cryoheater development, and presents an improved cryosurgery planning tool which incorporates cryoheaters. </jats:p>",

However, this will remain a daunting task, because the larger consequences of the arrival of antiaging interventions will greatly depend on the relative character and timing of the specific procedures that emerge. Three basic classes of interventions are likely: ones that slow aging in adults, ones that reverse aging in adults, and embryonic interventions that modify the overall trajectory of human aging. The consequences of each will differ significantly in the time required before noticeable demographic shifts begin to manifest in the human population, and in the social and political changes the interventions evoke. The specific societal consequences generally will arrive long before the demographic ones, and will hinge on the technical details of the interventions themselves—their complexity, physiological targets, modes of delivery, costs, unpleasantness, and the character and frequency of side effects.</jats:p>",

New Deal for Communities announced in 1998 is one of the most ambitious of English ABIs in that it aims over a period of ten years to close gaps between these thirty-nine areas and national standards in five outcome areas of crime, education, health, worklessness, and housing. Evidence gleaned from the national evaluation of 2002/03 helps illuminate trends and tensions within three themes which have proved central to the wider urban debate: community engagement, partnership working, and the complexity of ABIs. On the broad canvas, evidence from the evaluation suggests that institutional factors continue to impinge strongly on the programme, that the original assumption that partnerships should be given a strong degree of local flexibility and freedoms has been steadily eroded, and that the initiative as a whole sits within that raft of essentially reformist policy interventions effected by the Labour government since 1997. </jats:p>",

This controller acts on mutation probability and crossover rate in order to adapt their values dynamically while the algorithm runs. The second level consists of the identification of the optimal assembly or disassembly sequence by a Fuzzy function, in order to obtain a closer control of the technological knowledge of the assembly/disassembly process.

A between‐subjects experiment, using an SEC enforcement fraud case, was conducted to examine these relationships. Sixty‐nine auditors made risk assessments and designed an audit program. We found that auditors who used a standard risk checklist, structured by SAS No. 82 risk categories, made lower risk assessments than those without a checklist. This suggests that the use of the checklist was associated with a less effective diagnosis of the fraud. We also found that auditors with a standard audit program designed a relatively less effective fraud program than those without this tool but were not more willing to seek consultation with fraud experts. This suggests that standard programs may impair auditors' ability to respond to fraud risk. Finally, our results show that fraud risk assessment (FRASK) was not associated with the planning of more effective fraud procedures but was directly associated with the desire to consult with fraud specialists. This suggests that one benefit of improved FRASK is its relation with consultation. Overall, the findings call into question the effectiveness of standard audit tools in a fraud setting and highlight the need for a more strategic reasoning approach in an elevated risk situation.</jats:p>",

The paper begins by examining the ways that, for many Hispanos, land and identity depend on remembered Spanish and Mexican pasts. It continues by showing, through the case of the violent takeover of an old land grant, the political possibilities and contemporary identities that are enabled through the linking of distant past and contemporary land politics. It also demonstrates the ways in which deviating from the past dilutes these same formations and possibilities that accompany these histories—clearly delineated by treaties, deeds, patrimony, etc. The paper then explores—through the contemporary political struggle surrounding the dismembering of a statue erected to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Spanish arrival in northern New Mexico—the ways in which these very memories also tie Hispanos to alternative violent histories of conquest and colonialism. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the ways that contemporary land and identity politics in northern New Mexico trap Hispanos between what they need to remember and what others will not let them forget. </jats:p>",

A variety of techniques, both high- and low-tech, can be used. None is failsafe; each has pros and cons. Typically, their success will depend on both the community's resources and its resourcefulness. In this review, we briefly describe and assess techniques that can be used to aid five phases of a participatory planning process: those concerning goals, information, options, decisions, and monitoring. We conclude with recommendations for ways to build, not simply a plan, but a stronger social fabric. In particular, we argue that participants in a planning process should be treated, not primarily as representatives of vested interests, but as citizens with the responsibility and capability to plan for the common good. </jats:p>",

Using fewer mobile agents results in less network traffic and consumes less bandwidth. Regardless of the number of agents used, the total execution time for a task must be kept to a minimum. A retrieval service must minimize both these factors for better system performance, and at the same time, it must be able to supply the required information to users as quickly as possible. In this paper, we propose heuristic algorithms, called Cost-Effective MAP (CEMAP), to minimize both the number of mobile agents and the total execution time under the condition that the turnaround time is kept to a minimum. Although these algorithms tend to slightly increase the planning cost, a simulation study shows that these algorithms enhance the system performance significantly. By adopting these algorithms, systems can maintain lower network traffic while satisfying the minimum turnaround time. </jats:p>",

Environmental impact analysis (EIA), strategic environmental analysis (SEA), and strategic planning are all aspects of analyzing and projecting the impacts of various management decisions on the public and on natural systems. Integrated river-basin management is another aspect of this type of planning. Integrated management requires several basic conditions. Among these are clear communications among all the actors involved in managing the basin's water resources, one or more sets of data which are shared by all decision-makers, and tools by which the decision-makers can evaluate policies (impact assessment). </jats:p><jats:p> In the Souss Massa River Basin in Morocco, the result of un-coordinated policies for economic development has led to declining water tables as well as potentially damaging surface and groundwater pollution. The Government of Morocco (GOM), recognizing the need for coordinated and integrated water management, passed a law creating new River Basin Agencies. Aiding those agencies and their partners in developing integrated management is the objective of the USAID-sponsored Souss-Massa Integrated Water Management (SIWM) project. The project activities have been designed to develop and support communications, data sharing and model building within the institutions in the Souss-Massa Basin as a demonstration for all Moroccan river basins but space and time constraints require a more pointed discussion. The focus of this paper is on capacity building for strategic planning and integrated management being undertaken and, to the extent possible, some of the lessons learned. </jats:p>",

A spatial comparison of such preexisting, dense, dynamic networks of everyday mundane activities often leads to a better understanding of how power is created, maintained, and eventually used in times of neighbourhood crises. More specifically, by using a Flyvbjergian perspective of rationality and power, the author combines the notion of social capital as proposed by Putnam with Epstein's framework of participation within schools, to identify variations in civic activities within Public Elementary School Districts in Toronto (TDSB). Drawing from a unique descriptive dataset on parental and community participation available from the TDSB, and by combining it with enumeration-area data aggregated at the school-district level, this framework is empirically tested to gain an understanding of how such links relate to school-closure decisions. Within the context of education reform in Ontario, the results reveal the paradoxical nature of social capital in promoting and subjugating notions of democracy and civil society. </jats:p>",

Since the 1980s the government has made strenuous efforts to harness the innovative capacity of foreign transnational corporations through a series of policy initiatives aimed at facilitating a variety of forms of technology transfer to locally owned firms. This paper critically evaluates the impacts of these policy initiatives, and more specifically the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP), through case studies of the electronics and software sectors. The analysis suggests that supplier upgrading has been limited in the electronics sector, but that horizontal partnership arrangements, as evidenced by the software sector LIUP, may have more beneficial impacts. </jats:p>",

This is as true of the enormous state bureaucracy associated with the control of fertility as it is with the economic bureaucracies more often studied in transitional societies. Using observations from several field sites, the authors document how county-, township-and village-level family planning cadres have gone from being agents of the state to autonomous actors who must negotiate between the ongoing demands of the central bureaucracy and the new opportunities available in the locales in which they work and dwell. They suggest that any serious change in the draconian restrictions on fertility that have obtained in China for almost thirty years is likely to derive from initiatives at the local level. Local actors (cadres) have already begun to adjust to the tensions between responsibilities and available resources that have tended to induce paralysis in the upper levels of this long-standing state bureaucracy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper assesses the response by local authorities to the new institutional structure introduced in England and Wales since 1997: of Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), the Welsh Assembly and Welsh Development Agency (WDA), subregional partnerships, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), Education and Learning Wales (ELWa), and local government new well-being and Best Value initiatives. The paper demonstrates, using new survey evidence, that RDAs are beginning to promote a regional framework for local organizations, but the strategic impact is limited to county, unitary, and metropolitan areas, which are focused heavily on programme delivery. More generally, regional strategy inputs have added yet another dimension to local government partnerships. RDAs are not yet, therefore, the strategic bodies for all areas that was originally planned. Regional Chambers and the Welsh Assembly have weak influence on local government and are not yet effective monitoring bodies on the RDAs/WDA. Subregional partnerships offer potential for regional-local government strategy, but are chiefly involved in programme design (especially for regeneration) and their future importance appears limited. The transfer from TECs to the LSC/ELWa has had much less impact than expected: local government was already leader and financier of most of the projects in which TECs were involved. However, a reduction in level of activity, effectiveness, and resources has occurred for most projects in England, though to a lesser extent in Wales. Overall, the paper demonstrates that as yet changes in institutions have produced little real changes in how economic development occurs or how local government operates. The complexity and fragmentation of economic development institutions by government, on balance, appear to have increased rather than diminished. </jats:p>",

In particular, we present a model that takes into account a bounded rationality on the ability of risk perception, the information situation, and people's threshold acceptance of risk. A case study of the evaluation of risk in municipal water use is presented. In order to investigate the information situation and risk perception of people, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The survey reveals that risk awareness is a factor in drinking water, and that people change their choice based on risk information. The effects of information on risk and public investment are then considered. From some numerical examples, marginal willingness to pay is found to be low in the case of high risk, because of consumers' self-defensive activities. In other words, marginal willingness to pay for public investment is high when there is little or no averting behavior. Moreover, it is shown that consumers' perception of risk is dependent largely on information on risk, countermeasures taken by public authorities, and overconfidence in private averting goods. </jats:p>",

We pose the questions of why this technique was identified as the right tool for the job by government and why, at the same time, its use was so fiercely contested by other experts in animal health. To set our analysis in context we outline briefly the causes, characteristics, and consequences of FMD together with its history in the United Kingdom. We then provide an account of the 2001 FMD outbreak and the policies that were employed to control the epidemic. In the main discussion we integrate the geographical concept of spatial practices with the concept, drawn from the sociology of scientific knowledge, of styles of scientific practice and apply this to the analysis of the knowledge practices and arguments of the scientific groups that advised on controlling the epidemic. We analyse the key differences between expert groups and their policy recommendations in terms of their different styles of scientific spatial practice. In the rhetorical boundary work of the opposing scientific groups we see these differences in ‘style’ being invoked to delineate the boundaries of ‘sound science’ and thereby legitimate their respective policy prescriptions. We conclude by discussing the relationship between styles of scientific spatial practice and recent trends in government policy style and its implications for future risk policy. </jats:p>",

The lens coating operations at this facility utilize both volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants. The type and quantity of coatings utilized relative to market demands for products in the future may potentially result in the facility exceeding major source thresholds under Title V of the Clean Air Act, thus requiring permit changes and, most likely, emissions controls. A description of the facility, as well as the environmental risks is presented relative to potential “responses” available for consideration under present production variations. An in‐depth analysis of the various options for compliance and control management as well as operational flexibility in order to meet business demands is provided. The evaluation includes options in becoming a major facility under Clean Air Act Title V requirements, application of Maximum Available Control Technology requirements, and options in managing chemical inventory and production techniques to avoid major source thresholds, if it is possible to do so. This analysis will establish the framework by which company management can implement a formal program with automatic response activities that are put into effect when facility emissions exceed preestablished thresholds. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 23: 135–140, 2004</jats:p>",

Prescribed chlorination rates are often based on TOC levels, and levels of disinfection byproducts (DBP) can be subsequently approximated. Unfortunately, TOC is difficult to measure, and some water utilities rely on the more easily measured absorbance of ultraviolet light (specifically at a wavelength of 254 nm, abbreviated <jats:italic>UV‐254</jats:italic>) as a surrogate indicator of organic content. For daily or weekly operating purposes, measurements of UV‐254 can provide inexpensive and meaningful prescriptive guidance for disinfection processes. However, for longer term planning periods (monthly, seasonal, or annual) over which the minimization or reduction of TOC is an objective, a modeling approach may be necessary, and in a modeling environment, simulating TOC with simple mass balance relationships is much less data intensive than simulating light absorbance. This study aims to (1) develop a simple mass balance model for TOC in a stratified drinking water reservoir that can be used to help minimize TOC in real time and over longer term planning periods, and (2) demonstrate that TOC and UV‐254 are well correlated, so that either value can be used as model input or output. The study shows that TOC and UV‐254 are correlated reasonably well in a water supply reservoir for Boston, MA, and that a simple mass balance tool can effectively assist with planning and operations management using UV‐254 as a primary water quality indicator.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to report on commissioning and clinical implementation of a customized system for pediatric stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT). The system is based on the Pinnacle treatment‐planning system and its interfaces with other equipment: (1) Beam models were optimized for our compact blocking system and a new LINAC. (2) Three CT‐to‐density conversion tables were evaluated, one using tabulated data for a commercial phantom, the second including additional points from the manufacturer's data for the inserts in an in‐house phantom, and the third using measured densities for the in‐house phantom materials combined with tabulated data for the commercial phantom. (3) Blocks were transferred to a computerized block cutter using in‐house software that extracted the block shape from the export file and custom‐fitted the additional necessary shapes. (4) In the absence of a DICOM RT Image link, a method based on screen data capture was used to export digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) to two portal imaging systems for treatment verification. Lens shielding by multileaf collimation in the anterior‐posterior isocenter verification field was investigated. (1) Computed dose distributions using the beam models agreed with measurements well within published acceptability criteria. A difference of up to 1.0 mm was measured between the beam's eye views of aperture blocks and computed 50% isodose contours for a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20001-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20001:acm20001-math-0001\" /> dose calculation grid. (2) The third table, which included measured densities, improved the accuracy of the calculated isocenter dose by up to 0.5% in typical patient SCRT treatments and up to 1.0% in a phantom with 5‐cm diameter inhomogeneity inserts. (3) The block export and customization process was shown to introduce no additional uncertainty. A 1‐mm block production uncertainty was measured using film dosimetry on six blocks. (4) The DRR transfer method did not introduce uncertainty into the process. Verification field shielding reduced lens dose by 12 to 15 times. In conclusion, this customized system for planning and verification of pediatric SCRT provides a high level of precision as well as reasonable practical efficiency.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.53.Kn, 87.53.Ly, 87.53.Oq, 87.53.Tf, 87.53.Uv</jats:p>",
