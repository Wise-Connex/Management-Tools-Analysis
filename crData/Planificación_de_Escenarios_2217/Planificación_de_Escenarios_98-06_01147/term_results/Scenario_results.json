Describes how the newly arrived CD recordable drive changed the idea of desktop CD making, its working and limitations while mentioning the organizations that use CD‐Rs. Discusses the scenario of a CD‐ROM industry in India while listing a few Indian CD products. Concludes that CD‐ROM is the most sought‐after medium for commercial publishers and corporate communication and that, in India, the introduction of compulsory computer education in schools would augur well for the CD‐ROM market.</jats:p>",

From the same reason also gas turbines (GT) based technologies have become highly competitive option in the new capacity demand saturation. GT technologies will retain their dominant position also in the future. However, this needn’t inevitably mean that also NG must retain the first choice for the whole period of next generation. NG market may become saturated in middle-range horizon, approximately about 2010–2015. Huge reserves of coal together with appropriate coal-based technologies like IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) or PFBC (Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combustion) will cause subsequent decline from NG towards other fossil fuel commodities. Reasons for such scenario are given in our analysis.</jats:p>",

The fish were chronically exposed (90 days) in hardwater to the presence or absence of sublethal ammonia (70 µmol total ammonia ·L<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) alone or in combination with a 2°C elevation in the normal temperature profile over the months of June-September 1993 (ambient temperature range 13-22°C). Chronic sublethal exposure to ammonia had little impact on gill protein synthesis and degradation (protein turnover) and even less in muscle. However, in the liver, both protein synthesis and degradation were stimulated following 60 days of the sublethal ammonia exposure. The 2°C elevation in temperature resulted in a slight increase in protein turnover in both gills and liver. However, during the period of peak water temperature, the 2°C elevation in temperature inhibited protein dynamics in these tissues. Overall, elevated environmental ammonia in combination with a summer global warming scenario would challenge the ability of fish to adapt to alterations in the quality of their environment, most notably during periods of peak temperatures.</jats:p>",
