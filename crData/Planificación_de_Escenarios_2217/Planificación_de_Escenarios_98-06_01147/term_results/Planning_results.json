      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem-based learning (PBL) is a promising educational method to help students acquire the skills and knowledge to be more effective practitioners. Students learn how to learn as they tackle a real-world planning problem. The instructor, as a cognitive coach, ensures that students are active, collaborative, and reflective problem-solvers. In this article, we explore the theoretical foundations and the practical benefits of problem-based learning for planning education. We detail a process for implementing problem-based learning in the classroom, illustrated with an example from a planning course. This article suggests that PBL can help to bridge the gap between planning education and practice, and can help to improve traditional methods of academic instruction. </jats:p>",

This article is based on San Francisco State University's experience with the HUD-funded Bay Area Community Outreach Partnership Center and the academic literature on institutionalization of reforms within public sector bureaucracies. It argues that universities are well suited for certain partnership roles-convener, planner, and capacity builder-and not for others. True partnerships between universities and their communities must be built on mutual respect, equal status, and mutual give and take. Institutionalization of federally funded university-community partnerships must progress simultaneously at the federal and local levels. It must respond to the interests of community, university, and governmental stakeholders. At the local level, change in both the internal structure and the operating procedures of universities and their neighborhood partners is essential. </jats:p>",

As these initiatives have proliferated, universities-often led by their programs in urban planning-have played varied and important roles. They have assisted in the creation of the initiatives, provided guidance and feedback, contributed technical expertise and financial support, and evaluated the outcomes. In this article, I examine the roles played by universities in three distinct community-building activities in Oakland, California, over a five-year period. Using three cases and other experiences in the same city, I outline four types of lessons for universitycommunity partnerships. The lessons affirm that the contributions that universities can make to community-building are very important-and that the process of maintaining an effective partnership is complex, with a number of potential pitfalls. </jats:p>",

This relationship has exposed a culture clash between universities and community organizations in at least three major areas: the style of work, social justice understanding, and power relations. Further, although the COPC is committed to a community-driven planning model, the nature of the community-university relationship tends to push the work toward a consultant-driven model.

The collaborative planning model is characterized by incrementalism, and relationship building is a key element. Relationship building and goal achievement are not opposites; the achievement of goals requires some level of trust in a partnership. The relative emphasis on one or the other depends on the specific context in which planning is done. The implications for planners and planning education are a greater emphasis on political and communicative skills in order to be effective in collaborative planning. </jats:p>",

Thus, managers are confronted increasingly with an information flood which provides more information than managers are able to process. This results in an information overload, which, while being advantageous, also carries considerable problems for both consumers and manager. This paper presents the scientific controversy surrounding the information overload problem, its behavioural background and the implications made. The studies presented in the review are mainly experiments. A complementary non‚Äêexperimental study by the author using a questionnaire to measure the subjectively perceived information overload of managers in various managerial fields is presented in the second part of this paper. The hypothesis, that the subjectively perceived information overload is positively related to the disposable information volume, was confirmed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) is receiving increasing attention in many academic and practioner media, primarily from an organisational perspective. Yet, influence of integrated communications programmes on consumers is difficult to establish in the literature. Consideration of IMC seems unpromising unless the concept itself can be grounded within a psychological perspective of consumer cognition. This paper is an attempt to conceptually explore these concerns. The paper commences with a discussion of broad issues facing contemporary research in marketing communications and strongly suggests that multidisciplinary approaches may offer greater insight than unidisciplinary ones. The authors then briefly, and selectively, introduce questions concerning the psychological assumptions underpinning theoretical work in marketing communications and speculate on implications these assumptions may have for a consumer psychology of IMC. The final strand of the argument considers the cognitivist notion of social cognition and contrasts this with the social constructionist view with regard to theoretical implications both views may have for a psychology of integrated marketing communications. We conclude by suggesting possible interpretations with practical implications for marketing communications practitioners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Marketing theorists and practitioners have for many years extolled the need for and the value of developing a concept which has become known as a ‚Äúmarket orientation‚Äù. Indeed, since the early 1950s a variety of researchers have argued that a market orientation is frequently associated with high levels of performance. However, despite the widespread acceptance of the merits of a market orientation, researchers have found comparatively low levels of adoption within British industry. The relatively limited extent of market orientation development is possibly explained through the findings of a number of studies which conclude that a wide range of organizational barriers impede market orientation. However, this paper argues that extant research into the barriers to market orientation is frequently restricted by the explicit concentration on management‚Äêlevel barriers to the detriment of shopfloor‚Äêderived impediments. Hence, via the exploratory case study of two retailing organizations, a typology of the barriers to market orientation development at the shopfloor level is presented. Implications for theorists and practitioners are identified and an action plan discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Oil spills are not noted for their recognition of international boundaries, it is a relatively simple matter for a spill to quickly escalate into an international incident. It has also been recognised that there is benefit in allowing resources to be shared when responding to spills through a process of layering the response levels. One important factor in this is the pre-planning to allow this process to run smoothly and effectively. This paper looks at some of the issues involved in this planning cycle.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Over the last few years the Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Convention (OPRC) has been spreading throughout the international arena. This convention outlines the benefits of improved planning, training management and response equipment availability to enhance the success of any response operation. The convention attempts to improve the cross boundary co-operation between countries to facilitate the deployment of personnel and equipment to provide assistance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The amount of oil spill equipment which is available in the world is quite astonishing, the oil industry (IPIECA) approach to oil spill contingency planning recommends that the tiered approach to oil spills be adopted. This concept is aimed at ensuring that each operation conducted by the industry has the requisite amount of equipment and resources to respond to the spills which are most likely to occur i.e. the small operational spill, whilst catering for the large event which may require additional resources from outside the region. Ultimately the major event or worst case scenario must be considered where all of the local and regional response capability is exhausted and additional resources must be imported from an external source.</jats:p>",

First, four ‚Äúfactors‚Äù that prevailed prior to and during the revival are discussed: the ‚Äúcommunicative‚Äù, ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù, ‚Äúreligious‚Äù, and ‚Äúliterary.‚Äù The study then proposes schematically that the shift to Hebrew evolved in a cycle consisting of four consecutive albeit partially overlapping ‚Äústeps‚Äù: (1) The children are instilled with desired language attitudes. (2) The children acquire the code, Hebrew. (3) The children transfer Hebrew, now a second language, out of the schools. (4) With these children now adults, their newly born receive Hebrew as a first language. Finally, the study suggests that, in the absence of a central authority, the revival can be seen as a case of ‚Äúmicro language planning,‚Äù in which potential speakers constituted ‚Äúlanguage planning agents‚Äù active in ‚Äúlanguage planning cells.‚Äù (Language revival, Hebrew, language planning, language shift, vernacular)</jats:p>",

The distinction between these two models is developed in the light of the modernist / postmodernist debate to provide a set of theoretical issues to with planning in organisations. These issues are explored in the context of planning carried out in two empirically studied settings, a health authority and a school. The two models are found to provide resources for organisations and participants in these settings, both to proceed with planning activity and to account for it. Neither model is however adequate to describe the process of planning which is always a practical and situated activity whose character emerges in the process of interaction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pension funds may be one of the few avenues now open for financing new urban infrastructure and development projects. But convention dominates pension fund trustees' investment decisions, so it is difficult to see how the ambitions of advocates of pension fund investment can be squared with trustees' behaviour. The question is: why does convention dominate? Drawing on previously reported interviews and case studies, I propose a framework through which to understand the dominance of convention. In doing so, I identify a set of behavioural traits that structure decisions. This framework is inspired by the contributions of Kahneman and Tversky and their colleagues for understanding the economic psychology of individual decisionmaking. The paper is intended to be a realistic account of the attributes of trustee decisionmaking, recognising the ingrained and systematic nature of the identified habits, rules, and norms. The paper is also inspired by Keynes's work on risk and uncertainty. In combination, I assess the potential for investment innovation by pension fund trustees, noting the importance of analogical reasoning in extending the range of pension funds investments. The paper closes with a comparison of the proposed framework with standard treatments of decisionmaking, including reference to the robustness of psychological models of habit. </jats:p>",

It allows definition of measures of similarity or distance between complete sequences, called global alignment, or the evaluation of the best fit of short sequences within long sequences, called local alignment. Alignments may be done pairwise to develop similarity or distance matrices that describe the relatedness of individuals in the set of sequences being examined. Pairwise alignment methods may be extended to many individuals by using multiple alignment analysis. A number of elementary hand-worked examples are provided. The basic concepts are discussed in terms of the problems of time-use research and the method is illustrated by examining diary data from a survey conducted in Reading, England. The CLUSTAL software used for the alignments was written for molecular biological research. The method offers a powerful technique for analyzing the full richness of diary data without discarding the details of episode ordering, duration, or transition. It is also possible to extend the analysis to include the context of activities, such as the presence of other persons or the location, but such extensions would require software designed for social science rather than biochemical problems. The method also offers a challenge to researchers to begin to develop theories about the determinants of daily behavior as a whole, rather than about participation in single activities or about time-budget totals. </jats:p>",

Recent research, however, has tended to explore exceptions to general processes, and techniques have been developed which have as their focus the investigation of spatial variations in local relationships. One of these techniques, known as geographically weighted regression (GWR), developed by the authors is used here to investigate spatial variations in spatial association. The particular framework in which spatial association is examined here is the spatial autoregressive model of Ord, although the technique can easily be applied to any form of spatial autocorrelation measurement. The conceptual and theoretical foundations of GWR applied to the Ord model are followed by an empirical example which uses data on owner-occupation in the housing market of Tyne and Wear in northeast England where the problems of relying on global models of spatial association are demonstrated. This empirical investigation of spatial variations in spatial autocorrelation prompts a further discussion of several issues concerning the statistical technique. </jats:p>",

The picture is one of changing fortunes; many individuals temporarily disadvantaged revolving around a core of those experiencing more long-term disadvantage. This is especially true of unemployment. Used in multivariate models to predict health and deprivation outcomes in 1991, the individual characteristics from both 1971 and 1981 have stronger predictive power than ward scores on deprivation indicators.

This paper is based on a qualitative study of farmers in southern Scotland. In-depth interviews were used to gain access to farmers' perceptions of the environment and conservation issues. As farmers are inevitably working closely with and using nature, their views of nature were found to be connected to this exploitative relationship with nature. Farmers' constructions of conservation are also related to this, they viewed conservation in a very instrumental way, often believing that conservation should have direct economic benefits for them, and following that, for the rest of society. It was found that conservationists influenced what farmers understand by conservation, both directly and also as they represent a competing group in the countryside. Furthermore, conservationists were seen as having the power to designate Sites of Special Scientific Interest on the farmers' land, a power which clearly affected their relationship. The meanings given by farmers to conservation and associated concepts are an essential part of how they negotiate the growing significance of conservation issues in the farming world. </jats:p>",

After setting out the methods and the sociometric approach, the author identifies actors who have the ten highest centrality scores in the four cities, The author concludes that, in spite of continuing contrasts in the national institutional structures and differences in the politics and cultures of the four cities, there is a surprising similarity in the key actors involved in urban economic development; these actors include individuals from the locally elected authorities, central government bodies, and businesses. The new urban governance is based on the range of agencies responsible for economic development and upon the growing importance of business in policy formulation and implementation. </jats:p>",

Social and economic inequalities within cities have steadily grown, whereas shifting global economic relations have led to the polarisation of more and less successful local (urban) economies. At the same time many nation-states, such as Britain, have opted for greater deregulation and a resurgence of neoliberal strategies of governance, which have had the effect of disempowering local communities and managers just at the time when they would appear to be most vulnerable to the forces of change. </jats:p><jats:p> In this context a range of authors have argued that the way forward for city authorities is through developing an institutionally based set of local networks and alliances in which a range of interests are represented politically and through which wider global economic forces can be better ‚Äòheld down‚Äô at the local level. This ‚Äòinstitutional thickness‚Äô varies from city to city and this paper, in comparing Cardiff and Sheffield as two case studies, addresses the ways in which institutional relations have developed in those cities and the degree to which they represent effective forms of inclusive local political mobilisation and wider economic leverage. I argue that processes of ‚Äòinstitutional thickness‚Äô in cities does not necessarily create inclusive forms of local political representation and that institutional presence and interaction and the local policymaking processes they are part of, may in fact reinforce existing local social, economic, and political relations and divisions rather than leading to the encouragement of local corporatist relations. </jats:p>",

Findings from a pooled time series analysis of state family planning expenditures show that categorical funding (here, title X of the Public Health Service Act) is the most cost effective in producing desired outcomes, such as lowering infant mortality. Policies using entitlement grants are generally more cost effective than those that rely upon block grants.

Less than 2% is aimed directly at developing collaboration and cooperation between firms, The remainder is counterstrategic, grant aiding the development of individual firms. Although plants in Ireland are found to have more extensive network linkages than those in Germany, these were predominantly between companies which were part of the same group rather than collaborative relationships between independent plants. The limited information available suggests that the production operations of manufacturing plants in Ireland are less flexible than those of German plants. In terms of product development, plants in Ireland had more multifunctional involvement and less functional demarcation than plants in Germany. Plants in Ireland also had similar product-quality aspirations to their German counterparts. Political and operational difficulties are likely to arise in the adoption of a more strategic industrial policy. Firms in Ireland may also be constrained by available human and financial resources in their attempts to embrace the principles of the New Competition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Subcentral governments have gradually become more and more important in the general level of public economic activity in Western nations, To an increasing extent, macroeconomic management implies that the economic activity of subcentral governments is taken into account. But how can central governments coordinate the economic activity of numerous subcentral governments? What kind of intergovernmental arrangement is necessary? The author argues that fiscal federalism, the traditional approach to this problem, cannot answer these questions satisfactorily. The focus of fiscal federalism is on economic incentives in intergovernmental relations. The author argues that this is not sufficient. Fiscal federalism must be supplemented by a focus on political methods of influence. An analysis of Scandinavian and US ways of involving subcentral governments in macroeconomic management shows that the role played by subcentral government associations is crucial in the effectiveness of macroeconomic management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since economic reform in 1979 China has witnessed dramatic changes. In particular, the adoption of the new land leasing system in 1987 has led to the transformation of the urban internal structure of this country. Perhaps because of the lack of data, empirical studies lag far behind the rapid urban development and land-use changes currently taking place in China. In this paper the author attempts to examine empirically land-use changes in a fast growing city‚ÄîGuangzhou‚Äîby analyzing data obtained from aerial photographs. The author suggests that some new characteristics have emerged in the distribution of land-use change since the introduction of land reform. Polycentric urban development, a phenomenon that has been attracting wide research attention in Western contexts, has also appeared in the transitional economy. The author demonstrates that besides population density, housing and land value, and firm location, land-use change can be used as a prompt and reliable indicator of polycentric urban development. A range of policy implications are briefly outlined. </jats:p>",

Far from being the product of a monolithic culture, regional forestry, or, more inclusively agrosilvipastoral landscapes and fuelscapes, are social products which have been described as often construed in a plurality of ways and invested with diverse if not antithetical meanings by different individuals and social groups. They represent sites of contestation and cooperation for human agents and state agencies engaged in constructing, maintaining and modifying woodfuel and other forestry-related discourses. The author juxtaposes several such contests, their meanings, and the discourses of which they are a part. He does so with particular reference to perceived linkages between fuelwood use and production, on the one hand, and vegetation and degradation and other environmental change, on the other. The geographical focus is dryland Nigeria, in particular its regional forestry spaces and landscapes. In the conceptual framework empirical theorisation is combined with discourse and landscape analyses. The author concludes that the juxtaposition of forestry discourses, which he attempts, creates spaces for different landscape visions to be seen as virtual realities, which are shaped and sustained by social forces and (technologies of) representation.</jats:p>",

A transparent link between the risk analyses and the specific emergency preparedness analysis is shown together with the emergency preparedness plan, which comes out as a result of the analyses and the risk acceptance criteria. Key performance indicators were identified for the effectiveness of an eventual emergency response, and the effectiveness has been verified through exercises, reviews and audits. The work undertaken has been well received by all stakeholders, and is seen as an example of best practice.</jats:p>",

The early postcommunist transformation is examined in terms of a general transformational equation. The author provides a cross-sectional explanation of early differences throughout the twenty-one countries both in the institutional transformation and in the transformational slump. Two complementary LISREL (linear structural equations) models show that a successful early postcommunist transformation means (1) a quick resumption of macroeconomic balance and economic growth resting on (2) genuine democratization and economic liberalization, and (3) higher levels of inherited modernization. </jats:p>",

A framework to develop Environmental Information Models (EIM) that approaches this constraints and able to transform relevant Environmental Data into reliable Environmental Information is discussed. The framework is based on the previous efforts forwarded by Agencies like OECD and EPA to approach the development of EIM using meaningful categories of variables within each of the PSRE componentes and avoiding therefore the difficulties of Information Management based upon detailed and complex interaction models. The proposed framework also benefits from other approaches oriented to provide Strategic Planning with additional measurements of Environmental direction and performance based on EIM. The framework is used to develop an EIM for the development of the oil resources to be found in Eastern Venezuela, as well as to provide proper Environmental Performance Measurements (EPM) suitable to CSP needs.</jats:p>",

This form of development emerges as one of the few remaining options available to promote social equity and achieve community survival in the face of economic adversity. CED is dedicated to participatory decisionmaking and to forms of economic development that operate at a local level and advance social objectives. I contend that present circumstances are less than conducive to a fulfilment of the high hope placed in CED. I draw on regulation theory to identify factors that account for both the present interest in CED and the current difficulties experienced in carrying out this type of development. The argument is that difficult economic, social, and political circumstances associated with post-Fordism account for a search for solutions‚Äîamong which CED figures prominently‚Äîwhile precluding the availability of the resources needed to launch successful CED initiatives. I conclude by exploring the possibility that CED will eventually be conducive to the emergence of local regimes of regulation capable of reinserting marginalized groups into the production process, thus contributing to rebalance the production and consumption spheres, and of introducing democratic forms of management. </jats:p>",

In this paper the author argues that the reason for the lack of integration between these two literatures is that the dynamics of the formation and decline of the Stalinist socioeconomic system remain basically anomalous for each of the three dominant theoretical frameworks in the field of political economy: the modernization approach, the world-systems approach, and the rational choice approach. Moreover, none of these paradigms by itself appears to account satisfactorily for the diverse economic trends in postcommunist societies. Modernization theory is apparently consistent with economic ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô in the most successful areas within the Leninist and post-Leninist world; world-systems theory appears to fit the type of ‚Äòdependency‚Äô emerging in places such as Central Asia and the Caucasus; rational choice analysis elucidates the continuing ‚Äòdevolution‚Äô of Leninist state structures in places where rent-seeking bureaucrats still directly or indirectly control most of the national wealth‚Äîbut no single approach explains the overall pattern of mixed results. It is concluded that making sense of the puzzling emergence, destruction, and aftermath of the Stalinist economic model requires the integration of ideological modes of coordinating collective action into a more comprehensive political economy paradigm. </jats:p>",

We show how to analyze the single-stage model to determine the production smoothness and stability for a production stage and the inventory requirements. We also show how to optimize the tradeoff between production capacity and inventory for a single stage. We then can model the multistage supply chain using the single stage as a building block. We illustrate the multistage model with an industrial application, and we conclude with some thoughts on a research agenda. </jats:p>",

On closer inspection of the research, there appear to be clear benefits in the use of business planning as a process within the smaller business. This is in contrast to the production of a business plan as an output focused predominantly on convincing and acquiring resources from other organisations and individuals. As a process, business planning can be both formal and informal. It is also focused on understanding and responding to the context within which the business operates. Strategic awareness capability, as both a bundle of activities and a core competence, helps to make sense of this context, and serves as a means of managing interactions between the firm and its environment. It also allows for a more sensitive reading of the limitations and strengths of the planning process in markets that are, for the small business, generally unpredicatable and complex. When combined, strategic awareness capability and planning effectiveness can be used to develop a typology of business types that provides insight into the processes by which business development can be supported. In addition, strategic awareness capability can be considered a core competence of the small business and conceptualised in terms of different levels of experience, and expertise. As a result, small firms with varying levels of experience face different challenges and needs when using and developing strategic awareness capability.</jats:p>",

The paper answers the question: why did the central Illinois watershed planning effort craft a cooperative rather than a conflictual solution? Trust of and attachment to farmers, both evidence of social capital, helped community members to balance economic, social and health risks. The balance arrived at created a tacit mandate for a farmer‚Äêled planning committee to solve the atrazine problem in a way acceptable to farmers and townspeople. The cooperative solution represents a consensus: concerns remain, but people are willing to support the plan. Consensus also demonstrates that planning as a positive action can create new social capital, which can support further planning.</jats:p>",

It is the first comprehensive attempt in US air-quality policy to practice the idea of emission trading. More than two years after its implementation, the allowance market offers the unique opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of tradeable-permit markets on a practical basis, rather than a solely theoretical one. The author analyzes the recent developments in the allowance-trading market and alternative ‚Äòexplanations‚Äô used in attempts to explain low trading activity and low allowance prices. The author concludes that the present allowance price will prove to be equal to the abatement costs; the allowance-trading program is not only ecologically effective but is also economically efficient; and it plays an important role in the development of future tradeable-permits markets. </jats:p>",

This move is driven by its commitment to continuous improvement and the philosophy of \"doing it right\" as a preference to the standard curative end-of-pipe approach. One of the schemes is in the area of disposal of by-streams or \"waste\" gas and water associated with oil production. This disposal issue has remained topical and a continuous point of focus given some peculiarities of the Nigerian situation, i.e. high GOR crude, absence of sufficient gas disposal routes, increasing produced water levels and a struggling economy with limited project funding capacity. Despite these circumstances, SPDC has evolved strategies for harnessing these streams thus reducing their potential environmental risks. The strategies include plans for flares-out by 2008, proposals for produced water re-injection and the concept of \"oil - protection\" for new developments. This paper presents an overview of the company's enabling policies/objectives/plans and the outcome of an integrated development proposal for Cawthorne Channel - a major oil field in the company's Eastern Division.</jats:p>",

Tracing the history of development planning and the background of the preparation of environmental action plans in numerous African countries leads to an assessment of the results and impact of the NEAP in Burkina Faso. It is argued that the NEAP has played only a marginal role in tackling the environmental problems of the country. The lack ofparticipation in preparation, institutional confusion, and insufficient analysis of the main causes of environmental degradation as well as the failure to identify costs and benefits of specific resource management improvements are amongst shortcomings of the plan.

The authors use a unique survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in England to explore their use of external expertise and the location of external advisers. They also draw upon surveys both of private sector consultants and of personal business advisers (PBAs) employed by Business Link companies. Network analysis is used to identify the ways in which weak and strong ties either enable or constrain opportunities for SMEs to access the knowledge and expertise available both from private sector business-service companies and from state agencies. SME owner-managers have too many strong ties with their local business community. The paucity of weak tics with individuals located elsewhere in the United Kingdom restricts the ability of SMEs to search for business-service expertise outside their local area. An analysis of the Business Link initiative is undertaken which suggests that the spatial monopoly held by each Business Link company does not encourage them to participate in the development of a national knowledge-and-enterprise network. The analysis suggests that a dual information economy may be developing in the United Kingdom in which large firms arc able to access specialist external expertise irrespective of location, whereas SMEs are tied into local providers of more generalist expertise. </jats:p>",

Findings revealed that student participation ranged from highly active to nonexistent across the observed planning meetings. The level of student participation was influenced by the student's conversational style, the size of the meeting, the level of abstraction in the planning discussions, and the expectations and behaviors of others. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The challenge in pipeline emergency response planning is to respond effectively and efficiently to emergencies or incidents which may occur over a wide geographic area with variable degrees of potential human exposure and environmental sensitivities. The type and level of response is dictated by the nature and extent of the emergency, as well as the location of sensitive environmental and human resources. Access and use of both spatial and temporal information in responding to the emergency must therefore be efficient and subsequent decisions and actions clearly understood and passed on from a management/co-ordination level to the field operations. One means of increasing the efficiency in this process is through the use of geomatics technologies (i.e., geographic information system (GIS). Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data, image processing software) integrated with a database holding both spatial and non-spatial information.</jats:p>",

We start by deriving equations of motion and vibration for general n-link manipulators with a flexible plate, then, using eigenfunction expansion, derive an approximated finite dimensional modal model. The model of flexible plate vibration implies that angularly accelerating the manipulatorjoints excites vibration, so we use optimal trajectory planning to minimize acceleration; this trajectory is calculated using a numerical iterative algorithm, and the trajectory‚Äôs validity is demonstrated by experiments for an air-driven two-link robot arm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A redundant manipulator can achieve a principal task and additional tasks by utilizing the degrees of redundancy. In the present paper, the redundancy resolution problem is formulated as a local equality constrained optimization problem. A motion planning solution corresponding to a design objective is then obtained using a new approach, called the perturbation method. In contrast to conventional approaches, the inverse of the Jacobian matrix is not required in the method proposed. Tracking errors can be bounded by a permissible zone, which is a function of normal tracking error and a safety factor. Positioning of the end effector within the permissible zone is satisfactory for the completion of any given step and signals the beginning of the next step. The position angle change of each joint is also bounded in each sampling interval as a function of robot maximum speed. Computer simulations written in the parallel processing language occam and computed on a transputer-based computation network are used to study the behaviour of the method proposed. Results validate the approach. </jats:p>",

As our knowledge of early environmental factors for schizophrenia evolves, the question of links between early factors and a development of schizophrenia becomes more important. In this article, we analyse the relationship between obstetrical complications (OCs) and adult schizophrenia and methodological concerns in the search for pre‚Äê and perinatal risk factors. We review findings of aberrant electrodermal activity in schizophrenic patients and suggest that OCs may induce insults to cerebral structures that are critically involved in the control of orienting and of autonomic responses.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
