Understanding wayfinding behavior has important implications for our ability to explain and predict spatial behavior and for our attempts to plan and design the built environment for human use.

Two distinct yet complementary research perspectives are discussed: the environment-behavior and the artificial intelligence approaches to understanding wayfinding. Closer linkages between these perspectives have implications at both the theoretical and applied levels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die Siedlungsstruktur stellt eine der zentralen Rahmenbedingungen für das Verkehrsgeschehen dar. Die in den letzten Jahrzehnten abgelaufenen Prozesse, die man mit den Schlagworten „Ausdifferenzierung der räumlichen Nutzungsstrukturen“, „Suburbanisierung“ und „großräumige Arbeitsteilung“ zusammenfassend beschreiben kann, haben einerseits zu längeren Wegen im Verkehr geführt. Sie haben gleichzeitig aber auch schwächere und schwerer bündelbare Verkehrsströme produziert. Disperse räumliche Zielstrukturen bieten nur geringe Chancen für Fahrgemeinschaften, bieten kaum sinnvolle Möglichkeiten der Abstimmung von öffentlichem Verkehr und Individualverkehr und bieten nur geringe Attraktivität für die „Eigenfortbewegung“ mit dem Fahrrad und zu Fuß.Durch kompakte Siedlungsgebilde mit ausgewogener Nutzungsmischung ließe sich nicht nur Verkehr vermeiden, es ließe sich auch der verbleibende Restverkehr umweltschonender abwickeln. Es ist jedoch zumindest dafür zu sorgen, daß eine weitere Entflechtung z.B. von Wohnen und Arbeiten oder von Produktion und Konsum verhindert wird. Hierbei ist zweifellos die Raumplanung mit ihren Instrumenten zur Steuerung der Flächennutzung gefordert. Eine solche Forderung ist gerade vor dem Hintergrund der dramatischen Entwicklung der Siedlungsstruktur in den neuen Ländern mit ihren Folgen für das Verkehrswachstum berechtigt. Angesichts der Schwäche ihrer Steuerungsinstrumente werden aber Stadtplanung, Regionalplanung und Raumordnung allein das Problem nicht lösen können. Hier muß man sich vielmehr die tiefere Ursache des Auseinanderdriftens der räumlichen Nutzungstrukturen und der Verkehrsentwicklung vergegenwärtigen: die immer geringer werdenden Raumwiderstände aufgrund fallender Verkehrskosten und dauernd verbesserter Verkehrsinfrastruktur.Das Ziel der Verkehrsvermeidung verlangt eine integrierte Verkehrs‑, Raumordnungs- und Umweltpolitik, die einerseits auf nationaler und europäischer Ebene die notwendigen Rahmenvoraussetzungen schafft und andererseits auf lokaler und regionaler Ebene „konkret vor Ort“ dafür sorgt, daß diese Voraussetzungen in ein umweltbewußtes Verkehrsverhalten umgesetzt werden können. Denn Verkehrsvermeidung heißt nicht Verkehrsverbot, sondern die Bereitstellung der Möglichkeiten zur Verhinderung unnötiger Mobilität.</jats:p>"

Far too often the work authorization process is constrained by a limited budget. This situation can result in two common outcomes:The shipyard delivers a ship to the customer that has significant repair work either deferred or incomplete.The deferred or incomplete work is screened back to the shipyard late in the overhaul, forcing an upheaval in the logical planning and execution of the availability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Risk affects both the shipyard and ship's force because the completion of the overhaul could be affected by late authorized work resulting in the ship not being able to meet her commitments. As Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (PNSV) is an industry leader in Zone or Group Technology execution methods, it is particularly disruptive to work flow to return to geographic areas and perform work in an area out of phase—or even worse—in an area where similar work is already complete. With the innovation of Zone Technology, it was clear that a consistent and effective risk assessment method must be developed to determine the probability of equipment failure during the testing phase of the overhaul and the impact on cost and schedule to the overhaul. The USS Kidd (DD-963) scheduled availability in 1989 proved to be the ideal opportunity to develop and execute a formal risk assessment and management program. The USS Constellation (CV-64) SLEP availability in 1990 afforded the opportunity to refine and expand the risk assessment methodology.</jats:p>",

Hierzulande sind augenblicklich unter raumpolitischen Aspekten zwei zeitstrukturelle Umbrüche besonders aktuell: Erstens die Angliederung einer „geschützten Zone im Überfluß vorhandener Zeit“ (ehemalige DDR) an die Stufe „komprimierter Zeit“ im Westen und die Auswirkungen einerseits im angegliederten Raum, andererseits im raumpolitischen Bereich; zweitens die räumlichen und raumpolitischen Auswirkungen der neuen Beschleunigungsstufe (‚Globalisierung‘) der internationalen Wirtschaftsprozesse, die hauptsächlich durch die neuen Informations- und Kommunikationstechniken ermöglicht wurde. Hiermit scheint – im Trend unterstützt durch raumstrukturierende Politik, wie in früheren Fällen – ein neuer Veränderungsschub in der Siedlungsstruktur- und Raumstrukturentwicklung einherzugehen, mit erheblichen ökologischen und sozialpolitisch bedenklichen Folgen und mit starken räumlichen Unterschieden unter quantitativen und qualitativen Gesichtspunkten.</jats:p>"

The proposals in Working for Patients, which involve the separation of funding from the provision of services, and the proposals for community care in Caring for People have profound consequences for the planning and provision of services for the so-called priority groups. Planning teams, which were first established after the 1974 reorganisation, have been one of the main vehicles for planning coordinated care for such groups. The current study, which updates earlier findings, was carried out shortly before the publication of Working for Patients. It found an increased number of planning teams catering for a wider range of client groups, increasing unit involvement in care group planning and more emphasis on joint planning with local authorities. The implications of the findings for the post-review NHS are discussed, in particular the future of joint planning, the future of CHC involvement in planning and the future of planning teams themselves. </jats:p>",

Distance ranging sensors, mounted on the body of each manipulator link, are simulated here to estimate the proximity of an obstacle. The sensory data is analyzed through a fuzzy controller which estimates whether a collision is imminent, and if so, employs a geometric approach to compute the joint movements necessary to avoid the collision. Obstacles can sometimes move uncompromisingly in the environment attempting a deliberate collision. Strategies to deal with such cases are presented and recovery procedures to circumvent the obstacle from tight corners are suggested. Cases of link <jats:italic>overlap</jats:italic> have been avoided by considering each link as a body which is sensed as an obstacle by every other link of the same manipulator. Suitable examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithm.</jats:p>",

Three hundred and sixty people were interviewed in each city in relation to their attitudes toward water issues, their beliefs about representation, and their interests in personal involvement in water planning. At a later date respondents were invited to attend a workshop. Fifteen percent of those invited attended the workshops in each city. There was a relationship between \"intentions\" to participate and actual involvement. Unlike earlier studies there was no relationship between education, income, age, and participation. The major predictors of participation were perceived levels of desirable power for the water authority and intrinsic interest in particular water issues. The article concludes that there is a potentially strong demand for involvement in water-related planning and that there is a need to ensure that involvement is planned with methods appropriate to all sectors of the community. </jats:p>",

This important soil resource has been extensively exploited for the past 25 years, and is therefore subsiding at an excessive rate, In order to reduce this rate of subsidence, better irrigation practices must be introduced along with wind-breaks and cereal rotation. These improved irrigation practices require the availability of large volumes of water in a region where the topography does not allow for the storage of runoff within deep valleys. Furthermore, the procurement of these irrigation volumes must not jeopardise the water supply required by the urban communities and industries. An analysis of the available water supplies indicates that the best choice is the farm pond.</jats:p>",

The simulated price is an annual lease or rental price. The approach, applied to a sample of longline vessels targeting sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the Columbia INPFC area of the United States, indicates substantial potential gain in quasi-rent and economic efficiency from quota trade. The simulated quota exchange also indicates potential for concentration of quota.

Initially, the thrust was on using high-tech activities to promote regional development within an emerging information society. Subsequently, this strategy has been complemented by a policy of regional development based on the leisure and construction industries. Before this policy is outlined attention is focused on examining a conceptual framework for tourism urbanisation and past resort development in Japan. Then the key features of the Comprehensive Regional Resort Preparation Plan, 1987 and its implementation are detailed with reference to case studies in Tohoku, Kanto, and Kyushu and Okinawa. An analysis is also undertaken of key resort facilities with particular reference to golf course development and theme parks. The relevance of concepts fashioned for tourism urbanisation in explaining tourism-led regional development is also considered. Apart from underlining the way in which resorts are blurring the distinction between urban and regional activities the task of monitoring Japanese resort development is highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Because of the increasing globalisation of the economy and reinforced competition, technological change has become an important factor in the restructuring process and in the competitive position of firms and regions. In this paper the author investigates to what extent the innovation process is differentiated across space and in particular how this process is shaped by the locational conditions as well as by the structures and strategies of firms in selected regions. To develop a framework for the analysis, contrasting views about the innovation process at the regional level are presented. In the traditional linear innovation model (product-cycle theory and innovation diffusion) relevant locational factors are stressed and an hierarchical pattern of innovation in space is arrived at. More recent approaches such as the evolutionary and network theories point to the relevance of historically evolved firm structures and strategies. The analysis of the Austrian case demonstrates that each of these models has a certain relevance. There was a pronounced differentiation of innovation across space, which was partly in line with the hierarchical model, such as a concentration of R&amp;D and product innovation in the largest agglomerations. However, strong innovation activities, corresponding more with the evolutionary model, were in addition identified in newly industrialised or even in some of the peripheral rural areas. Structural and behavioural features of the firms, such as organisational characteristics (status, functions, and skills), the strategic orientation as well as network links, in addition to locational factors, were relevant for these patterns. </jats:p>",

AXIS (algorithms combined with knowledge systems in an interactive sequence) is a framework for interactively combining structured algorithms that seek a best solution with knowledge‐based expert systems that seek expert heuristic solutions. This paper tests the framework using an interactive multiple objective integer programming algorithm combined with heuristics taken from the domain of aggregate production planning. The results indicate the AXIS framework can be successful in generating high quality solutions, in vastly reduced solution times compared to the structured algorithms, at much lower costs compared to the expert heuristics working alone.</jats:p>",

The existence of the optimal feedback control is shown with the aid of viscosity solutions to the dynamic programming equations. Turnpike set concepts are introduced to characterize the optimal inventory levels. It is proved that the turnpike set is an attractor set for the optimal trajectories provided that the capacity is assumed to be fixed at a level exceeding the maximum possible demand. Conditions under which the optimal trajectories enter the convex closure of the set in finite time are given. The structure of turnpike sets is analyzed. Last but not least, it is shown that the turnpike sets exhibit a monotone property with respect to capacity and demand. It turns out that the monotonicity property helps in solving the optimal production problem numerically, and in some cases, analytically. </jats:p>",

Die zu ergreifenden Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Erhaltungszustandes sollten, vor allem im Hinblick auf eine langfristige Qualitätssicherung und eine effiziente Mittelverwendung, einer ursachengerechten Strategie folgen. Vor diesem Hintergrund analysiert der vorliegende Beitrag die bestehenden Struktur- und Intensitätsunterschiede im Gefüge der Ursachen des unzureichenden Erhaltungszustandes der materiellen kommunalen Infrastruktureinrichtungen in Ost und West. Daran anknüpfend wird versucht, orientiert an den besonderen Rahmenbedingungen in Ostdeutschland und vor dem Hintergrund westdeutscher Erfahrungswerte, Empfehlungen für die Ausgestaltung einer infrastrukturellen Qualitätssicherung in den neuen Bundesländern zu geben. Es zeigt sich dabei, daß nur in einer gesamthaften Perspektive, die neben den Kommunen auch Bund und Länder umfaßt, die Anknüpfungspunkte für notwendige Gegenmaßnahmen aufgezeigt werden können. Trotz der zahlreichen Unterschiede in den Determinantenstrukturen Ost- und Westdeutschlands passen viele Konzepte, die ursprünglich für westdeutsche Kommunen entworfen wurden, auch auf die Situation der Gemeinden in den neuen Bundesländern.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The interregional cohort survival model developed by Rogers is an excellent one that includes all of the three population processes: birth-death, aging, and interregional migration. Rogers's model, however, has been rarely implemented because it requires detailed data concerning cohortwise (that is by age and sex) interregional migration tables which are not usually available as published data. The most usual case is that only marginal tables that are from different sources can be obtained. However, in this case, those marginal tables necessarily show inconsistency in the sense that they do not have identical common submarginals. This inconsistency prevents the standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure from converging to the estimate of the complete migration table which conforms to the given observed marginals. Thus to implement Rogers's model some method is needed to estimate the complete migration table where only inconsistent marginals are available. In this paper a multistep IPF procedure is proposed for that purpose and an actual application of the proposed method is shown. The multistep IPF procedure has universal applicability to a wide class of general problems concerned with the estimation of a joint table under inconsistent marginals. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> British housing policy has, since 1979, been dominated by a shift from collectivist to market-oriented strategies. The single most important element of this policy shift has been the sale of public-sector dwellings to sitting tenants. The patterns of such sales have been well documented, but the longer-term effects on the broader housing market are less well understood. This paper is a report of the results of a research project into the resale by purchasing tenants of Scottish Special Housing Association dwellings over the period 1979–90. The findings are placed in the broader context of the general government housing policy aimed at widening the access to owner occupation for lower-income households. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of the sale of public-sector dwellings is more likely to widen choice for existing owners rather than to increase access to owner occupation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper provides a contribution to the geographies of advertising and the media. The authors examine the ways in which commercial television companies try to attract advertising to their regions; advertising being their main source of revenue. Competition based on the cost of advertising in particular regions is effectively restricted. This market failure results in regionally uneven allocations of advertising money, and hence an uneven regional pattern of TV company revenues. Other forms of competition are used to attempt to change this. TV companies promote their regions to advertisers and advertising agencies in ways varying from the production of ‘hard’ data to full-blown campaigns designed to promote or alter regional ‘images’. They also provide various services and cost incentives. It is argued that the deregulation of commercial television, which introduces intraregional competition, will not correct the market failure and will, if anything, reinforce the uneven allocation of advertising monies and media revenues. It is also suggested that intraregional competition will reduce regional promotion, the main competitive strategy that has been used to try to offset regional differences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> All 38 geriatric assessment service units identified in Michigan were surveyed and responded as a component of planning a statewide network of diagnostic and assessment services for patients with dementia. Most units were outpatient (71 percent), urban (71 percent), and hospital-based (82 percent). Some provided primarily geropsychiatric services (21 percent), while the rest provided general geriatric services. The staff included physicians (95 percent), nurses (100 percent), social workers (95 percent) and other professionals (SO percent) such as nutritionists, neuro psychologists or clinical pharmacists. Assessments performed by most units included physical (92 percent), psychosocial (95 percent), functional (95 percent), neurological (71 percent) mental (95 percent), and financial (89 percent). Patient referral sources were most frequently self/family, followed by physician, community agencies, and community mental health. Reasons for referral were most often confusion! memory loss, followed by behavior change, caregiver stress, depression, and evaluation for placement. Most patients seen were between 65 and 84 years of age (72 percent), lived within 25 miles of the unit (87 percent), and had dementia (62 percent). Urban sites assessed significantly more persons per month (19 percent) than non-urban sites (4 percent). Community-based services spent significantly more time per month on geriatric assessments (68 hours) than did hospital-based services (26 hours). These survey results will aid the development of a statewide network of dementia diagnostic and assessment services. </jats:p>",
