The article first charts the broad character of administrative discretion and the limits of discretion. Potential problems include a lack of accountability, manipulation, unpredictability, intrusiveness, and poor decision making. The second section of the article examines one area of value-based planning—progressive planning. It concludes that administrative discretion may provide enough space for value-based planning, but using discretion for such actions often requires testing a set of ethical and political limits of working within governments. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, there is anxiety about the performance of these affordable loans. The key concern stems from the fear that affordable loans may be riskier than other loan products. This article reviews the research evidence and explores two types of reasons for the conflicting nature of that evidence. These reasons include the practices of the institutions involved in mortgage lending and methodological considerations. Implications for research and policy are derived from the review. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on a brief survey in the autumn of 1998, the current situation in regional forest planning in Switzerland is presented. This new approach of regional forest planning is intended for all forests in all the cantons, but has, however, only been realised in a few cases. The putting into practice of this planning system on the owners' level is of great interest. Three examples from different regions of Switzerland present solution approaches. On a more theoretical level, new directions for the development of modern management planning are shown. The fixing of a strategy with regard to products and performances, conceptional process planning and the organisation of strategic and of operative controlling are decisive. Thus, a management plan is primarily a management instrument for the forest enterprise director and should, therefore, also be elaborated by him or her. The alterations thus involved are not yet generally accepted, but will surely be realised in the short term, thanks to the close relationship between the forest service and the forest owners.</jats:p>",

In the future, it was replaced by other, more modern and effective flaps. However, in recent years, in the treatment of hand injuries, the pedunculated inguinal flap has experienced a rebirth [4]. And this is due to its undoubted advantages over other methods of skin plastic surgery. The inguinal flap can be taken quite large, and the donor site suffers slightly. If microsurgical reconstruction is to be performed in the future, then it is better to perform it on the hand, where microvascular anastomoses have not been done before.</jats:p>"

The method used to measure electron density has a greater effect than the differences between scanners, or the kilovoltage used on a given scanner. The effect of variation of these slopes on the accuracy of radiotherapy treatment planning is analysed. For typical radiotherapy beams, to produce a 1% error in dosimetry would require errors of over 8% in bone electron density. Using a single pair of calibration lines for all the scanners reported would give dosimetric errors of under 0.8%.

We clarified the planning context, assessed the tourism market potential, and structured objectives with a series of interviews. In a multi-stakeholder workshop, the objectives were ranked and weighted, and new alternatives were developed. Tourism planning in Guimaras has been substantially changed as a result of these activities, with two new approaches being pursued. This case study, and our past experience, suggest value-focused thinking is useful “decision therapy.” </jats:p>",

These approaches consider a form of equity between current and future generations, as represented by the periods in a planning horizon. Both nominal net revenue in each period and each period's present net worth with values discounted relative to each period, are used as criteria for welfare. The minimum present net worth or net revenue outcome obtained for the set of periods is maximized. The approaches are different. Using present net worth relative to each period as a criterion allows for a concern for economic efficiency and allows variation in net revenue. Using net revenue focuses on a more even distribution of net revenue between periods. The approaches are tested in a case study, and the results are compared to those from a standard approach of maximizing present net worth relative to the first period. The results suggest that the approaches could be useful in a forest planning context, either as an alternative to standard approaches or as a means of generating relevant information. For.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Knowledge engineering for planning is expensive and the resulting knowledge can be imperfect. To autonomously learn a plan operator definition from environmental feedback, our learning system WISER explores an instantiated literal space using a breadth‐first search technique. Each node of the search tree represents a state, a unique subset of the instantiated literal space. A state at the root node is called a seed state. WISER can generate seed states with or without utilizing imperfect expert knowledge. WISER experiments with an operator at each node. The positive state, in which an operator can be successfully executed, constitutes initial preconditions of an operator. We analyze the number of required experiments as a function of the number of missing preconditions in a seed state. We introduce a naive domain assumption to test only a subset of the exponential state space. Since breadth‐first search is expensive, WISER introduces two search techniques to reorder literals at each level of the search tree. We demonstrate performance improvement using the naive domain assumption and literal‐ordering heuristics. To learn the effects of an operator, WISER computes the delta state, composed of the add list and the delete list, and parameterizes it. Unlike previous systems, WISER can handle unbound objects in the delta state. We show that machine‐generated effects definitions are often simpler in representation than expert‐provided definitions.</jats:p>",

Motivated by the attempt to address this situation, I offer this discussion as an exegetical account of some of Spivak's principle categories and arguments. I demonstrate how certain themes, such as the aporia, catachresis, subalternity, and the relationship between the narrow and the general, function in Spivak's work as signposts en route to her formulation of postcolonialism as a deconstructive scenario. Crucial to this formulation is a type of political economy of intellectual production and academic work and the situating of the latter with respect to the international division of labour, informed by a Marxian critique of capital and, in particular, Marx's concept of value. Spivak demonstrates, via Marx, that an economic logic underwrites the practice of representation, in general, and, hence, all intellectual and academic work, in particular. Ironically, Spivak's idiosyncrasy with respect to the mobilisation of Marx in her work, and one of the reasons for her perceived difficulty, lies in the unexpectedness of her orthodoxy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Is geographical migration a consequence of the end of unemployment or does it help in finding a job? This question is approached within the general framework of human capital theory. Two main categories of determinants may be distinguished. The first is termed the decisionmaking context and groups factors which are intrinsic to the individual (such as gender or age) and factors which are related to spatial issues (such as employment or economic conditions in an area). The second category is formed by the human capital available at the moment of the choice. The aim of this paper is to take past investment into consideration and incorporate the fact that some decisions may be joint ones. A model is introduced in the form of a system of two simultaneous equations with qualitative endogenous variables. The test is based on a 1993 survey of 1176 young rural people of seven areas of France. A main finding is that migrations of young rural people are essentially the result of professional preoccupations. However, migration is not a factor which always helps in finding a job, when people are unemployed. When a young person has a good initial training, he or she has to migrate (and leave a rural area) to get a job. Yet, migration does not seem to be necessary for less trained people. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article describes the implementation of a promotion-event forecasting system, PromoCast™, and its performance in several pilot applications and validity studies. Pilot studies involved retail grocery chains with 95 to 185 stores per trading area. The goal was to provide short-term, tactical forecasts useful for planning promotions from a retailer's perspective. Thus, the forecast system must be able to handle any of the over 150,000 UPCs in each store's item master file, and must be scalable to produce approximately 800,000,000 forecasts per year across all the retailers served by efficient marketing services, inc. (ems, inc.). This is a much different task than one that confronts a manufacturer, even one with a broad product line. Manufacturers can benefit from custom modeling in a product line or category. Retailers need a production system that generates forecasts that help promotion planning. Marketing scientists have typically approached promotion analysis from the manufacturer's perspective. One objective of this article is to encourage marketing scientists to rethink promotion analysis from a different perspective.</jats:p><jats:p>From the retailer's point of view the “planning unit” is the promotion event. Neither weekly store-tracking data nor shopping-trip data from consumer panels are easily aggregated to reflect total sales during a promotion event. We describe the promotion-event databases and the statistical model developed using these databases. The data are the strategic asset. Our goal is to help retailers use their data to increase the profitability of promotions. We have data on the performance of each UPC in each store under a variety of promotion conditions, on each store's adeptness at executing various styles of promotions, as well as on chain-wide historical performance for each UPC. We use many historical averages from these databases to build a 67-variable, regression-style model. The forecast incorporates a simple bias correction needed when using a log-transformed dependent variable (the natural log of total unit sales). We argue that the historical averages matching the planned ad and display conditions provide a benchmark superior to the widely used “base-times-lift” method. When aggregated into case units (the natural unit for product ordering), 69% of the forecasts in our first validation study were within ± one case compared to 39% within ± one case using the appropriate historical averages. We report the results of two over-time validity studies that reflect the value of our model for retailers. The limitations and implications of this planning tool for managerial decision making concerning stocking levels are discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>Whenever historical data are the strategic asset we face inherent limitations. Our model does not forecast new products. The forecast error increases when an existing product is promoted in a new way. Over 99.5% of the time, we have full data from which to create a forecast. However, with a database for a typical chain market containing over 20 million promotion events in the 30-month time frame we use, 100,000 events have less than ideal data. The breadth of the database (typically 150,000 UPS) makes it impractical to incorporate data on competitive offerings. We find that regression-style modeling is not adept at incorporating information on the 1,200 subcommodities managed in our pilot stores or the 1,000 manufacturers who supply those stores.</jats:p><jats:p>Despite these limitations we show the value of using promotion-event data, how tactical forecasts based on these data can directly impact the bottom line of grocery retailers, and how store-by-store forecasts can help retailers with problems of running out of stock or overstocking.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite three decades of continuous research on gentrification, there are a number of areas where understanding of this process still remains quite rudimentary, especially with respect to the actual process of gentrification itself. The author seeks to focus attention upon this issue by examining how historic change to property ownership and tenure structure of housing induced by gentrification impacted upon the unfolding of this process in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe from 1960 to 1986. By using an empirical analysis he reveals that a synchronisation existed between the market behaviour of small-scale property owners, working-class incumbent upgraders, and middle-class homebuyers and renters which had a significant bearing upon both the timing and the extent of gentrification activity in the case study. In addition, once a less orthodox method of measurement was employed, social replacement was found to operate alongside social displacement. The implications of these findings suggest that the process of gentrification is much more complex than has been previously inferred in the empirical literature and that this particular form of neighbourhood change can follow a number of possible trajectories, as has been more recently asserted in cross-cultural research. </jats:p>",

Borne of exhaustion rather than tiredness, the dream-work lends consistency to a host of fragments drawn from the milieux of spatial science, political economy, poststructuralist philosophy, postmodern sociology, twentieth-century literature, and popular culture. As a work composed in the dead of night, the authors follow Deleuze and Foucault in affirming not the omniscient light of Bentham's generalised, ‘all-seeing’ Panopticon, but the ‘dark light’ of the blind power lurking in the shadowy world of the Dark Panopticon. Surprisingly, the exemplary mise-en-scéne for the resulting foray into the Heart of Darkness turns out to be the greengrocery that is invariably situated at the gateway to every supermarket and hypermarket. It is here that the authors sense the unbearable violence perpetrated against the flesh of the world—the flesh of soft fruit and animals, no less than the flesh of ourselves and the earth—and it is from here that the revenge of the zombie flesh takes hold (fetishistic depersonalisation and deindividuation), The authors argue that the human being is suspended, undone, and disseminated between the information society and the consumer society. Only our ‘en-trails’ are left amidst the flesh of the world. This undead dreamworld is less Orwellian than Kafkaesque: infinite suspense and perpetual regret. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A common event in the consumer packaged goods industry is the negotiation between a manufacturer and a retailer of the sales promotion calendar. Determining the promotion calendar involves a large number of decisions regarding levels of temporary price reductions, feature ads, and in-store displays, each executed at the level of individual retail accounts and brand SKUs over several months or a year. Though manufacturers spend much of their marketing budget on trade promotions, they lack decision support systems to address the complexity and dynamics of promotion planning. Previous research has produced insights into how to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional events, but has not addressed the planning problem in a dynamic environment. This paper develops a disaggregate-level econometric model to capture the dynamics and heterogeneity of consumer response. By modeling the purchase incidence (timing), choice and quantity decisions of consumers we decompose total sales into incremental and nonincremental (baseline plus borrowed). </jats:p><jats:p> The response model forms the basis of a market simulator that permits us to search for the manufacturer's optimal promotion calendar (subject to a set of constraints, some of them imposed by the retailer) via the simulated annealing algorithm. Calendar profits are the net result of the contribution from incremental sales minus the opportunity cost from giving away discounts to nonincremental sales and the fixed costs associated with implementing promotional events (e.g., retagging, features, displays). Incremental sales result from promotion-induced switching, the acceleration and quantity promotion effects on those switchers, increased consumption and the carryover effect from purchase event feedback. </jats:p><jats:p> We applied our approach to the promotion-planning problem of a large consumer-packaged goods company in a nonperishable, staple product category suggested by company executives (canned tomato sauce). Subject to a retailer pass-through constant rate of 80%, provided to us by the collaborating firm, the optimal promotion calendar produced by the modeling system followed a pattern of frequent and shallow temporary price reductions with no feature or display activity. We also analyze how that result would change under different retailer pass-through scenarios. </jats:p><jats:p> Our findings indicated that the manufacturer could substantially improve the profitability of its sales promotion activity and that there would be a concurrent positive effect on retailer profit and volume levels. Management reported to us that the insights from the use of the system were implemented in their promotion-planning process and produced positive results. A validation analysis on follow-up data for one market showed that promotion activity could be significantly reduced, as recommended, with no adverse effect on the brand's market share, as predicted. </jats:p><jats:p> To generalize the model beyond the specific category where it was implemented, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the profile of the calendar (i.e., frequency, depth, and duration of deals) with respect to changes in market response, competitive activity, and retailer pass-through. First, we found that the optimal depth, frequency, and timing of discounts is stable for price elasticities ranging from near zero to around four (in absolute magnitude). We also found no systematic impact of competitive promotions on the profile of the optimal calendar. For example, variation in competitive activity did not affect the optimal depth or frequency of discounts. Lastly, we found changes in retailer pass-through to have a significant effect on the optimal depth and number of weeks of trade promotion that a manufacturer should offer. This emphasizes the importance to manufacturers of having accurate estimates of pass-through for purposes of promotion budgeting and planning. </jats:p>",

These include pure markets; impure markets without government; voluntary agreements on externality solutions; clubs and other near-market mechanisms of supplying quasi-public goods; and rigid zone-planning. In a second paper we describe how the model is embedded in a nondeterministic CA algorithm that yields simulated land-use patterns.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Three images of ocean space are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and planning circles and popular culture: The image of the ocean as an empty void to be annihilated by hypermobile capital; as a resource-rich but fragile space requiring rational management for sustainable development; and as a source of consumable spectacles. In this paper I locate the emergence of these three apparently contradictory images of the ocean within structural contradictions in the spatiality of capitalism, which, in turn, are precipitating a crisis in marine regulation. To analyze these contradictions, I begin with a historical study of industrial-era marine uses, regulations, and representations. This is followed by an analysis of the present crisis and its associated representational discourses. I conclude with a call for analyses of ocean space that probe beneath marine imagery so as to explore the regulatory crises and social conflicts that underlie marine-policy debates and that reveal the ocean's potential as a site of social transformation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Landscape‐based planning, and in particular ecosystem management, has been promoted widely as an approach to linking ecological, social, and economic concerns at large spatial and temporal scales, yet there have been few comparative studies of actual projects. We used a mailed questionnaire and four case studies within the Pacific Northwest region of the United States to explore the ways in which ecological analyses are being integrated with landscape planning projects and to identify linkages between science and public involvement. Specifically, we wanted to learn: (a) what types of ecological science are being used in landscape‐based planning projects, (b) what factors most limit the application of ecological analyses to land planning processes, (c) how ecological information and analyses are being integrated with stakeholder participation, and (d) what appear to be the key strategies for developing productive links between ecological science and public involvement. Results from the questionnaire show the ecologichl complexities of attempting to manage large landscapes, exemplified by the broad array of ecological issues and stressors that projects attempt to address, the high degree to which they are attempting to analyze them scientifically, and the wide array of assessments and analytical techniques they are using to do so. While both public involvement and scientific research generally had strong influences on planning and management decisions, there appeared to be less effective exchanges between researchers and stakeholders. Based on the case studies, we identified key strategies for strengthening the links between ecological science and public involvement in three principal areas: ecosystem analysis, linking science to the public via community outreach and education, and employing economic development as an ecosystem restoration and management strategy. To implement these strategies requires reconceptualizing the roles of both scientists and stakeholders so as to improve the integration of applied ecological science with democratic decisionmoting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I seek to examine a set of tactile, habitually grounded, bodily modes of perception which lie at the centre of Walter Benjamin's analysis of urban experience under modernity. On first reading of Benjamin's later writings, particularly his various interpretations of Baudelaire, these tactile, distracted modes of perception appear to represent a profound experiential entropy; a dilution of real affective experience which Benjamin sees as defining modernity, However, it is possible to trace the outline of a richer and more far-reaching phenomenology of perception within Benjamin's thought. This is what I seek to do. In seeking to trace out this phenomenology I argue that although such tactile, distracted, habitually grounded modes of perception are intertwined in an economy of self-defence, they also contain within them a whole range of capacities for knowing and getting hold of the urban, Following the lead of earlier interpreters of Benjamin such as Marleen Stoessel, Miriam Hansen, and Jürgen Habermas I also argue that these modes of perception stand in a particular relationship to the ‘auratic’. In exploring this relationship Benjamin outlines a novel theory of intersubjectivity between humans and the nonhuman. This clement of the intersubjective is not only important in understanding Benjamin's work, it also suggests a range of productive avenues for enframing an ethics of encounter within the contemporary city. </jats:p>",

A wide range of scholars, policymakers, and business leaders now argue that the post-Fordist economy requires greater levels of employee involvement, participation, and empowerment, and a new set of management practices have been developed to secure this new culture of work. In this paper we explore these developments and point to the different ways in which terms such as involvement, empowerment, participation, and partnership can be mobilised in the workplace. Moreover, research suggests that new management practices and cultures of work have evolved in different ways across space, crafting an uneven geography of new management practice. In this regard, we look at the ways in which some employee-owned firms in Ohio, America, have been the arena for considerable managerial experiment in fostering employee participation. Although we acknowledge the limitations of employee ownership, empirical material from two majority employee-owned firms illustrates the way in which employees have been able to take a greater role in the business. Employee ownership is much further advanced in the United States than the United Kingdom, and there is scope for building on US experiences in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

Using the Cervero and Wilson theoretical framework, a qualitative case study of an AIDS community services agency was conducted using interviews with staff and board members, participant-observations of three programs, and analysis of agency documents. The study showed that, except for a one-hour segment of one program, the overall AIDS education efforts were not culturally relevant for African-American women. Three factors accounted for this lack of cultural relevancy: (a) the organizational image and financing were directed toward the interests of its white gay male leadership, (b) the internal interpretation of the agency's educational mission did not include a focus on African-American women, and (c) the organizational structure did not support substantive representation of the interests of African-American women in regard to programmatic decisions. It is concluded that power relations manifested themselves concretely through these factors in the social and organizational context, which by defining African-American learners as generic entities, produced undifferentiated educational programs. </jats:p>",

These defects include the scale dependency of the index, the inappropriate treatment of positive and negative numbers, the unequal weights assigned to the indicators used and the difficulties introduced by using a nonlinear structure for the index. Recent decisions to modify the ILD do not address these defects and one change that has been mooted would exaggerate the scale bias. Suggestions are made for what should be done in replacing and supplementing the ILD to provide a better basis for assessing relative need. </jats:p>",

The paper explores reasons why some children are more likely to attend meetings than others, and uses material from interviews with children and adults to understand the part which children take in meetings when they do attend. The attendance of children at review meetings has exposed some ambiguity in their purpose, and the paper argues for a re‐evaluation of the place of reviews in relation to other processes.

Little is known about the sources of funds for those campaigns, and research on the 1997 general election has shown that for most parties the legal requirement to disclose where they obtain their income does not result in the disclosure of original sources of their income. As at previous elections, however, the amounts spent in the constituencies have an impact on the outcome, sustaining the case for regulation; much is spent outside the legal constraints, however, and it is difficult to envisage ways in which this might be regulated.</jats:p>",

We examine the privatisation of the water industry in Bolivia and chart how, in this industry, neoliberalism and globalisation are coming together in new ways and are creating new, and sometimes conflicting, institutional and geographical contexts through which water resources must now be viewed. These issues are examined through the example of Misicuni, a big-dam project in the province of Cochabamba. The debates around this project raise a series of questions. What roles do cultural understandings of water play in contemporary regional and national constructions of ‘modernisation’ in Bolivia? Are processes of globalisation and privatisation in the water industry strengthening or weakening marginalised regional identities in the Andes? Is neoliberal hegemony being promoted in the region as a result of privatisation or is the restructuring of the water industry facilitating the emergence of alternative development discourses of resistance? </jats:p>",

In laying claim to its own knowledge, language, and values, this concern for place provides a legitimate authority for local people to challenge outside representations of their space. As a result, I suggest that the practice of participation may be bringing about a retreat from the national vision of traditional conservation and a fragmentation of conservation ideas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The countries of Central Europe have been undergoing major structural transformations since the collapse of Soviet and communist domination towards the end of 1989. However, there has been a relative scarcity of published research on the impact of these transformations on the development of real estate markets in these countries. The authors aim to rectify in part this lack by examining the process of development of real estate markets in the three Central European cities of Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest. Their analysis is focused on the development of markets in the larger commercial activities in urban areas, particularly the office and retail sectors. To this end the authors utilise the structure-and-agency model as their basic methodological approach to identify and examine the overall socioeconomic and political structure which governs the activities of real estate markets and the main agents or actors involved in these activities. They first examine the impact of the continuing societal transformations in terms of the legal framework, restitution of private property, and privatisation on the reemergence and development of real estate markets in the studied cities. The authors then go on to consider the development of real estate markets in more detail by using the results of field surveys carried out in the above cities during 1993 and 1994 to examine the organisation, behaviour, and stage of development of the real estate markets through an analysis of the development of the real estate professionals, the role and behaviour of local and international firms, and factors inhibiting the activities of these firms and limiting the growth of the real estate markets. The authors conclude by arguing that, in addition to the structural reforms, the role of international investment and foreign firms has been crucial in the rapid development and growth of the real estate markets in the studied cases. Nevertheless, lack of further investment finance, particularly local finance, is a major obstacle to the further growth and development of the real estate market and industry in these cities. Moreover, although these markets have developed remarkably rapidly since the end of 1989, they are still in an immature state of development in comparison with Western European markets. This, however, does not negate the fact that they still offer good opportunities for international investment at acceptable rates of return. </jats:p>",

These have been explored and implemented by Essex and Suffolk Water and the Environment Agency through the ‘drought reliable output program’(DROP) project. The needs and benefits of a more user‐friendly platform are reviewed, and issues relating to the lack of a general quantifiable measure of reliability (both in yield assessment for planning purposes and the optimization of operation of water‐resource systems) are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous research has demonstrated the importance of attention in the development of survey (or configurai) knowledge of the environment. However, it is unclear if attention is also necessary for the development of route knowledge. Our aim in this paper is to evaluate the specific role of attention in the acquisition of both route and survey knowledge during simulated navigation. In four experiments, subjects in a condition of full or divided attention were presented a series of routes through a simulated environment. Spatial learning was assessed by having subjects discriminate between old and novel route segments in a subsequent recognition test. Novel route segments consisted of old landmarks from the same route but in the wrong order or with wrong turns, or consisted of old landmarks from two separate routes, or contained old landmarks in new spatial relations to one another. Divided attention disrupted memory for sequences of landmarks (experiment 1), landmark—turn associations (experiment 2), landmark—route associations (experiment 3), and spatial relations between landmarks (experiment 4). Together, these results show that even relatively simple components of spatial learning during navigation require attention. Furthermore, divided attention disrupts the acquisition of spatial knowledge at both the route level and the survey level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographic information systems (GISs) offer a powerful tool to geographers, foresters, statisticians, public health officials, and other users of spatially referenced regional data sets. However, as useful as they are for data display and trend detection, they typically feature little ability for statistical inference, leaving the user in doubt as to the significance of the various patterns and ‘hot spots’ identified. Unfortunately, classical statistical methods are often ill suited for this complex inferential task, dealing as it does with data which are multivariate, multilevel, misaligned, and often nonrandomly missing. In this paper we describe a Bayesian approach to this inference problem which simultaneously allows interpolation of missing values, estimation of the effect of relevant covariates, and spatial smoothing of underlying causal patterns. Implemented via Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational methods, the approach automatically produces both point and interval estimates which account for all sources of uncertainty in the data. After describing the approach in the context of a simple, idealized example, we illustrate it with a data set on leukemia rates and potential geographic risk factors in Tompkins County, New York, summarizing our results with numerous maps created by using the popular GIS Arc/INFO. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Different capital-structure theories are reviewed in order to formulate testable propositions concerning the levels of debt in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and a number of regression models are developed to test the hypotheses, The statistical results indicate that age and profitability, are negatively related to gearing, whereas size, asset structure, risk, nondebt tax shields, and the level of debtors each have a positive relationship with gearing. These relationships are maintained over time, but the magnitude and significance of the coefficients vary over business economic cycles, The results indicate that the last recession may have changed the borrowing behaviour of small businesses. After the dramatic experiences of the longest and deepest UK recession, small-business owners appear to be more cautious in raising external finance, and the results suggest that they may wish to grow only when there are sufficient internally generated funds, especially profits, to finance new investments. The results also suggest that the last recession had an effect on the lending behaviour of financial institutions, which still appear to be more cautious in their lending policies—even after the recession. The authors examine a number of policy implications that emanate from the findings, and discuss a number of possible actions that the government could undertake in order to enhance the financial development and prosperity of SMEs across the economic cycle. </jats:p>",

However, explanations for the development of environmental policies in these countries have been relatively sparse compared with those of their industrial policies, The author attempts to widen our understanding of environmental-policy development in East Asia by examining one notable state intervention in pollution issues in South Korea—the evacuation of the pollution victims of Ulsan and Onsan in the mid 1980s under the authoritarian Chun Doo-Hwan regime. This Korean case study shows a pattern of policy development primarily driven by particular ‘interests' (the perceived political-survival needs of state elites), with changes in external conditions, policy legacies, and policy efforts playing supplementary roles. In particular, the state intervention is interpreted as an anticipatory concession to the pollution victims by the state elites who aimed to stabilize their regime by alienating the victims from antiregime activists. The author also indicates the possibility of applying the theories established in the context of liberal democracy to authoritarian political regimes, and draws attention to the change and continuity in the development of environmental politics and policy in East Asia. </jats:p>",

A key feature of the social exclusion discourse has been its emphasis on paid work as a mechanism of integration. The author outlines how ex-offenders are excluded from the labour market. The consequences for crime and implications for policy focused on the New Deal are also discussed. The key findings are that exclusion is as much a social and political phenomenon as an economic one. Consequently, the focus of the New Deal on reinforcing immediate labour-market attachment by enhancing individual employability is unlikely to succeed in reintegrating ex-offenders through work. The central challenge for policy remains the tackling of inequality in the labour market. </jats:p>",
