      "abstract": "<jats:p> The reputed ‘difficulty’ of the texts of Gayatri Spivak poses an obstacle to potentially productive reflection on, and debate surrounding, her critical positions and analyses. Motivated by the attempt to address this situation, I offer this discussion as an exegetical account of some of Spivak's principle categories and arguments. I demonstrate how certain themes, such as the aporia, catachresis, subalternity, and the relationship between the narrow and the general, function in Spivak's work as signposts en route to her formulation of postcolonialism as a deconstructive scenario. Crucial to this formulation is a type of political economy of intellectual production and academic work and the situating of the latter with respect to the international division of labour, informed by a Marxian critique of capital and, in particular, Marx's concept of value. Spivak demonstrates, via Marx, that an economic logic underwrites the practice of representation, in general, and, hence, all intellectual and academic work, in particular. Ironically, Spivak's idiosyncrasy with respect to the mobilisation of Marx in her work, and one of the reasons for her perceived difficulty, lies in the unexpectedness of her orthodoxy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Given the fluctuations and rate of change inherent in today’s business environment, it is more imperative than ever that business schools help prepare students to deal with an uncertain future. By enabling students to embrace uncertainty and to envision multiple future competitive environments, scenario planning provides the ability to craft multiple strategies and contingencies and better prepares today’s students to anticipate tomorrow’s crises. The three-phase approach provides faculty with a contemporary and applicable methodology for revitalizing the marketing strategy course. </jats:p>",
