      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning is concerned both with the im pact of social changes and their causes, but lacks a theoretical framework that can integrate these two concerns. Hence, it often seems caught between palliating the hardships of change or protesting against hardships it is powerless to affect. The paper puts forward a way of thinking about adaptation and change in terms of the structuring of meaning. Social pro cesses can be understood as reproducing, reinforcing or disrupting the structures of meaning on which each of us depends to make sense of our lives. Hierarchies of power, by the way they distribute uncer tainty, influence the kinds of meanings which different sorts of people are able to sustain, and whose lives will be most vulnerable to the loss of the attachments and purposes about which we construct meaning. When these structures of mean ing break down, we experience grief. Grieving is essentially a painful process of retrieving and reconstructing a sense of meaning, which has its collective counterparts. Social changes can provoke a process of rejection and redefinition of relationships, as people work through a shared sense of loss. The concept of meaning relates the unique experience of each individual to the structure of social relationships, as the way this experience is publicly acknowledged, supported or disparaged. Planning is essentially con cerned with this mediation between public and private meanings. </jats:p>",

Together the dimensions define a typology of political representation, within which strategic influence over development policy exists only when both electoral and bureaucratic enfranchisement are strong. But the outcomes of urban redevelopment are also critically affected by economic forces, which determine both private ac tivity to change the built environment and the financial resources available to local government. In general, the higher the level of net private investment in the built environment, the greater the potential ability of lower income neighborhoods to benefit from redevelopment. Without ef fective political power, however, even high levels of investment result primarily in extreme uneven development and displacement. While political and economic forces establish a determinism over which planners have relatively limited control, progressive planners can play im portant roles in broadening the agenda of local politics so as to facilitate political mobilization of lower income communities. </jats:p>",

The main features of the planning exercise are outlined with emphasis placed on the comprehensive nature of the proposals in the plan. The implementation of these strategies is then considered and the failure to realise declared aims of the Master Plan is emphasised. This is attributed in part to the planning agencies failure to implement strategies efficiently and effectively, in part to the erroneous assumptions upon which these strategies are based, and in part to the comprehensive, blue-print approach adopted. In the final section the need for an alternative approach to urban planning is argued, with emphasis placed on the identification of realisable goals, the assessment of priorities, and the need for the involvement of the communities one is attempting to benefit. </jats:p>",

The object of a reconstructed political order is to accomplish integration of the two spaces (Part III).

These include: a lack of involvement in defining the clinical problem; deficiencies in the algorithms for computing dose; failure to compute dose throughout the volume of interest; an inability to handle treatments with noncoplanar beams; failure to provide estimates of error; lack of tools for comparing rival plans; inadequate definition of geometric coverage of anatomic structures by external beams; and failure to provide tools for specifying and verifying the accuracy of treatment delivery. Some suggestions are offered for improvements in some of these areas. In particular, subtraction of dose distributions is proposed as a tool for comparing plans, and displays which exhibit the results of error analyses are presented.</jats:p>",

The model succeeds in integrating physical constraints of reservoir behavior and gas flow in wells, surface pipes, and compressors with variables that describe possible development activities. This enables a development plan that maximizes the economic worth of the gas resources to be found. The mathematical techniques of mixed integer programming (MIP) are used to find the optimal plan.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The gasfield planning model has been developed as a means of finding a development strategy that maximizes the economic worth of a gas field. The model development was undertaken for application to a group of four offshore North Sea reservoirs managed by one operator.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Production from the field began in 1977 with the commissioning of two production platforms serving two of the reservoirs. Since then, two more platforms have been commissioned for the other two reservoirs, and compressors have been installed on one of the original platforms. Installation of compressors on one other platform is planned.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Current production is achieved through 16 wells producing from the Middle Bunter and Rotliegendes formations. The surface gathering system consists of two branches. Each branch comprises a pipeline of diameter 10 in. connecting two platforms. A pipeline 19 in. in diameter transports the gas to a commonly owned trunkline for flow to a shore terminal. The distances between the two pairs of connected platforms are 6 and 2 miles, respectively, and the minimum pressure maintained at the trunkline inlet is 1,200 psi.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The gas from all four reservoirs is dry, with a high proportion of methane. The relative gravity varies between 0.63 and 0.64. The production history suggests that all the reservoirs behave as independent closed systems with negligible water influx. Thus, the average reservoir pressure divided by the gas compressibility can be predicted as a linear function of cumulative gas production from the reservoir.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Total field production is limited by the sales contract quantity. However, within a few years, with the currently installed facilities and the planned additional compressors, production is expected to decline below the contract plateau. This provides the opportunity for further investment to boost the declining rate.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Several available options for increasing the production rate are described in the following.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Workovers</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Of the 16 producing wells, five have significantly lower rates than other wells in the same reservoir and, thus, could be considered for workover. Workover operations are expected to raise these rates to be comparable with the other similar wells. However, the total improvement expected is small, perhaps adding only 10% to the total rate at current pressures.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>New Wells</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The scope for increasing production by drilling additional wells is considerable.

Husbands and wives had the same viewson the ideal size for the average family—5·6 children; this is considerably higher than other European survey findings. Overall, 66% of wives said that they had used some formof contraception and this correlates highly with social class, age of wife, educational level and residence. Use of the pill correlates with residence and age but not with social class or education. One-third of the sample would like more information on the subject of family planning. Although very few gave religious attitudes as a reason for not using birth control in general, 13% stated that the pill was immoral.</jats:p>",

Resources are concentrated in a number of provider organizations, associations, and government agencies, which have common goals as well as a diversity of individual objectives, and therefore enter into networks of relationships to accomplish their overlapping service missions. Interorganizational research shows that it is important to enhance the interdependence and benefits of cooperation between organizations and at the same time maintain the identity and distinctive qualities of each organization. Thus, in addition to the important role to provide information for decisions, planners have a role to manage the interdependencies and identities among organizations in the health system. Research shows that in situations where only methods, data, and analysis were emphasized by health planners, they had less impact on community decisions than in situations where planners also emphasized the development of the interorganizational system of decision-making. In a neutral position with respect to competing forces, planners can more effectively use their leverage from their information processing role and from their regulatory powers to facilitate the balancing of interorganizational interests and to enhance cooperative benefits to the community. </jats:p>",

To determine whether these findings could be applied to strategic decision making in organizations, a review was made of all published field research on the evaluation of formal planning. Formal planning was superior in 10 of the 15 comparisons drawn from 12 studies, while informal planning was superior in only two comparisons. Although this research did not provide sufficient information on the use of various aspects of the planning process, mild support was provided for having participation by stakeholders. Formal planning tended to be more useful where large changes were involved, but, beyond that, little information was available to suggest when formal planning is most valuable. Future research should assess the formal planning process, the situation in which it is used, and its effects on the total system.</jats:p>",

The objective function is expressed in terms of an information loss criterion between the original array and an array of the same size acting as a surrogate for the reduced array. In contrast to the usual application of information theory in planning, where arrays are filled out based on incomplete information, the converse case is implied here, in which a particular partial representation of the array is sought (that is, the aggregated array) which most closely approaches the information content of the original full array. The method is expected to be useful for situations where available large arrays of data need to be appropriately reduced in size so that they can be efficiently used in further computations. Alternatively, the original array may contain current observed data, and the primary aim may be to determine from this array the aggregation scheme to use in future forecasting calculations. Typical applications may include the aggregation of spatial zones, the aggregation of economic sectors in input-output analysis, as well as various clustering problems. </jats:p>",

The first set contains regressions constructed in terms of indicators of structural development only, whereas the second set consists of regressions specified in terms of both types of indicators. It is found that including cyclical indicators into the specification does not meaningfully contribute to the statistical explanation of the employment of migrant workers. However, mixed specifications including the lagged dependent variable demonstrate a slight superiority for a number of individual coefficient statistics. </jats:p>",

A representative needs index is then chosen which is based on multiplying the average local authority service costs by the size of client group and summing over each service group in any authority. This index is estimated for 1974/1975–1980/1981 both for discretionary and for nondiscretionary services. The index is then compared with the grant-related expenditure (GRE) used for rate support grant purposes in 1981/1982. Discrepancies are shown to arise from particular choices of GRE assessment which exclude the large discretionary spending of some large central cities and some Inner London boroughs. </jats:p>",

An analysis of approximately 1500 questionnaires returned by corporate presidents reveals that anticipated tenure is generally little affected by whether the CEO is recruited from within or from outside the organization. However, under conditions of formalized succession planning and when confronted with specific problems, such as modernizing operations, mandates to increase sales and merger operations, there exist differences in anticipated tenure between inside and outside recruited CEOs. These differences are discussed in terms of their implications to corporate level succession planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An inference strategy is presented to assess the goodness-of-fit for logit models. The conventional approach has emphasized likelihood ratio tests in which a distribution for the test statistic is assumed. A more recent development, the prediction success table, is based upon a ratio of predicted to observed choice patterns, yet it is primarily a descriptive index not placed within the context of an inference strategy/hypothesis-testing framework. An alternative method is put forward which uses residuals. Although problematic in a parametric context, residuals can be used in an approach which incorporates both a nonparametric randomization procedure and a sample reuse design. A test statistic is defined and compared to a reference distribution created under the assumption of random variation in the responses with variation in the explanatory variable(s). A numerical example is carried out to investigate the efficacy of using this approach. </jats:p>",
