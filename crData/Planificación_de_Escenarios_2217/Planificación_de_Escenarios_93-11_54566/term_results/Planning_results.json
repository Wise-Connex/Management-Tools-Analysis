      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1980s, many policymakersfacing decreasing revenues and increasing unemployment looked to technology-led development to pump new life into their sagging regional and national economies. One of the ways they attempted to promote this high-tech strategy was through the creation of science parks. But although these parks have demonstrated some potential for enhancing economic growth, they are hardly the economic quick fixes some policymakers believe them to be: successful parks often have taken a decade or more to become economically viable, theirfailure rate is high, and their regional and national economic impacts have been exaggerated. State or governmental support is essential to the success of a science park. This assistance may take many forms-from direct state subsidy, to provision of infrastructure, to simply directing government-related research and development contracts to science park tenants. Locating a park near certain urban features-good transportation linkages, a high-quality residential environment, a university, and a pleasant working environment-is also essential. Science parks are not, in themselves, the answer to promoting regional or national high-technology-led economic development, but they can be one of a number of options available to planners and policymakers as part of a well-thought-out and coordinated development strategy built on regional or national strengths, rather than artificial supports for costly and uncertain high-technology strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1950s and 1960s, rural counties in the United States gained manufacturing employment at a significantly higher rate than did metropolitan counties. From a theoretical perspective, this was unexpected and appeared to contradict existing manufacturing location theory. The product cycle theory was proposed as an explanation, and it quickly gained acceptance. The product cycle model as applied in regional analysis predicts that manufacturing plants will locate in urban areas in early stages of product development to take advantage of highly skilled labor, external economies of subcontractors, and close ties to management. As production becomes standardized, manufacturing will shift to rural areas to take advantage of lower labor costs. There now exists a substantial literature, mostly empirical in nature, concerned with the product cycle theory. This article presents a review and evaluation of this literature in hopes of achieving two goals: the first is to provide a coherent summary of the literature for use by economic development planners. The second is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the product cycle theory and to point out unresolved issues. </jats:p>",

So erhalten zentrale Orte trotz eines steigenden Bedarfs unter Umständen sogar weniger als vorher, eine These, die prinzipiell für jedes denkbare Bedarfsmaß gilt und die bisher gültige Vorstellung eindeutig widerlegt.

Kaum jemand würde es wagen, sanften Tourismus nicht zu wollen.Die Entstehungsgeschichte des „sanften“ oder „auch sozial- und umweltverträglichen“ Tourismus ist eng mit der Entstehung und den Veränderungen der Ökologiebewegung in den 80er Jahren verbunden. Daraus ist einiger ideologischer Ballast erhalten geblieben, der in der Praxis manchmal nicht einfach zu handhaben ist. Das betrifft insbesondere die modernisierungs- und stadtfeindlichen Tendenzen, die im romantischen „Zurück zur Natur“ gipfeln können.Um sanften Tourismus praktisch umzusetzen, muß klar unterschieden werden zwischen drei Dimensionen und fünf Ebenen des sanften Tourismus, die in dem Beitrag näher definiert werden.Die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen der Planung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland erscheinen im Prinzip ausreichend, um eine „sanfte“ Tourismusentwicklung voranzutreiben, jedenfalls, wenn sie kreativ eingesetzt würden. Unterschieden werden muß jedoch im Einsatz der Instrumente deutlich zwischen Gemeinden und Regionen, die ihren Tourismus neu entwickeln wollen (z. B. neue Bundesländer), und solchen, die Überlastungen entgegensteuern wollen (z. B. klassische Urlaubsorte an der See und in den Alpen).Sanfter Tourismus ist kein Planungs-Rezept, sondern eine Grundhaltung vernünftiger Grenzen, Grenzen, die aber immer wieder neu aus gehandelt und für die die Durchsetzungsinstrumente immer wieder neu formuliert werden müssen.</jats:p>"

Die drei Betriebe sind sich im Hinblick auf Entwicklung, Größe und Produktpalette sehr ähnlich. Ihre Entwicklung wurde durch Skalenerträge und externe Effekte begünstigt. Die Betriebe bilden den Kern einer regionalen Monostruktur, die über lange Jahre hinweg den Interessen der Akteure in der Region mehr oder minder weitgehend entsprach. Die Abhängigkeit der regionalen Ökonomie von der Monostruktur führte jedoch in eine Sackgasse der Entwicklung.Aktuelle Konjunktur- und Strukturprobleme, die die Großbetriebe synchron betreffen, haben eine drastisch schrumpfende Beschäftigung in einem stark segmentierten Markt zur Folge. Die Krise mit Arbeitslosenquoten von bisher 15 % (bei weiterhin steil ansteigender Tendenz) wirkt sich besonders problematisch dadurch aus, daß die Stadt Schweinfurt Rekordhalterin bei der Einpendlerquote ist und Erwerbsmöglichkeiten für die gesamte strukturschwache Region bietet.Perspektiven für eine endogene Regionalentwicklung könnten sich allenfalls aus dem Aufbau einer stärker dezentralisierten ökonomischen Struktur ergeben, bei der die Firmen ein Netzwerk aus vielfältigen Beziehungen bilden. Erschwerend für die Umstrukturierung ist jedoch, daß Dienstleistung und Handwerk nur unterproportional am Standort vertreten sind.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nachdem die ehemalige DDR-Übergangsregierung kurz vor ihrer Auflösung im September 1990 die Einrichtung von fünf Nationalparks und sechs Biosphärenreservaten beschlossen hatte, ist auch in den westlichen Ländern die Mitte der 70er Jahre geführte Nationalparkdiskussion neu belebt worden. So wurde in jüngster Zeit für den Nordschwarzwald und den niedersächsischen Harz die Ausweisung großräumiger Nationalparks gefordert, obwohl es sich in beiden Fällen um stark vom Menschen veränderte Gebiete handelt. Am Beispiel des Harzes wird dargelegt, daß die vorgesehene Fläche von rd. 16 000 ha bei weitem nicht den internationalen Kriterien und der Legaldefinition des Bundesnaturschutzgesetzes entspricht. Nur knapp die Hälfte dieser Fläche könnte im Hochharz zusammen mit dem in Sachsen-Anhalt im Brockenbereich bestehenden Nationalpark zu einem gemeinsamen Schutzgebiet ausgewiesen werden. Sinnvoller wäre die Bildung eines „Biosphärenreservates“ im Sinne der UNESCO, in dem „sanfte“ Nutzungen grundsätzlich möglich sind. Abschließend folgt eine Gegenüberstellung der gegenwärtig im Bundesgebiet vorhandenen Nationalparks und Biosphärenreservate.</jats:p>"

It is widely believed that certain exogenous variables, in particular estimates of state income, are useful leading indicators of migration rates. In this paper, panel-data (or longitudinal-data) models are used to represent the relationship between destination-specific out-migration and several explanatory variables. The introduction of this methodology into the migration literature is possible because of some new and improved databases developed by the US Bureau of the Census. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis are used to investigate the incorporation of exogenous factors as variables in the model. One aim in the paper is to use graphical techniques in the understanding of the relationships between migration and these exogenous factors. These techniques provide insight into the strong relationships suggested by the many gravity models that have appeared in the literature. However, when one also includes additional parameters that are estimable in longitudinal-data models, it turns out that there is little additional information in the exogenous factors that is useful for forecasting. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There have been a number of surveys of people's housing-tenure preferences in the last few years, all of which show large majorities preferring to own rather than rent their dwelling. Debate rages, however, about how the survey findings should be interpreted. The theoretical debate has not been helped by the limited information supplied in many of the surveys. Using data in the 1978 General Household Survey (GHS), Littlewood made a more detailed analysis of tenure preferences, providing a basis for future longitudinal studies of changing tenure preferences. In the 1988 GHS, respondents were asked the same questions as in 1978 about their housing-tenure preferences. The findings of the 1988 survey have been analysed and, in this paper, those findings are compared with the results of Littlewood's analysis of the 1978 data and provide some important information which can contribute to a theoretical understanding of changing tenure preferences and to the debates about the meaning of expressed tenure preferences. Where possible Littlewood's methods have been replicated; where this was not possible, an attempt has been made to give an explanation in the appropriate part of the text. Also, Littlewood's analysis has been extended in certain areas. However, it is argued that although some important information is provided in this paper, if an understanding of the significance of people's housing-tenure preferences is to be achieved, more in-depth interviewing of a qualitative or discursive nature is needed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Der strukturelle Wandel in von Großstrukturen dominierten Wirtschaftssektoren verbindet sich regelmäßig mit Entwicklungsbrüchen. Diese Brüche verursachen gravierende soziale Probleme, führen aber auch politisch häufig zu Legitimationsproblemen. Im Hinblick darauf ist es unmittelbar verständlich, daß Strategien zur „kontinuierlichen“ Bewältigung des Strukturwandels auf allen politischen Ebenen immer größtes Interesse finden; diese Feststellung gilt in verstärktem Maße für sogenannte strukturschwache Regionen.Eine derartige Strategie besteht in einer intensiven öffentlichen Förderung des Dienstleistungssektors. Ausgangspunkt ist dabei die Beobachtung, daß die Beschäftigung in den Dienstleistungsbranchen signifikant schneller wächst als in den übrigen Wirtschaftsbereichen. Es liegt somit nahe, Beschäftigungseinbrüche in Krisenbranchen – sei es Stahl, Textil oder Kohle – durch eine Nutzung des Beschäftigungspotentials von Dienstleistungsbetrieben ausgleichen zu wollen. Solche Hoffnungen erscheinen auch insofern nachvollziehbar, als Dienstleistungsbetriebe wegen der für sie typischen geringen Kapitalintensität relativ schnell und dynamisch auf Veränderungen von (kommunal gestaltbaren) Standortfaktoren reagieren können.Diese Hoffnungen gelten in besonderem Maße für den Teilbereich der besonders expansiven, sog. „unternehmensbezogenen“ Dienstleistungen. Neben die positiven Beschäftigungseffekte tritt hier – zumindest bei den hochwertigen Dienstleistungszweigen – ein hohes Qualifizierungsniveau. Darüber hinaus gilt das Vorhandensein dieser Art von Dienstleistungen als Standortfaktor bei der Ansiedlung gewerblicher Betriebe (indirekte Beschäftigungseffekte): Produktionsorientierte Dienste werden so zu Katalysatoren des Strukturwandels.Zentrale Fragen sind dabei: Gibt es aus Sicht der Stadtplanung und Wirtschaftsförderung Strategien zur gezielten Förderung unternehmensbezogener Dienstleistungen? Mit Hilfe welcher Maßnahmen oder Planungspolitiken können die Rahmenbedingungen für bereits vorhandene oder anzusiedelnde Dienstleister verbessert werden? Grundlage für die Beantwortung dieser Fragen bildet eine breit angelegte, empirisch gestützte Untersuchung im Aachener Raum, die eine gezielte Förderung unternehmensbezogener Dienstleistungen im Rahmen abgestimmter städtebaulicher Konzepte zum Gegenstand hatte (1)..</jats:p>"

Usually this process is driven by an outside funding agency who views the planning, design, and construction steps as relatively insignificant milestones in the overall effort required to quickly better a community's sanitary drainage problems. With the exception of very small scale type sanitation projects which have relatively simple replication steps, the development emphasis tends to be on the final treatment plant product with little or no attention specifically focused on community participation and institutionalizing national and local policies and procedures needed for future locally sponsored facilities replication. In contrast to this, the Government of Egypt (GOE) enacted a fresh approach through a Local Development Program with the United States AID program. An overview is presented of the guiding principals of the program which produced the first 24 working wastewater systems including gravity sewers, sewage pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants which were designed and constructed by local entities in Egypt. The wastewater projects cover five different treatment technologies implemented in both delta and desert regions.</jats:p>",

The Department of Health's microcomputer model – Balance of Care – attempts to analyse different policies for the care of the elderly and to assess the consequences of such policies in terms of the resources required. This paper shows how the model operates using data from a survey of elderly people in Northern Ireland. An attempt is also made to introduce economic principles into the decision making process. Attention is drawn to the economist's definition of costs and how this can differ from the public expenditure concept of costs. A further area of interest is the process of allocationg people to specific types of care. The economic approach points to the need to make explicit valuations of the benefits of various services against a background of costs. Within this context, the Balance of Care model can be used to consider various scenarios and as such is a useful tool in the decision making process. </jats:p>",

The emergence of local economic development networks (LEDNs) as critical mediators in attracting new business investment into metropolitan areas is addressed. These networks comprise private and state organizations with major institutionalized stakes in LED. Each organization has a distinct set of powers and responsibilities which generate a division of labor with respect to the attraction of investment into a locality. It is argued that LEDNs are a means of integrating the activities of the different agents into this division of labor. Also explored are the conditions that lead to the formation of networks mediated by relations of trust as a principal means of organizing for LED. LEDNs are seen to be characterized by various power asymmetries, and the implications of these asymmetries for the politics of LED are explored in the final section. Empirical material is drawn upon from extended interviews with representatives of seventy-eight economic development organizations in four major metropolitan areas in Ohio. </jats:p>",

The major objective in this paper is to assess the extent and distribution of FDI between Czechoslovakia (before its breakup), Hungary, and Poland at the beginning of 1992. A detailed examination of the new investment patterns is followed by an analysis of the capital flows by geographical origin of investors and sector of the economy. In addition, the political and economic reasons for emerging regional differences in terms of FDI are discussed. The conclusions are focused on possible scenarios for future FDI in the region and its importance in the European integration process. It is clear that the benefits of direct Western investment in the former Eastern Europe stretch well beyond narrowly defined economic interests. </jats:p>",

In the first part of the paper they discuss two main approaches of international production: internalisation theory and network theory. It is argued that both approaches may be applied in a staged model of internationalisation. In the second part they highlight patterns of internationalisation in the Spanish automotive sector in the last two decades, based on data gathered in Spain in the first months of 1991. The results indicate that both theoretical approaches may be invoked to clarify certain aspects of the Spanish case; however, the general staged approach is not supported. The conclusion therefore stresses the need to develop a more integrative approach to internationalisation which is part of a broader theory of spatial-organisational change. </jats:p>",

We analyze a model that links the disease with deforestation and ecological measures to control the mosquito. In the model the probability of contracting malaria increases with population density, which is a principal endogenous variable in land-use decisions. A higher incidence of malaria reduces labor productivity. Farmers maximize profit by allocating labor between cultivation and health activities that reduce the incidence and severity of malaria. Commodity price changes, transportation improvements, and land clearance costs all affect the prevalence of malaria, and health and labor productivity. A reduction in land clearance costs will improve health and labor productivity but will exacerbate deforestation. An increase in the commodity price and a reduction in transportation costs exacerbate deforestation but reduce the prevalence of malaria, although the resultant change in the equilibrium levels of health and labor productivity is ambiguous. </jats:p>",

This research is dedicated towards finding a framework for such analysis and testing such framework in 15 local/regional companies. </jats:p><jats:p> After an extensive literature review from sources which are both international and local, a fairly lengthy questionnaire was developed. As stated, 15 companies’ chief executives (or in their absence, someone equivalent) were interviewed and at the end of each interview a set of structured questions were asked to be filled in. The whole interview process itself took more than a month. The results have been analysed and highlighted. One main finding is that SMEs continue to be family-centred in a local/regional context especially. Among other findings were the process of information gathering which was chiefly informal, the dominance of CEO-centred management, opportunity-seeking and risk-taking in identifying strategies and finally, the role of the spouse-support. </jats:p><jats:p> This research is multi-faced and deserves to be further explored. Herein lies its limitation as well as its promise. A research of this nature cannot claim to be fully conclusive and hence its natural incompleteness indicates further research continuation. </jats:p>",
