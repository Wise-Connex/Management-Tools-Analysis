First, strong support is needed from the corporate chief executive, and indirect power that follows such support. Second, continuous cooperation and real involvement in the planning process are required from division and profit‐center management. Such conditions are normally mutually dependent on one another, but the planning director must keep the support and interest constantly alive through communication, education, and sometimes badgering.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, planners frequently prefer to give relatively little attention to recent trends and patterns and therefore to avoid the use of trend projections, time‐series‐analysis techniques, and other such methods. These planners maintain that their objective is to create an environment that will enable them to deviate from historical trends and therefore that history has little value. However, there are several ways in which statistical projections are useful to planners. In this article we will describe some of the more commonly used time‐series techniques and how they can be applied.</jats:p>",

Four planning models, all claiming to be “democratic,” are examined. It is shown that each system offers its own “brand” of freedom or freedoms. Therefore, comparisons of the amounts or kinds of freedom(s) among systems remain unresolved.

All too often a project touted in the Message from the President one year as an exciting new venture is “forgotten” by the next annual report. Every corporate success has a proud father, but failures are doomed to bastardy. Some annual reports attempt to draw attention away from failures by highlighting a category called Profits from Continuing Operations. Thus a president can discreetly abandon the venture that failed by categorizing it in the annual report as a Discontinued Operation — a seemingly unimportant item. Such public relations devices may salve the chief executive officer's conscience, but they make fair assessment of his performance difficult. Discontinued operations are also a product of the CEO, and are an end result of his strategy. As failures, they deserve careful examination by directors, stockholders, employees, and press.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The effort to bring about change for the better in the performance of the criminal justice system and to bring about crime reduction has rested on the proposition that comprehensive planning must precede initiatives aimed at these ends. An assessment of the state of comprehensive planning for law enforcement and criminal justice systems since 1965 when the first Federal legislation placed emphasis on this kind of planning, indicates that much progress has been made, but that major barriers exist to effective system-wide planning. The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals said three years ago that the state comprehensive plans required under the Federal Crime Control Act since 1968 had been narrow in scope, had lacked reliable data and analysis, had not been precise about goals, directions, and strategies, and had not shown evidence of efforts to measure performance through monitoring and evaluation. These deficiencies still exist, though in lesser measure. They appear to be related to the fragmentation which characterizes the management of the criminal justice system, a narrow interpretation of the Crime Control Act and particularly its predecessor legislation by some states, a failure to analyze data, and uncertainty over what planning approaches might be most useful and appropriate for comprehensive, system-wide criminal justice and law enforcement planning. The key to overcoming the deficiencies would appear to be an understanding of the nature of the criminal justice system, and the development of a pragmatic approach to planning. Consensus appears to be developing along these lines, encouraged by the actions of several states which have taken the lead in adopting and incremental list, process-oriented approach to planning, and supported by new LEAA guidelines, the standards and goals program of LEAA, and the development and implementation of supportive mechanisms, in the form of planning, training and technical assistance. </jats:p>",

Data from a number of sources were used to identify ten independent dimensions which appeared intuitively meaningful as descriptors of residential settings. The independence of the dimensions indicates that stereotyped characterizations of the ‘urban/rural’ or the ‘affluent/nonaffluent’ type are unable to capture the multidimensional character of residential neighborhoods. It was hypothesized that the dimensions could describe some of the humane characteristics of residential neighborhoods, and a study of well-being in former mental patients lent some support to this hypothesis. Although this was a pilot study and much work remains to be done, the results are encouraging in that they appear to be applicable to planning for the community care of the mentally ill; to the design of humane environments; and as a methodological link in identifying some of the environmental components of psychological well-being. </jats:p>",

Many of these problems are concentrated in large cities, which places are also believed to generate many of the benefits considered vital to continued economic growth. Measurement and evaluation of the costs and benefits of cities of various sizes is thus important for the derivation of policies which will minimise costs and maximise benefits. With regard to measurement, this paper argues that costs are not properly accounted for, and a method of doing this is suggested. With regard to evaluation, I argue against liberal economists who see costs as necessary evils to be countered by price mechanisms and, as a consequence, inequalities. </jats:p>",

The inconsistencies and limitations inherent in some of the existing spatial-interaction entropy models used to describe activities taking place in urban and regional systems are first discussed, and new location models that have none of these inconsistencies are then developed. The new models describe the location of households about a city centre and, more generally, about a given distribution of jobs. The models take due account, in a consistent fashion, of any zonal-capacity constraints. The use of the models is illustrated with suitable data. </jats:p>",

A Markovian population model is used to project various performance measures for a blood supply region. These measures are summarized in graphs covering a planning period of several months to one year. The planner improves projected performance by changing collection plans and using the planning model iteratively to evaluate each plan. The data required by the model are generally available: past performance of bloodmobile sponsors, quotas and demand forecasts. In this paper the model is described, projected performance measures are validated against actual measures, sensitivity to errors in inputs is analyzed and the model is evaluated relative to less complex models. The planning model is shown to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose and highly effective for its cost. It has been implemented by two regional blood suppliers using remote computer terminals. </jats:p>",

By using the distribution model of linear programming, a constrained regression hypothesis is presented which strongly interacts with the theory that generated it. The full use of dual evaluators for estimation purposes is a central feature of the new model, and is an innovative contribution. It is not necessary to observe the purchase price of individual properties, since these (and interval estimates of other offer prices) follow theoretically from the regression results. </jats:p><jats:p> A market solution to the housing-allocation problem having been characterized, the consumer's decision problem is considered, and his solution is shown to be in general incompatible with market conditions. This incompatibility is resolved by the use of a multipage or decomposable linear program which incorporates both consumer goals and market conditions. The method of solution of this problem reflects the gain of information that leads to the purchase of a residence by each consumer, and demonstrates the value of the ‘decomposition principle’ in consumer theory. An illustration of the consumer's point of view is developed by using the noise problem of a neighborhood airport. </jats:p>",
