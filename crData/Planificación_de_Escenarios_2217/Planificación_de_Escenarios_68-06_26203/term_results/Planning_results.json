      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper deals with a problem of optimization of resource allocation in a project plan. It is assumed that the technological ordering of activities in a project is defined by the project graph. The predecessor-successor relations of activities are mapped into a set of transformations, where the state variables are the amounts of work required to complete the activities. The resources allocated to each activity are considered as decision variables. They are constrained when resources are limited. This enables one to consider the project execution as a discrete multistage decision process with the associated objective function. The optimization of this process is viewed as a dynamic programming problem. It is shown that the high dimensionality of the functional equations that appear can be overcome by means of (a) subproject programming, (b) two-level concept of management control evaluation, and (c) by approximation in policy space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article deals with a method of increasing co-operation between physical planners and economists by development of the technique of threshold analysis. This form of analysis of planning decisions is based on the fact that the development of an urban area encounters obstacles caused by topography, the public utilities network and existing land uses. These obstacles, easily conceived of spatially, also have an economic significance in two respects; (a) capital expenditure will be necessary to overcome the threshold, (b) the threshold may mark a new, higher-cost period of development for the area. </jats:p><jats:p> The threshold, therefore, is a concept with significance for both planning and economic analysis. It can improve communication between the disciplines because a threshold may be designated by a line on a planning map or an inflexion point on a cost curve. Analysis of costs based on thresholds makes possible a number of insights into the efficiency of investment planning associated with development but, perhaps more important, it accommodates the economists' methodology of comparing alternatives. </jats:p>",

Foresters must play the lead role in the allocation and development of lands for recreation use, and should be aware of new tools becoming available. Among these is the recreation capability mapping program of the Canada Land Inventory, which will classify all land in the designated area — some 1,000,000 square miles — according to its natural capability to engender and sustain outdoor recreation use. A parallel program is classifying and mapping wildlife capability. In addition, plans are underway for commencement in 1968 of a co-ordinated, searching analysis of the demands for outdoor recreation across Canada. Several federal agencies and the provinces will take part in associated surveys to assess present opportunities for recreation, present use of them and the preferences and habits of users and non-users.In spite of the lack of an evident national direction, and of national leadership in outdoor recreation, informal and semi-formal liaison ensure a reasonable degree of intergovernment and interdepartment co-ordination in the development of these new tools and in making them available to land use planners. </jats:p>",
