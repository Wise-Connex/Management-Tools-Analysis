The former is frequently advanced by ecologists as an objective of environmental planning. The latter is advanced as a planning objective by economists of the cost—benefit school of thought. It is demonstrated that the two are necessarily incompatible objectives: the former precludes the latter, and vice versa. If the importance of ecological ‘steady states' can be shown, however, it follows from the analysis that the ecological objective is logically prior to the economic objective. The conventional approach to planning for ‘externality correction’ is then misplaced. </jats:p>",

First of all, to move toward greater clarity with respect to a number of basic terms revealing less consensus in the language planning literature (e.g. planning, traditional, development, modernization, Westernization) than in the social sciences more generally. Secondly, but more importantly, to introduce into the language planning field a large number of concepts, questions and dimensions which have not yet found their way there from planning theory and planning research in other-than-language fields. In many (but not all) respects it would seem, on logical and impressionistic grounds, that language planning and other- than-language planning face similar burdens and benefit from related social and organizational circumstances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Planning the development of ports and harbours involves many complex, technical tasks. Various facility designs must be outlined and analysed. Facility locations must be evaluated and sites selected. Environmental issues must be recognised and the impact of port facilities on the environment must be estimated. Traffic and trade levels must be forecast. Port operating procedures must be evaluated to insure proper facility design. Men, material and capital resources must be inventoried to support the budgeting and economic analysis required. Finally, an economic evaluation must be made of the costs and benefits of the development project. Port planners must often develop plans under economic, social and political pressures. These pressures may not allow the time necessary to evaluate fully all the possible facility designs which could be included in the development plan. The computer model and planning methodology outlined briefly in this paper are designed to facilitate the development process by providing an automated planning framework for the rapid, accurate and thorough analysis of alternative port development plans. This port planning model is centred around a dynamic, stochastic digital computer simulation program. It is dynamic in that port operations may be simulated for any desired length of time; thereby providing in minutes estimates of the results of port operations simulated for years. The model is stochastic in that processes which vary randomly in actual port operations are represented to vary in the same way during the simulation. This added realism in the model increases the accuracy of its results. By properly specifying input data planners may evaluate the effect of alternative development plans on the port's operation; however, its use is not limited to development planning only.</jats:p>",

The method is illustrated using energy consumption in the transportation sector, in particular in the intraregional commuter transportation sector, as an example. The specific procedure described consists of three rounds, two devoted to choosing nodes and one to choosing edges and signs. The expert judgments of round 3 are combined to build an energy demand signed digraph for intraurban commuter transportation, and this signed digraph is then analyzed using the mathematical tools developed in Brown et al. (1972). Stabilizing strategies are identified, as are stable and unstable starting nodes and feedback loops contributing to stability and instability of the system. The conclusions are interpreted for their significance for energy demand in intraurban commuter transportation (this significance is mostly tentative and suggestive at this time) and as an illustration of the application of the signed digraph methodology. </jats:p>",

Three major modes of analysis are reviewed in depth—urban ecological and spatial interaction models in Part 1, urban economic models in Part 2. Developments in each field are documented in a roughly chronological order, and assessments are made of the models themselves and the style of modelling. It will be shown in Part 2 that the diverse experiences gained in each field suggest possibilities for synthesising the best elements and underlying concepts of each approach. The review itself is prefaced by a description of the structure of the residential subsystem. It is stressed at the outset that the emphasis is largely, but not exclusively, on models defined as operational constructs rather than on theoretical propositions. </jats:p>",

The econometric model provides a new method of delineating a region's employment into basic (export) and nonbasic (service) employment. Employment in the Cleveland, Ohio, (SMSA) was divided into these two categories using respectively the econometric model and two variants of the location quotient, one by Tiebout and the other by Thompson. Employment was forecasted within the sample period (1961–66) and outside the period (1967–69). The accuracy of the forecasts was gauged by calculating Theil's inequality coefficients. The results conclusively showed that the econometric method consistently forecasted more accurately than the other techniques, which registered very poor forecasts outside of the sample period. </jats:p>",
