      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the past decade, increasing attention has been given to\n      the role of agriculture in the process of economic development. One\n      aspect of the discus¬sion has concerned the significance of relative\n      prices for farmer in decision¬making. Recent studies have yielded\n      estimates of supply elasticities for jute in East Pakistan, and for\n      cotton, wheat, and several other crops in West Pak¬istan, so that a\n      basic body of information is beginning to emerge. The main purpose of\n      this note is to supplement these studies by presenting estimates of the\n      price elasticity of supply for rice in East Pakistan. However, since\n      rice and jute are the main alternate crops in East Pakistan, supply\n      elasticities for jute will also be presented. Because of fluctuations in\n      agricultural yields due to variations in weather conditions, the acreage\n      response to price has generally been estimated rather than the output\n      response. Significant changes in the size and timing of the monsoon\n      rains in East Pakistan make it particularly important in this case to\n      use acreage changes as a measure of farmer response to price. Inputs\n      others than land, such as fertilizers, better seeds, and\n      plant-protection measures are not widely used in East Pakistan; and\n      apparently, these measures are not very responsive to price changes. At\n      least, no statistically significant relationship exists between the\n      relative price of rice (to jute) in one year and rice yields in the next\n      year. An increased price for rice results in an extension of rice\n      acreage,) but it does not result in significantly more intensive\n      cultivation. Under these conditions, the price elasticity of acreage\n      closely approximates the elasticity of planned output2</jats:p>"

In the preparation of special-purpose maps such as real-estate-assessment, employment, traffic-shed, traffic-flow, and parking-area maps, it adds to the effective analysis of data presented and sometimes adds new data for consideration. As an example of practical application, the paper shows how a combination of such special-purpose maps may be used in the location of a new supermarket. For planning in rural areas immediately adjacent to a city a somewhat different series of special-purpose maps is necessary, but photo interpretation can play the same important role in providing data for the maps and assisting in the analyses. </jats:p>",

The old apparatus of social-welfare planning has been able to disregard totalities of need, to avoid accountability for failure or gaps, and to function without discipline. Urban renewal cannot do this because its ultimate objective is a wholly sound city. It has been demonstrated that physical improve ments will not produce net gains unless accompanied by ap propriate and adequate social-welfare programs. Thus, social- welfare planning should be a function of the agency responsible for physical planning; plan and strategy for both must be developed together. Because discipline or conformity to plan cannot be imposed on voluntary agencies, both plan and implementation must be derived, primarily, from public sources. The concept now developing is based on two principles: first, priority must be given to the amplification and modification of those systems which operate naturally as the dynamics of upward mobility—namely, employment, income, education, and housing; second, social-welfare services should be focused first on the areas or projects of urban renewal so that problems of the city can be attacked at a feasible rate and that full use be made of \"society\" or social structure as an instrument of social rehabilitation. </jats:p>",
