      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been a noticeable silence among planning researchers concerning the notion of reflexivity. This is in sharp contrast to other areas of the social sciences, where the issues of reflexivity have recently assumed major prominence. This article argues that concepts and theories of Bourdieu’s notion of reflexivity generated primarily in the fields of sociological research provide a necessary and fruitful backcloth for the study of planning and land-use development. Following a brief consideration of the Habermasian and Foucauldian approaches that have come to dominate planning thought in recent times, we explore Bourdieuian notions of reflexivity, habitus, capital and field. We argue that a Bourdieuian stance, with its greater emphasis on digesting and acknowledging the researched habitus, field and capital, will offer planning researchers new tools for understanding the nature and outcomes of planning practices. Furthermore, we contend that a Bourdieuian conceptual framework will highlight the durable and embodied nature of the intuitive practices of many actors in planning and development processes. </jats:p>",

Variations include aggregative, unitary, deontic and dialogic approaches, with applications ranging from utilitarian evaluation methods to deliberative and dialogic approaches in political, administrative and judicial arenas. The ontological debate on the public interest concludes that the problem defeating any substantive public interest application is complexity, leaving a dialogic public interest as a default legitimator of public planning. To meet the need for normative application of a substantive public interest concept in planning practice, a threshold criterion is proposed for use in appropriate cases of plan evaluation. </jats:p>",

Planners and scholars who see twenty-first-century technologies ushering in a new era of substantively different planning—that is, yielding different development outcomes, not just different planning methods—would do well to understand that this is not the first time that such predictions have been made. There is no doubt that the RPAA demonstrated remarkable insight into the transformative potential of two major emerging technologies: motor vehicles and electric power. But it was utterly ineffectual in its attempts to realize this potential in a manner that achieved social change. Its story indicates that when the elements of a utopian program are stripped of their organizing principle and adopted a la carte to other purposes, the utopian vision can become simply a cover story for business as usual. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> That planning history is a thriving subject is evidenced by the continuing success of Society for American City and Regional Planning History (SACRPH) conferences and those of other planning history organizations. Its vigor is also proven by the many varieties of history that find a voice in these conferences: histories of famous city plans and of renowned planners, histories of state planning and of national planning agencies, and histories of great planning movements. Unfortunately, not all types of planning history are as well represented. Among the most neglected are methodological and conceptual histories. In this article, the author presents the story of a conceptual and methodological innovation in urban planning known as multidimensional land use classification. Since its appearance more than forty years ago, it has influenced the way planners think about land use as well as the manner in which land use data are organized. This article places multidimensional classification in its historical context and explains how and why it came to be from the standpoint of one who had a role in its development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the link between information technology (IT) and urban form. It does this by examining recent literature pertaining to two urban theorizing traditions: the deconcentration and economic-restructuring schools. Whereas in the deconcentration school, IT–urban form relationships are the newest stage in a sequence of technological innovations in transportation and communications posing new challenges to the geography of accessibility, in the restructuring school, these relationships are theorized as pervasive sociotechnical change transforming the organization of production, institutions, and everyday life. Despite their paradigmatic differences, both schools explore urban decentralization and/or centralization questions and identify urban dispersing effects related to synergies between IT and the automobile society. The author uses a Dutch and a U.S. case to illustrate the challenges that informational or New Economy development pose to urban and regional planning. </jats:p>",

The term urban village has since entered the planning discourse, and a number of developments known as urban villages have appeared across the country. This article draws on ongoing research into the phenomenon of the urban village, and focuses on the origins, definitions, and meanings given to the term in the literature, in interviews with key players, in planning documentation and in the professional press. It appears that the urban village concept is variously interpreted and applied depending on the context in which it is used, and on the knowledge, role and interests of the individual reflecting on the term. The article will attempt to unravel the significance of this, while also drawing some conclusions about how concepts frame, and are framed by, prevailing discourses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the Great Depression, New York planner Arthur C. Holden offered reformers an alternative to the eminent domain and broad slum clearance favored by most proponents of low-rent public housing. Holden advocated the technique of pooling properties in an equity trust, that is, of transforming tenement owners into shareholders of a district corporation empowered to manage, selectively demolish, and redevelop real estate. He tried the experiment among property owners on blocks of the Lower East Side and in Chelsea, but he could not overcome their residual individualism. A product of the 1930s debates about eminent domain, Holden’s ideas anticipated much of the 1960s disillusionment toward slum clearance by distant government authority. </jats:p>",

This paper reviews the main approaches to strategic management and, by presenting the results of a survey of 159 small and medium sized enterprises selected from both the service and manufacturing sectors, demonstrates a divide between the theoretical concepts and the practical realities of strategic planning. While there are strong indications of business planning among the organisations surveyed, there is less evidence of strategic thinking except among larger businesses. Even in this latter group there are only a few instances where the recognised tools of strategic management appear to play a role in planning, the exception being internal financial analysis, which is widely undertaken.</jats:p>",

This article focuses on the vicissitudes of post-apartheid housing development schemes, and raises troubling questions about the failure of planners, policy makers and developers to take into account the complexities of the everyday lives they sought to transform. Had they done so they might have anticipated the ‘re-informalisation’ of the newly formalised suburb. The article explores the disjunctures between the planners' model of ‘suburban bliss’ and the reality. The messy, improvised character of low-income housing development in South Africa is contrasted with their Utopian and technocratic vision. This is not to deny that dreams embodied in blueprints may often be shared by the intended ‘beneficiaries’, only that for a variety of social, economic and cultural reasons poor communities are generally unable to realise such ideal visions of modern urban living.</jats:p>",

This paper begins to tackle that shortfall and outlines the findings of exploratory research into negotiation styles of customer‐supplier dyads engaged in strategic relationship development. First, it reviews two distinct styles of negotiation approach: the competitive (adversarial or distributive) approach and the collaborative (problem‐solving or integrative) approach. Then it discusses the findings that support the argument that there are commonalities in the adoption of negotiating stances across industries and at different stages of relationship development. In conclusion the paper suggests that negotiation can be seen as a process of information exchange and highlights the practical implications of this research in terms of business development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Résumé Dans les années 1950, le regard porté sur la sexualité, et plus particulièrement sur celle des jeunes, paraît se modifier, ainsi qu’en témoignent des films d’avant-garde, Et Dieu créa la femme , ou encore les œuvres des cinéastes de la Nouvelle Vague, qui montrent une jeunesse brisant les tabous et bravant les interdits. Pourtant, le mariage semble demeurer alors, pour la majorité des jeunes, le rite de passage leur reconnaissant un droit à la sexualité. Or, c’est dans ce contexte, en 1956, qu’est créée l’association « La Maternité heureuse ». Celle-ci a pour objectifs l’introduction en France de la planification des naissances et la révision de la loi de 1920. L’association devient, en 1960, le Mouvement français pour le planning familial, et se trouve confrontée à des aspirations et à des attitudes inédites, de la part des jeunes, à l’égard de l’amour et de la sexualité. Se prononçant d’emblée pour la reconnaissance du principe de la contraception, et par là même d’une sexualité dissociée de la procréation, le MFPF reste longtemps hésitant face au problème des mineurs : les médecins du Mouvement, en particulier, demeurent réticents dans la délivrance de contraceptifs aux jeunes. C’est pourquoi, la position officielle du MFPF, au cours des années 1960, s’en tient à la stricte observation de la majorité. Cependant, beaucoup sont aussi conscients que l’âge de l’état civil ne constitue nullement une réponse appropriée, et les Centres de consultation du planning familial, au niveau local, prescrivent, ou non, en conscience. En effet, le nombre de jeunes filles mineures venant demander des conseils de contraception ne fait que croître, tandis que, dans le même temps, leur âge s’abaisse. Progressivement, des critiques se font jour à l’égard des positions du Mouvement, notamment en provenance des étudiants. C’est ainsi qu’en 1973 intervient la scission au sein du MFPF, au profit du Mouvement pour la Liberté de l’Avortement et de la Contraception. Néanmoins, le MFPF a beaucoup œuvré pour une réflexion renouvelée sur la contraception et la liberté sexuelle, notamment par l’adoption de la loi Neuwirth.</jats:p>",

Clearly important though customers are, they should not dominate marketing strategy and planning to the exclusion of other influential groups, one of these being competitors. With this in mind, a pilot research project was undertaken to gain a better understanding of how UK companies conduct competitive intelligence. From this pilot, a tentative typology of companies was developed to reflect four attributes of competitive intelligence activity: attitude, gathering, use, and location. Further research was subsequently undertaken to corroborate the findings of the pilot study, test the appropriateness of the typology and further develop the classification definitions. The research has resulted in a typology that illustrates a continuum of behaviour on the four strands of investigation. From this, an understanding of CI best practice can be deduced.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The field of salary management is at a crossroad. Traditional salary management practices were developed for an organization model that has largely disappeared. The critics of those practices were first heard a decade ago. The “next generation” program model moves in a different direction but is still not fully developed. The newer salary systems reflect common core principles; however, there are unresolved design issues that affect system management. A key change is the shift in control from human resources to line managers, which makes it important to create simple, transparent and credible programs. The experience of three companies—Dow Chemical, IBM, and Marriott Lodging—confirms that managers can effectively handle this new role when they are provided with adequate information. This article looks at the focal issues in designing a next generation salary system. It considers the rationale for assigning jobs to salary bands and for managing individual salaries within the bands. It also suggests criteria for evaluating system changes. </jats:p>",

The advent of the computer created an opportunity for the developers of material requirements planning (MRP) concepts to automate many of the manual practices employed in manufacturing for acquiring and tracking of materials. This resulted in more efficient manufacturing operations in terms of labor for planning activities and better material control. Technology was expanded to include capacity planning and production schedule control. The acceptance in industry for the new “tool” was monumental and soon a new industry was born. For some time MRP allowed manufacturers to perform at higher levels of proficiency. However, the demands and expectations of the customers have continued to change and manufacturers wishing to keep pace with competition are beginning to question if MRP is still a valid tool for production planning and control. As a result new concepts have begun to emerge. These new approaches call for an abandonment of some of the foundational components of MRP.</jats:p>",

In each of the three subsequent sections of the paper, the empirical findings are presented and analyzed: the grounded conceptions of innovativeness, the two main variants of project organization (self-organized versus managerially coordinated project teams), and the varieties of interfirm networks such as transactional and mixed networks.

M‐SMEs form the biggest group of manufacturing entities in many newly industrialized economies. The needs and operating requirements of these M‐SMEs are very different from those of large companies. Much research has been carried out in the area of mechanisms, techniques, heuristic designs, modeling, and usage of fuzzy logic in production planning, scheduling and production control. However, most research only addresses a particular area of the enterprise planning process. In addition, the majority of the large‐scale enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems created for large corporations’ manufacturers are sometimes ineffective in M‐SMEs. This research highlights the organizational, structural, operational and supply chain related interdependencies impacting the planning and management of the internal supply chain in M‐SMEs in the Southeast Asia region. Similar to the deployment of management and manufacturing information systems, the need to fully comprehend the operational dynamics of M‐SMEs is crucial for the successful implementation of ERP systems to manage the internal supply chain. The deployment of ERP systems in M‐SMEs is simpler in some aspects compared to large corporations, but can be more complicated in others.</jats:p>",

The C–space is generated using an interference detection technique. Two levels of heuristic search are performed within the C–space. The first search is a heuristic depth search to determine the obstacle–free lift paths. The second search performs a more detailed optimization of the path within a constrained search space. The tool can be used within the AutoCad environment and is based on program modules developed using AutoLisp and external programs. The system was tested on a number of problems. It was found that the system was capable of generating good paths in complex situations.</jats:p>",

Despite the momentum that European integration gained over this period, the key finding is that the geography of manufacturing employment has remained almost intact. Processes operating at the European scale appear to have the largest impact on labour outcomes in each member state, while there is little deviation from the widespread declining trends. Spatial stability is reinforced even further through the homogeneity of several national industrial structures. In addition, the moderate increase in the industrial specialisation of the participating economies, and the localisation tendencies of a few traditional subsectors, pose little if any threat to the stability of the present map of manufacturing distribution. This evidence suggests that, contrary to some political rhetoric, the integration process has not, so far at least, adversely affected the relative competitiveness of manufacturing either in peripheral or in core countries.</jats:p>",

The status quo in media planning and buying is increasingly problematic, however, in the face of changes in the mediasphere and in audience consumption practices. What is more, advertisers are hungry for a qualitative dimension which is often missing from raw quantitative figures. New and alternative media offer a way through the impasse into the future, but lack the credibility offered by ratings data. Courage will be required from advertisers and their media planner/buyers to break these constraints and make optimum use of emerging, niche and community media. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Like all forms of work, project work is constructed within the rules that govern labor and capital markets. In this paper, I examine how project work and the project workforce in ‘old’ media (motion pictures and television) and ‘new’ media (multimedia or Internet-based information, entertainment, and infotainment) have been affected by changes in the regulatory regime governing entertainment and information-intensive industries in the United States. Of particular significance is the role that collective bargaining institutions play in industry governance. In the case of old media, the regulatory regime initiated in the 1980s by the Reagan administration considerably reshaped the terrain for media production. ‘Virtual integration’ of a substantial portion of production resulted in the routinization of project work and decreased the need for collocation of preproduction, production, and postproduction in Los Angeles, the ‘home base’ of these industries. Old media, however, retained the key governance organizations that predated changes in regulation, particularly guilds and unions. New media, by contrast, emerged in the 1990s era of laissez-faire regulatory policy. ‘Consent decrees’, regulating competition in a wide range of industries were lifted, allowing firms to acquire, merge, and move freely both to concentrate economic power and to diversify. Unlike their old-media counterparts, new-media workers (and their employers) did not have the intermediary institutions to set the rules for employment, to define roles in project production, or to facilitate project management. For the new-media worker, and his or her employers, stronger dependence on interpersonal connections for credentials, legitimacy, and job match means stronger dependence on regional markets. The history of change and continuity in media project work can illuminate broader questions, such as how market regulation affects the location strategies of firms and workers. </jats:p>",

Using three case studies drawn from research with very small-scale farmers, the author examines processes of identification, drawing on ideas which suggest the importance of encounter, farming discourse, physical relation and heterogeneous association in the emergence of ethical identity in specific farming situations and places. The case studies examine the ethical positioning of interviewees, and their mobility of ethical identification, in relation to ‘other’ types of farmer and the human and nonhuman components of their farming assemblages. The paper illustrates the importance of examining situated farming moralities and identities in current debates over alternative ways of thinking about and practising agriculture, and over different ways of using rural space. </jats:p>",

The role of supporting emergency services and the community both during and after emergencies has been a traditional role. Added to this is an increasing responsibility as the focal point for the conduct of local mitigation using risk analysis, prioritization, and treatment under the methodology of emergency risk management. This role is part of a shift in the emphasis of emergency management in Australia away from the strong focus on emergencies and the emergency services, towards an emphasis on the sustainability of the community and its life in the context of the risk of loss posed by natural and other hazards. Models of municipal emergency risk management planning are presented to assist municipalities to connect or even integrate their emergency management planning processes with other similar community safety activities such as crime and injury prevention. </jats:p>",

We also found a strong positive investor reaction to outside CEO promotion and a negative investor reaction to nonheir inside CEO promotion. Further, firm performance exerts an important influence on the wealth effect of heir apparent promotion and exit. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In light of the scarcity of material for the learning disability sector, information has been examined from other health domains such as mental health. The paper also presents a discussion on whether rationing of services is best done via explicit or implicit means. Issues related to setting referral criteria and the allocation of referrals are also considered. Although suggestions have been made for CLDTs, it is difficult to do so whilst the evidence base for this sector is so lacking. </jats:p>",

We analyze and compare the resilience properties of the various options including the recently defined and developed DNI on protection interworking feature. We then use a case study to demonstrate the traffic carrying capabilities and the resilience properties of the various available architectures under different traffic scenarios. Trade‐offs introduced are illustrated and explained and an analysis of the modeling results allows for a better understanding of the significance of ring clustering for resilience purposes. We conclude on the penalties of DNI when MS‐SPRings and SNCP‐ring architectures are employed and we demonstrate that significant efficiencies can be achieved from the emergence of DNI on protection techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we present an airspace planning model (APM) that has been developed for use in both tactical and strategic planning contexts under various airspace scenarios. Given a set of flights for a particular time horizon, along with (possibly several) alternative flight-plans for each flight that are based on delays and diversions, due to special-use airspace (SUA) restrictions prompted by launches at spaceports or adverse weather conditions, this model prescribes a set of flight-plans to be implemented. The model formulation seeks to minimize and delay fuel-cost-based objective function, subject to the constraints that each flight is assigned one of the designated flight-plans, and that the resulting set of flight-plans satisfies certain specified workload, safety, and equity criteria. These requirements ensure that the workload for air-traffic controllers in each sector is held under a permissible limit, that any potential conflicts are routinely resolvable, and that the various airlines involved derive equitable levels of benefits from the overall implemented schedule. To solve the resulting 0–1 mixed-integer programming problem more effectively using commercial software (e.g., CPLEX-MIP), we explore the use of reformulation techniques designed to more closely approximate the convex hull of feasible solutions to the problem. We also prescribe a polynomial-time heuristic procedure that is demonstrated to provide solutions to the problem within 0.01% of optimality. Computational results are reported on several scenarios based on actual flight data obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for air-traffic management (ATM) purposes. </jats:p>",

Through this policy analysis, it is shown how a number of factors conspired to create the current nursing shortage in Alberta. Through the analysis of qualitative interviews with key stakeholders, five themes are identified as factors causing this shortage. These themes are national and provincial political contexts during the 1990s, increased need for nurses, lack of timely information, nurses’ political inexperience, and a loss of institutional nursing leadership.

This better understanding, when translated into meeting patients’ QOL priorities and needs, resulted in clinically significant improvements in their QOL. Reflective practice by nurses was also shown.

The blood vessels in computed tomographic scans demonstrated a higher attenuation than surrounding soft tissues. The opacity consistency of the injected vessels was a critical parameter for a clear three-dimensional rendering of the vascular structures in the natural surroundings of the skull base. Static and dynamic three-dimensional images of the cadaveric vascular tree were obtained as viewed through surgical corridors of various skull base approaches.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We demonstrated a new cadaveric preparation model for imaging and dissection.

The biophysical model, the beam‐setup logic, and the dose‐calculation algorithm implemented for the layer‐stacking method are described and the expected clinical usability is discussed. The layer‐stacking method was integrated in perfect accordance with the ongoing conventional treatments so that the established protocols, which are the clinically optimized dose fractionation schemes, will still be valid. On the other hand, a simulation study indicated a substantial improvement of dose distribution with the layer‐stacking method though the significance may depend on the size, shape, and location of the tumor. The completed treatment system will provide an option for improved conformal radiotherapy without interfering with the conventional method and we expect a gradual expansion of the clinical cases applicable to the layer‐stacking method.</jats:p>",

These discussions focused on the planning of respectively the product design objectives, design changes, and design activities. This product design planning was based on the product requirements relevant to the diverse groups involved, a pro–active view on the market circumstances, the available knowledge, skills and resources, lead–time and costs.

We conceptualize distance to hospital in geographic and socioeconomic contexts from the care seeker's perspective, and develop a GIS procedure to generate variables for these contexts. The procedure includes geocoding hospital locations and patient locations to determine travel distance for each hospitalization, generating several geographic barriers such as mountain crossings, and linking patient-neighborhood locations to socioeconomic variables. The findings reveal that overall, hospitalization rates are inversely related to distance to hospital. Even though low-income patients are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable conditions, the income effect influences different dimensions from those affected by the distance effect. A balanced approach may be needed to address issues appropriately at both the low and the high ends of physical accessibility. </jats:p>",

The six vegetation distribution scenarios were calculated at 0.5° latitude–longitude resolution and the boundaries of 39 national parks superimposed in a geographic information system (GIS). Park management plans and other planning documents were also reviewed as part of the analysis.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> The proportional distribution of biomes in Canada's national park system was very similar (within 3% of area for each biome) using BIOME3 and MAPSS under the current climate. Regardless of the GVM and climate change scenario used, the modelling results suggest the potential for substantial change in the biome representation in Canada's national park system. In five of six vegetation scenarios, a novel biome type appeared in more than half of the national parks and greater than 50% of all vegetation grid boxes changed biome type. The proportional representation of tundra and taiga/tundra in the national park system declined in each of the vegetation scenarios, while more southerly biomes (temperate forests and savanna/woodland) increased (in some scenarios doubling to quadrupling). Results for boreal forest varied among the climate change scenarios. A range of potential vulnerabilities in existing policy and planning frameworks were identified, including the national park system plan, individual park objectives, and fire and exotic species management plans.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to Parks Canada and its ability to achieve its conservation mandate as presently legislated. Research is needed not only on ecosystem responses to climate change, but also on the capacity of conservation systems and agencies to adapt to climate change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Background.</jats:bold> Repeated, self-damaging behaviour occurring in the context of borderline personality disorder (BPD) may reflect impairments in decision-making and planning cognition. However, there has been no systematic neuropsychological examination of these particular cognitive functions in patients diagnosed with BPD. Such investigations may improve our understanding of the possible role of brain dysfunction in BPD and improve the characterization of the psychological difficulties associated with this disorder.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method.</jats:bold> Forty-two psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of DSM-III-R BPD (41 of whom gave a history of self-harm), without a history of specified ‘psychoses’ or current major affective disorder, were clinically assessed before completing computerized tasks of decision-making and planning previously shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction, and tests of spatial and pattern visual recognition memory previously shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe damage and temporal lobe damage respectively. The performance of the BPD patient group was compared with that of a non-clinical control group consisting of 42 subjects.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> The performance of the BPD patients on the decision-making task was characterized by a pattern of delayed and maladaptive choices when choosing between competing actions, and by impulsive, disinhibited responding when gambling on the outcome of their decisions. BPD patients also showed impairments on the planning task. There was no evidence of impaired visual recognition memory. Additional analyses suggested only limited effects of current medication and history of previous substance use disorder.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold> These findings suggest that BPD is associated with complex impairments in dissociable cognitive processes mediated by circuitry encompassing the frontal lobes. These impairments may mediate some of the behavioural changes evident in BPD. Further work is needed to examine the specificity of these findings.</jats:p>",
