      "abstract": "<jats:p> In models of decision making under uncertainty, one typically has to approximate the uncertainties by a limited number of discrete outcomes. Høyland and Wallace (2001) formulate a nonlinear programming problem to generate such a limited number of discrete outcomes while satisfying specified statistical properties. They have developed and employed this method for a stochastic multistage asset-allocation problem. When the method is applied to such financial optimization problems under uncertainty, we argue here that it does not suffice to match statistical properties. To obtain realistic outcomes, the (limited) description of the uncertainty in such models should also exclude arbitrage opportunities, and thereby be consistent with financial asset pricing theory. We illustrate that the method proposed by Høyland and Wallace can result in arbitrage opportunities in the scenario tree if only statistical properties are imposed. We show how one can check ex post for the presence of arbitrage opportunities in a scenario tree by checking for the existence of solutions to sets of linear equations. Arbitrage opportunities can also be precluded ex ante in the scenario tree by adding constraints to the nonlinear programming problem of Høyland and Wallace. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Himalayas have a great environmental influence in the Indian subcontinent. But Himalayan ecosystems with their rich biodiversity are particularly fragile. In the recent past, India has been serially affected by several natural calamities like droughts, floods and even earthquakes. Scientists all over the world have warned of various contributing factors. But, the major cause has been attributed to one important matrix – the constant degeneration of the Himalayan ecology. Human activities have resulted in arrested succession, leading to exhaustion of the germplasm of larger shrubs and trees, and invasion of exotic weeds. Large-scale transformation of landscapes for chir-pine plantation in the Himalayas has resulted in changes in soil physicochemical and biological properties. In this article the author depicts the introduction of pines as well as the present and future consequences of pine culture in the Himalayas. </jats:p>",

Similar situations occur during laser beam welding \nwhere a relatively long vapour capillary is observed. The present analysis focuses \non the flow of the electrically conducting liquid phase in the presence of a strong \nuniform horizontal magnetic field. The cross-section of vapour channels is circular if \nsurface tension dominates magnetic forces. In the opposite case a stretching of the \nliquid–vapour interface along magnetic field lines is observed and contours become \npossible where a major part of the interface is straight and aligned with the field. For \nstrong magnetic fields the liquid flow exhibits several distinct subregions. Most of the \nliquid domain is occupied by inviscid cores. These are separated from each other by \nparallel layers that spread along the field lines which are tangential to the vapour \nchannel. In one core, which is located between two parallel layers, the flow direction \nis preferentially oriented along magnetic field lines, while in the other cores the flow \nis perpendicular to the field.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scenario-based specifications such as Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are popular for requirement elicitation and specification. MSCs describe two distinct aspects of a system: on the one hand they provide examples of intended system behaviour and on the other they outline the system architecture. A mismatch between architecture and behaviour may give rise to implied scenarios. Implied scenarios occur because a component's local view of the system state is insufficient to enforce specified system behaviour. An implied scenario indicates a gap in the MSC specification that needs to be clarified. It may simply mean that an acceptable scenario has been overlooked and should be added to the scenario specification. Alternatively, it may represent an unacceptable behaviour which should be documented and avoided in the final implementation. Thus implied scenarios can be used to iteratively drive requirements elicitation. However, in order to do so, tools for coping with rejected implied scenarios are needed. The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we define a language for describing negative scenarios. Secondly, we complement existing implied scenario detection methods with techniques for accommodating negative scenarios.</jats:p>",
