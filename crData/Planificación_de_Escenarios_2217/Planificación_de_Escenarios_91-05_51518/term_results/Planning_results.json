How housing ages and what the appropriate points of intervention are during this aging cycle are important considerations for local planners. The field is as yet underdeveloped. The literature that planners must turn to for guidance comes laigely from economics, geography, real estate appraisal, and planning. It is a disparate field, presented here from the perspective of planners. Topics include similarities in demography and housing analysis; estimates of housing longevity and depreciation paths and the widely varying conclusions about them; behavior of owners and investors and the difficulties they face in making rational estimates of market trends; and, finally, national policies about the importance of caring for an aging housing stock and the prevention of \"premature obsolescence.\" </jats:p>",

Rather than trying to solve transportation problems by building highways and transit routes, transportation demand management relies on incentives and disincentives to promote carpooling, vanpooling, transit use, and changed work hours. These approaches attempt to accommodate travel demand by more efficiently utilizing existingfacilities. Although many argue that transportation behavior cannot be changed, this review demonstrates that many years of behavioral science research on travel show otherwise. Commuters respond to differences in travel time and travel cost and to changes in work hours and other attributes of travel in systematic ways that are quite predictable. As a consequence, travel demand management is a promising approach to regional transportation planning. </jats:p>",

This phenomenon is the essence of marketing\nkinetics. The article discusses the reasons for poor strategy\nimplementation and demonstrates that it is the level of ownership that\ndictates the effectiveness of implementation rather than the\nsophistication of the plan.

The (non‐Bayesian) DDA planning concept should provide the investigator with tools to draw final conclusions from data of several variables possibly observed at several time points in possibly several groups of subjects by combining his pre‐trial medical experience with descriptive inferential statements (confidence intervals and test results) at nominal significance levels.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The function of a process planning system is to determine the methods by which a product is to be manufactured economically and competitively. In a modern manufacturing environment, a process planning system consists of highly trained people and complex software. The plans prepared by a process planning system are not always executed as planned. It is useful if the system can discover why plans fail, when they do fail. In order to learn why plans fail, the system must analyse a number of plans, both successful and unsuccessful, to find patterns in the failures of plans. This type of analysis is difficult for people, who are much better at analysing single events than multiple events.</jats:p><jats:p>The aim of the project described here is to design and implement a computer program which will help human planners in a process planning system to understand why plans fail. To achieve this aim, a program called IMAFO (Intelligent MAnufacturing FOreman) has been developed. IMAFO uses <jats:italic>decision tree induction</jats:italic> to analyse examples of both successful and unsuccessful plans.</jats:p><jats:p>The difficulties presented by this application are discussed and solutions are presented. Problems addressed include finding an appropriate set of attributes for describing the plans, using data efficiently, consolidating input from distinct sources, and presenting decision trees in an understandable form. Potential applications and directions for future research are considered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, numerous conceptual models of the land-development process have been produced. In this paper, this material is brought together for the first time; not only are the salient characteristics of these models presented, but also they are evaluated critically in relation to their clarity, applicability, and theoretical underpinnings. Four different categories of model are identified, namely sequential descriptions, behavioural models, production-based analyses, and the structures-of-provision approach. Each of these is reviewed in turn. From this it emerges that the first three approaches have by and large resulted in models that are only partially representative of the complexity and variability inherent in the land-development process. It is concluded that the search for a generally applicable model is, in fact, a futile one, and that energy would be more usefully expended in applying the principles of the ‘structures-of-provision’ approach to the full range of land-development activity, thus producing a specific model for each development sector. </jats:p>",

First, the revenues from sales of retail goods in each zone are assumed to be in balance with the costs of supplying such goods. Second, shoppers in each zone of residence are distributed to shopping zones according to a logit function of a generalized cost of shopping and traveling. Third, shoppers choose a travel route to the store such that their cost of travel is minimized. The model solution thus represents an economic, market-clearing equilibrium and a transportation network equilibrium. </jats:p><jats:p> The model is then applied to assess the impacts, on a hypothetical commercial activity and travel system, of various changes in physical and economic conditions, as well as the result of the imposition of constraints on zonal retail activity and/or prices. The results provide some insight into the sometimes counterintuitive interactions between the key variables and illustrate the potential use of the model for policy analysis purposes. </jats:p><jats:p> Possible areas for further refinements of the model are discussed in conclusion. </jats:p>",

The Telstar team for each study includes the study director/report coordinator, the principal technician, the animal care technician, the data specialist, the information specialist, and the quality assurance auditor. Start and end times are assigned to each study period, including protocol approval, the various phases of study conduct and critical phase audits, specific raw data audits, beginning and ending of the in-life phase meetings, preparation of intermediate and final tables, review of tables, review of report results with senior staff, report writing by the study director, submission of report to senior staff, revision times, submission of report to quality assurance for audit, final review by study director after the quality assurance audit, final review by management (including review of the quality assurance audit results for the report), and report issue. Throughout the study, various team members interact with the study director, and scheduling is checked at twice-weekly management meetings, allowing study design and milestones to be modified if necessary.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A stochastic model of block-level advancing contagious urban decay in New York City, under conditions of inadequate fire extinguishment services, is presented, based on earlier observations that spread of contagious urban decay in small areas of New York involves sudden clusters of fires which propagate from affected blocks to those nearby, as landlords withdraw maintenance services from occupied buildings near damaged structures, in preparation for abandonment. Earlier work on on propagation in time is thus generalized to propagation in space and time. It is found that, under conditions of contagious urban decay, programs of community stabilization, fire prevention, and fire extinguishment may interact synergistically. Thus, failure to address properly the adequacy of available fire extinguishment, and other, related, municipal services, may seriously compromise and undercut community rehabilitation activities. Simple generalization of the stochastic model leads directly to the inference that correlation between spatial patterns of susceptibility to contagious urban decay and to susceptibility to breakdown of municipal services can markedly raise the rate of propagation of urban decay—a phenomenon not as easily seen in deterministic analyses. Suggestions are made for further empirical and theoretical studies, in the context of recently announced and executed further cutbacks of fire extinguishment services provided for poor minority communities of New York City. </jats:p>",

Four women (0.13 percent) tested positive (3/1801 PN and 1/1167 FP). Three reported no risk factors; one reported a history of syphilis since 1978. Voluntary HIV testing was selectively offered to women who reported risk factors for HIV infection. Only 14 percent (96/685) of clients offered testing chose to do it: 28 percent (14/50) of clients classified as being at highest risk of infection, and 27 percent (16/59) of women who judged themselves to have some chance of being exposed to HIV. None of the four women who tested positive by blinded testing chose testing. While few women at this center were infected with HIV, higher risk women were not persuaded to be tested through a targeted screening program. Blinded HIV seroprevalence studies provide a tool for both tracking infection in a population and evaluating screening programs. </jats:p>",

This analysis, which is based on detailed case studies of nineteen companies which employed over 11 000 workers in 1987, reveals that recent changes in the industry in the city-region can best be understood by reference to the changing role of local establishments within the wider corporate geography of their parent groups. Despite the high degree of external ownership, the city-region contains various subsidiaries with important control functions and with responsibility for product innovation and development. In response to a range of market pressures there has been a progressive upgrading of the technological sophistication of the products made within the city-region. In some cases this technological enhancement has been accompanied by the relocation of mature products to peripheral areas of the United Kingdom or to the Far East. These changes have had an important impact upon the skill composition of the work force. Increases in scientific, technical, and management functions have been accompanied by absolute or relative declines in production, ancillary, and clerical jobs. These occupational and production changes have, particularly in the larger firms, been associated with new working patterns. </jats:p>",
