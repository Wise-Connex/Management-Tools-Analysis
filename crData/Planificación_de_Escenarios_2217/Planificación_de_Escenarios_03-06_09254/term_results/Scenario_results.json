      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the next decade and beyond, hospitality and leisure companies will embrace business models that focus on mass customizing travel experiences. As a result, in 2010, travel will be about engaging in powerful, seamless personal experiences that are carefully tailored to learning and catering to the tastes and demands of individual travelers. Two key forces are driving this trend on both the demand side and the supply side: globalization that allows more people to go more places, and technological advancements that will fuel economic growth and enable companies to provide experiences on demand. Most travel and leisure companies will need to make significant changes to be successful participants in this new experience marketplace. Travel companies that wish to offer differentiated experiences must do the following between now and 2010: promote customer‐experience centricity; brandish the brands: aggressively launch measures to re‐affirm the brand positioning; personalize with precision; focus on the fundamentals: guest service, revenue management, and brand building to offer a better quality product and more customized guest service with a lower cost structure; shift focus of personal: use technology for transactional tasks; refocus employees on value‐added guest services; reinvent sales and distribution using an integrated direct connect mechanism (IDCM); leverage technology advances in numerous aspects of the operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Crude oil is a major source of energy and feedstock for petrochemicals. Oily sludge, bio-sludge and chemical sludge are the major sludges generated from the processes and effluent treatment plants of the refineries engaged in crude oil refining operations. Refineries in India generate about 28,220 tons of sludge per annum. Various types of pollutants like phenols, heavy metals, etc. are present in the sludges and they are treated as hazardous waste. Oily sludge, which is generated in much higher amount compared to other sludges, contains phenol (90-100 mg/kg), nickel (17-25 mg/kg), chromium (27-80 mg/kg), zinc (7-80 mg/kg), manganese (19-24 mg/kg), cadmium (0.8-2 mg/kg), copper (32-120 mg/kg) and lead (0.001-0.12 mg/kg). Uncontrolled disposal practices of sludges in India cause degradation of environmental and depreciation of aesthetic quality. Environmental impact due to improper sludge management has also been identified. Salient features of various treatment and disposal practices have been discussed. Findings of a case study undertaken by the authors for Numaligarh Refinery in India have been presented. Various system alternatives have been identified for waste management in Numaligarh Refinery. A ranking exercise has been carried out to evaluate the alternatives and select the appropriate one. A detailed design of the selected waste management system has been presented. </jats:p>",

We compare the performance of the Xfer approach with two corpus-based approaches---Statistical MT (SMT) and Example-based MT (EBMT)---under the limited data scenario. The results indicate that the Xfer system significantly outperforms both EBMT and SMT in this scenario. Results also indicate that automatically learned transfer rules are effective in improving translation performance, compared with a baseline word-to-word translation version of the system. Xfer system performance with a limited number of manually written transfer rules is, however, still better than the current automatically inferred rules. Furthermore, a \"multiengine\" version of our system that combined the output of the Xfer and SMT systems and optimizes translation selection outperformed both individual systems.</jats:p>",
