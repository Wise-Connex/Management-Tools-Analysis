Calls for the enhanced participation of civil society in planning are associated with an international trend toward the decentralization and devolution of many areas of natural resource policy and state responsibility. Democratic decentralization has been widely advocated as being more efficient and equitable than state control. These claims are examined with reference to three stories involving environmental planning and Australian indigenous peoples. The stories suggest that rather than a “new political economy of planning” whereby the spaces for democracy are enlarged by the activities of civil society, the participation of civil society and decentralization can result in political processes whereby public deliberation is suborned by interest group politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reveals how local knowledge can improve planning for communities facing the most serious environmental and health risks. These communities often draw on their firsthand experience—here called local knowledge—to challenge expert-lay distinctions. Community participation in environmental decisions is putting pressure on planners to find new ways of fusing the expertise of scientists with insights from the local knowledge of communities. Using interviews, primary texts, and ethnographic fieldwork, this article defines local knowledge, reveals how it differs from professional knowledge, and argues that local knowledge can improve planning in at least four ways (1) epistemology, adding to the knowledge base of environmental policy; (2) procedural democracy, including new and previously silenced voices; (3) effectiveness, providing low-cost policy solutions; and (4) distributive justice, highlighting inequitable distributions of environmental burdens. </jats:p>",

In this simulation a three-factor factorial design was implemented where decision cost, problem disutility, and planning investment were considered in terms of combinations of six levels of these factors. The results suggest that all three factors have statistically significant effects on the behavior of the complex system. In particular, decision cost and problem disutility tended to have effects counter to each other, whereas planning resulted in more efficient decisionmaking, but at the cost of resolving fewer problems. </jats:p>",

Suppose the greenbelt had never existed. How would the spatial structure of the metropolitan region have been different? Under both monocentric and polycentric assumptions, both population and employment (in terms of densities and numbers) would have been much lower in the core city and the periphery. The effects would have been more dramatic in the core city, suggesting that the greenbelt contributed significantly to densification and congestion. Still, its consequences for leapfrog development were far from negligible. In addition, because the greenbelt policy was reinforced by a strong government strategy to build very large new towns beyond the greenbelt, a significant jobs-housing imbalance resulted because people decentralized much faster than jobs. Whether these effects are offset by the recreational and other environmental benefits of the greenbelt is unclear. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 1994 and 1996, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) closed 23 country missions worldwide, of which eight were in West and Central Africa. To preserve United States support for family planning and reproductive health in four countries in that region, USAID created a subregional program through a consortium of US‐based groups that hired mainly African managers and African organizations. This study assesses cost‐effectiveness of the program through an interrupted time‐series design spanning the 1990s and compares cost‐effectiveness in four similar countries in which mission‐based programs continued. Key indicators include costs, contraceptive prevalence rates, and imputed “women‐years of protection.” The study found that, taking into account all external financing for population and family planning, the USAID West Africa regional approach generated women‐years of protection at one‐third the cost of the mission‐based programs. This regional approach delivered family planning assistance in West Africa cost‐effectively, and the findings suggest that regional models may work well for many health and population services in small countries.</jats:p>",

The incidence of illegal, often unsafe, induced abortion has to be estimated, however. In the literature, no fewer than eight methods have been used to estimate the frequency of induced abortion: the “illegal abortion provider survey,” the “complications statistics” approach, the “mortality statistics” approach, self‐reporting techniques, prospective studies, the “residual” method, anonymous third party reports, and experts' estimates. This article describes the methodological requirements of each of these methods and discusses their biases. Empirical records for each method are reviewed, with particular attention paid to the contexts in which the method has been employed successfully. Finally, the choice of an appropriate method of estimation is discussed, depending on the context in which it is to be applied and on the goal of the estimation effort.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A methodology is developed in this paper for evaluating and enhancing the performance of urban transportation systems in the aftermath of a disaster. A performance measure is proposed for assessing overall and distributional impacts based on the concept of accessibility. The methodology is demonstrated with two case studies. The first focuses on passenger railroad disruption in the catastrophic 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan. An accessibility measure is applied to evaluate the loss of transportation service and, in particular, its attendant spatial disparities. Alternative repair and restoration strategies are investigated and shown, in hindsight, to be preferable to the actual sequence of repairs. The second case study focuses on the potential loss of road and highway transportation in Seattle, WA, after a hypothetical earthquake. A refined accessibility measure is applied that accounts for postdisaster detouring and congestion. Again, this brings attention to spatial disparities in loss and the spatial implications of alternative restoration priorities. It further demonstrates that restoration strategies should be designed from a systems perspective. The limitations and broader applicability of the approach are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The role of the private sector in public healthcare systems is much debated, but there is little research to inform the debate. In the Nordic countries the extent and type of private sector involvement is largely unknown and the changes and the consequences have not been studied. This paper presents a conceptual framework and some limited data about the changing private–public mix and privatization in the Nordic countries between 1985 and 2000. The data suggest a small increase in both private financing and provision which has accelerated in recent years, especially in specific healthcare fields such as diagnostic centres, dentistry, primary medical care and care for older people.</jats:p><jats:p>The overall increase is small, but large in certain sectors. Differences between the countries can only be understood in relation to their historical, financial, economic and political context, even though there are many commonalities. Impact also is context dependent, but the findings do show a cross‐country pattern of a willingness to experiment and a change in underlying assumptions. The findings show a more extensive interpenetration of private and public than previously recognized but more research is required, especially about changes in recent years about which data are scarce. The paper considers the factors driving these trends, the likely larger changes in the next 10 years and the possible consequences for patients, professionals, managers and governments. It notes the different ways governments can control or influence finance and provision. It proposes that the Nordic and other governments improve regulation and data collection about the private sector and consider influencing private providers through partnership arrangements, rather than leaving the developments to be shaped by growing consumer demands or market logic alone.

Current issues on visual diversity include (a) how to measure it?, (b) what is the function between visual diversity and pleasure?, and (c) is the function between visual diversity and pleasure the same for different kinds of stimuli? Data are reported from twenty experiments covering 1126 stimuli and 1027 participants. The concept of statistical entropy is proposed as a measure of visual diversity. The correlation of ratings of visual diversity and entropy for environmental scenes was r = 0.87. Tenable relationships between pleasure and entropy for visual stimuli include linear and asymptotic but not the inverted U function. The type of stimulus strongly mediates the relationship between pleasure and entropy. Results from simple laboratory stimuli do not generalize to environmental scenes and, even within environmental scenes, the relationship between pleasure and entropy is positive for some types of scenes but negative for other types of scenes. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the cost effectiveness of using a loan mechanism to motivate a for‐profit provider to deliver family planning services. The intervention examined directly resulted in a private provider delivering family planning services, however, it did not create a long‐term financial incentive for the private provider to <jats:italic>promote</jats:italic> the use of family planning. The cost effectiveness of this intervention is analysed using a methodology that captures long term sustainability of the intervention within a traditional family planning outcome measure, such as couple years protection (CYP), by discounting future expected CYPs. Depending on the method for analysing costs and assumptions regarding future CYPs, this intervention produced family planning outcomes at no or very low cost ($0–$4.11 per CYP). The analysis demonstrates that innovative family planning interventions with private providers should be considered as they can be more cost effective than traditional programmes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors begin the paper with the question ‘Do mountains exist?’ They show that providing an answer to this question is surprisingly difficult and that the answer that one gives depends on the context in which the question is posed. Mountains clearly exist as real correlates of everyday human thought and action, and they form the archetype for geographic objects. Yet individual mountains lack many of the properties that characterize bona fide objects, and ‘mountains’ as a category also lacks many of the properties that characterize natural kinds. In the context of scientific modeling of the environment, especially of such phenomena as surface hydrology and fluvial erosion and deposition, mountains are not picked out as constituents of reality in their own right at all; rather, they are just parts of the field of elevations whose gradients shape the direction of runoff and influence the intensity of erosion. Thus, although an object-based ontology of mountains and other landforms is required to do justice to our everyday conceptions of the environment and to support spatial reasoning and natural language processing, topographic databases designed to support environmental modeling can be field-based at geographic scales.</jats:p>",

These modifications in fiscal incentives and the corporate restructuring undertaken by American health organizations has resulted in limited fiscal savings or improvements in access to care. As a result, trustees are now faced with divesting their losers, and shuttering facilities and services to reduce fixed costs. Decision‐making by trustees will be further thwarted in the future by: their institutions being forced to deliver more care without a proportional increase in revenues; physicians seeking to obtain more ambulatory revenues at a hospital's expense; the inability to adequately finance mental health and long‐term care services except among the wealthy; the number of divestitures increasing so that eventually the organizational focus for most IDSs will once again be on regionally oriented hospital systems; and much more difficulty being experienced in attracting sufficiently qualified personnel to deliver high quality health services. Finally, many of these findings relevant to the United States also are being shared by governing boards in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

This study focuses on 3861 reimbursement claims, which come from 22 government and 38 private tertiary hospitals. Wide variations of cost existed among the hospitals and among the inpatients. Medicine was the leading expenditure in total costs (38%), second was examinations (27%), third was beds (22%) and the last was doctors fees (13%). The same ranking ocurred for reimbursement by PHIC. The private hospitals were more expensive than the government hospitals, but also more efficient in the length of hospitalization. The member patients spent more and were reimbursed more for clinical practice than the dependent patients. However, there was no difference in the length of hospitalization between member and dependent patients. There was no difference in the length of hospitalization and expenditure between Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) in 1997 and Social Security System (SSS) patients. Clinical guidelines should be effectively implemented and PHIC should contribute more to reduce existing variations, improve cost‐effectiveness and the quality of clinical practices.

The examination of more than 45 quantitative and qualitative studies finds that relationships with older partners and those that involve economic transactions are common and that these asymmetries are associated with unsafe sexual behaviors and increased risk of HIV infection. Although the reasons that adolescent girls engage in sexual relationships with older men are varied, receipt of financial benefits is a major motivation. The literature presents evidence that girls have considerable negotiating power over certain aspects of sexual relationships with older men, including partnership formation and continuation; however, they have little control over sexual practices within partnerships, including condom use and violence. The review discusses directions for further research and the implications of current knowledge for future interventions.</jats:p>",

One common bottleneck encountered has been the traditional organizational structure of the private sector, with its plethora of independent, single physician practices. The atomistic nature of the sector has rendered many privatization efforts difficult, slow and costly—in terms of both organizational development and administration. In many parts of Africa, in particular, the shortages of human and social capital, and the fragile nature of legal institutions, undermine the appeal of privatization. The private sector is left with inefficiencies, high prices and costs, and a reduced effective demand. The result is the simultaneous existence of excess capacity and unmet need.</jats:p><jats:p>One potential method to improve the efficiency of the private sector, and thereby enhance the likelihood of successful privatization, is to transfer managerial technology—via franchising—from models that have proven successful elsewhere. This paper presents a feasibility analysis of franchizing the successful Bolivian PROSALUD system's management package to Zambia. The assessment, based on PROSALUD's financial model, demonstrates that technology transfer requires careful adaptation to local conditions and, in this instance, would still require significant external assistance.

New growth should include diverse housing types and mixed land uses and support pedestrian access and public transit. This article investigates how local government regulation has responded to this trend. Local development regulation is empirically examined by analyzing how much “smart growth” policies are implemented at the local level and investigating how much regulatory cultures prevent compact, pedestrian-oriented development. A typology of the kinds of local regulation used to promote smart growth is first established. Interregulatory consistency is also investigated—to what degree are cities and counties adopting frameworks consistent with smart growth? The types of developments implemented by local zoning regulations are then quantified. Results from a large-scale sample show that local jurisdictions in Illinois employ relatively low levels of smart growth-related prescriptive policies, and regulations generally run counter to smart growth development ideals. </jats:p>",

Data from Indonesia were collected in 1997 (just before the crisis) and in 1998 (during the crisis) that are used in this study to examine changes in the contraceptive supply environment and in women's choices regarding contraceptive use. Despite substantial changes in providers' characteristics during the first year of the crisis, no statistically significant differences are found between 1997 and 1998 in overall levels of prevalence, in unmet need, or in method mix. Women's choices regarding source of contraceptive supplies, however, changed considerably over the period. Changes in the contraceptive supply environment are linked here to changes in women's choice of source of supply, and a number of providers' characteristics are found to be significantly associated with women's choices in this regard.</jats:p>",

This article examines the impact of stakeholder representation and participation on ecosystem management strategies. It tests the relationship between community participation in the planning process and the quality of local plans associated with the long-term management of ecological systems. Besides the overall breadth of stakeholder groups involved in planning, the effects of specific stakeholders are tested and discussed to determine which has the greatest impact on the quality of an adopted plan. Statistical results indicate that the presence of specific stakeholders does in fact significantly increase ecosystem plans' quality. Policy implications are discussed to more effectively link the planning process to high-quality ecosystem planning outcomes. </jats:p>",

However, there is globally increasing skepticism concerning the effectiveness of CPE. In developed countries, the major reasons for participation in CPE include compliance with employers' requirements and renewal of specialist qualifications and licences. In developing countries, CPE, frequently supported by development agencies, often provides subsistence support to participants and is possibly perceived as an extra income opportunity or tool for promotion among health professionals. The knowledge and skills learned are insufficiently applied in daily practice. This carrot‐and‐stick approach should be reduced and efforts should be made to increase the level of application of what has been learned. To deliver more effective and efficient CPE, it is critical to study this issue in more depth. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a multiagent model in which developers and suppliers negotiate and generate proposals for developing a site, given multiple candidate locations in an urban area. In the model, the developer takes the initiative and coordinates the negotiation process with the aim of obtaining commitments from suppliers to open an outlet at a location. In this process, suppliers indicate their preferences and make yes – no decisions to participate in a proposal. We formulate and investigate two alternative negotiation protocols and various possible decision strategies for the developer and supplier agents. The model is applied to a hypothetical study area to investigate long-term dynamics as a function of the choice of protocol and strategies. We show that the model is capable of reproducing the typical hierarchical structure of real retail systems. Furthermore, it appears that the choice of protocol and strategy has an impact on the degree of spatial clustering of outlets as well as on the performance of each individual supplier. The choice of strategy is particularly critical for relatively weak suppliers. We conclude that the multiagent model is useful for planners, developers, and suppliers to explore the impacts their choices have on outcomes, and we identify promising avenues of future research. </jats:p>",

Yet, an important discrepancy has been noticed between the utility levels (in the qualitative sense) and the theoretical intrinsic potential of these technologies. The social utility value of GIT seems quite low compared with the quantitative level at which they are diffused. The authors focus on the ‘determination of value’, by considering the obstacles to the development of a spatial data infrastructure in the French context. From the results of a Delphi study, the authors bring to the fore the fact that the institutional and organisational barriers 0ack of a clear policy in matters of access and dissemination; cost of public data; absence of fully operational norms and standards; failure to raise the awareness of the potential users as a whole; etc) more than technical difficulties, are the prime causes of this phenomenon. Through this analysis, the authors emphasise the need to organise a French national spatial data infrastructure, strongly linked with most of the local initiatives developed by the local governments. </jats:p>",

In a first step, interviews were carried out with ten foresters, on the basis of which certain weak points were identified in the management to overcome the effects of hurricane Lothar and handling requirements ascertained for any such future catastrophe. One basic handicap proved to be that potential disturbances in the management process were not adequately taken into account,nor systematically. This can be partially explained by the use of inappropriate planning instruments. As a consequence we developed a theoretical management process model that can be applied as the basis of a systematic handling of the results of catastrophes. The basic idea is that at an early stage, using this model, the forester can recognise certain trends or developments in his surroundings that could have negative consequences for the production process later on. He can thus steer the production process in a way that is fully adapted to the situation,i.e. which takes into account the ongoing information exchange within the production process, using mid-term and long-term management plans. The central element of the model is a system of verifiable risk level values. In order to realise the concept of steering, management planning must differentiate between levels of strategic and operational planning.</jats:p>",

Recently, TotalFinaElf E&amp;P Qatar completed 15 wells in the Al-Khalij Field, 135 km northeast of Doha, Qatar. Because of the deviation at which they wished to set the packers, the operator needed a completion method that would eliminate slickline intervention. After considering many completion options, the following equipment was chosen: An interventionless plugging device that would allow testing of the entire tubing string without setting the hydraulic packer, during running of the completion, and would allow setting of the hydraulic packer, when on depth, without slickline or coiled-tubing intervention.Punch-to-release injection packers with the reliability of permanent packers that would provide capability to retrieve the entire completion without conducting costly and potentially damaging milling operations.ESP packers that could be reset to allow repairs at the wellhead without pulling the tubing string to replace the packer.Nippleless lock technology to keep the required number of landing nipples to a minimum while providing the utility to place flow-control devices anywhere in the completion string.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>TotalFinaElf Qatar employed the above philosophies in completing their wells. By using interventionless completion philosophies and innovative installation methods, the client saved approximately 16 hours of rig time per well and a minimum of 4 slickline runs into each well to run/retrieve the intervention tools. The equipment also allowed testing of the tubing and provided a barrier while installing the tree. Finally, in addition to reducing cost, the elimination of intervention operations reduced risks to the safety of the personnel, the environment, the equipment, and the well bore.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Based on the success of these operations, TFE is planning to use the same completion design to complete a minimum of 10 wells in Phase 3 of the Al-Khalij project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This completion system can be used in applications that would benefit from a completion deployment without well intervention to set plugs, test tubing or set a packer.</jats:p>",

The companies were classified into three groups according to their responsibility values based on the concepts of redirecting customers towards sustainability and the role of governmental balancing of markets. “Proactive green marketers” (companies emphasising pursuing sustainability and believing in free market system) emphasise environmental issues in their marketing planning clearly more than traditional “consumption marketers”, and more than “reactive green marketers” (companies emphasising pursuing sustainability under governmental balancing). We interpret that proactive marketers are the most genuine group in implementing environmental marketing voluntarily and seeking competitive advantage through environmental friendliness. Thus, the example of these progressive companies should be the direction towards sustainable development in business and society. The results also give evidence that green values, environmental marketing strategies, structures and functions are logically connected to each other as hypothesised according to the model of environmental marketing used to guide this study.</jats:p>",

The index was considered to be more realistic for crop planning, since the same included number of rainy days. Linear relationships established between the weekly rainfall distribution index (RDI) and weekly rainfall, were found to hold good at 1 per cent level of significance and the regression equations explained more than eighty per cent variation in RDI values. Expected weekly RDI values showed zero values, thirty fifth week (Aug. 27 – Sep. 2) and thereafter at eighty per cent chances, suggesting the necessity of short duration crop varieties for the kharif season.</jats:p>",

Up to date, the models designed to support this kind of decision failed in their application. We found that the main reason is that often these models restrict the problem to a unique aspect (such as “covering of the territory” or “technique efficiency”), leaving outside a set of very important other dimensions, even if these are usually subjective and difficult to formalise. In this paper we present a method to identify formally these dimensions, by assigning measurable attributes to each of them. At a different level, we propose a hierarchical formulation of the overall objective of the regional healthcare resource planning for the facility systems; in this hierarchy, each leaf term corresponds to a formal evaluation criterion.</jats:p>",

In the second part I report on an ethnographic study of the Internet and the lessons learned for how it could most effectively be used. In the third part I present the outline of a programme for inclusion within the school geography curriculum to use the Internet to educate children in their responsibilities as consumers. This consists of following three products, all of which are personalised to the children as end consumers. Using the Internet they would follow all stages of production, distribution, transportation, and the combination of elements that constitute the commodity. All such processes are seen through the labour of those involved. The result may not fully defetishise the commodity in respect to wider issues of power and control, but it might turn the current interest in commodity chains into an attempt to transform the consciousness of consumers for the benefit of producers. </jats:p>",

Two broad themes are discernible in this work. On the one hand there are those who argue that the speed of change is so fast that organisations and managers who can respond almost instinctively and improvise responses quickly will do well. On the other, there are those who argue that more formalised systems of strategic development and control are needed to give organisations a competitive advantage. The results from an empirical study of some 267 organisations are used to shed some light on this debate. The evidence supports the idea that a growing organisation is associated with the existence of internal strategic systems that support the firm’s growth ambitions, allowing it to make not only “good” business decisions and to monitor how well the organisations is doing against its strategy, but to do so speedily.</jats:p>",

I focus on how commodification affects how people value things, practices, themselves, and others. It is argued that, although traditional critiques of consumer culture have often been both elitist and weakly supported empirically, some of their normative distinctions can be used to illuminate more positive aspects of consumption. In particular, the distinction between internal and external goods enables us to appreciate that much consumption is not primarily a form of status seeking but a means to the development of skills, achievements, commitments, and relationships which have value regardless of whether they bring participants external rewards. Although Bourdieu's analysis of inequalities and the struggles of the social field misses this distinction, use of it helps to illuminate how the struggles are for internal goods as well as for status and power. Finally, by reference to recent work by Miller on altruistic shopping, I question the common related criticism of consumer culture as individualistic, and conclude. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we explore the contested spaces of contemporary commodity culture through case-study research with two fashion companies that are involved, in linked but contrasting ways, with the production and marketing of cultural difference. One company, the British-based women's wear firm EAST, is striving to extend its high-street presence via a generalised ‘ethnic’ aesthetic, combined with culturally constructed notions of design individuality. The other firm, the Indian-based company Anokhi, has a more ambivalent relationship with the commercial ‘mainstream’, emphasising its use of traditional hand-block printing methods, combined with a sense of social responsibility and ethical commitment to its workforce. The case studies demonstrate that cultural difference is actively constituted through the process of commodification, justifying an emphasis on the production of difference as well as on its consumption. We draw on in-depth interviews and participant observation with key actors in both firms, examining how the meaning of goods is shaped as they move along the commodity chain from production to consumption. We examine the retail spaces and marketing strategies of the two firms and explore (via focus-group research) the further transformations of meaning and value undertaken by consumers as they purchase and wear these clothes. We conclude that commercial culture is a contested space characterised by competing discourses and practices, the outcome of which can only be determined empirically. </jats:p>",

This paper outlines the process of Scheme development, which required effective integration of varied technical studies and extensive consultation with a diverse group of stakeholders. The process has delivered a scheme which exceeds authority, community and user objectives in terms of cost, environmental protection and operational efficiency. The consultative process implemented for scheme development and optimisation of the REMS concept are discussed as are operational challenges and scheme benefits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply alternatives to alleviate water shortage damages in urbanized watersheds are itemized and evaluated in terms of cost, life cycle energy (LCE), and damages. A newly developed stochastic model of precipitation and constructed GIS databases are applied to estimation of potential water resources in the Hakata bay watershed in Japan. Based on these results, water supply alternatives in the watershed are selected at several return periods on less annual precipitation in the order of minimizing cost, LCE, and damages. The water supply alternatives selected are cascade reuse in house, groundwater, two kinds of recycled water, and desalinated water. The storage water volume in the reservoirs at initial time, annual precipitation, and annual precipitation patterns are considered as three factors on water shortage from the water supply side. The unit values of cost, LCE, and damages are obtained to estimate damages of water shortage and to consider measures for water supply by applying the above three factors. Finally, based on statistical distribution of damages on water shortage, a new planning method to avoid water shortage is developed and how to decide a design precipitation level is proposed in terms of the return period of damages instead of that of precipitation.</jats:p>",

They were asked to draw the cups as they saw them and to select one among five picture cards (circle, horizontal, orientation-centered, vertical, view-specific) that matched their drawing plan. Analysis showed in both partial and total occlusions in the drawing 4-yr.-olds more often drew either a circle or the two cups horizontally; 5-yr.-olds drew the two cups vertically, while 6-yr.-olds made view-specific drawings, that is, drew the cups as seen. On the planning task for partial and total occlusions 4-yr.-olds selected the picture card representing a circle or two horizontally drawn cups, 5-yr.-olds tended to pick the card of two vertically drawn cups, while 6-yr.-olds chose the view-specific picture card, like their drawn products. These results suggested that planning and drawing were similar within and across age groups and that children's drawing reflected the representation of their planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the implementation of the 1994 Law of Popular Participation (LPP) nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) assumed a new role as intermediaries between the government and the Bolivian population. The law, at the heart of a decentralization program, transferred 20% of the national budget to municipalities, established participatory planning, and mandated oversight by grass-roots territorial organizations. In some cases, NGOs with long-term commitments to an area have served as effective planning agents, successfully assisting a relatively democratic process of decentralization, and using their project-writing expertise to find matching grants to leverage revenue-sharing funds. Perhaps most important, some NGOs have educated residents of small municipalities about their rights to participate in local planning and budgeting. At the same time, rivalries between NGOs, NGO control of planning, and the failure to establish a permanent presence in a municipality have limited NGO effectiveness. Despite these shortcomings, NGOs have the potential to help prevent local elite cooption of the LPP and the corruption found throughout the country as small municipalities develop the technical capacity to direct local development. </jats:p><jats:p> Examination of the Bolivian experience offers lessons both on the opportunities and on the limitations of NGOs as partners with governments that seek efficient and more equitable solutions to problems of local development. This assessment is particularly important as multilateral donors and institutions have consistently used Bolivia over the past fifteen years to experiment with new policy models which they later apply elsewhere in the developing world. </jats:p>",

From the late 1940s up to the major housing reforms of the early 1990s, a form of strong economic planning characterised the Swedish housing sector. By the early 1970s, the housing standard for all income-groups had been raised markedly and urban slums eliminated. Yet, Sweden's success came at huge resource cost while at the same time important equity goals were compromised. For example, Swedish building costs are among the highest in the world while in Sweden's major cities socioeconomic segregation is more pronounced than ever before in the post-war period. </jats:p>",

Characteristics of the Turkish way of using shopping malls, and their social and spatial consequences, are investigated and analyzed through a case study in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. The field survey was carried out in Bilkent Shopping Center, a newly built shopping mall in a suburban area which was also established recently as a high-income housing settlement. This shopping mall is an appropriate example of spatial transformations under the influence of global forces, which may also give clues about changes in urban lifestyle. A field survey was carried out through user surveys, and various observations are used to enrich the analysis. The results indicate that the shopping mall as a postmodern site matched the changing shopping and consumption requirements of Turkish urban citizens. The development of the shopping mall turns out to be timely for the Turkish urban citizen searching for modernity through new identity components in consumption patterns. Some benefit from this development more than others, for example, working women, indicating the process of feminization of the flaneur. However, these sites simultaneously produce a new arena of negotiation and conflict as well, creating new forms of exclusion—particularly for the urban poor. Although malls appear more public and democratic than the streets for the time being, the potential for segregation is implicit in their private character. </jats:p>",

The substantive focus is the electronics cluster of the Toronto region, Canada's largest manufacturing center. A small, stratified sample of establishments drawn from this cluster is used to verify the importance of external sources of material inputs, and other knowledge sources, and the strength of distant market connections. Interregional and local collaboration vary in importance as a result of scale-dependent resource differences between firms and in response to choices associated with foreign rather than domestic ownership. The results support the rejection of simple models of clusters and learning regions in which internal connections are privileged over interregional and international transactions operating either between or within firms. </jats:p>",

Drawing on research conducted among forest-dwelling Kenyah communities in Kalimantan, Indonesia, during 1995 to 1998, I show that the realization of resource rights must be understood in the social context of how boundaries are interpreted and negotiated. Access to and control over forest resources is as much a matter of boundary keeping as of boundary setting. The analysis shows that boundary keepers assessed whether someone should be given access based on the potential user's entitlement, identity, and the potential for exchange. Understanding the ‘fuzziness’ of how seemingly clear boundary rules are applied should provide a more realistic picture of how groups gain and control access to resources in practice. </jats:p>",

Equivalence, in turn, rotates around a specific numerological metaphysics, including the concept of zero and the algebraic function. Yet, rarely are the mathematics of equivalence subject to critical scrutiny. In this paper I explore contemporary alternative numerologies of money and finance. The alternatives that I consider are a US local scrip currency and transnational Islamic finance experiments. My data come from fieldwork in Ithaca, New York, and from research among Islamic finance specialists devising new financial products. I am interested in how these alternatives make explicit the moral form of the mathematics of the general equivalent. </jats:p>",

The existence of a general trend towards devolution also has significant implications for efficiency, equity, and administration. The authors outline first the general drive towards devolution and then proceed to examine which countries are experiencing which forms of decentralisation. A theoretical argument emphasising the role of governmental legitimacy across various tiers of government is used to explain the diversity of devolution initiatives, drawing on examples that include Brazil, Mexico, India, China, the USA, and some European countries. Having supported their model of decentralisation, the authors then examine the implications of the widespread downward transfer of power towards regions. Some of the less widely discussed pitfalls of decentralisation are presented; caution in promoting devolutionary efforts is the prescription of this paper. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the author examines the development and causes of territorial inequalities in the postcommunist economies of East–Central Europe (ECE), with a specific focus on the Slovak Republic (Slovakia). He begins by examining the extent of regional economic differentiation in ECE, within the context of the European Union (EU) enlargement process, and argues that an EU of twenty-five or twenty-seven states will face enormous territorial inequality. Through a specific examination of the experience of Slovakia he then goes on to examine some of the determinants and trajectories of these territorial inequalities. Specifically, he focuses on the contribution of relative regional industrial productivity trends in the second half of the 1990s to the endurance of territorial disparities. A decomposition of regional productivity and employment across industrial sectors is provided to examine some of the reasons for the comparative performance of Slovakia's regional economies. Attention is paid to the role of key strategic inward investment projects in the upgrading of particular regional industrial sectors. In contrast, other forms of global integration through, for example, outward processing of clothing for the EU market have, in other regions, been unable to stimulate a positive upgrading of regional productivity. Indeed, it is argued that the challenge for transitional economies such as Slovakia in the early part of the 21st century is how to manage the process of increasing, yet geographically uneven, global and European economic integration at the same time as ensuring that territorial and social inequalities are reduced. </jats:p>",

The examination identifies gaps and highlights forest management planning aspects that require gap–bridging interventions at the forest management unit (FMU) level. The three levels (parts) of the FMPM—Management Planning, Annual Operations, and Reporting &amp; Monitoring—are examined. Gaps are categorized in three groups—major, intermediate, and minor gaps. Major gaps are recorded for five out of 22 elements of the CCFM C&amp;I framework, and these gaps indicate inadequate prescriptions for the corresponding elements at all the three levels. Minor gaps are also recorded for five elements, and these gaps indicate inadequate prescriptions at the monitoring level. Intermediate gaps are recorded for 11 elements, and depending on the specific element and indicator, inadequacy of prescriptions may only be for operations, reporting and monitoring, or may also include the planning level. The main findings of the gap analysis are that none of the six criteria of SFM has been fully incorporated in the FMPM; Part C (Reporting and Monitoring) has the highest degree and Part A (Plan Contents) has the lowest degree of non–conformity with respect to CCFM C&amp;I framework; at the criterion–level the Global Ecological Cycles has major gaps while three criteria—Soil and Water Conservation, Multiple Benefits, and Society' Responsibility—have intermediate gaps; and the changes in the FMPM have been incremental while the shift in the concept of forest management from Sustained Yield Timber Management to SFM was a drastic change. Key words: biological diversity, Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, criteria and indicators, ecological cycles, forest management, multiple benefits, society's responsibility </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses the extent to which EU-derived gender mainstreaming (GM) requirements are being adopted with reference to Royal Town Planning Institute research on the situation in UK local planning authorities (LPAs). Firstly, the problem of a lack of gender perspective on planning policy is summarised. Barriers to progress are explained and the role of enablers is identified. International and European factors that resulted in GM becoming an integral component of the UK planning system are explained. The second part of the paper outlines the current extent of GM in LPAs. Although generic equalities policy is widespread, it is primarily concerned with personnel matters and there is little understanding of the impact of gender considerations on planning policy. At best there is an assumption that only policies related to women's traditional roles are affected. At worst some LPAs do not consider gender to be of any relevance to the planning process, particularly in departments where there is little social awareness and a technical and quantitative approach predominates. The methodological steps required to achieve GM that need to be applied to the planning process are summarised. Little will change unless central government gives high-level guidance on mainstreaming, and resource allocation and awareness training is increased. Cultural change is needed within the profession to enable planners to take gender seriously. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every 4 years, rowers from around the world compete in a 50- to 60-day transAtlantic rowing challenge. These ultra-distance rowers require a diet that provides adequate calories, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fluids so they can perform well day after day, minimize fatigue, and stay healthy. Yet, the rowers are confronted with menu planning challenges. The food needs to be lightweight, compact, sturdy, non-spoiling in tropical temperatures, calorie dense, easy to prepare, quick to cook, and good tasting. Financial concerns commonly add another menu planning challenge. The purpose of this case study is to summarize the rowers’ food experiences and to provide guidance for sports nutrition professionals who work with ultra-endurance athletes embarking on a physical challenge with similar food requirements. The article provides food and nutrition recommendations as well as practical considerations for ultra-distance athletes. We describe an 8,000 calorie per day menu planning model that uses food exchanges based on familiar, tasty, and reasonably priced supermarket foods that provide the required nutrients and help contain financial costs.</jats:p>",

Generating paint gun trajectories for free-form surfaces to satisfy paint thickness requirements is still highly challenging due to the complex geometry of free-form surfaces. In this paper, a CAD-guided paint gun trajectory generation system for free-form surfaces has been developed. The system utilizes the CAD information of a free-form surface to be painted and a paint gun model to generate a paint gun trajectory to satisfy the paint thickness requirements. The paint thickness deviation from the required paint thickness is optimized by modifying the paint gun velocity. A paint thickness verication method is also provided to verify the generated trajectories. The results of simulations have shown that the trajectory generation system achieves satisfactory performance. This trajectory generation system can also be applied to generate trajectories for many other CAD-guided robot trajectory planning applications. </jats:p>",

The general argument of the paper is that under certain conditions such a model may represent an unsatisfactory characterization of actual conditions which, in turn, may cause decisionmakers to make an inaccurate diagnosis of a regional problem, leading to an inappropriate policy response. After considering the core–periphery model and its recent extensions, this general argument is examined with respect to the Southern region of Israel, a region customarily viewed as one of the nation's peripheries. It is demonstrated that in several important respects the region does not conform to the usual stereotype of the periphery. The impact of public policy on the development of the region is also considered, and it is argued that the particular form of intervention has not always been in the best interests of the region. Two alternative policy emphases for the future development of the Southern region are outlined. </jats:p>",

Right-hand dominant individuals, 15 with right stroke (right-sided brain damage), 16 with left stroke, and 30 without stroke, performed aiming movements to targets. Those with stroke used the ipsilesional upper extremity (UE). Right and left comparison groups used the right and left UE, respectively. Reaction time (RT) and movement time (MT) were collected to represent movement planning and execution, respectively. Individuals with right stroke improved RT with practice. Individuals with left stroke did not improve RT with practice and made more errors than their comparison group. Those with left stroke achieved faster MT with practice, but MT remained slower than their comparison group. There were no effects of the distractor on RT or MT. Adults with left stroke have persistent deficits in movement planning and execution. Further studies are needed to determine how the performance of older adults, with or without stroke, is affected by an unpredictable visual distractor.</jats:p>",

Service statistics suggest a rising trend in MR and induced abortion, which is expected to decline as contraceptive use rate increases. It is observed that knowledge of MR had not significantly increased over time and women did not differentiate between MR and abortion. Findings from case studies suggest that in most cases husbands have supported decisions regarding both contraception and pregnancy termination. Understanding the experiences of MR users will help service providers to identify problems faced by a particular group of women who desperately need quality reproductive health services. </jats:p>",

As forest management practices in Canada evolve from a sustained yield, timber-based focus to a more sustainable approach, the need has been recognized for the addition of landscape or watershed-based management strategies to address the cumulative effects of management practices on aquatic systems. Additional concerns expressed by regulatory agencies have resulted in the need to restrict cumulative harvest rates and monitor harvest levels for a forest management operation in Manitoba. Present riparian management practices and watershed analysis procedures are reviewed for the operations of Louisiana-Pacific Canada in Manitoba. Requirements are outlined for multi-scale indicators and research to support the development of a watershed-based planning approach for use in forest management planning and monitoring. The development of this watershed-based approach is linked to the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project.

Post-Fordism, chain inversion, and liberalisation allow for consumer-oriented monitoring, which increases the countervailing power of end-users and strengthens the potentials of citizen-consumers to change the infrastructures of consumption.

Given recent epidemiological evidence concerning chlorinated disinfection byproducts in drinking water and cancer outcomes, some branches within Health Canada have been undertaking an extensive review of the issue. This paper examines what impact contested scientific authorities, as filtered through a regulatory agency, may have on the policymaking process in the setting of Canadian drinking-water guidelines. Using an agenda-setting framework, we rely on a textual analysis of a Health Canada expert panel report and a position paper written to accompany the panel report; Canadian print media translations of scientific evidence; and in-depth interviews with scientists (from the academy, industry, and government) and other interested stakeholders [for example, chlorine and water industry, and environmental nongovernmental organizations]. Through this analysis we reconstruct a discourse which suggests government-science in policy, rather than policymakers, is primarily and presently driving the issue. The issue itself appears to remain a debate which is largely over the strength of the scientific evidence from regulatory and public-health scientists (for example, in Health Canada), and their colleague research scientists (for example, leading researchers in the field). Although we argue that it is primarily cancer that drives the science-policy agenda, with respect to chlorinated drinking water, it is possible that reproductive effects are likely to be central to the debate for controlling chlorine use in the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is widely acknowledged that China's economic miracle has been achieved at the expense of its natural environment. Although considerable emphasis is now being given to the environment in the central government's current policy initiatives, reversing the degradation of natural capital will require the full range of policy mechanisms. Although businesses must be made to comply with regulations, collaboration from management will be required to implement various nonregulatory policy mechanisms. Consequently, it is important to understand managers' assessment of the current situation, particularly in light of China's ‘command-and-control’ tradition and whom they hold responsible. From a sample of 653 managers in three large urban centers, it was found that Chinese managers hold multiple institutions responsible. The central and local governments are held primarily responsible—both for not having passed stricter regulations and for not having enforced those already on the books. Economic organizations are held secondarily responsible. Significant differences among sectors and regions, however, were also observed.</jats:p>",

Patients subsequently received the AneuRx (n=157) or Ancure (n=13) device; intraprocedural IVUS was used to survey the proximal endograft for proper apposition to the aortic wall. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> Reliable preoperative IVUS measurements were obtained in all patients. Plaque morphology was assessed in 140 (82.3%) aortic necks; in 36 (25.7%), preoperative IVUS showed high-grade atherosclerotic plaque in the nonaneurysmal abdominal aortic neck. The procedure was successful in 168 (98.8%) cases (1 [0.6%] acute conversion and 1 access failure). There were 2 (1.2%) periprocedural deaths related to bowel ischemia. Four (2.3%) patients developed graft occlusion/kinking and 2 (1.2%) developed renal failure requiring dialysis within 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (p=0.0247), a short nonaneurysmal aortic neck (p=0.0185), and presence of high-grade atherosclerotic plaque (p=0.0185) correlated with major acute complications. Over a mean 10.4-month follow-up (range 1–25), 11 patients died of unrelated causes; there was no known AAA rupture or device failure. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 1 year was 91.0%±2.8%. Sixteen (9.4%) patients underwent 17 secondary procedures for endoleak or graft limb occlusion at a mean 5.4 months after stent-graft repair (freedom from secondary intervention at 1 year 86.5%±3.2%). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> Our findings suggest that IVUS may identify patients at increased risk of major adverse complications following endovascular repair.

Systems theory is an integrative theory, which helps clinicians identify and prioritise key areas of difficulty, and organise information from multiple system levels into a well‐defined treatment plan. Treatment plans take into account not only patient but also service factors, and to be viable in clinical settings must function within the limits of organisational reality.

These four criteria are constitutive of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which has become the dominant rhetorical device of environmental governance. We discuss the tendency for disciplinary research to focus on particular subsets of the four criteria, and argue that such a practice promotes solutions that do not acknowledge the dynamics of scale and the heterogeneity of institutional contexts. We advocate an interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of environmental decisionmaking that seeks to identify legitimate and context-sensitive institutional solutions producing equitable, efficient, and effective outcomes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by using it to examine decisions concerning contested nature conservation and multiple-use commons in the management of Hickling Broad in Norfolk in the United Kingdom. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches enable the generalisation and transfer of lessons in a way that respects the specifics and context of the issue at hand. </jats:p>",

Continued STI case management at the FP clinics is nevertheless justified because there exists an easily identifiable group of higher risk women who need STI care; and because of the demand by a large proportion of clients, the high prevalence of vaginal pathogens, and the limited costs to the FP programme.</jats:p>",

One result is the reduction of costs for administration and coordination. When realizing the demands of the non-hierarchical network model and at the same time considering the structure of the competence cell therein, questions for necessary development of the competence cell process planning arise for this form of cooperation. This contribution introduces initial results of research concerning the structuring of process planning competence in non-hierarchical production networks. </jats:p>",
