Intranational and international crises and conflicts will increase sharply during the next several decades unless we manage socioeconomic development competently. Crises within nation‐states will lead to and spill over into conflicts between nations as the resources needed to cope with domestic situations are sought elsewhere in a highly competitive international market. Human resources and natural resources are not distributed equally; some of the most developed countries are poor in resources and some of the least developed are rich in natural resources. Similarly, population densities and growth rates are unevenly distributed, with population pressures emanating from the less developed nations, and technologic‐economic pressures coming from the more developed ones. In the world as a whole, population growth will outrun resource availability if current growth rates and rates of resource exploitation and use are maintained. Should present trends continue unchanged, major crises could precipitate worldwide conflicts within the next decade or two.</jats:p>",

In this way planners can be more effective in “getting through” to those with whom they must communicate. Obviously, having your thoughts heard is no guarantee that they will be accepted, but it is a necessary first step. It is also a step in which attempts at communication are often abandoned, because planners, discouraged by their inability to “get through,” give up.</jats:p>",

However, to appreciate fully the present state of planning for law libraries in Canada, it is helpful first to have some idea of the history of our development. It is a history which indicates that law library service in Canada has been very slow in evolving.

These studies attempt to isolate those concepts which might lead to costly and intractable infrastructure problems. Several analytical tools that may be used to explore the implications of strategic development alternatives are described.A land use-transport model is described which may be used to estimate the implications of alternative public development policies. These policies may include servicing and transportation options, basic and service employment location alternatives, and zoning. The model calculates an internally consistent co-distribution of population and employment along with the associated travel demands for each set of public policies. A corridor-level traffic assignment technique is described which may be used along with the land use-transport model to develop corridor travel demand estimates for each development concept. Computer-based procedures for estimating the servicing requirements of alternative development concepts are also described. These procedures directly employ the land use allocations calculated by the land use model. The use of the analytical tools is illustrated with information from the Hamilton area. </jats:p>",

Clearly, this pursuit of an adequate supply of jobs is essential, particularly in the midst of a recession. But even the achievement of full employment would leave many basic and enduring employ ment problems unaffected—problems such as subemploy ment, underemployment, low-level employment and in voluntary employment. Society fails to respond to these problems because the performance criteria for the economy are directed towards measuring the quantity of jobs and not their quality. Moreover, we have developed a panoply of myths and rationalizations to support the single-minded pursuit of more jobs and lower unemployment rates. These myths blind us to the fact that the nature of employment is a powerful influence on such social problems as poverty, family disorganization and delinquency. Rather than pursuing full employment, then, a more inclusive and appropriate goal might be total employment. This condition—one in which everyone who desires a job would be reasonably assured of finding a satisfying one—can not be achieved through a single, monolithic government program. \"Total employment\" would be the state of equilibrium in the economy achieved as the result of workers' making free choices about when, where and in what jobs they work. Freedom of choice of workers could be enhanced by removing the artificial barriers and constraints that currently prevent them from realizing their personal employment needs. The policy would even permit reluctant workers to leave the work force, thus opening jobs for willing but unemployed workers. </jats:p>",
