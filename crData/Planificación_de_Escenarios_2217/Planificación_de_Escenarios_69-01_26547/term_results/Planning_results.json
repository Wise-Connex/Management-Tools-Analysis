      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study of the Ottawa area points out that a rural planning gap exists between city planning on the one hand and conservation on the other. It explores the gap and introduces five general planning territories which need essentially different treatment.\nThe first three of these territories are defined as townscape, farmscape and wildscape and it is recognized that they are all fundamentally stable and desirable. The other two are the rurban fringe and the twilight fringe which are the unstable and undesirable zones of conflict between the scapes.\nThey are characterized by extensive areas of idle land and they need to be planned out of existence.\nIn Part I the general principles of the five territories are explained. The general problems of idle land are discussed and some possible methods of resolving them are suggested.\nIn Part Il the methods of survey and identification of the five territories are described and the location of their boundaries in the Ottawa area is established. Each territory is analyzed in turn and special attention given to the effect upon them of the Ottawa greenbelt.\nThe interaction of the territories is considered to support the case for some form of regional government in order that their differing needs may be considered and satisfied in an integrated way.</jats:p>"

Of those who advise directly 92% prescribe the pill; 32 % of the respondents have had training in contraceptive methods. Doctors trained in Ireland were less likely to suggest contraception measures on their own initiative or to prescribe the pill, and more likely to prescribe the safe period than doctors trained elsewhere in the British Isles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In an integrated pulp and papermill, all subprocesses are interrelated. This means that they cannot always be run at the optimum production level, since the result as a whole is decisive. The production managers have for many years successfully carried out the difficult scheduling of an entire mill. With increasing complexity of a modern mill, it is desirable to help production managers more systematically to utilise existing storage capacities. Thus, a production control system has been developed for the Gruv√∂n mill. The mathematical formulation and solution of the scheduling problem is based upon optimum control theory.  In order to perform unavoidable production changes with the minimum of disturbances, the process control must not only produce uniform quality during steady state conditions, but whenever possible carry out production changes without introducing disturbances in the quality of the product. In order to implement computerised production and process control systems, good human relations must exist between computer staff and production personnel. This, together with good technical solutions, including the man/machine interface, will guarantee success.</jats:p>"
