      "abstract": "<jats:p>At stable oil prices in the low 20s (US dollars per barrel), a reference case for oil market developments sees annual oil demand growth of 1.5 million barrels per day over the period 2000–10. At these prices, non‐OPEC production growth, mainly from developing countries and the former Soviet Union, is expected to meet less than one‐third of this increase in demand; this means that an annual rise in output of around 1 mb/d is required from OPEC, increasing to 1.4 mb/d yearly over the period 2010–20. However, high prices, above $30/b, lead to lower oil demand, and, in particular, a strong response in non‐OPEC production for both conventional and unconventional oil. Consequently, there will be a sharp reduction in OPEC market share, with even production levels having to continually fall. Such a scenario suggests that a price of $30/b and above may be unsustainable. The moot question remains at what price non‐linear non‐OPEC production responses may be triggered in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The need for the development of a method for generating an ensemble of rainfall scenarios, which are conditioned on the observed rainfall, and its place in the HYREX programme is discussed. A review of stochastic models for rainfall, and rainfall forecasting techniques, is followed by a justification for the choice of the Modified Turning Bands (MTB) model in this context. This is a stochastic model of rainfall which is continuous over space and time, and which reproduces features of real rainfall fields at four distinct scales: raincells, cluster potential regions, rainbands and the overall outline of a storm at the synoptic scale. The model can be used to produce synthetic data sets, in the same format as data from a radar. An inversion procedure for inferring a construction of the MTB model which generates a given sequence of radar images is described. This procedure is used to generate an ensemble of future rainfall scenarios which are consistent with a currently observed storm. The combination of deterministic modelling at the large scales and stochastic modelling at smaller scales, within the MTB model, makes the system particularly suitable for short-term forecasts. As the lead time increases, so too does the variability across the set of generated scenarios.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The sites in our nation's nuclear weapons complex contain over 4,000 square miles of largely undeveloped, scenic, wildlife‐rich, and ecologically unique lands. In light of recent directives and programs within the Department of Energy (DOE) aimed toward multiple uses of sites and leasing or sale of excess lands, it is time to assess low‐impact, low‐risk, and cost‐effective ways to utilize more of the environmental, ecological, and aesthetic values of these sites. This article examines wildlife‐related outdoor recreation as an economic development option on and around DOE sites. We use an economic impact simulation model for the two‐state region around the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina to illustrate the economic benefits. The objective was to demonstrate the outcome of plausible alternatives. The article demonstrates that even a moderate investment in expanded recreation could add up to several hundred new jobs almost immediately and even more jobs 15 years into the future. To the extent that sportsmen and tourists travelporn areas outside the two states, the benefits to the entire two‐state region are increased. We also found that as an efzcient form of economic investment, recreation holds up well against other alternafives.</jats:p>",
