      "abstract": "<jats:p> Freeways have profoundly influenced the form and function of U.S. cities, yet urban planners generally played only a peripheral role in their development. This article traces the history of freeway development in California to show how political negotiations between local and state governments over street and highway finance resulted in urban freeways financed, designed, and built by the state highway department. To fund their ambitious transportation plans, local officials and planners in cities like Los Angeles turned over control of the planning and development of urban freeways in the 1940s and 1950s to state departments of transportation. This shift in control led to, among other things, the construction of freeways too large to fit easily into cities and freeway networks too sparse to adequately disperse urban traffic. While federal surface transportation legislation returned significant control over metropolitan freeways to regions and planners in the 1990s, the influence of modern freeways on urban life endures. </jats:p>",

Sustainability is seen as requiring a holistic, long-term planning approach, as well as certain general policy directions such as compact urban form, reductions in automobile use, protection of ecosystems, and improved equity. Based on the experience of three sample regions, the article suggests a long-term strategic approach in which vision statements, coalition building, institutional development, intergovernmental incentive frameworks, indicators, public involvement, and social learning help create a regional context in which sustainable development is increasingly possible. </jats:p>",

We review the use of the GIS technique in earlier research studies and represent the empirical findings from using GIS in a quality-of-life study in conjunction with an urban renewal project of a residential area in Stockholm County, Sweden. Special attention is given to the potential of GIS for mapping qualitative data representing people's needs and judgments about their residential areas. We conclude with a discussion of future challenges in using GIS techniques in combination with the Internet for social analysis in renewal planning. One of the arguments proposed is that the tool can be used to promote the involvement of urban residents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past quarter century, normative planning theory has argued that planning should be participatory. And a body of empirical studies has found that mainstream planning practice is participatory in some sense. At the same time, however, there is a competing body of empirical studies that disputes the claim that planning is participatory in any meaningful way. As participation becomes more and more prominent in shaping the practice of local government planning, it is important to try to shed light on this apparent contradiction. To that end, the authors have investigated the development of the most recent comprehensive plan for Jackson/Teton County, Wyoming. What appeared to be a process of high involvement and inclusiveness did not lead to community consensus around the plan, nor did it affirm the merits of planning. This study is an exploration of why participatory planning failed to achieve its potential in a community with a history of local problem solving. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two new models of language planning are proposed in this paper. The approach is similar to that used in business planning of viewing industries and organisations as sets of interrelated activities, as an aid to analysis and planning. The first model develops a three-level view of language planning and aims to develop a more strategic approach. The three levels in the model are ‘Status Planning’, ‘Language Planning’, and ‘Functional Language Planning’. The second model, the Integrated Language Planning Model, is related to the second level of language planning, and is designed to facilitate a comprehensive and integrated approach to reinforcing targeted languages. The model disaggregrates language reinforcement efforts into two types of activities — primary activities and support activities. The primary activities are those that are designed to directly influence changes in language behaviour. The support activities support the primary activities and each other by managing and facilitating the language reinforcement effort.</jats:p>",

Its decline in fortune has recently prompted a number of corpus and status planning initiatives which, largely devoid of State support, lie in the hands of a small, non-linguistically trained, group of enthusiasts. This paper examines the different agencies of language planning on Jersey and the progress they have made hitherto, comparing the corpus and status planning undertaken in this context with that which occurs in countries where more support is forthcoming from the State, and situating the position of Jèrriais within the contemporary language planning literature. It also suggests some possible avenues for the future and discusses the factors which are likely to determine the success or otherwise of the outcome. The paper highlights the fact that, by themselves, high-prestige domains such as the school do not necessarily hold the key to successful language maintenance.</jats:p>",

These contradictory characterizations of GIS permeate the current debate on transfer and applications of the technology in indigenous communities. This article reviews the debate in the context of GIS adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. A case study is presented to demonstrate how GIS can be used to assist local community representatives to plan for the protection of local forest resources. The results of the study, which was implemented at Kofiase in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, reinforce the belief that GIS can be used for the benefit of indigenous groups rather than for their disempowerment. </jats:p>",

Or, as safe‐motherhood advocates claim, do public health and social policy interventions have the potential to accelerate maternal mortality transitions? Globally, almost one in 200 live births leads to the death of the mother, making maternal mortality an issue of critical international import. This article presents an analysis of the determinants of national maternal mortality levels with a view to shedding light on these questions. A cross‐national regression of 64 countries shows that wealth indicators explain only a portion of the variance in national maternal mortality levels. Other determinants, including women's educational levels and the proportion of deliveries attended by trained health personnel, are more clearly associated with national maternal mortality levels than are measures of wealth. The results offer grounds for optimism concerning the potential for global safe‐motherhood efforts to induce maternal mortality transitions.</jats:p>",

This article examines contrasts between the rhetoric and realities of the university, the community, and partnership with case material from the University of Maryland’s Urban Community Service Program partnership with a Southeast Baltimore education organization. The case highlights the importance of starting partnerships with definiteness about outcomes and resources but maintaining adaptability in process. </jats:p>",

They critically examine empirical evidence on changing neighborhood racial group composition, income group composition, social and economic conditions (criminal activity, friendship, teen child-bearing, marriage, educational attainment, employment and earnings, social relationships, health, and welfare dependency), and housing investment. The authors find evidence of threshold effects in dynamics of all these neighborhood attributes. The possibility of identifying thresholds provides guidance to planners for spatially targeting reinvestments to those neighborhoods approaching or past critical thresholds. Future research needs to devise careful empirical tests designed to distinguish the alternative mechanisms producing thresholds and ascertain the generality of findings summarized in this review. </jats:p>",

Participants included school district representatives, architects, builders, trades-people, end-use marketers, and solid waste specialists, with each of the participants representing a different perspective of school construction. The study underscored potential changes other participants could adopt that might lead to increasing the total capacity of school construction stakeholders to divert solid waste materials from the waste stream. Themes studied included (a) valuing waste diversion, (b) building infrastructure capacity, (c) balancing cost-effectiveness with strategies, and (d) communicating strategies and obstacles. In particular, the study identified activities currently used and obstacles to solid waste diversion efforts. </jats:p>",

In this article, the authors discuss the use of aesthetic controls in the United States and review the case for and against restricting architectural expression. The authors then examine two questions: what is the rationale for protecting such expression, and to what extent is this protection warranted? They find two very strong but conflicting interests—one in controlling design expression and the other in not doing so. How might this conflict be resolved? The authors propose a middle ground that is characterized by four criteria: a clearly articulated and demonstrable public interest, demonstrable links to the stated intent, application early in the design or decision process, and allowing and encouraging a variety of acceptable decisions. </jats:p>",

In particular, women appeared much readier to report symptoms to lay interviewers after being invited to undergo a clinical examination in the near future than they were if no examination were offered. Little consistency was found in the results obtained from interviews, clinical examinations, and laboratory tests. Apparently, no alternative exists to the collection of biological specimens for laboratory analysis when estimates of disease prevalence are needed. Use of generic health‐related quality‐of‐life assessments is recommended for future surveys.

The ultra-orthodox Yiddish-speaking community is the only one among all of the “Jewish languages other than Hebrew” which has both a continually growing number of young speakers as well as demographically concentrated residential areas with neighborhood institutions (schools, synagogues) utilizing their own vernacular. The secular Yiddish sector is much richer in modern language-related institutional infrastructure and intelligentsia but is almost in total disarray insofar as demographic concentration of young speakers, schools with adequate instructional time and young institutional leadership are concerned. Ladino is even worse off, with respect to speakers and infrastructure, but has recently moved ahead noticeably due to prominent younger leaders with a rich agenda of important goals and projects. Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Persian both suffer from a dire lack of language-focused intellectuals as well as the absence of a dominant spoken or written variety and are still regarded by their own speakers as dialects lacking in autonomy. None of the latter three languages/varieties has either a periodical press or book-production and the last two lack even courses, teachers or pedagogic materials appropriate for young students. The current insufficiency of funds and less-than-informed efforts on behalf of governmental authorities may lead to the early demise of most “other Jewish languages than Hebrew” in Israel, with the distinct exception of Yiddish in ultra-Orthodox circles.</jats:p>",

Abortion statistics from 1975 to 1995 from the Ministry of Health and Welfare are reviewed. The abortion rate (the number of cases of induced abortion per 1,000 women per year) for women younger than 20 increased during the study period. The abortion ratio (number of cases per 1,000 live births) remained the highest among women aged 40–44. An increase in the abortion ratio was seen in the two youngest groups (younger than 20 and 20–24), especially among those who were born after 1955. The proportion of abortions experienced by women younger than 25 increased from 18 percent between 1976 and 1980 to 30 percent between 1991 and 1995, and a slight increase was also observed among women aged 40–44. The proportion of abortions performed after eight weeks of a pregnancy for the two youngest groups remained higher than that for older age groups during 1975–95. The analysis demonstrates that women younger than 25 should be the principal concern of family planning policy in Japan. Further investigations on unintended pregnancy are recommended.</jats:p>",

It also provides the cities with the financial support necessary for the elimination of the underendowment of services and infrastructure caused by abusivism. This empirical work, based on a two-stage hedonic approach, defines and implements a research methodology and design to evaluate the monetary value of the excessive burden on existing public utilities generated by urban residential expansion.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last two decades, there have been numerous advancements in theorising the significance of subnational territories within both the global economy and nation-states. Within the United Kingdom over the last few years, academic study has tended to concentrate on the ‘new regionalism’ and the rescaling of political processes caused by the ‘hollowing out’ of the nation-state and governmental devolution and decentralisation to the subnational level. Part of the reason for this push towards a renewed interest in regional governance and policy processes has been the autonomous institutional capacities of regions to harness regional economic development with planning processes. The new regionalism (a contentious label) has occurred throughout the United Kingdom, but has been implemented separately in each country, through the creation of Regional Development Agencies in the English regions, and new politically accountable elected forums in Wales and Scotland. In this paper, we provide one of the first attempts empirically to analyse the new institutional structures through a survey of agencies across Britain—in England, Scotland, and Wales—in order to provide a comparative assessment of evolving forms of regional governance. We illustrate a mixed reaction from public-policy stakeholders with concern over the ability of these new forums to develop a capacity to harness both economic development and planning policy processes. On a more conceptual level, the research indicates uncertainty over both the future spatial dimension of planning processes and the scale links between the new regional level and the existing national and local levels of governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we use the tension between ideals and reality as a key to comprehend the ever-changing concept of neighbourhood in architecture and planning theory. We analyze the theoretical, that is abstract, meaning of the concept of neighbourhood by using a deconstructive approach in the examination of particular texts. A shift in the sense and meaning of neighbourhood in architecture and planning theory over the years is discerned. A stratified process of transformation in the meaning attached to the neighbourhood is identified in the arguments used to construct this idea in theory and in professional practice. This process proceeds from a humanistic approach, to an instrumental and then to a phenomenological approach. The humanistic approach sees the neighbourhood as a manifestation of human activity and thus the planning of the neighbourhood as a moral requirement which is a proper response to basic human needs. The instrumental approach views the neighbourhood as a planning device, an integral building block in the development of urban structure. As such it conceives of the neighbourhood as a subsystem in a larger assemblage. The phenomenological approach emphasizes the neighbourhood as a unique urban phenomenon. Its significance is seen to stem from its conventional everyday function (residential) which involves continuity and permanence and which fixes the neighbourhood sense of place in the urban collective memory. In our paper these three approaches are related to present architectural and planning attempts to come to terms with both overall general societal developments as well as with specific demands and needs situated in the profession. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A community trial was conducted in rural Gambia in order to determine whether a community‐based intervention designed to mobilize latent demand for contraception would increase use of modern contraceptives, even in the absence of improved availability of family planning services. Analysis of trial data indicates that the demand‐mobilization intervention had a statistically significant positive effect on nonusers' adoption of modern contraception and that coterminous implementation of an intervention designed to improve access to services offered no additional benefit. The program component found to have the greatest impact was the “kabilo approach,” in which village women provide basic health and family planning counseling to other women in their extended families. These results suggest that the principal barriers to increased contraceptive use in rural Gambia are psychosocial and that these barriers can be overcome through village‐based interventions designed to provide socially appropriate counseling to potential contraceptive users.</jats:p>",

Attempts made to measure attributes of photographs of landscapes and to develop predictive models of scenic beauty have either failed to include depth or included it by subjective separation of the foreground, mid-ground, and background within the photograph. The process of measurement from photographs is also limiting because it does not provide a mechanism for readily assessing the effect on visual qualities of proposed landscape changes. The process described here requires a detailed digital model of the environment but is then able to generate variables relating to land-cover type, their depth, and patterns of depth in any view direction. Among these variables are several which are closely correlated with scenic beauty and which can together make a good predictive model. Computer systems, which include hardware implementations of three-dimensional visible surface algorithms, offer the possibility of very fast generation of scenic beauty estimates from any location. Such estimates are among the requirements for autonomous agent-based modelling of landscape behaviour. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I will report on the development of a new spatial understanding support system (SUSS) for representing community disputes. It is argued that the more traditional approach of spatial decision support systems (SDSS) has had limited success in its application to actual community conflicts. In this study I have therefore adopted an alternative approach to spatial decision support, broadly following the paradigm of soft operational research. A prototype system termed CRANES (coordinator for rational arguments through nested substantiation) has been developed based on this alternative approach, integrated with a GIS. CRANES is a computer-assisted communication tool that aims to structure conflicts with their geographical, strategic, and argumentative dimensions. In the case study CRANES was introduced into an actual consultation exercise on an urban regeneration scheme in London. Results show that the multidimensional representation realised by CRANES contributed to a richer understanding of other peoples' arguments. Furthermore these arguments structured by and stored in CRANES proved to be a useful public resource for future decision making. It is concluded that SUSS such as CRANES could be incorporated into a future consultation process for many real-world community conflicts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Limited research has been undertaken into the geographical structure of familism within urban areas in recent decades despite significant changes in the nature of family living arrangements. A major element in this hiatus has been the lack of a viable methodology other than the factorial ecology and grouping procedures. These permitted the development of multiple place-to-theory studies in social geography, establishing familism as one of the three basic dimensions of social space, but did not facilitate place-to-place or temporal studies. In the current data-rich environment, an alternative methodology needs to be developed for comparative studies, both temporal and spatial, where measurements of change and differences can be advanced. Without it social geographers will not be able to undertake many measurement tasks and provide spatial projections of change. In this paper we provide the basis of such a methodology, centred on the objectification of social space by utilising census data, where measurements on single-attribute and multiattribute objects are obtained. As a base study it takes the seven categories of living arrangements designated in the Australian census and derives the familism objects for Sydney. A model of five family-type objects for Sydney is developed. Four distinct types of familism objects account for 93.65% of Sydney's area. The fifth is a collection of forty-one heterogeneous objects. These and other associated measurements can subsequently be compared over time, and between places, thereby facilitating detailed place-to-place and temporal studies in social geography. </jats:p>",

Three groups of women–with severe complications, with mild complications, and with a normal delivery–were identified retrospectively in three hospitals in South Benin and interviewed at home. The concept of “near‐miss” was used to identify women with severe episodes of morbidity. The questionnaire was able to detect, with some accuracy, eclamptic fits, abnormal bleeding in the third trimester for a recall period of at least three to four years, and all episodes of bleeding independent of timing within a period of two years. Questions concerning dystocia and infections of the genital tract generated disappointing results except when information on treatment was included. Overall, better results were achieved for antepartum and acute events. Severity made a positive difference only in the case of eclampsia, with an increase in sensitivity. The implications of the results for using women's recall of obstetric complications in surveys are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We tackle the problem of planning in nondeterministic    domains, by presenting a new approach to conformant planning.    Conformant planning is the problem of finding a sequence of actions    that is guaranteed to achieve the goal despite the nondeterminism of    the domain. Our approach is based on the representation of the    planning domain as a finite state automaton. We use Symbolic Model    Checking techniques, in particular Binary Decision Diagrams, to    compactly represent and efficiently search the automaton. In this    paper we make the following contributions. First, we present a general    planning algorithm for conformant planning, which applies to fully    nondeterministic domains, with uncertainty in the initial condition    and in action effects. The algorithm is based on a breadth-first,    backward search, and returns conformant plans of minimal length, if a    solution to the planning problem exists, otherwise it terminates    concluding that the problem admits no conformant solution. Second, we    provide a symbolic representation of the search space based on Binary    Decision Diagrams (BDDs), which is the basis for search techniques    derived from symbolic model checking. The symbolic representation    makes it possible to analyze potentially large sets of states and    transitions in a single computation step, thus providing for an    efficient implementation.  Third, we present CMBP (Conformant Model    Based Planner), an efficient implementation of the data structures and    algorithm described above, directly based on BDD manipulations, which    allows for a compact representation of the search layers and an    efficient implementation of the search steps. Finally, we present an    experimental comparison of our approach with the state-of-the-art    conformant planners CGP, QBFPLAN and GPT. Our analysis includes all    the planning problems from the distribution packages of these systems,    plus other problems defined to stress a number of specific factors.    Our approach appears to be the most effective: CMBP is strictly more    expressive than QBFPLAN and CGP and, in all the problems where a    comparison is possible, CMBP outperforms its competitors, sometimes by    orders of magnitude.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past thirty years, one of the fastest growing fields of urban history has been the history of planning. In some respects, this is surprising, as urban planning had existed on an institutional basis only since the early twentieth century. In other ways, though, it was a very logical development. Planning reached its high point during the 1960s, and by the 1970s was being condemned in many quarters, being blamed, for example, for disasters like high-rise tower blocks and sacrificing old cities to crude commercial and transport developments. Historical research was necessary to understand how a movement which promised so much at the start of the century had degenerated so badly in sixty years. Criticism became so severe that, in the words of one historian, ‘many planners have certainly thought in more pessimistic moments . . . that the past may be the only thing they have to look forward to’. For whatever reason, the Planning History Group was set up in 1974 and a massive body of historical research on planning has been produced. This paper reviews four recent books on planning, two from North America and two European. They represent different aspects of planning and different time periods and will be treated in chronological order.</jats:p>",

This plan was comparable in importance to the liberalization of trade and exchange. In 1960, the Japanese economy was at the height of the Iwata Boom (1958-61). The US economy was also enjoying prosperity in 1959 and into 1960, a time that has been called the ‘threshold of the Golden Sixties’. Despite the brisk economic conditions, the Japanese political scene in 1960 was in turmoil over controversy created by the revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the quantitative planning process provides an essential base.

What makes Bellamy’s thought compelling for marketing scholars is his emphasis on the consumer, his focus on equality as the vehicle for societal transformation, and his analysis of the role consumer desire, envy, and greed play in generating strife and strain. Thus, his Utopian vision seems to have much in common with the mantra of the modern marketing machine – happiness is material, and your credit card is your ticket to the good life. However, his vision of the good life is largely at odds with the market economy’s version. This paper examines the man behind a uniquely consumer oriented socialist paradise and suggests that his writings have left an inspiring legacy that marketing academics might find insightful.</jats:p>",

What can it do today to increase that success? Should it be renamed, to take into account a shift in overall scholarly interest from language planning to language choice? Should it continue to encourage submission of manuscripts in languages other than English? Should the content of the journal change to match changing times? Should the journal be linked with other means of communication, e.g. a website for updates and reader comments?

It seems to slander some more than others to label all three as pimps. And despite the phenomenon of serial addictions, the religious zealots, impoverished wretches, and compulsive consumers of the world seem to form mutually exclusive, if not mutually hostile, groups. Nevertheless, missionaries, international monetary funds, and other marketers all strive to incite passionate longing toward something far better, for which those seduced must pay a price. All three seek to fan the fires of fanaticism with promises of a future paradise, immediate or distant. And all three threaten hellish punishments for those who reject these promises. There are, I contend, more similarities than differences among the conversion tactics and promises of these three panderers to human fears and longings. By examining the overlapping manner in which each purveys promises of paradise, we may better understand the tap roots of human emotion that each seeks to incite.</jats:p>",

It analyses the link between ideas about Igbo language and the rise of Igbo ethnic identity in twentieth-century Nigeria. It focuses, first, on how language was introduced as an important marker for ethnic identity, and, second, on how the notion of the existence of an ‘Igbo language’ was successfully employed in debates by Igbo ethnic nationalists and others. Early efforts to standardize the Igbo language were initiated by missionaries and the colonial government, who had also decided upon the boundaries of the Igbo language and the Igbo ethnic group. Most Igbo people preferred literacy in English and were not interested in these efforts. This situation changed after 1940, when the growing influence of the Nigerian anti-colonial movement began to make an impact on the perception of the Igbo language. This does not mean that Igbo became more widely used as a written language. Nearly all articles and pamphlets on the Igbo language and its role continued to be written in English. Also, all attempts to standardize Igbo failed. Thus, the notion of the existence of one shared Igbo language was important and not the existence of a vernacular readership in that language.</jats:p>",

La planificación económica y, en general, toda forma de política social redistribuitiva o compensadora de las desigualdades sociales es considerada arbitraria, inefectiva y restrictiva de la libertad.

Using a sample of 72 acute care hospitals the research explored the perceived functions, typical customers and priorities of hospital human resource departments, ownership of a workforce plan, and the relationships between ownership of a workforce plan and type of hospital, as well as the degree to which different human resource activities are given priority. Cross‐tabulation procedure revealed statistically significant relationships between ownership of a workforce plan and the degree of priority given to having a quick, efficient and cost‐effective recruitment and selection system and, not surprisingly, the degree of priority given to ensuring that the human resource department has a workforce plan. The study evidence also indicates that, although the human resource staff in hospitals seem to be aware of their role in assisting hospital management in decision making, the human resource function in the Slovak hospitals still rather resembles that of a personnel administration than that of an important strategic human resource activity.</jats:p>",

Bourdieu’s publication <jats:italic>Language and Symbolic Power</jats:italic> (1992) helps explain this unwillingness: an official language can be considered as “linguistic capital” which affords its holders “symbolic power”. On the other hand, when new countries join the European Union it is not inconceivable that, for reasons of a utilitarian and financial-economic nature, there will be a shift in favour of the exclusively institutional use of English in the long term. Bourdieu’s analysis of the mechanisms which underlie the process of linguistic unification during the construction of the French nation state in the nineteenth century answers the question whether the mechanisms which led to the use of French as common language for France also apply to the language choice in the EU.</jats:p>",

Machiavelli reflects the enquiring mind, enlightenment and is perceived as the true advocate of the realities of the discipline and the search for power. Monet provides the creative guiding light and insight into the perceived image. Contemporary marketing concepts are also added to the thoughts of the mediators. Marketing needs to regenerate itself and not fear change or ambiguity in its quest to seek the truth.

It is now usually as fast to obtain “copiable” items from foreign countries as from one’s own, even when they have to be supplied by paper copies; and more and more items are accessible on the Internet. For books, the time taken to supply and the cost still vary considerably between domestic and other sources; there is no easy solution unless and until large amounts of material are digitised, and then remote supply and remote consultation begin to merge.

The stigmatization of Khoekhoegowap in Namibia shows how negative images of minority languages are generated by external forces, but also how these forces may also be reinforced by corresponding internal forces. The case of Khoekhoegowap is examined on three levels: (1) the external level (how political doctrine may influence the observations of language planners), (2) the theoretical level (how language stigmatization and similar problems result from a wide variety of factors), and (3) the empirical level (how members of a speech community can intentionally create negative stereotypes of another language to destabilize the development of that language and reduce the status of its speakers in society, and how this, in turn, can become internalized and lead to language decline).</jats:p>",

Like his Viennese contemporary Adolf Loos, Frank developed his own individual spatial planning strategy, which was based on differentiated room levels and heights, open circulation spaces and galleries, and open stairwells, terraces, and landings. This article examines the genesis and development of Frank's concept of \"The House as Path and Place\" and its expression in the Villa Beer, comparing Frank's approach with Loos's notion of the Raumplan and Le Corbusier's plan libre. By carefully establishing the linkages between the interlocking volumes in the house, Frank was able to produce a dynamic version of the Raumplan, one that fostered a powerful and affective experience of space.</jats:p>",

The maintenance schedule must be planned so as to minimize outage costs, taking into consideration various factors such as system security/reliability, system availability, and manpower utilization. With the rapid growth of organization, planning engineers are required to fulfill additional roles in order to increase productivity. To this end, a fast response and accurate mechanism is required to assist the planning engineers in dealing with the daily operation. This paper describes how a proposed maintenance schedule can be obtained automatically by the adoption of genetic algorithm. The main aim is to determine the maintenance schedule of circuit outage with minimizing the maintenance cost and maximizing the circuit availability under certain unavoidable system constraints. Further, an additional search mechanism called “final tuning search” is developed to enhance the system performance.</jats:p>",

Foremost among the concepts to be updated is gender identity. In a postmodern society, traditional notions of femininity and masculinity come across as antiquated and illusory. The consumption ethic has deconstructed the historical male‐female mind‐body producer‐consumer dichotomy and made identity construction a consuming pastime. It has also turned gender into a pastiche of possibilities. Yet in the utopian cyber future that awaits us, what will become of gender identity? In the ethereality of the Internet, where existence is ephemeral, is gender identity a meaningful and necessary concept? This paper reviews the historical (modern) significance of gender identity to marketing, explores the postmodern consumer condition, and prophesies a paradisal vision of gender identity in the consumer society to come.</jats:p>",

He notes how people reaching this point often “turn in on themselves, and perhaps turn towards religion”. It is with this “metanoid” perspective on marketing theory that the authors of this piece present two possible paths to epistemological paradise; one route representing an inward re‐evaluation and the other more of an outward exploration. Two of the authors combine to take an axiomatic approach to rediscovering the celestial citadel, whereas the third has forsaken the fundamentalist fortress. In his, the second, sermon Brother Nick implores you to reject the foregoing calls to get back to basics, and instead, to embrace a more contemporary, critical orientation to “dat ole time marketing religion”.</jats:p>",

I apply aspects of the post-Keynesian investment theory developed by Hyman Minsky to understand the causes of hyperextended building cycles, with particular attention paid to the 1980s boom. Periods of rampant overbuilding are found to be rooted in the distressed conditions of the commercial banking sector, which drove the banks to annex the commercial property markets as outlets for surplus credit capacity and to offset declining rates of profit. I explore how the existence of commercial property at the intersection of markets for space and markets for capital assets introduces distortions into the capital supply process and exacerbates tendencies towards overproduction and crisis. Conditions prevailing in the 1980s are contrasted to the current economic expansion, and the performance of the commercial property markets through 1999 is analyzed, to distinguish further the key control functions exercised by the commercial banks over market outcomes. </jats:p>",

In the patient's prescription, the user can specify both the maximum number of shots of radiation and a minimum isodose line that must surround the entire treatment volume. After satisfying all of the constraints included in the prescription, the system maximizes the conformity of the dose distribution. This automated approach to treatment planning has been applied retrospectively to a series of patient cases, and each optimized plan has been compared to the corresponding manual plan produced by an experienced user. The results demonstrate that this tool can often improve the tumor dose homogeneity while using fewer shots than were included in the original plan. Therefore, inverse treatment planning should improve both the quality and the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatments.</jats:p>",

The result may be viewed as a form of peripheral industrialization of small plants specializing in less-advanced industrial production. The peripheralization process and the fact that Israeli Arab industry has remained marginal to the national economy should be understood in the context of the structural conditions in which Arab entrepreneurship is embedded. The impact of three forces is stressed: government policy, large corporations, and the internal sociocultural properties peculiar to the Arab population in Israel. </jats:p><jats:p> The resulting form of industrialization is based on restructuring processes formatted as a number of distinctive development stages, which must be understood within the wider framework of Israel's economic restructuring. The dominant form of capitalist production affected the transformation of the Israeli Arab economy at each period, from state management to corporate dominance, and currently succeeded by a new accumulation regime affected by globalization processes. Furthermore, majority–minority relations affected it with each pole embedded in its own ethnic milieu. These majority–minority relations, supported by a selective government policy, have since been superseded by the relations conducted between the Jewish-dominated core and the Israeli-Arab-subordinated periphery. The result of this process has diversely affected both economic poles, and continues to influence the form of Arab industrialization, branch selection, and rate of plant openings. Furthermore, the result is a failure by Arab entrepreneurs to penetrate the more privileged sectors of the national economy, partly because of the failure of the Israeli political and economic elite to respond to Arab efforts at expansion into the larger economy. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to examine how the movement's class-based concerns are articulated through discourses of local sovereignty and patriotism. Because patriots' class interests are articulated through the patriot category rather than through traditional class categories, I use identity theory to analyze the movement. The movement, with its legacy of violence and its calls for local control, illustrates that the submersion of class (as a category that crosses scale) can lead to militant and particularistic responses. The couching of local power within discourses of patriotism demonstrates that such politics continue to rely on larger scales for legitimization. Reference to patriotism is, however, mostly symbolic. As such patriots ironically are unable to conceive of class positioning or their responses to it as cross local. As a case study I examine the movement in central Kentucky, and an issue around which patriots there have galvanized—calls to legalize industrial hemp. The paper concludes by arguing that the Patriot Movement illustrates the need to actively create progressive discourses to address working-class concerns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We deploy aspects of Foucault's concept of governmentality to discuss the argument that the recent shift towards a ‘rights and responsibilities' agenda in urban policy is part of broader transformations in the rationalities and techniques of government. Following Rose, we characterise the emergent forms of urban policy as part of ‘advanced liberalism’ or strategies which seek to activate citizens, individually and collectively, to take greater responsibility for their own government. Such strategies are, as Rose notes, seeking to govern through the instrumentalisation of the self-governing properties of the subjects of government themselves in a whole variety of locales. We develop the argument in three parts. The first part justifies the use of a Foucauldian framework in seeking to understand the new political and policy agenda on ‘rights and responsibilities’. In a second part, we investigate the changing nature of governmental rationalities and techniques of governmentality primarily through the context of the Single Regeneration Budget. In so doing, we consider two interrelated dimensions of the rationalities and techniques of government which seek to shape and guide what Foucault refers to as ‘the conduct of others' or those that are the objects of government, that is, active citizens. These dimensions are government through community and the specification of subjects of government. We conclude by specifying the importance we attach to using a Foucauldian framework for the analysis of urban policy and policy processes more generally. </jats:p>",

Operations at Titan were based on the philosophy that performing a shallow hazards assessment, preparing and implementing SWF contingency plans, drilling a 9|-?. pilot hole (for dynamic kill), identifying a SWF zone quickly, controlling a water-flow zone with weighted mud (while drilling riserless), and using nitrified foam cement to seal off a water flow behind 20-in. conductor pipe, were all critical in successfully containing and drilling through a SWF occurrence.</jats:p>",

Health care is labour intensive. Staffing costs are often a major focus of the health sector. There is a tendency for staffing to be regarded as part of the ‘problem’ of cost containment, and staffing costs are often a major focus of health sector reform. This report argues that it is more appropriate to regard staffing in general, and nurses in particular, as part of the solution to improving quality, access and cost of care. The major elements in nurse workforce planning are discussed, and the need for planning to be integrated with service delivery is emphasized. With projected increases in the demand for healthcare, and concern about staff shortages, policy attention across Europe and in other countries must focus on improving the methods of recruiting, retaining and utilizing nursing resources. A policy‐based framework for sustained improvement is presented, based on five areas of action: improve ‘conventional’ recruitment; improve recruitment from ‘non‐conventional’ sources; identify and apply incentives to improve staff retention and motivation; improve staff deployment; and improve utilization/skill mix.</jats:p>",

A starting-point for McKinnon’s study was the observation that the texts of the communions for ferial days in Lent are derived from Psalms 1-26 in numerical order. Not only this section of the liturgy, but the communions of the whole of the Temporale are constructed on similar schematic principles. Other components of the Mass Proper behave in a comparable fashion, especially during the periods of Advent and Christmas. The scholarly significance of an investigation of this phenomenon lies in the fact that it might provide indications about chronological layers in the development of a group of chants.</jats:p>",

The author examines how a policy-network approach can contribute to the analysis of domestic climate change responses. Consideration is given to the role of advocacy coalitions and discourse coalitions within policy networks. It is argued that the discourse-coalition approach offers a useful explanation of the processes of coalition formation, interaction, and policy learning. Although it cannot alone explain the outcomes of the policy process, its emphasis on the dynamics of meaning, legitimacy, and knowledge as an essential part of policymaking can usefully be incorporated into an analysis of policy networks. </jats:p>",

Fifteen planning conferences since 1957 are reviewed to show the changing perspectives on planning from the professional community. Ten areas are identified that will provide special challenge to future transport planners—demographic changes, the importance of economic production and market forces for transport system performance, multimodal perspectives for transport planning, adopting an operations focus, an important role for technology, developing a sense of community, laying the groundwork for pricing, integrating transport decision making with growth management, transport planning within a sustainability framework, and providing greater accountability of the decision making and planning processes.</jats:p>",

Though recognising that specific cases have to be understood in their own terms, this article offers a framework for incorporating political analysis in policy design. It is based on a programme of research on a number of countries in Africa and Asia over the last four years. It argues that the starting‐point should be an analysis of crises of authority within contemporary nation‐states which convert conflict (a feature of all political systems) into violent conflict; of how such conflict may in turn generate more problems for, or even destroy, the state; of the deep‐rooted political, institutional and developmental legacies of political violence; and of the difficulties that complicate the restoration of legitimate and effective systems of governance after the ‘termination’ of conflict. It then lists a series of questions which such an analysis would need to ask — less in order to provide a comprehensive check‐list than to uncover underlying political processes and links. It is hoped these may be used not only to understand the political dynamics of emergencies, but also to identify what kinds of policy action should and should not be given priority by practitioners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within a growing and varied body of work exploring homeless people's own understandings and experiences of homelessness, increased attention has begun to focus upon the varying understandings of ‘home’ held by those who are currently ‘home-less’. Most such work has been concerned with an examination of people's experiences of ‘home as residence’, with far less attention paid to homeless people's understandings of what might be termed ‘home as place’. Given the extent to which homelessness continues to be constructed as an experience intimately if not inevitably associated with the experience of movement, such an omission is surprising. As homeless people move within, between, and through places—sometimes by necessity, sometimes by ‘choice’—such movements are liable to have a significant impact upon a person's sense of home as well as upon his or her experience of homelessness. The author examines understandings of home as place articulated by single homeless men living in night shelter and hostel accommodation in a large town on the south coast of England. Drawing upon a reconstructive life-history approach, the author sets the understandings of each respondent within the context of the mobility which has characterised that respondent's homeless career. In attempting to make sense of respondents’ experiences, four contrasting narratives of home as place are outlined, relating to the experiences of the ‘(dis)placed’, the ‘homesick’, those whose lives now move around a ‘spectral geography’, and of the ‘new nomads’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The state possesses the relatively autonomous power to give concessions to the lower classes, the poor. But the extent to which the poor will actually benefit from the policies designed to help them is influenced by three factors. First, it depends on the level of the material support for the policy through which the concessions are sought to be given. This level of material support is, in turn, influenced by the state's financial dependence on the private economy and by competing demands from different classes and groups on the state's resources. Second, the extent to which the poor will benefit from the antipoverty intervention also depends on the balance of power between state actors and the poor ‘on the ground’, that is, at the local scale of state – society interaction where the policies are implemented. There are two aspects to this balance of power. On the one hand, state actors have some relative autonomy which they use to bend the rules of the state, often in alliance with ‘dominant’ actors in the civil society, in order to pocket a part of the legitimate share belonging to the poor (bribes). On the other hand, these actions of state actors are also subject to the struggle of the poor. Finally, the economic structure within which both the state and its poor clients work also affects the ways in which the antipoverty policies operate. In this paper I argue that these three factors produce constant interactions between state and society. The state is to be seen as both a process and a relationship. To illustrate this argument, I make use of primary and secondary information on the implementation of a major poverty-alleviation programme in India. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we discuss the apparent failure to couple together the constructs of ‘rurality’ and ‘homelessness’, and propose a critical deconstruction of this noncoupling. Three principal lines of arguments are employed. First, there are a range of physical and material reasons why rural and urban spaces have varying qualities for hiding or revealing homeless people, and why the embodied experiences of homelessness have varying geographies. Second, there are a series of obstacles that exist within the practices, thoughts, and discourses of rural dwellers themselves, which lead them to deny that homelessness exists in their place. Third, normalised conceptualisations about rurality and homelessness often serve to separate the two concepts, and contribute to the assumption that homelessness is an urban phenomenon, which is rendered invisible in rural space. In short, homelessness may be conceptualised as being ‘out-of-place’ in the purified spaces of rurality, and the imaginary geographies of rurality and homelessness become transformed into everyday practices and actions relating to what people actually do in and about rural places. This critical deconstruction will be important for any attempts to recouple homelessness and rurality in the understandings and actions of policymakers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The enterprise resource planning (ERP) software market has been growing at a very fast pace over the last few years and has been predicted to keep growing rapidly in the long term. This has led to an abundance of media reports on the subject of ERP and to managers wondering whether their companies should implement ERP systems. In order to separate the reality of the ERP phenomenon from the hype that surrounds it, we studied 14 ERP implementation projects in Irish organizations and focused on the key relationships between organizations which attempt to implement ERP systems and their implementing partners. We found that the ERP implementations that are going on in Ireland at the moment are different to the projects that have been reported elsewhere in two key respects. Firstly, the organizations interested in ERP software are, on average, far smaller than the case studies reported in the literature and the majority of the cases we reviewed were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Secondly, the durations of implementation were far shorter than reported elsewhere. These results are not surprising if one considers the smaller average size of Irish organizations, but they indicate that the ERP movement is truly ready for an extension towards the SME market. They also indicate that the duration of the implementation of ERP software may be related to the size and complexity of the client organization and that SMEs can expect to have an easier time implementing ERPs than the current literature suggests. We also found that software implementers play a key role, not only in technical terms, but also in managerial and political terms, because they can help their clients in correcting their expectations and perceptions of ERP systems and ERP implementations. </jats:p>",

As expected, the relative value of fixed production costs to transportation costs is crucial in the determination of facility locations. Less expected is the fairly strong instability observed in the structure of the locational pattern of facilities when the relative value of the fixed costs changes. The construction of a piece of infrastructure has an impact on the regional structure of production provided that it allows for a substantial reduction in transport spending. When scale economies in production are large, one regional center swallows up the other and may eventually become the only production center within the integrated economy. </jats:p>",

The authors consider two typical models of networks that target an industry, one programme calling for participation from all relevant sectors in the industry and the other focusing on a particular firm and its suppliers. Two network programmes in Wales are closely examined. The authors suggest that compared with the other model the ‘supply-chain model’ is a more reliable option for peripheral regions in producing tangible benefits to a wider population of its members in the relatively short </jats:p>",

Through shared goals, such involvement enriches the planning, implementation, operation and management process. Various strategies of involving the public in the planning process have been tried in the past thirty years, but the overall effort has been lumpy and at times disappointing. In the last few years some forms of communicative action have been applied, following its appearance in current literature, but we still have a long way to go. This paper has four main objectives. First, it surveys the citizen involvement effort as it is practiced today and the problems it faces. Second, it describes teleogenic systems that are particularly suited for tackling conflictual problems. Thirdly, it presents the interplay of virtuous and vicious cycles in reinforcing or retarding collective decision making. And lastly, the process of harvesting the potential of citizen groups in collective decision‐making through critical systems thinking is described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> ERP (enterprise resource planning) packages provide generic off-the-shelf business and software solutions for customers. However, these packages are implemented in companies with different corporate and national cultures and there is growing evidence that failure to adapt ERP packages to fit these cultures leads to projects which are expensive and overdue. This paper describes research which synthesizes social science theories of culture in order to be able to model and predict the impact of culture on ERP package implementation. It describes a knowledge meta-schema for modelling the surface and deeper manifestations of culture and predictions of ERP implementation problems based on national culture differences. It reports on an empirical study into the implementation of ERP packages in a large pharmaceuticals organization in Scandinavia and the UK. The results provide evidence for an association between corporate culture and ERP implementation problems but no direct evidence for an association between national culture and implementation problems. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that these diverse implementation problems can be caused by a mismatch between a small set of core values which are indicative of a customer's corporate culture. The paper concludes with revisions to the design of our extended method for ERP package implementation to the design of the meta-model and to rules that codify culture constraints that are applied in order to analyse instances of the meta-model. </jats:p>",

We analysed and compared these two types of information from available literature sources in an attempt to identify all bird species critically dependent on tropical deciduous forests of western Mexico and Central America. Based on patterns of biogeographical restriction, we identified 42 endemics, 33 disjunct endemics, 59 corridor species and 3 seasonal endemics associated with tropical deciduous forest (TDF) in this region. Based on patterns of habitat use in these species, we classified them as 50 tropical deciduous forest-restricted species and 82 apparent habitat generalist species. No habitat use information was available within the TDF belt for five of the biogeographically restricted species. We found a high proportion of apparent habitat generalists (60%) among biogeographically restricted species. We discuss three specific scenarios in which species critically dependent on TDF may nonetheless appear generalized in their patterns of habitat use. These species are termed “cryptic habitat specialists.” The proportion of apparent habitat generalists is highly variable among biogeographical regions and habitat types. Thus, global biodiversity conservation prioritizations that rely on habitat restriction as an indicator of ecological sensitivity may underestimate conservation needs within bioregions that contain high proportions of cryptic habitat specialists.</jats:p>",

A theory of entrepreneurship, drawing on human capital theory, skills–opportunity theory, and internal labor-market theory, links declines in firm market share to a disequilibrium in labor-market matches. That imbalance leads to the breakdown of control and the consequent generation of spin-offs.

In an attempt to determine the dose from both diagnostic and orthovoltage x rays, we have used a commercial treatment planning system (Pinnacle, ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, CA) to calculate the doses in phantoms from kilovoltage x rays. The planning system's capabilities for dose computation have been extended to lower energies by the addition of energy deposition kernels in the 20–110 keV range and modeling of the 60, 80, 100, and 120 kVp beams using the system. We compared the dose calculated by the system with that measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) placed in various positions within several phantoms. The phantoms consisted of a cubical solid water phantom, the solid water phantom with added lung and bone inhomogeneities, and the Rando anthropomorphic phantom. Using Pinnacle, a treatment plan was generated using CT scans of each of these phantoms and point doses at the positions of TLD chips were calculated. Comparisons of measured and computed values show an average difference of less than 2% within materials of atomic number less than and equal to that of water. The algorithm, however, does not produce accurate results in and around bone inhomogeneities and underestimates attenuation of x rays by bone by an average of 145%. A modification to the CT number‐to‐density conversion table used by the system resulted in significant improvements in the dose calculated to points beyond bone.</jats:p>",

Through examining past planning decisions on urban office development applications between 1988 and 1997, this paper explores whether this 'hybrid' system provides both certainty for development capital and flexibility in administrative control. Our study concludes that the Hong Kong system offers considerable certainty, although the decision-making criteria of the development controllers tend to deviate from the planning policy applicable to our application cases. Technical merits of the development schemes are found to be necessary, but not sufficient conditions in securing planning permissions. The rejection reasons given by the planning authority apparently disguise their real concerns. Market forces also affect planning control decisions. </jats:p>",

Both designers and older people approach this matter by way of commonsense usages of home as a physical location and as a location in space. The differences between these individuals are explicated in terms of Schutz's notion of anonymous typifications. It is shown that architectural design briefs involve making predictions about the future lives of residents of sheltered housing. This results in a range of anonymous typifications informing architects' views on space utilisation. By contrast, when older people talk about their future lives in sheltered housing and space utilisation they rely upon features of their individual biographies: matters from which architects are inevitably excluded. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on a large transnational research project that involved questionnaires with 1000 farm households in nine EU countries and Switzerland, this paper investigates factors influencing farmers' participation in agri-environmental schemes (AESs). Analysis of motivations for AES participation highlights that complex patterns of AESs are in operation. Pronounced geographical differences in farmers' reactions towards schemes can be identified, with responses by farmers from northern member states often differing from those in Mediterranean countries, and with arable farmers often responding differently from grassland farmers. Yet, the study also highlights that much common ground exists and that conceptual frameworks for the understanding of farmers' participation in AESs developed in the United Kingdom can be successfully applied outside the British context. Common participation patterns include the importance of financial imperatives and ‘goodness of fit’, and the influence of similar sets of factors such as farm size, tenure, or farm type. The growing importance of conservation-oriented motivations for AES participation across Europe suggests the emergence of a ‘new hypothesis’ which highlights that the financial imperative for participation does not necessarily exclude an often equally important environmental concern. The paper concludes by indicating where current agri-environmental policy (AEP) may be failing adequately to address structural and socioeconomic characteristics of targeted farming populations, and by arguing that understanding participation decisionmaking is only the first step in an attempt to assess the ‘effectiveness’ of AEP. Further comparative research is needed to investigate in detail more complex indicators of scheme success, in particular what effects scheme participation has on farmers' incomes, farmers' environmental attitudes, and on the environmental quality of the countryside targeted by AESs. </jats:p>",

It was the story of a fellow named “Fritz Kobus” who was living in Alsace. He could be seen as the stereotype of how the “collective unconscious” in France was imagining a prosperous Alsatian fellow. In a very short period of time this fiction became a significant link between the Alsace region and the whole French nation. We will use this example in order to show that the links with consumption and art are very peculiar. It is not only companies that are interested in the appropriation of art, but also consumers. This will help us to show that for example in postmodern times the distinction between high and low culture is not as clear as it may first appear. High and low culture are blending together in interesting ways. What we would like to show here, is that the novel sometimes gives a landmark to the consumers, telling them what their ideal aspirations should be and then the society tries to reflect the novel.</jats:p>",

Via intersectoral and interregional relations, this affects the entire production structure. In analysing the structural changes in an economy, changes in the input coefficients are a major determinant. Typically, however, this determinant is not unravelled further into its underlying sources. In the present paper we apply the RAS method to decompose the input coefficient changes into column-specific, row-specific, and cell-specific changes. They indicate the change in the intermediate input intensity of a sector, the average substitution of the intermediate goods and services provided by a sector, and the sector-specific substitutions, respectively. The method is applied to input–output tables of European Union member states, as issued every five years between 1965 and 1985. The usefulness of the RAS method as a descriptive tool is established. </jats:p>",

This article reviews the history of unmet need and the development of increasingly refined methods of its empirical measurement and delineates the main questions that have been raised about unmet need during the past decade, some of which concern the validity of the concept and others its role in policy debates. The discussion draws heavily on empirical research conducted during the 1990s, much of it localized, in‐depth studies combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Of the causes of unmet need other than those related to access to services, three emerge as especially salient: lack of necessary knowledge about contraceptive methods, social opposition to their use, and health concerns about possible side effects. The article argues that the concept of unmet need for family planning, by joining together contraceptive behavior and fertility preferences, encourages an integration of family planning programs and broader development approaches to population policy. By focusing on the fulfillment of individual aspirations, unmet need remains a defensible rationale for the formulation of population policy and a sensible guide to the design of family planning programs.</jats:p>",

Israeli electronics has its origins in locally initiated R&amp;D, is dominated by indigenously owned firms, and has its main export-market strengths in the research-intensive leading-edge markets for telecommunications and medical diagnostic equipment. In contrast, large-scale, US-owned plants producing computer equipment and components dominate the Irish electronics sector. The authors explore the factors that have contributed to these very different development paths. Social and political factors are examined, along with differences in technology and industrial policy, and the availability and cost of suitably skilled labour. The suggestion is that Ireland retains some cost advantages for large-scale manufacturing operations whereas Israel provides a more attractive location for research-intensive activities or niche manufacturing. The experience of the two nations suggests important policy lessons for Israel if it is to capture more of the value added generated by the products it develops and for Ireland if it is to move towards more research-intensive electronics activities. </jats:p>",

We investigated whether this separation of extent and direction planning for well practiced movements could be explained by differences in the adaptation to extent and directional errors during motor learning. We compared the time course and generalization of adaptation with two types of screen cursor transformation that altered the relationship between hand space and screen space. The first was a gain change that induced extent errors and required subjects to learn a new scaling factor. The second was a screen cursor rotation that induced directional errors and required subjects to learn new reference axes. Subjects learned a new scaling factor at the same rate when training with one or multiple target distances, whereas learning new reference axes took longer and was less complete when training with multiple compared with one target direction. After training to a single target, subjects were able to transfer learning of a new scaling factor to previously unvisited distances and directions. In contrast, generalization of rotation adaptation was incomplete; there was transfer across distances and arm configurations but not across directions. Learning a rotated reference frame only occurred after multiple target directions were sampled during training. These results suggest the separate processing of extent and directional errors by the brain and support the idea that reaching movements are planned as a hand-centered vector whose extent and direction are established via learning a scaling factor and reference axes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the results of new road construction is often a reduction in the price of nearby properties. In the United Kingdom property owners can be compensated for this loss through the Land Compensation Act. The appropriate level of compensation is currently determined by valuers and is mainly based upon their expertise and skill. This study aims to determine what the correct level of compensation should be. It has been specifically designed to fulfil the requirements of current legislation and can be integrated into existing compensation procedures. This was achieved through a hedonic pricing study that relates current property prices to a wide range of factors. These variables include the structure, neighbourhood, accessibility, and environment of the property, in addition to the impact of nearby roads. These were all created through GIS and large-scale digital data. The study, which is based on over 3500 property sales in Glasgow, Scotland, suggests that property prices were depressed by 0.202% for each decibel increase in road noise. This result has enabled a more streamlined compensation procedure to be developed and demonstrates that compensation claims can be estimated at the road-development stage. This would allow any compensation claims to be assessed prior to road construction and inform the design of noise-reduction measures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies motion planning from one zero-velocity state to another for a three-joint robot in a horizontal plane with a passive revolute third joint. Such a robot is small-time locally controllable on an open subset of its zero-velocity section, allowing it to follow any path in this subset arbitrarily closely. However, some paths are “preferred” by the dynamics of the manipulator in that they can be followed at higher speeds. In this paper, the authors describe a computationally efficient trajectory planner that finds fast, collision-free trajectories among obstacles. The planner decouples the problem of planning feasible trajectories in the robot’s six-dimensional state space into the computationally simpler problems of planning paths in the three-dimensional configuration space and time scaling the paths according to the manipulator dynamics. This decoupling is made possible by the existence of velocity directions, fixed in the passive link frame, which can be executed at arbitrary speeds. Results of the planner have been implemented on an experimental underactuated manipulator. To the authors’ knowledge, it is the first implementation of a collision-free motion-planning algorithm for a manipulator subject to a second-order nonholonomic constraint. </jats:p>",

This was done as part of a larger research programme into the determinants of cognitive ageing (the Maastricht Aging Study: MAAS). Possible withdrawal effects that may have explained in part the positive association between performance and intake in an earlier study were controlled for. In addition, all cognitive tests in this study were administered under strict laboratory conditions. A group of 1875 healthy adults, stratified for age (range 24 – 81 years), sex, and general ability, were screened for habitual intake of coffee and tea and took part in extensive cognitive testing. Multiple regression analysis with control for age, sex, socio‐demographic variables, and substance use showed that habitual caffeine consumption was significantly related to better long‐term memory performance and faster locomotor speed. No relationships were found between habitual caffeine consumption and short‐term memory, information processing, planning, and attention as measured with the Stroop Test. Moreover, no difference in sensitivity to caffeine intake between different age groups was found, suggesting that caffeine intake did not counteract age‐related cognitive decline. Several recommendations are made to improve the design of future studies in this field. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",
