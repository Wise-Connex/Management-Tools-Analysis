Although a copious letter‐writer, Beckford's letters have not received much critical attention. The article attempts a close reading of some features of Beckfordian letter‐writing—a preliminary investigation into its style, rhetorical complexities and consistent merging of narrator and narratee. Studying separate letters as a whole (as one text), the article tries to make visible those literary strategies that make Beckford's epistolary prose—even at its most private and personal—a subject worth historical as well as theoretical scrutiny.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>India is an agricultural country and the majority of India’s population live in rural areas. This is so in Karnataka, a state in southern India. The present report consists of a detailed nutrition situation analysis. Karnataka has a population of 45 million, which is approximately 3–5% of India’s population. One in every two women are agricultural labourers, reflecting women’s predominance in the field of agriculture. The state has a literacy rate of 56%. The food consumption patterns reveal that cereals and millets are the main food items. However, protective foods (i.e. foods that are rich in proteins, vitamins and minerals) are consumed in lesser amounts. When compared with the average Indian recommended dietary intake (RDI), the intake of energy in adults was found to be higher, as was protein. The average intake of vitamins, however, was 50% less than the RDI. Unlike adults, energy deficiency is a problem in the diets of preschool children. Growth retardation has been observed in a vast majority of children in Karnataka. An improvement in the nutritional status of rural adults has been observed in recent years. Protein energy malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency and B‐complex deficiencies are the major nutritional deficiencies among preschool children, while anaemia remains a major health problem in women. Improvement in the healthcare system has brought a decline in the infant mortality rate in Karnataka and the state attained universal immunization coverage in 1990. The National Nutrition Programme – Integrated Child Development Scheme provides an integrated package of services to residents of Karnataka.</jats:p>",

We analyze the activation of B in implanted Si on the basis of detailed interactions between B and defects in Si. In the model, the nucleation of B clusters requires a high interstitial supersaturation, which occurs in the damaged region during implantation and at the early stages of the postimplant anneal. B clusters grow by adding interstitial B to preexisting B clusters, resulting in B complexes with a high interstitial content. As the annealing proceeds and the Si interstitial supersaturation decreases, the B clusters emit Si interstitials, leaving small stable B complexes with low interstitial content. The total dissolution of B clusters involves thermally generated Si interstitials, and it is only achieved at very high temperatures or long anneal times.</jats:p>",
