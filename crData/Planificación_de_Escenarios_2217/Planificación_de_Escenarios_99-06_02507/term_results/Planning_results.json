      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we analyze recent rural strategy initiatives in England in an attempt to explore the relationship between planning policy and the provision of outdoor recreation. Notwithstanding a wider rhetoric of accessibility to the countryside, much recreational planning activity has been based on the discriminatory notion of acceptable leisure activities. Acceptability in this case is associated with a land use planning system in which land itself assumes a form of naturalness, in contrast to its uses, which are seen to be socially constructed. This dualism is based not on any definition of demand, need, or public interest, but on a continuing spatial determinism in which rights of land ownership are constructed as both socially and morally superior to other rights. This continues to legitimize a rationalized form of protection through the statutory planning system. </jats:p>",

After examining the underlying theoretical context in social practice, I demonstrate that the re-emergence of a different form of rationality creates the conditions for incorporating new forms of urban models. Finally, I highlight the developments in group decision support systems research and suggest how these systems, together with a geographic information systems component, can be designed for critical planning practice. </jats:p>",

Using four specific cases, I show how local landscape change is connected to the broader forces of urban restructuring. In addition, I discuss important differences between the city-building process in a central core and a suburban process within this structural context. The local deviations from the structural context are explained vis-à-vis the Phoenix regional economy, conservative political culture, and relative youth on the American urban frontier. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most academic planning programs offer planning methods through traditional threecredit courses in their core planning curricula, a format that our students, faculty, and alumni have questioned. The methods courses tend to get overloaded through incremental additions of material over time. Semester-long courses do not offer flexibility to students who need more in-depth coverage of some techniques. In addition, the match between faculty expertise in methods and the required methods offering is not ideal. The search for an alternative format of offering planning methods has led to the use of five-week, onecredit modules as a part of the core requirements. With the modules, the methods curriculum is now more diverse, more rigorous, and more practical than it was before. A survey of U.S. graduate planning programs suggests that the module approach to teaching planning methods is appropriate and effective for many particular methods. This discussion is intended to provide background and experience with methods modules. </jats:p>",

However, few prior studies have quantified the magnitude of this facilitating or enabling effect of family planning services, given existing demand for contraception. This study takes advantage of panel survey data and linked information on the supply environment for family planning services in Morocco in order to bridge this research gap. In the analysis, contraceptive use during the 1992–95 period is related to contraceptive intentions in 1992; individual‐, household‐, and community‐level determinants of contraceptive behavior; and family planning supply factors. Estimation procedures are used that control for unobserved joint determinants of contraceptive intentions and use. Evidence of a significant enabling or facilitating role of family planning services is found, and the results also suggest that family planning program factors influence contraceptive intentions in important ways.</jats:p>",

The focus of this article is on the dynamics of such a doctrine. Drawing on Thomas Kuhn, doctrine implies a phase model, from a pre-doctrinal to a doctrinal situation and on to one where revolution threatens. Four pre-doctrinal situations are discussed: the Flemish Structure Plan, the Second Outline Structural Plan for the Benelux, European Union planning, and Florida's state growth management. Conceiving of them as pre-doctrinal focuses on how, in the fullness of time, they may evolve. However, what about situations where, like in the Netherlands, doctrine is mature? In those situations, a ‘Laudanian Model’ of evolutionary change (after Larry Laudan, a critic of Kuhn) opens up new perspectives. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a survey of in-lieu programs in 46 cities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Germany, and Iceland. These in-lieu programs reduce the cost of development, encourage shared parking, improve urban design, and support historic preservation. The in-lieu fees also reveal that the cost of complying with minimum parking requirements is more than four times the cost of the impact fees that cities levy for all other public purposes combined. The high cost of required parking suggests another promising in-lieu policy: allow developers to reduce parking demand rather than increase the parking supply. Examination of an Eco Pass program in California shows that reducing parking demand can cost far less than increasing the parking supply. </jats:p>",

While planners have taught children about planning, relatively little academic research has been conducted on what children can teach the discipline about planning. This paper summarizes the results of a survey of the planning preferences of 248 children in kindergarten through second grade. The content analysis revealed a preference for land use variety and for places associated with activity and social interaction. Children tended to favor diversity and accessibility, as opposed to homogeneity and privacy. Further, the children's plans were different in terms of age and particularly in terms of gender. Children were able to conceptualize neighborhood even at the kindergarten level, and many of their conceptualizations were not dissimilar from the traditional view of neighborhood espoused by planners. </jats:p>",

Sibling history data collected in the course of this survey are analyzed together with longitudinal data from the Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System (NDSS). A comparison between mortality data from these two sources indicates that obtaining reasonably accurate estimates of age‐specific death rates is possible by using the sisterhood method.

The study is based on in‐depth interviews and focus‐group discussions with adolescents, parents, chiefs, traditional leaders, youth leaders, and health workers, supplemented by quantitative data from the 1996 wave of a panel survey of women of reproductive age conducted by the Navrongo Health Research Centre. The social environment that adolescent boys and girls in the Kassena‐Nankana District encounter and its links to reproductive behavior are described. The principal question is whether even in this remote rural area, the social environment has been altered in ways that have undermined traditional sexual and reproductive patterns. The survey data indicate a considerable increase in girls' education and the beginning of a decline in the incidence of early marriage. The qualitative data suggest that social institutions, systems, and practices such as female circumcision that previously structured the lives ofadokscent boys and girls have eroded, leading to an apparent increase in premarital sexual activity.</jats:p>",

This study assesses the accuracy of simple, field‐based methods of diagnosing five reproductive tract infections (trichomonas, Candida, bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) in two rural Chinese counties, using “gold standard” laboratory diagnosis as the reference. Self‐reported symptoms and clinical examination proved inadequate for making accurate diagnoses, because many infected women show no symptoms or are infected with two or more conditions. The use of simple tests such as KOH staining, wet mount, Gram's stain, and pH of discharge greatly improved diagnostic accuracy, especially for Candida and trichomonas, the two most common infections. Promoting the use of such diagnostic approaches by rural Chinese medical and family planning health providers would reduce the prevalence and severity of these preventable and easily treated infections.</jats:p>",

The program was evaluated through indicators of contraceptive use, breastfeeding performance, infant growth and health, and a qualitative assessment of women's satisfaction. Controls were women of similar characteristics attending the nearby public clinic. Acceptability of contraceptive methods was similar but contraceptive options differed between clinics. The total number of pregnancies and of respondents lost to follow‐up was significantly higher for the public clinic than for the CSLH. Breastfeeding duration was significantly longer and infant growth and health were found to be significantly better at the CSLH than at the public clinic. Women valued being treated with respect, receiving education and support, and being offered timesaving services and wider contraceptive choices at the CSLH. This study demonstrates that such interventions are possible for poor communities, providing significant advantages for women and children.</jats:p>",

Sustainability provides the resilience which allows learning through mistakes and evolving visions not tied to a past that never was and a future that never will be. By renorming the time frame, and the concept of history, sustainability mandates that human intelligence not abdicate its responsibilities by attempting to defer to a static, mythic, external force.

In North Central Texas, this is made more difficult by the predominance of post oak (<jats:italic>Quercus stellata</jats:italic>), a tree that declines severely when cultural conditions are modified. The purpose of this project was to create a map using GPS technology of the existing trees, before final planning and construction of the golf course. In addition to the map, a database was created which would be used for future maintenance and management decisions. The GPS equipment consisted of a Trimble PRO-XRS GPS receiver and Trimble TDC-1 data logger and a Laser Atlanta laser rangefinder. Information collected for the database included tree number, latitude, longitude, number, identification, caliper, estimated height, and quality. Quality ratings were defined as 1) specimen, 2) good, 3) fair, 4) poor, 5) unacceptable. Tree numbers were placed on each tree rated above unacceptable, using metal tree tags. Height estimates were made using the vertical offset feature of the GPS equipment. Base maps were created using Pathfinder Office. Hard copy maps were printed, and digital copies were saved in raw and.dxf format for importation into AutoCAD. This map was combined with existing course plans and adjustments were made to save as many specimen trees as possible. Raw information was also imported into a Microsoft Access 97 database. This project created a database and maps that will provide important information in the future, and the development of the course with minimal loss of specimen trees.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relationship marketing focuses on building strong relationships with individual customers. Its emergence in the 1980s was however not so much a discovery, but a rediscovery of a truth which formed the foundation of many businesses. Partnering, at its best, is a long term commitment between two or more organisations for the purpose of achieving specific business objectives by maximising the effectiveness of each participant’s resources. The relationship is based upon trust, dedication to common goals and understanding each other’s individual expectations and values. This seems to suggest many similarities between relationship marketing and partnering. It is, however, still unclear as to what these similarities are. The objectives of this paper are, firstly, to compare relationship marketing with the partnering concept in the construction industry and, secondly, draw lessons from partnering in construction for relationship marketing.</jats:p>",

The responses of the marketing managers identified three categories of issues: standard or clerical applications, such as e‐mail or voice mail; advanced applications, such as conducting business on the Internet and EDI; and managerial and technical issues, such as the use of telecommunications to gain a competitive advantage. Surprisingly, marketing managers rated the standard applications as the most important. The explanation was found in the quality of their training. Marketing managers expressed major dissatisfaction with all areas of telecommunications training, but especially in the advanced applications and managerial issues. Rather than placing emphasis on the strategic, more training effort was spent on telecommunications training in the clerical functions. Without knowledge about the advanced or cutting‐edge applications, marketing managers do not understand the potential of these applications and issues in the organization.</jats:p>",

In this paper the foundations of Guanxi are described in the form of a four‐stage model. As Guanxi is a particular form of relationship in the Chinese culture and underpins much of the business carried out in China‐based economies, it is compared to relationship building in Western cultures. The paper adds to the literature on relationships and how they are developed and is important to the literature on relationship marketing applied in the Chinese context. It also helps the practitioner, who wishes to develop relationships in Chinese‐based economics, by providing guidelines on how the Chinese like to do business.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Each watershed has an overall hydrologic function to capture, store and safely release water. How well a watershed is able to perform this overall function is dependent upon how well each geomorphic component landform is functioning within the watershed. Each geomorphic component landform within a watershed has a specific hydrologic function and ecological potential. Component landforms that commonly occur in a watershed include stream channels, floodplains, stream terraces, alluvial valley bottoms, alluvial fans, mountain slopes, and ridge tops. When a component landform within a watershed becomes ecologically altered or degraded, its ability to perform its natural hydrologic and geomorphic functions becomes impaired and the watershed or ecosystem is unable to function properly. Component landforms within a watershed are interrelated. For example, the condition of a stream channel is closely related to the condition of its floodplain. Water from upland slopes is transported over and through alluvial fans and bottoms. Therefore, each component landform needs to be considered in the planning process and in setting watershed goals. This paper presents a simple field approach to inventory, evaluate and plan watershed restoration based on geomorphic, hydrologic and ecological principles. Examples of successful use of the approach on several watersheds in Utah, USA are given.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I outline a corporeal geography of consumption. By using the example of food I explore how our bodies are linked to wider consumption spaces and the ways that they are inflected by these sociospatial relations, Although discourses around eating in western cultures tend to privilege self-discipline, there are other meanings around food that emphasise its pleasurable qualities. Because our bodies are a product of the complex interaction of different discourses, social relations, and practices constituted in relation to wider locations, including other bodies, the home, and the workplace, these constellations of relationships do not always serve to produce our bodies in a coherent way. I therefore explore some of the tensions and conflicts individuals experience between different” discourses around food, bodily ideals, and sets of regulatory practices in different locations. In doing so I consider the extent to which individuals produce the space of their bodies in accordance with the disciplinary gaze of others rather than their own desires. I suggest that close spatial proximity to others can result in the erosion of individuals' body boundaries, and argue that the lack of corporeal freedom experienced by those interviewed highlights the limitations of public information and discourses about healthy eating, which are usually targeted at individuals and assume individualised patterns of consumption, rather than recognising the way that food consumption is often a shared activity and that bodily practices arc therefore inflected by wider sociospatial relations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops an optimization model and methodology to support tactical planning in a high mix, low volume electronics assembly environment. The model assigns product families to parallel surface mount assembly lines to minimize setup cost on the placement machines while ensuring that the facilities are not overloaded. To capture the impact of product assignment decisions on setup cost, we consider a partial setup policy of mounting some components permanently on each placement machine and loading other components as needed for each product. We formulate the tactical planning problem as an integer program, and show that even the special case of minimizing the setup cost on a single placement machine, for a given assignment of products, is NP-hard. Our solution method for the general problem, based on column generation, provides both heuristic solutions and lower bounds. Two subproblems that we solve—a product selection subproblem and a setup optimization subproblem—might be independently useful for short-term production planning. Computational experience shows that the approach is effective, providing solutions that are within 1.5% of optimality on average and reducing setup costs considerably compared to a complete setup policy. </jats:p>",

Transformation of these properties to meet the requirements of modern industrial operations is becoming an imminent task for property managers and industrial landowners. This paper reviews the experience of the private sector in restructuring obsolete industrial properties in Hong Kong. In particular, we focus our discussions on a recent market initiative (composite industrial‐office property development in Hong Kong) as an innovative attempt to make better use of urban industrial space. We argue that this new property type has not been successful because of the institutional constraints imposed under the planning policy. It again confirms that the industrial property market is characterized by market imperfection, owing largely to government policies, which precludes a smooth market adjustment to respond positively to changing demand. This problem, if allowed to continue, will ultimately damage the competitiveness of the cities.</jats:p>",

The field studies verified the set of activities and the findings were used to refine the activities and identify additional activities to be included in the set. The field studies were also used to develop detailed reasons why each activity was considered relevant or not relevant. From the field studies it was possible to conclude that the overall type of company (i.e. make‐to‐order (MTO), make‐to‐stock (MTS), etc.) was not in itself sufficient to predict which activity would be relevant to a particular company.

By drawing on focus-group discussions with men of different class, age, and regional and ethnic backgrounds, we contrast two ways of thinking about these magazines. The first employs a distinction between ‘surface’ and ‘depth’, and suggests that the magazines signal only superficial changes in contemporary masculinities. The second approach identifies a series of discursive repertoires on which men draw in ‘making sense’ of the magazines. Four such repertoires are highlighted, which involve notions of ‘honesty’, ‘naturalness’, ‘openness’, and ‘harmless fun’. The analysis suggests that although some respondents saw the magazines' commercial success in terms of a backlash against ‘feminist extremism’ and ‘political correctness’, most denied their wider political significance. We conclude that the magazines provide their readers with a form of ‘constructed certitude’ that represents a commodified response to men's current gender anxieties. </jats:p>",

An alternative explanation for high unemployment is the skills mismatch hypothesis, which argues that skill demands in urban labor markets increase over time, but blacks lag behind other population groups in their job skills and educational attainments. This research suggests that spatial and skills mismatch are interlinked. Logistical regression models are utilized, with 1990 PUMS data, to test the impacts of spatial accessibility on employment of black and white youths between 16 and 25 years of age in three different labor-market segments. The results confirm that a disadvantage for blacks exists as a combination of the two mismatches. Racial job-accessibility differentials appears to be more important in lower labor-market segments but blacks experience a disadvantage both in central-city and in suburban locations. </jats:p>",

The initial concern is with the origins of the strategy, particularly the manner in which the work of Perroux (on dominance and economic space) became modified to form a normative concept in regional economic planning. Consideration is given to the various regional-problem settings in which the growth-pole strategy has been advocated. These settings reflected such policy concerns as depressed-area revival, the encouragement of regional deconcentration, the modification of a national urban system, the pursuit of interregional balance, etc. Attention then turns to the fundamental nature and underlying rationale of the strategy. The paper is continued in Part 2 which appears in the next issue of the journal. </jats:p>",

Such fear is typically constructed from a white perspective, which reinforces prejudice and ignores the role of race in the experience of fear.

In this paper I investigate middle-class white, black and Hispanic women's experiences of race and fear in public spaces in Orange County, California. I present a typology of public spaces in which women encounter racialized others, and I map race fear onto these spaces. Experiences of fear and comfort in public space are examined, and I consider the interaction of race, class, and gender with place type and location. Particular attention is given to the form of these interactions in a post-suburban landscape. </jats:p>",

A key element in the Government's strategy for tackling social exclusion, the New Deal represents a major financial and political commitment, yet perhaps more fundamentally it reflects a change in Labour's thinking about the underlying causes of, and appropriate remedies for, unemployment. Drawing on a behaviourist, supply-side, explanation of ‘welfare dependency’, the aim of the programme is not to create jobs (as it was for ‘Old Labour’) but to (re)create a work ethic — to raise ‘employ ability’ amongst young people. This does not take sufficient account of the demand-side, structural, causes of unemployment a fact which is likely to lead to difficulties (both in implementation and in the achievement of positive outcomes) in precisely those parts of the country where the need is greatest: high-unemployment areas in the large cities and lagging regions. The author argues, therefore, that particular attention needs to be paid to the emerging geographies of welfare-to-work because, as the New Deal ‘treads down’ differentially into local labour markets around the country, its effects will begin to diverge from those anticipated by national policymakers. In labour-market terms, the programme may even begin to dispense different regulatory functions in relatively depressed compared with buoyant local economies, with institutional containment emerging as the dominant function in the depressed areas and economic coercion the dominant function in buoyant local economies. </jats:p>",

The key to understanding this emerging industry is the evolution of interfirm relational skills under conditions constrained by uncertainty (for example, market failures compounded by bounded rationality and opportunism), yet which necessitate collaboration. The evolution of interfirm relations takes two forms: core firms and suppliers devise new means of bilateral relations in a situation where neither can invest in a committed relationship; competing auto makers and suppliers create and support multilateral institutions necessary to industry and market development. Evidence from EV auto-maker—supplier bilateral relations and from auto-maker—supplier relations with multilateral institutions are analyzed for motive, mechanisms, and effect, and are categorized. </jats:p>",

Governments in most poor countries are encouraging self-help ownership. But what do poor households actually gain through ownership? Unlike the housing of the better off, consolidated self-help housing is seldom sold. If there is a limited market for this kind of property, capital appreciation must be limited and, therefore, the poor are likely to lose out relative to the rich. If the poor do not sell their consolidated self-help homes what do they do with them? Are homes merely to live in or do they have economic functions too? The author attempts to answer some of these questions with the aid of research on consolidated self-help suburbs in Bogotá, Colombia. He broadly concludes that self-help ownership does not offer the same advantages in terms of capital appreciations as does ownership in higher income areas. </jats:p>",

It is very difficult to provide accurate and smooth input paths quickly through the master arm and avoid collisions. These problems are further compounded by time-delay when the distances involved are large (for example, in the case of space exploration). If an intermediate VR system can modify the human input to provide smooth, collision-free paths, the intuitive capabilities of human beings to identify a feasible path can be quickly combined with the machine's ability to modify the colliding segments to noncolliding ones. We call this synthesis shared intelligence. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper develops the strategies and mathematics to implement this concept of shared intelligence in path planning, using a VR interface in which human and machine abilities are combined appropriately. Shared intelligence unburdens the human operator from precisely and accurately inputting the planned path. With the help of the free space developed for a simple telerobot, it is shown how the human input is converted into parameterized paths in the configuration space, checked for collisions, and automatically modified into collision-free paths using repulsive fields introduced in the configuration space. Simulations and experimental results are also shown to illustrate these concepts. </jats:p>",

Regression analysis, controlling for demographic variables, further indicated that athletes who had sustained a severe athletic injury were no less satisfied with life than noninjured and moderately injured athletes. However, athletes who could state a postcollegiate occupational plan were significantly more satisfied with life than those who were unable to indicate such a goal.

She draws on Census of Population data for 1981 and 1991 from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study and cross-sectional Sample of Anonymised Records microdata for 1991. These data are used to demonstrate the shifts in household employment composition, by region, for a subpopulation of ‘nuclear family’ households. The results indicate that households with more than one earner demonstrate a lower propensity to be spatially mobile than do ‘traditional’ male-breadwinner households. The implication is that differential opportunities and constraints, which are conferred by residential location and all forms of mobility—residential, occupational, and sociospatial—operate, at least in part, as a function of household employment structure and the evolution of household structure across both time (the life course) and space (home and work locations). The author opens up the analysis of Census of Population data to issues both of intrahousehold and of inter-household mobility as a means of sensitising migration research to issues which call for further in-depth qualitative investigation. </jats:p>",

In addition to the widely understood shift to service and high technology employment experienced in urban, suburban, and rural places, restructuring in the Western Mountain states has also significantly challenged existing political and social relationships. The authors examine the outcomes of restructuring by exploring economic, social, and political change in Idaho—a state in the Western USA. Idaho has witnessed a drastic decline in agriculture, ranching, and mining, and a rapid growth in the tourism, recreation, and high-technology sectors. Such changes have contributed to escalating tensions across the state concerning the appropriate use of public lands. The authors illustrate these tensions by exploring an ongoing controversy over the use of Idaho's school-endowment lands. The conflict over how these lands should be used highlights the central role that restructuring has played in political and social conflict over environmental protection and land use in largely rural areas. </jats:p>",

Associated with the union action was a ground swell of resident opposition to demolition and redevelopment. There has been much documentation of this important moment in Australian history: Green Bans have been celebrated as a class-based urban social movement and as the birth of environmentalism in Australia. We begin the process of critically reevaluating Sydney's Green Bans, drawing on feminist-inspired reworkings of publicity and privacy. In this cultural geography of the Green Bans we argue that resident participation restructured the very terms of democracy and, along with this, a range of citizens' rights. This reading shows that the categories ‘private’ and ‘public’ are far from fixed: they are sociospatial categories that take a multitude of forms and configurations in time, in process, across space. </jats:p>",

This study examines functional status at three points surrounding an acute health episode: admission, discharge and 3 months post discharge from a community hospital. The aim of the study is to determine the most appropriate time to measure functional status to assist health service planning. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted at Manly Hospital, Australia. Four hundred patients aged 65 years and over representing a 10% random sample of all hospital admissions in a 10‐month period were interviewed on admission, discharge and 3 months post discharge. Repeated measure multiple analysis of variance identified a decline in functional status between admission and discharge. At 3 months post discharge functional status had improved to levels higher than admission. Functional status assessment at discharge can assist consumers, clinicians, health planners and health insurers to make effective decisions to maximize health outcomes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For a number of decades considerable resources have been devoted to supporting Irish industrial policies. There has, however, been a distinct lack of evaluation of these policies. This is particularly pertinent to the Irish small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector given its employment potential and importance to the domestic economy. The Small Business Task Force reports that 98% of businesses in Ireland employ fewer than 50 persons and that these provide around half of the total employment in the private sector. There has, however, been a distinct lack of research into the additional impact of SME policy, and particularly the measurement of the twin concepts of deadweight and displacement. To help bridge this gap in Irish SME policy research, the author evaluates grants awarded to indigenous firms (91% of which are SMEs) by a regional development agency in the Shannon region of Ireland. Two components of additionality—deadweight and displacement—are used to aid this evaluation process. The prime methodological approach is that of the self-assessment approach, involving in-depth face-to-face interviews with the managing directors of 77 firms that received grants from the regional development agency in 1995. Data emanating from interviews are then used to obtain estimates of deadweight and displacement in the Shannon region of Ireland. </jats:p>",

Over time, as the business planning process becomes increasingly one which adopts a top‐down approach, the main influence middle managers have is upon the implementation of deliberate strategic change. Middle managers modify the implementation of deliberate strategy by contesting the performance indicators that form the basis of the business planning framework. In particular they draw upon features of inner and outer context of the organization to question the legitimacy of business planning. However, the findings also show, albeit to a limited extent, that middle managers are purveyors as well as recipients of change. That middle managers can have upward influence has important implications for policy‐makers since potentially, middle managers can enjoy an enhanced role and add value to organizations, in this case to patient care. Therefore recent attacks upon their numbers and role may be misplaced. In addition a high degree of central intervention in the NHS generally may be inappropriate, since it militates against an enhanced role for middle managers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An extended review is presented of Bruno Latour's book Aramis, or the Love of Technology (Harvard University Press, 1996). Attention is paid to the textual style and strategies in the book, and also to how it fits in with, and exemplifies, many of the more abstract claims central to Latour's actor-network theory. In particular, consideration is given to the provocative arguments in the book about the status of nonhuman beings in social-scientific research, and to the specific manoeuvre whereby Aramis, this transportation project which never quite made it from being an idea to being a completed object, is accorded agency—and even a voice—in the text. The ‘x-morphising’ which underpins Aramis in this respect is examined, and is subsequently criticised for a flattening out of agency which permits humans and nonhumans to be regarded as ‘social’ equivalents. Although attracted to Latour's radical emancipation of nonhuman things from a social-scientific netherworld, we nonetheless conclude by worrying about the flat and undifferentiated ‘spatial imaginary’ at the heart of what he is attempting to do for actors of all kinds in Aramis. </jats:p>",

More recent literature has begun to explore more carefully the nature of sound and the aural sensing of the environment in its social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Here we contribute to this exploration not solely by offering a theoretical consideration of sound but also by providing a detailed analysis of the ways in which one particular place, over a particular period of time, became involved in a new set of relations centred on sound. The place in question is Blackburn in Lancashire, England, where, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, ‘warehouse parties’ revolving around ‘acid house’ music and the drug Ecstasy (‘E’) had a major impact on the town, in all manner of ways. By offering an empirical study as well as a more theoretical discussion on the relations between sound and space, we hope to demonstrate the significance of these relations to themes that have traditionally been regarded as central to geographical enquiry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine, using the NatWest/Manchester Business School (MBS) tax models, the impact of taxation on the small business sector over the last few years. Because it is known that a small number of growth businesses provide most of the new wealth and additional employment created by the small firms sector, consideration is given to the combined effect of the different elements of the tax regime on small firms, with particular reference to the tax implications of business growth. The NatWest/MBS tax models, for incorporated and unincorporated small businesses, contain accounting data for a stratified random sample of almost 4000 small UK firms. These data are employed to estimate the total tax burden borne by small firms in the United Kingdom, including the total value of taxes collected from this sector by the Exchequer and the aggregate value of compliance costs borne by small businesses. Unincorporated firms employing fewer than 20 staff contribute just 5% of government revenues, and small limited companies with fewer than 100 employees provide 15% of total taxes collected. These figures of total tax revenues together with estimates of the compliance costs borne by small firms are assembled into tax indices for incorporated and unincorporated firms, set at 100 in 1994/95. Changes to the total tax burden are traced from 1994/95 (the base year in the models) up to 1996/97 in the light of the changes introduced in successive budgets. Although the index for small companies falls by 2.5 points across this period the position of unincorporated firms remains virtually unchanged. The reasons for these differential effects are considered and explained. We identify three important areas in which the growth and development of small business is restrained by the tax regulations currently in force: sales growth, employment generation, and investment for the future, We conclude that the fiscal barriers in these areas could be reduced by raising the VAT registration limit (initially to £100 000), by compensating small businesses for the cost of collecting tax on behalf of government and by reducing the level of taxation on profits reinvested in small businesses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An area of increasing attention for policymakers is the potential for growth as small businesses take up new information and communication technologies (ICTs), This interest has added to the broad discussion on small firms which use information technology (IT) and the take-up of IT by small firms, Often it is an implicit assumption that benefits for the business will accrue as new information-processing technologies are adopted and, accordingly, there has been a flurry of concern over the take-up of ICTs by small firms. Much less attention has been paid within small-firms research to the policy mechanisms and programmes which are enabling take-up, and the reasons why small firms should use ICTs. It is not our intention in this paper to question the rights or wrongs of policy of this nature; rather we seek to make three main points. The first is that there is a scattered and piecemeal approach to this area, consistent with many other small-firm policy issues. We indicate the type of ICT programmes taking place, initiated by UK and European governments, and suggest that an important rationale to this rests with the notion of increasing economic competitiveness. A second point is that there is a clear distinction between the aims and ideals of ICT programmes and the perspectives of owner/managers in small firms. We suggest that policy has not been grounded in the experience of the small firm. The third is that there needs to be further work by small-firm researchers to develop a more rigorous conceptual base for small firms and ICTs. This needs to go beyond notions of use and towards thinking about the ways in which small firms do business in an informational economy. We draw on our previous and current work on small firms, local economic policy, and ICTs and the raison d’être for this paper is that there is a place on the policy agenda for further discussion on the way small firms are being encouraged to use ICTs. </jats:p>",

They focus specifically on exports of sawn lumber and added-value wood products from the Pacific Northwest region (PNW), comprising the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC), and the US states of Washington and Oregon. Conceptually, a ‘get tough—get smart’ dichotomy for evaluating export-stimulation policies is outlined and elaborated on in the context of the PNW wood-products trade with Japan. The authors show that Canada and BC favored predominantly ‘get-smart’ strategies in the wood-products trade with Japan whereas the United States and Washington/Oregon preferred mainly ‘get-tough’ strategics. However, the authors conclude by pointing to the need for both styles in order to be successful in the difficult Japanese market. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive and both generate external economy effects that cannot be limited to one national or regional territory. Nevertheless, the ‘get-tough-get-smart’ continuum is an effective starting point for classifying US and Canadian positions, respectively, and for raising policy and research questions about their relative roles and the underlying bargaining and learning processes which are involved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last few years, the UK government has sought to assist more effectively small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)-sector firms through the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils and Business Links. These organisations undertake assessment of client satisfaction. Most of their measurement tools, however, do not permit determination of the factors which are key influences of client attitudes. Research on customer behaviour both in industrial markets and in service environments has caused some academics to posit that, in many situations, the application of traditional transactional-market-research tools is often ineffective. Accordingly, they propose that satisfaction measurement should encompass the influence of a relationship-management orientation because the processes designed to build long-term customer loyalty may be a more appropriate philosophy through which to gain understanding of SME-sector attitudes to services delivered by suppliers. The aim, therefore, is to examine the relevance of applying a relationship-management research tool to assess client satisfaction in small-business-advisory scenarios. Interviews with advisors and owner/managers have been used to construct a qualitative model of factors influencing the client-advisor relationship. The implications of the study are discussed in relation to the future operation of not-for-profit support agencies seeking to optimise the effectiveness of service provision. Proposals are made concerning the need for further research. </jats:p>",

The metropolitan and the microlevel data facilitate an analysis incorporating well-defined geographic units and their respective attributes, as well as an analysis disaggregated by the personal factors of migrants. The PUMS files provide one of the richest sources of national-level migration micro data in terms of geographic resolution, the number of individual or household characteristics recorded, sample size, and availability. The focus of the modelling exercise is to examine the performance of competing-destinations migration models which are based on the assumption that migrants process spatial information hierarchically. To date the only empirical testing of such models has been undertaken with aggregate spatial flow data, so the PUMS data provide a unique opportunity to examine the behaviour of the competing destinations framework in more detail. The authors provide information on the determinants of intermetropolitan migration within the USA and on the validity of the theoretical foundations of the competing-destinations framework. Traditional spatial choice models are shown to be severely misspecified and the distance-decay parameter estimates from such models to be potentially biased in such a manner that they exhibit the well-known ‘spatial structure’ effect. This effect does not appear when the parameters are estimated from competing-destinations models. </jats:p>",

Five patients with localized prostate cancer, imaged with four MRI sequences (spin echo (SE) T1, turbo SE (TSE) T2, high resolution TSE (HR) T2, and FLASH 3D (F3D)), compared with their corresponding CT planning scans. Segmentation ability of the following pelvic structures: prostatic apex (PA), prostate, rectum, bladder and seminal vesicles (SV), were evaluated by three independent observers. They used a five point grading scale based on the anatomical definition of the organ boundary, tissue contrast and multiplanar display. Results were averaged for the group and for each sequence. There was no significant interobserver variation in the assessed scores (p &amp;gt; 0.1). The average scores (+/- 1 SD) for all pelvic structures assessed by each imaging sequence were CT 1.3 +/- 0.6; SE T1 2.4 +/- 0.9; TSE T2 2.4 +/- 0.7; HR T2 2.2 +/- 0.7 and F3D 3.4 +/- 0.6. Compared with CT, the average MR score for each assessed pelvic structure was higher with a trend for all transaxial MR sequences to provide improved segmentation of the PA and rectum. The F3D sequence scored highest as it provided multiplanar views and avoided the problem of partial volume averaging. MRI, compared with CT, appears to provide improved definition of pelvic treatment volumes but further work is required to confirm this and to address the issues of MRI associated distortion and dosimetry before MRI can be used routinely for pelvic radiotherapy planning.</jats:p>",

This article presents a time‐efficient procedure for facilitation of the necessary communication between the prosthodontist and surgeon before maxillectomy surgical procedures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research into the effects of electioneering at the constituency level suggests positive impacts on voters of campaign spending by one party relative to another. In much of this research, however, the political context of the elections studied is ignored or fitted into Key's category of normal or maintaining elections, where voting patterns remain relatively constant from one election to another. There are few, if any, reports of money—votes relationships associated with other types of elections. Analysis of a deviating election followed by two reinstating elections in the state of New South Wales, Australia, from 1988 to 1995 confirms the generality of postulated relationships between campaign spending and voting patterns, even allowing for some degree of underestimation associated with a misreading of voter intentions by the major parties in times of electoral volatility. Further insights into money—votes relationships are provided from particular features of Australian elections: a focus on marginal seats associated with strategic use of a public funding component of election-campaign expenditure, compulsory voting, and the use of an alternative vote or preferential voting system. </jats:p>",

The model relies on the small displacement torsor concept and on the computer aided tolerancing approach. The link between process planning and functional tolerances with torsor chains according to workpiece set-ups is exposed. An example shows how the model is used to determine automatically geometrical variations of the workpiece knowing geometrical variations of each part (part-holder, positioning devices, machined surfaces, etc.). </jats:p>",
