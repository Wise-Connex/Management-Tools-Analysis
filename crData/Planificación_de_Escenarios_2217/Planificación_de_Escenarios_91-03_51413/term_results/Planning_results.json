Vom fachlichen Selbstverständnis und Instrumentarium aus gesehen zum Städtebau, von der historischen Aufgabenstellung her betrachtet zur Wirtschaft, nach moderner gesellschaftlicher Gewichtung zur Ökologie und unter ästhetischen Aspekten zur Harmonie- und Gestaltungsidee des Landschaftsgartens im 18. Jahrhundert. Eine umstrittene Beziehung der Raumordnung ist die zum Recht. Das Schlagwort der \"Verrechtlichung\" der Raumordnung ist nicht zu akzeptieren. Die Verbindung der Raumordnung als staatliche Aufgabenstellung mit dem Recht ist notwendig und keineswegs außergewöhnlich. Dies gilt besonders für eine Aufgabenstellung, die gezwungen ist, als neutraler Mittler staatliche Fachbelange gegeneinander abzuwägen und damit im Einzelfall auch bei der Abwägung unterliegen zu lassen.Die Verbindung mit dem Recht ist freilich nicht problemlos, soweit sich die Raumordnung zur Durchsetzung ihrer generellen Festlegungen in Form der Ziele verbindlicher Normen bedient. Naturgemäß muß einer von Unwägbarkeiten der Zukunft abhängigen und damit flexiblen Planung die Einbindung in notwendigerweise starre, auf verläßlichen Bestand ausgerichtete Rechtsnormen widerstreben. Der systembedingte Konflikt ist über den Zwang zur ständigen Überprüfung und Fortschreibung zu mildern, aber nicht völlig aufzulösen.Die notwendige Verbindung von Raumordnung und Recht wird durch die These überhöht, daß die Ordnung des Raumes sogar als Wurzel des Rechts schlechthin betrachtet werden kann. Dies gilt sowohl für die historische Entwicklung des Rechts aus der Ordnung und Gliederung des Raumes als auch für die sprachgeschichtliche Ableitung des griechischen Nomos (Gesetz) von nemein, das nicht nur \"Weiden\", sondern auch das \"Gerechte Verteilen\" von Weideland, also von Raum und Fläche bedeutet.</jats:p>"

An organization with an effective oil spill contingency plan will have considered both components.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Armed with thick oil spill contingency plans, companies expect to be able to respond adequately to major oil spills. For several reasons, this expectation may be unrealistic. For example, the plans may incorporate inadequate appraisals of available response assets, they may have been developed merely to satisfy regulatory requirements, or they may fail to consider various spill scenarios. Plans based on unattainable or unrealistic expectations end up on the shelf collecting dust. Thus, one of the first things to consider in contingency planning is what the plan will be expected to do.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Another factor in the effectiveness of a contingency plan is its format. Oil spill contingency plans that are comprehensive and easy to use are essential. It is useful to divide the plan into three major sections: response procedures, background information, and scenario development. The response procedures section should be relatively short and contain step-by-step procedures to be followed during a spill response. The background information section should contain the background information accumulated during the planning period. The scenario development section should contain the scenarios identified for various spill sizes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An excellent contingency plan is of limited value if it is not effectively implemented. Effective implementation requires that everyone in the response and planning organization know the company's ideas, policies, and strategies regarding oil spill response, understands his or her roles and responsibilities in preparing for and carrying out a response, and is committed to carrying out the program. Implementation is often difficult because it involves changing the organization's way of doing things. When the way an organization does business does not match a new program being implemented, leadership is required to match them, either by changing the way of doing business or by changing the program. Changing a new program could be as simple as making a decision. Changing the way an organization does business is a process and is usually very difficult, especially in a large, complex organization like an oil company.</jats:p>",

In fact, section 300.210 of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) goes so far as to require that the U.S. Coast Guard on-scene coordinator (OSC) develop a contingency plan for all areas of the coastal zone. However, before the Exxon Valdez oil spill, most contingency plans, federal and state included, simply addressed a response to the largest spills that, historically, had occurred in the areas. The idea of a catastrophic oil spill the size of the Exxon Valdez spill was not considered. This, of course, all changed shortly after midnight on March 24, 1989.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper discusses the guidance that was provided by U. S. Coast Guard Headquarters to each Coast Guard OSC for reviewing and revising their local contingency plans (LCPs). This guidance delineated certain areas of the planning process that require special attention (such as hazard identification, risk assessment, response times, and required equipment), specific criteria to be used while reviewing the LCPs, and guidelines to be used for determining response resource needs and shortfalls.</jats:p>",

Moreover both of them, while examining the relation between ‘space and society’, are broad in scope and carry the debate beyond the confines of the geography discipline. In this paper they are examined from a feminist perspective. The arguments range across a number of issues, from the question of style and the construction of the texts, the assumption of universals which are in fact particulars, the lack of recognition of the feminist literature, to a politics in which it is assumed that the only enemy is capitalism. These arguments therefore go beyond feminism to link up with issues of other groups, most particularly ethnic minorities and those from non-Western societies. In the end, it is argued, consigning these groups to parentheses after the supposed universal of the white, male, heterosexual vitiates the projects which the two books undertake. </jats:p>",

Adopting Jameson's definition of postmodernism as an embracing historical condition in which the valorization of fragmentation and difference conceals the spatioeconomic relations that underlie the totality of late capitalist society, Harvey contends that intellectual and aesthetic currents which insist on different starting points of social analysis or identify new objects of political analysis are necessarily complicit with advanced capitalism's concealment of social reality. It is no accident that Harvey's claim to perceive an objective basis of totality entails a refusal of feminist theories of representation, for feminists have analyzed such totalizing visions as the fictions of subjects driven by the desire to disavow their own partial and fragmented condition through the refusal of difference. </jats:p>",

Multicriterial optimization models have limited utility for decision analysis in this environment as they must be formulated from the perspective of a single decision maker. A flexible integer programming model is demonstrated as a useful and appropriate tool to simulate and explore the collective options in a multiple ownership integrated planning (MOIP) problem. Multiple budget constraints are featured in this model as a vehicle by which resource contributions from both landowners and nonlandowners can be explicitly recognized. The hypothesis that MOIP problems define a positive sum game is supported by analyzing the data set of published national forest plan Draft Environmental Impact Statements (DEIS) for California data set.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eine regional differenzierte Wohnungspolitik wird in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland fast überhaupt nicht durch eine räumliche Feinsteuerung auf staatlicher Ebene, sondern durch die Arbeitsteilung zwischen den drei räumlichen Ebenen von Politik und Verwaltung erreicht, die mit den Stichworten Föderalismus (Bundesländer) und kommunale Selbstverwaltung (Städte und Gemeinden) umrissen ist. Am Beispiel des sozialen Wohnungsbaus läßt sich zeigen, daß die Rolle der unteren Verwaltungsebenen jeweils eine Mischung aus Verwaltungsvollzug von Bundes- bzw. Landesgesetzen und aus eigenen wohnungspolitischen Entscheidungen darstellt.Diese Balance der regionalen Verantwortlichkeiten würde jedoch nachhaltig gestört, würde auf Bundesebene die Liberalisierungspolitik fortgesetzt, die zunehmende Teile des preis- und belegungsgebundenen Sozialwohnungsbestands in den freien Markt überführt und damit der kommunalen Ebene eines ihrer wichtigsten Instrumente zur Versorgung von am Markt benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen nimmt. Die jüngst in diesem Bereich ergriffenen Maßnahmen lassen bereits ein Umdenken erkennen. Für die durch die deutsche Vereinigung hinzugekommenen neuen Länder fehlt jedoch noch eine klare Konzeption für die Konstituierung eines entsprechenden gebundenen Wohnungsbestands.</jats:p>"

Zu den konvergenten Entwicklungen gehören insbesondere die verschiedenen Folgen einer zunehmend marktkonformen Finanzierung des Sozialen Wohnungsbaus, so der Wechsel von staatlichen Billigdarlehen zu degressiv subventionierten Bankdarlehen, die Anhebung der erforderlichen Eigenmittel und die soziale Abfederung dieser Maßnahmen durch steigende Subjektförderungen. Nur im Bereich der steuerlichen Förderung ist Österreich insgesamt nicht dem internationalen Trend gefolgt. Weitere Divergenzen lassen sich vor allem im Bereich der Bauträger, des Mietrechts, der Sanierungs- und der Eigentumspolitik feststellen. In diesen organisatorisch-institutionellen Fragen haben sich viele Eigenarten der Wiener Wohnungswirtschaft und Wohnungspolitik bis heute erhalten.</jats:p>"

It is suggested that an indicator based on just two of these variables can be as reliable a measure of the physical quality of life in a population as a multivariable indicator based directly on socioeconomic data. Unlike multivariable indicators, which are expensive to collect, the demographic data are readily available. Their use as social indicators would thus offer a simple, cheap, and effective means of monitoring the standard of living in small, geographically defined populations and in evaluating the effects of policy interventions. The analysis is based on Israeli towns, with use of data from the census of 1983. </jats:p>",

Eine solche Anpassung erscheint insbesondere dann notwendig, wenn verstärkte Zuwanderungen, steigende Mieten und vermehrte Immobilientransaktionen veränderte Rahmenbedingungen am Wohnungsmarkt anzeigen.Verteilungswirkungen stadterneuerungspolitischer Instrumente werden im Hinblick auf die spezielle Versorgungsfunktion von Altbauwohnungsteilmärkten aus segmentationstheoretischer Sicht begründet. Zugleich wird betont, daß die Divergenz aus stadterneuerungspolitischen Zielen und privatwirtschaftlichen Interessen eine sozialorientierte Wirkungsweise von maßgeblichen ordnungs- und förderungspolitischen Instrumenten nicht unbedingt erwarten läßt. Dies zeigen tendenziell auch die empirischen Befunde bezüglich der geförderten Hauseigentümer und bestimmter sozialer Milieus. Unter Berücksichtigung der trotz Förderung zusätzlich entstehenden Wohnkosten und des zunehmenden Nachfragedrucks im Altbausegment nach Billigwohnungen ist zu erwarten, daß eine sozial verträgliche Wohnungsversorgung in den nächsten Jahren kaum erhalten werden kann. Eine Modifikation der wohnungs- und stadterneuerungspolitischen Instrumente erscheint daher angesichts der sich ändernden Rahmenbedingungen unerläßlich.</jats:p>"

Shoreline assessment was a prerequisite to the cleanup program in both 1989 and 1990, and provided the cornerstone for the development and monitoring of the cleanup program. Information provided by the assessment teams included geomorphological, biological, archaeological, and oiling information that led to site specific treatment plans. These plans were submitted for interagency review prior to approval by the federal on-scene coordinator. This process was instrumental in developing an environmentally sensitive approach to the cleanup of over 1,000 miles of remote shoreline in 1989.</jats:p>",

Der Begriff der Finanzierungskraft umfaßt die Lebenszykluseinkommen, die ererbte bzw. übertragene Vermögensausstattung sowie komplementäre Vermögensbestandteile wie die Kreditwürdigkeit durch Ausbildung und Beruf, und auch intangible Komponenten wie die Zugehörigkeit zu bestimmten Schichten mit unterschiedlicher Information über den Zugang zum Wohnungsmarkt. Es wird argumentiert, daß in einer Welt mit unterschiedlichen Vermögensausstattungen stets die Tendenz besteht, daß die Wohnungsanbieter die Haushalte mit Vermögensvorteilen an sich binden. Das soziale Problem des Wohnens wird darin erblickt, daß Haushalte ohne ausreichende Vermögensausstattung sowohl im Rahmen einer freien Wohnungsmarktwirtschaft als auch, aufgrund ökonomischer und sozialer Ineffizienzen, bei ausgeprägter angebotsseitiger Staatsintervention vom Wohnungsmarkt ausgeschlossen werden. Es wird vorgeschlagen, ein Subjekthilfe System nach dem Muster einer negativen Einkommensteuer zu implementieren, während geeignete Anreize benötigt werden, daß eine Vielfalt von Angebotstypen die langfristige Wohnraumversorgung für aufeinanderfolgende Generationen sicherstellt.

Three segments of the population are identified as highly sensitive to the adverse effects of air pollution: children, the aged, and sufferers from respiratory and circulatory conditions. Accordingly, some central facilities, such as crèches, kindergartens, elementary schools, homes for the aged, and hospitals are recognized as hypersusceptible to environmental pollution. An illustration of an environmental approach to central facility location is presented. A multicriteria optimization model is developed and applied to the location of pediatric hospitals in the Warsaw region.

An application of this environment to implementing the StructureMover demonstration is then described in detail. The structure-moving task, accomplished by this demonstration, requires exploration with sensors, and understanding of a structure presented to the robot system. It thus requires the processing of sensory information, model-based interpreta tion of this information, and planning of both physical actions as well as measurement actions to acquire new information.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with the way in which housing tenure categories are used in analysis of social change in Britain. The tendency to represent tenures as unchanging, homogeneous categories with exclusive attributes is discussed. It is argued that it is important to assess the ways in which dominant housing tenures have been changing and to highlight differentiation within tenures. This discussion is mainly pursued in relation to debates about homeownership. Reference is made to the need to appreciate various elements contributing to the growth of homeownership and various differences between homeowners in terms of accommodation, legal rights, material interest, security, and social class. In conclusion it is argued that polarised presentations of homogeneous tenures are an inadequate basis for discussion and that recognition of key divisions within tenures is important in developing an understanding of the relationship between housing and social change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A method is presented for integrating stereotactic projection and tomographic image data to give composite 3‐D images (stereo pairs) of cerebral anatomy and vasculature. The technique serves to combine complementary information from each modality and allows the imaged volume to be viewed directly. The procedure is largely automated and requires no additional apparatus or information beyond that which is ordinarily employed during stereotactic surgical planning. The two types of data are combined by superimposing the projection angiogram (DSA) onto a translucent volume rendered CT or MR image. Since the rendering algorithm employs an orthographic projection technique, the tomographic volume must first be reshaped and oriented to yield a perspective view that matches the DSA projection. During this process, the data undergo various interpolations which consequently affect the accuracy of target identification based on the resulting images. The integrity of the matching procedure was assessed using simulated data sets. Also, calculations were performed to estimate the resolution of measurements made from digitized stereoscopic images. The resulting sub‐pixel accuracy of the matched images suggests that the technique has potential for stereotactic applications. Preliminary results are presented illustrating combined CT‐DSA and MR‐DSA data sets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die Volkszählung 1981 stand in Österreich im Banne der Zweitwohnsitzproblematik. Jeder Bürger, der über mehrere Wohnsitze verfügte, konnte angeben, wo der \"Mittelpunkt seiner Lebensinteressen\" liegt, welchen Wohnsitz er als Hauptwohnsitz betrachtete. Die Wohnsitznachfrage hatte enorme politische Brisanz erhalten, weil damit weitreichende Konsequenzen für die Zuteilung von Mitteln aus dem Finanzausgleich bzw. die Mandatsverteilung verbunden sind.Der Beitrag geht den Gründen für die auch im Vergleich zu anderen Großstädten Europas hohe Zweitwohnungsintensität (ca. 37 % der Wiener Haushalte verfügen über einen Zweitwohnsitz) nach. Die Ausgangsthese ist: Die Hauptunterschiede im Ausmaß und in den Formen der Aufspaltung des Wohnens in den industrialisierten Ländern sind in den Rahmenbedingungen der jeweiligen politischen Systeme zu suchen, den Zielsetzungen der Gesellschaftspolitik, politisch-administrativen Strukturen, städtebaulichen Determinanten und vor allem der Wohnungspolitik und -wirtschaft. Länder mit einer liberalen Wohnungspolitik verzeichnen eine geringe Zweitwohnungsintensität und eine hohe Bevölkerungs-Suburbanisierungsrate, solche mit einer restriktiven Wohnungspolitik und größeren Segmenten geschützter Wohnungsteilmärkte haben dagegen eine hohe Zweitwohnungsintensität und eine vergleichsweise geringe Bevölkerungs-Suburbanisierungsrate. Der Anteil der Kosten des Hauptwohnsitzes am Haushaltseinkommen bestimmt die Möglichkeit der Aufspaltung des Wohnens.Das Zweitwohnungswesen der Wiener wird durch die spezifischen Mechanismen der Wiener Wohnungspolitik und -wirtschaft determiniert. Durch die geringe Mietkostenbelastung in den geschützten Wohnungsteilmärkten haben viele Haushalte Kaufkraftreserven. Wohnbauförderungsmittel sind auch dem Zweitwohnungsmarkt zugänglich. Die indirekte Förderung des Hauptwohnsitzes (geringe Wohnkostenbelastung vor allem bei den gemeinnützigen Wohnungsteilmärkten und im Althaussektor) und die Objektförderung der verschiedenen Zweitwohnsitzklassen (Zweithaus und Zweitwohnung) kann man als \"Subventionierung\" des Zweitwohnungswesens und damit als zentralen Erklärungsansatz für die Entwicklung des Wiener Zweitwohnsitzwesens ansehen.Das gewünschte Anspruchsniveau im Hinblick auf Wohn- und Wohnstandortqualität wird durch den Zweitwohnsitz realisiert. Viele Zweitwohnsitze sind daher besser ausgestattet (der Zweitwohnsitz als Ersthaus) als der städtische Wohnsitz, der bei Verlagerung des Hauptwohnsitzes ins Stadtumland nicht aufgegeben werden muß, sondern als \"Vorratswohnung\" für Kinder und Enkel gehalten wird. Diese Wohnungen werden dadurch dem Wohnungsmarkt \"entzogen\".Eine Liberalisierung der Wohnungspolitik würde für Wien große Auswirkungen haben: Viele Haushalte mit Zweitwohnsitz würden ihren Wiener Wohnsitz aufgeben und sich für ihren Zweitwohnsitz entscheiden, der häufig bereits als (späterer) Hauptwohnsitz konzipiert wurde.</jats:p>"

For this process to be\nsuccessful, the operations manager must participate assertively in the\nstrategy debate. In manufacturing it is important that the functional\nstrategy supports the corporate strategy in the marketplace and is\nco‐ordinated with other functional strategies. There is sufficient\nbuffering between the manufacturing system and the customer that\nfunctional strategies can be developed within corporate strategies and\nthen be co‐ordinated. In services, however, there are many issues where\nco‐ordination is not an adequate response. Virtually all strategic\nissues involving customer contact and front‐office operations must be\nthe result of joint decision making involving marketing, operations,\nfinance, and human resources. What little buffering there is occurs\nbetween the front office and the back room. This interface then becomes\nthe locus for interfunctional co‐ordination on strategic issues.\nConsequently, planning for the front‐office operation differs in many\nways from the manufacturing strategy development, while the back‐room\nstrategy differs little from the manufacturing strategy model. This\narticle outlines and contrasts the processes for both manufacturing and\nservices, paralleling the models of Wheelwright and Hayes and Hill. The\nobserved process differences have major implications for both teaching\nand research in service operations. The new and interesting issues are\npredominantly interfunctional and, given the intellectual backgrounds of\nthe various functional areas, interdisciplinary.</jats:p>",

Due in part to the use of forms of problem‐solving that are incongruent with tribal values and cultural patterns, many Indian communities have been paralyzed in their efforts to develop consensus on strategic plans. While many tribes have experimented with various forms of conflict management techniques, careful consideration must be given to the appropriateness of the approach employed Because the cultural traditions of Indian communities are rooted in a consensual approach to problem‐solving, dispute resolution approaches imposed by non‐Indian law and bureaucracies often conflict with tribal values. This paper reports the attempt of one tribe, the Winnebago in Nebraska, to introduce a system of planning and problem‐solving adequate for dealing with the needs of the tribal community in a culturally appropriate manner.</jats:p>",

In this paper, it is argued that educationists, in their desire to show that schools matter, have reinforced the arguments of the political Right, often unintentionally, and have neglected the effects of the social geography of catchments. On the basis of past and present research findings, it is argued that any adjustments to the indicators need to consider the effects of the local environment and perhaps parental choice itself, as well as prior attainment and social class. The impracticality of making such adjustments, the difficulty of establishing a standardised effect of local environments across the country, and the problems of disentangling school effects from those of social geography, cast great doubt on the use even of adjusted indicators as a meaningful basis for parental choice. These indicators, as one of the major mechanisms in the newly constructed education system by which schools will compete for pupils and resources, are thus seriously flawed. </jats:p>",

Thus, in the stochastic models several of the most persistent criticisms of the technique are addressed by allowing for testing of hypotheses, while preserving the practicality of the conventional accounting approach. It is suggested that stochastic shift—share should be used whenever practical. </jats:p>",

It is argued that this cultural focus is often absent from analyses of industrial change and the regeneration of localities. With a focus on two deindustrialised areas in Australia which have faced significant job loss in recent years, the local promotional texts are analysed to investigate how important the production of a revitalised image has been to the regeneration of these areas. The author looks at what elements in the texts drew on specifically local or national myths and culture and what elements drew on more universal symbolic discourses and realities, in particular dominant Western notions of masculinity. The concern was to see if the form of representation of the dominant discourses varied spatially or in the process of change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Criticism of major events is not unusual. This criticism is often based more on a consideration of costs than on a balanced evaluation of the costs and benefits which a major event may provide. Opinions on the economic desirability of a major event often appear to be based on personal and political convictions rather than on a careful appraisal of the economic merits of an event. Obviously economic factors should not be the sole determinant of any decision to host or support a major event but careful economic analysis of these events could provide useful information for public debate. Many people have speculated about the impact which the World Student Games, to be held in Sheffield in July 1991, will have on the city. Key issues concerning the costs and benefits for Sheffield arising from the £173.8 million expected to be spent on the games are presented in this paper. Figures provided by Sheffield City Council, supported by studies completed at Sheffield University, suggest the games will directly create approximately 1980 jobs; 1650 in constructing facilities for the games and approximately 329 in management and administration. In total it is estimated the games will provide 6580 jobs in Sheffield and 11070 jobs in the Yorkshire and Humberside region (the regional figure includes local job creation). Local (Sheffield) job-generation costs for the games are approximately £24780 per job. This compares favourably with job-creation costs of £28760 which have been estimated for other construction-oriented initiatives in the United Kingdom. It must be remembered that, although the World Student Games are a one-off major event, Sheffield residents will have some of the best sporting facilities in Europe when the games are over. The promotion of the facilities to host other major sporting events is already under way. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Presented here is a method of designing compensators for a single beam or one or more pairs of beams, not necessarily parallel opposed. The objective is to produce a flat distribution in a plane that may be perpendicular to the central ray or may be an arbitrarily oriented plane, for example, a plane that bisects the hinge angle between two beams. The method takes into account not only surface irregularities but also tissue inhomogeneities, hinge angles between beams, distance from the source, and even “horns” in the beam. The design process employs convolution of Monte Carlo generated pencil beams with photon fluence distributions, appropriately modified for the presence of beam modifiers (blocks and compensators), to compute dose in a flat homogeneous phantom. Corrections for inhomogeneities and surface curvature are applied by using computerized tomography information to determine the effective path length through tissue. Multiple interations are used to arrive at a compensator that properly incorporates changes in radiation transport, and therefore dose distribution, resulting from the presence of beam‐shaping devices. In each iteration it is assumed that the required reduction in dose at a point can be achieved by reducing the fluence along the ray joining the source to computation point proportionately. The compensator design is represented as a finely spaced matrix of thickness values which is entered into a prorammable milling maching for fabrication. Dose measurements in phantom exposed to 6‐MV x rays with and without compensation are presented.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the statistical problem of differential skewness of the component variables plagues the construction of UPA scores and alternative indexes. In particular, this skewness distorts GPs' explicit weightings of the constituent variables of the UPA index. It is argued that the Department's current, stepped payment system requires a degree of precision and accuracy in measuring deprivation which is at odds with the quality both of the data and of the UPA index used. Furthermore, if the UPA index was replaced by the Townsend index, a substantial geographic redistribution of payments would occur, particularly benefiting Merseyside, the North East, and Humberside. It is recommended that the Department of Health adopt a tapered payment system consistent with the continuous gradation of area deprivation scores. An illustration of a scheme involving no additional public expenditure is given. Such a scheme may be more politically acceptable to the government if the payments to GPs are more accurately labelled ‘workload payments’. </jats:p>",

A conscientious design requires thorough efforts in organizing the planning process, conducting the decision analysis, and obtaining approvalfor a program. Weak methods and processes in the management of these efforts can result in faulty assumptions and costly errors in the development of new health care ventures, thus preventing the achievement of financial and operating goals. This article reviews the stages of business planning, and the points at which success may be impaired. </jats:p>",

The impact of this multivariate relationship on organizational effectiveness is then examined using a sample of 115 large manufacturing firms. The findings show general support for the proposition that, in order to be effective, a strategic planning system should be designed in such a way that the specific situational setting of the firm is reflected in the design. The analysis also indicates that firms adopt a more flexible planning system ‐ captured here by two key variables, planning horizon, and frequency of plan reviews ‐ as the level of environmental complexity increases. Implications for future research are discussed.</jats:p>",

The overall level of subsidy is shown to have fallen through time and the greatest relative subsidies are given to households with the smallest taxable income. The effect of the income elasticity of demand for housing on subsidy levels is considered and an estimate of the income elasticity of demand is produced for the Newcastle TTWA.

Most initiatives have fallen into one of three categories: Those designed to improve coordination; innovations in liberalisation; and urban development programmes. These initiatives can collectively be evaluated within a number of parameters. Central government has argued that urban policy is a coordinated, adequate, efficient, and consensual approach to difficulties faced by the older conurbations. Evidence from Parliament, academics, practitioners, and lobbyists suggests, however, that it remains an ill-coordinated, limited, inefficient, and sectorally divisive policy. Other interpretations rooted in concepts such as privatisation and accentuated control have greater validity in explaining British urban policy. </jats:p>",

It is implicitly and explicitly argued that the mutual exclusivity of corporatism and pluralism, widely taken for granted in the literature, is more apparent than real.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The disturbances in the global economy induced by the US trade and budget deficits are widely recognised by economists, even if the precise causes and effects of these deficits remain a topic of debate, What is less widely understood is that the deficits are pregnant with geographical implications for the world economy and that the production of the deficits can be explained in part by the changing and asymmetrical location of the USA in international economic and geopolitical relations. In this paper, both of these points are expanded. In section 2, competing accounts of the production of the US trade and budget deficits are considered. Particular attention is paid to ‘Reaganomics’ as an economic and geopolitical discourse. In section 3, the implications of the twin deficits for the US space-economy are considered. The regional impacts of increased military (and other) spending under Reagan are noted, as are the likely effects of the alienation of US real assets and of the buildup of debt-servicing obligations for future generations. In section 4, the implications of the US deficits for the rest of the world, and for the less developed countries in particular, are examined. Attention is drawn to the emerging links between the geography of international trade and the geography of international debt. The regional implications of a debtors' surplus are discussed in section 5, which serves also as a conclusion. </jats:p>",

The data were derived from a questionnaire-based survey of selected branch-plant managers in eight southern states. The findings suggest that labor factors have been important to the location of branch plants, and that the product-cycle explanation has merit; however, the findings also suggest that the locational behavior of these plants has been a response to conditions not clearly embraced by the product-cycle conceptualization, leading to the conclusion that a more comprehensive model is required to explain industrial location in the rural South.</jats:p>",

In this paper it is argued that Pinch's approach was too simplistic, because he did not differentiate between private and public services, took little account of other determinants of service change, and too readily grasped the influence of the new left as a determining factor. In this paper service change from 1977 to 1988 is assessed and it is found that, although there were political party effects on provision levels and provision change, these were reflected in different responses to local socioeconomic conditions. Provision in Conservative councils was notably affected by local wealth differences, whereas services in Labour areas appeared to be more responsive to female employment and local occupational structures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past decade, the city of Cambridge has been used increasingly by academics and the media as an exemplar of the role that entrepreneurial high-technology development can play in local and national economic growth. Politically, this symbolism has found a ready resonance with the Thatcher government's vision of the ‘new Britain’. In this paper the reality and rhetoric behind this use of Cambridge is critically examined. First, the politics and polemics of locality under Thatcherism are highlighted. Second, the dominant account of the much-celebrated ‘Cambridge phenomenon’ is outlined to reveal its ideological leitmotivs of entrepreneurship, high-technology, postindustrialism, the small firm, and the union of academic science and business. Third, it is shown how these rhetorical constructions of a ‘boomtown’ locality are in reality weakened by a number of tensions within the ‘phenomenon’ itself. Moreover, it is then shown that there are important silences in the dominant view of Cambridge, certain ‘other sides’ to the city that portray a rather different set of meanings, both about Cambridge as a success story and about high-technology development as the basis of economic prosperity. These other sides of Cambridge provide a much more complex and, in some important respects, a very different expression of the socioeconomic renewal championed by Thatcherism. </jats:p>",

By changing a demand-oriented approach to a more supply-oriented one, labour exchanges can raise their placement results by almost 40%. If all labour exchanges adopted a more supply-oriented approach, the average placement percentage would increase by about 10%.
