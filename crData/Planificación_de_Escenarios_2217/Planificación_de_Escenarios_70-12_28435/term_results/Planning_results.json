      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper discusses methodological issues that arise when national planning is attempted which is regionalised and integrated with the traditional forms of physical and community development planning at the regional level. Distinctions are made between control and operational decisions and between analytical target planning and institutional planning. Decisions are furthermore classified according to levels in the decision-making hierarchy, and according to their sectoral and spatial dimensions, resulting in a multi-level, multi-sectoral, and multi-regional system of decision-making and planning activities. The key problem arising is that of distributing decision-making authority among the decision units and superimposing a planning and information exchange system that not only guarantees consistency, but also ensures efficiency in inter-sectoral growth patterns as well as with respect to location of project and utilisation of regional resources and external economies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two features of population planning are of special interest to operations researchers: the important interaction among family planning, health, and economic development, and the substantial but varying impact of social, cultural, political, and economic factors—features that require a multi-disciplinary, flexible approach for which operations research is well suited. In spite of the vast differences among various international settings, three overriding principles should be borne in mind. First, programs of population planning are designed to serve national goals, whereas the ultimate actions concerning family limitation are usually recognized to be private family decisions. Second, one usually faces a rather ill-defined interplay among a great variety of factors. Third, the universal importance of the population problem in developing countries is always coupled with severe limitations of resources to cope with the problem. This paper deals initially with the family decision process and then with the organization of professional activities toward population control. In both cases hypothetical models are developed, information from the field is used to illustrate their significance, and suggestions for further research are offered. The decision model considers the utility of child-bearing for different population groups compared with the subjective valuation these groups give to contraception. Means of measuring these poorly defined values are proposed. In assessing the role of operations research in the organization and delivery of family planning services, the paper directs attention to the allocation problem, which includes concern, on the one hand, for the methods of contraception provided, the manner in which they are offered, and the kinds of personnel employed, and, on the other hand, the attitudes of target populations toward both the services and the providers. </jats:p>",

However, the consideration of various viewpoints does not necessarily make them compatible. A plan once formulated favors a particular point of view over others. The local point of view generally carries more weight than the national point of view because: (1) more projects can be justified on the basis of their net value to local interests rather than the public at large, and (2) the local economic effects of a project are more readily identifiable and more easily analyzed than are the net national effects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of factorial ecology in the analysis of residential differentiation is illustrated by data on the four main urban areas in New Zealand and by some historical data on Auckland. The article concludes by examining some of the implications of factorial ecology for urban theory. </jats:p><jats:p> Recent community analyses have indicated a renewed interest in one of the chief concerns of the early human ecologists: the effects and implications of residential differentiation and segregation. A notable aspect of the trend has been the application of factor-analytic methods to data generated for urban sub-communities<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup>. Analyses of census tract or enumeration district data in several North American, Scandinavian, and Australasian cities have shown that much of the detailed variation in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the urban population may be expressed in terms of a small number of underlying factors relating to social rank, style of life or family type and, in ethnically heterogeneous populations, ethnic composition. Beshers (1962) suggests that the axes of differentiation are so clear that virtually any form of analysis will reveal their existence. Within the general pattern, however, it may be anticipated that local and regional differences in socio-cultural, economic, and political circumstances will result in variations in ecological structure. An attempt to delineate these variations is essential if the goal of developing a genuinely cross-cultural model of urban society is to be attained. It is in the pursuit of this end that the procedures of factorial ecology promise most. According to Sweetser (1965, p.219): “Modern factor analysis, using factor structure as a model for ecological structure, is the method par excellence for comparing cross-nationally (and intranationally) the ecological differentiation of residential areas in urban and metropolitan communities”. In the present example data from New Zealand is used to examine the usefulness of the factorial ecology approach for comparative studies at both the inter-city and the temporal levels. </jats:p>",

It is shown that a model of individual urban contact fields described in an earlier paper (Moore, 1970) provides interesting insights into the spatial characteristics of the empirical contact fields. The model is briefly presented, its aggregate form is derived, and the data are then examined with reference to the aggregate-level model. </jats:p><jats:p> Analysis of person-to-person contacts may be regarded as the first step towards identification of spatial regularities in information flows<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup>. Most studies of contact fields have been quite restrictive in their spatial representation, having adopted distance-decay functions as the prime means of description (Hägerstrand, 1957; Marble and Nystuen, 1963; Morrill and Pitts, 1967; Marble and Bowlby, 1968). If the distribution of opportunities for contact is neither uniform nor possesses a symmetrical decline in frequency with increasing distance from the respondent, fitting distance-decay functions to observed contacts tends to hide interesting spatial properties of contact fields. This paper is concerned, therefore, with examining the validity and implications of the aggregated form of a model of individual urban contact fields in an empirical situation. </jats:p>",
