      "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can    efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal    interactions.  This evidence has led to the common belief that    delayed-commitment is the \"best\" possible planning strategy.  However,    we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a    variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those    with difficult operator choices.  Resigned to the futility of trying    to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a    planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best    for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new    planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy    with respect to plan-step orderings.  It is able to use any strategy    from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment.  The combination of    delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take    advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution    state and reasoning about planning constraints.  FLECS can vary its    commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also    during the course of a single planning problem.  FLECS represents a    novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the    choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning.  FLECS    provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains    and problems to efficient planning strategies.</jats:p>"

It stresses the importance of defining the problem and creating policies and programs directed at particular types and levels of the problem. First, however, it summarizes strategies used during recent decades for dealing with delinquent groups and gangs, particularly at the community level. To a large extent, what is past is prologue. There are both continuity and change in the policies and practices that show promise in dealing with gang issues. The challenge is to create a new paradigm of action that modifies past approaches to make them relevant to current and evolving situations. I describe five strategies for dealing with gang problems in different community contexts. The discussion of planning focuses on definitions of the gang incident, assessment of com munity problems and resources, development of appropriate strategies and inter organizational structures, targeting of different gangs and gang youths, and setting of priorities.</jats:p>",

A computer program is built to get the membership functions between the colors and image words. the membership functions are arranged by size and suggested to the designer to help make a decision on what color should be used. In this manner, the psychology of customers can easily be captured by the designer, consequently increasing the efficiency of the decision process. Though a simple product is taken as an example here, this systematic method can be used to design other more complicated products. In addition, the results can be used to investigate the color psychology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a case study on the role of complex computer simulation models in the regulation of the electricity industry. The analysis focuses on electricity production cost simulation models as they are used to set prices for certain nonutility generators in California. This represents an early part of the trend toward “markets” for electric power, and away from pure monopoly supply. The introduction of even limited competition creates conditions both favoring and hindering the reliability of cost estimates, and demonstrates the sensitivity of results to problem specification and model implementation. Attention is focused on the representation of power system operational constraints, particularly the unit commitment problem, in the modeling process and their effect on the prices which result. Examples from the litigation history illustrate the problem of managing the strategic use and abuse of modeling techniques for competitive advantage. Highly structured procedures for using models in such situations offer some constraints on manipulation by competing parties. Otherwise, experts are apt to overwhelm regulators. </jats:p>",

Most companies' planning processes fall into one of seven patterns: top down, elite group, team development, committee, staff review, external provision, and inherited. Less than one-third of the plans were written and barely one in five was reviewed annually. Decision making during a disaster tends to be incremental-as the situation appears to worsen, more decisions are made, many of them unanticipated. A few executives had engaged in local emergency-preparedness programs. The best way to meet disaster is by planning appropriate actions, resisting denial, having a single person in charge, improving employee and customer communication, anticipating the needs of special populations, and recognizing family priorities, as well as structuring media relations. </jats:p>",

Use of algebraic results by Koerts and Abrahamse and theoretical results by Imhof, allows the authors to determine by numerical integration the exact distribution function of Moran's I for normally distributed variables. For the case in which the explanatory variables have been neglected, an upper and a lower bound can be given within which the exact distribution of Moran's I for regression residuals will lie. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is flexible enough to investigate related topics such as the characteristics of the exact distribution for distinct spatial structures as well as their different specifications, the exact power function under different spatial autocorrelation levels, and the distribution of Moran's I for nonnormal random variables. </jats:p>",

How might it open up the possibility of anticapitalist and noncapitalist economic interventions?

Using the Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive model as a base, a cognitive instruction which facilitated planning was provided to two students with low scores on planning, obtained using an experimental version of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System, and two students with average planning scores. All students completed three sessions of baseline and seven sessions of cognitive instruction in addition and multiplication. During the cognitive instruction phase, 5-min. sessions of self-reflection and verbalization of strategies about the mathematics problems were conducted after each initial 10-min. session of mathematics. Scores on addition problems showed that all students improved. On multiplication, however, 2 students with low planning scores improved considerably but not 2 with higher planning scores.

Almost invariably, that analysis has focused on the manifestations and interactions of rebellion, violent conflict, and social disadvantage. In this paper, however, elements of stability and less dramatic activity, as well as themes of change and anxiety within adolescence, are emphasised. The experience of dilemma within adolescence is shown to accommodate a plurality of influences and expressions beyond the relatively narrow experiences of violence and aggression. In order to examine these nuances of adolescent dilemmas, I will pursue a critical discourse analysis of data drawn from an extended programme of indigenous ethnography. The central theme of this analysis will consider the ways in which dilemmas within individual religious experience can inform, and remain informed by, the landscape and place interpretations of ten adolescents living in a Suffolk Parish. These interpretations include references to Christian ecumenical festivals. Consequently, this paper may be of interest to social and cultural geographers, particularly those interested in religio-geographical problems, as well as religious leaders and their lay assistants who arc involved in the instigation and organisation of festivals and similar religious events attended by adolescent people. </jats:p>",

The World-of-Work Map (Prediger, 1976), an extension of Holland's hexagon (Holland, Whitney, Cole, &amp; Richards, 1969), provides the basis for linking UNIACT results and results from 12 other, widely used interest inventories to occupational options and to results from assessments of work-relevant experiences, work-relevant abilities, and job values. A case study illustrates the interpretation of Holland-type interests in the context of experiences, abilities, job values, and current occupational choice. Guidelines followed in the development of UNIACT's interpretation procedure are explained, and issues related to interest inventory response style and sex fairness are addressed. UNIACT's validity data, which include three-letter (Holland) codes for 648 career groups and results from studies supporting the hexagon's Data/Ideas and Things/People Work Task Dimensions, are summarized. </jats:p>",

In this method, both classes of fuzziness and the statistical trend of risk for each uncertain factor can be integrated into the risk of each uncertain factor, and then the risks of each uncertain factor with respect to all the objectives can be aggregated by extension principle in fuzzy sets theory. In the second phase based on the linguistic approximation technique, the aggregated risk of each uncertain factor can be represented by natural language.

It is argued that traditional normative approaches to the study of deprivation and poverty need to be supplemented by an understanding of varying social and cultural constructions of reality, community, living standards, and welfare. The importance of such social and cultural constructs is illustrated in a discussion of the discursive transformation of previous codes, symbols, and concepts of welfare and poverty during the Thatcher and Reagan eras in Britain and the USA, respectively. In a series of contested transformations, the relationship between individual, society, and state in the provision and receipt of welfare has been redefined. Moreover, it is suggested that there are important spatial differences between the urban and the rural within this discursive context, with the urban construction of ‘underclass’ contrasting with rural constructions of ‘idyll’, the latter suggesting codes and symbols of self-help which negate the need for state intervention in welfare. </jats:p>",

Based on an indepth analyses of field data, a series of short and long term remedial measures were worked out to cope with the immediate and the future travel demands.

The complexity of Bhabha's writing might be seen as symptomatic of the critically ineffectual obsession with textuality that many geographers have recently criticised. However, I argue that there are a number of reasons for Bhabha's convoluted textual style. I suggest that he is performing a subject position symptomatic of the contradictions of post/colonial discourse, contradictions he is also at the same time analysing. This performance has implications for geographers' current discussions of situated knowledge and self-reflection. It also has implications for the thcorisation of space, because Bhabha argues that the politics of subjectivity arc also the politics of spatiality.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the urban process in the face of China's transition to a market economy is examined from the perspective of political economy. Before economic reform, China operated a centrally planned economy. Production activities were organized on the basis of sectoral departments of the central government, and the reproduction of labour was carried out through self-contained development. The dominance of the state stemmed from its role in resource allocation. Economic reform, launched in 1978, introduced market mechanisms to urban processes in China. Through fiscal, housing, and land reforms decisionmaking was decentralized. Under so-called ‘comprehensive development’, municipalities are now required to organize urban development. The state has lost its dominant status in budgetary investment. Self-raised, extrabudgetary funds increased rapidly. Work units still extract surplus value efficiently but have had to become the major purchasers in housing markets because workers in the public sector cannot afford housing. The persistence of state ownership in the mode of production makes it unlikely that market forces will play a leading role in urban development in China. </jats:p>",

Although including these variables in scientific analyses for recovery planning may be important, there is little agreement on how to integrate the relevant disciplines. The dilemma associated with interdisciplinary collaboration is that, while a diversity of values and perspectives is unavoidable, this diversity stands as a barrier to agreement on an integrative research approach. We describe a general framework for interdisciplinary analysis designed to support recovery planning that does not rely on choosing a single interdisciplinary approach. Rather, it uses value conflicts potentially arising in an interdisciplinary setting to select a diverse set of scientific approaches relevant to a particular conservation effort. We apply this framework to recovery planning for threatened Snake River chinook salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</jats:italic>) and examine the implications of conflicts over the acceptability of institutional change, technological solutions, and transferability of recovery effort across groups responsible for the current status of the species.</jats:p>",

The emerging electric vehicle industry represents a possible new growth pole for the region, and a number of private and public initiatives have already been taken to encourage the development of the industry in the local area. I argue that policy can significantly enhance this development process by focussing on specifically regional sources of industrial productivity, innovativeness, and competitive advantage. I argue also that the existing industrial assets of Southern California, combined with policy of this sort, could indeed foster the growth of a major cluster of electric vehicle and parts producers in the region. To be successful, policy needs to be concentrated in particular on fostering flexible and collaborative manufacturing systems together with various services (for example, in the areas of technological research, labor training, venture capital provision, and so on) that enhance the region's overall stock of external economies. I conclude by suggesting that there are significant parallels between the growth of the aircraft industry in Southern California before World War 2, and the development of the electric vehicle industry in the region today. </jats:p>",

Using base‐stock control and assuming total reliability for internal supplies, I present a procedure for integrated multilevel safety stock optimization that can be applied to arbitrary serial and divergent systems even when demand is jointly cross‐product and cross‐time correlated. As I demonstrate in an example for autocorrelated demands of a moving average type, there are specific solution properties that drastically reduce the computational effort for safety stock planning. Safety stocks determined in that way can be used as an appropriate protection against demand uncertainties in material requirements planning systems. </jats:p>",

While city-financed consultants have enabled citizen advisory groups to monitor environmental review and project design and to secure environmental improvements to proposed facilities, they have not helped to promote citizen acceptance of the technologies or their locations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Unlike research in the Anglophone West Indies, research in the French West Indies has only very recently developed the idea of the existence of a peasant social group in the plantation societies of Guadeloupe and Martinique. The fragility and instability of the collective identity in the French West Indies has served as a principal argument to support the view that the group is not a peasantry but a mere by-product of the plantation system. The idea of the absence of a real process of taking control of space or of a sort of intimate history with space occurs in some writings to explain this weakness of collective sense. Far from refuting the argument which firmly links the identity question to that of space, I shall reinforce it but in order to show that, on the contrary, there arc good grounds for affirming the existence, in the case of the peasant group in Martinique, of an original social experience in which space is strongly mobilised. In doing this, my intention is also to add weight to a theoretical point of view which shows the strength of the ties between space and identity, given that the peasant world in Martinique provides a paradigmatic example of the undeniable power of these ties. </jats:p>",

Focusing on the evaluation phase of the discharge planning process, this study examined whether the evaluation time spent by hospital discharge planners and floor nurses could be reduced by replacing the customary telephone procedure with an electronic transmission procedure (a) to expand the information base communicated to nursing homes and (b) to send this enriched information earlier in the discharge process. Using a quasi-experimental design, 31 discharges from a midwestern hospital to seven nursing homes were examined. Sixteen hospitalized nursing home residents were evaluated via the usual telephone procedure and 15 were evaluated using a facsimile machine to communicate medical and psychosocial information. The average time spent to complete discharge evaluations was reduced from 3.8 to 3.2 hours. A substantial reduction also occurred in the number of telephone calls for purposes of evaluation. Electronic transmission of patient information offers promise of more comprehensive and timely discharge services, particularly for high needs patients. </jats:p>",

The end of the Cold War has meant significant reductions in defense investment and the downsizing of the region's aerospace-electronics industrial complex. Although the region is technology rich, it lacks the institutional support and corporate know-how necessary to develop new markets, new industrial relations, and new production systems. To remedy these failings, a rare mix of institution building and policy initiatives is tending to cohere around advanced-ground-transportation technologies and in particular the development of an electric vehicle industry. In this paper we examine federal, state, and local policy efforts to develop an electric vehicle industrial complex in Southern California. </jats:p>",

The literature argues that the existence of lower tiers depends on their ability at being better informed than the centre on local preferences and suggests that central government should exercise its control mainly through the grant allocated to each tier. However, setting up an efficient system requires the knowledge of nonobservable local parameters, and this creates an asymmetry-of-information problem that the literature on grants-in-aid has not recognized so far. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. An optimal grant system that central government could use to reach an efficient allocation of resources within an intertemporal model characterized by asymmetry of information is described. The optimal grant formula is set in a dynamic framework by using an approach taken by Harris and Townsend in 1981. The formula obtained is very general and can be applied to many other situations involving delegated choices. </jats:p>",

The composition of the homeless population has changed markedly in this period, and now includes more women and children, and more of the deinstitutionalised mentally ill. The lives of street kids in the city of Newcastle, Australia show patterns of structured behaviour and territorial and social organisation. They have a distinctive group identity and moral order. Their subculture is complex with strains of nonpatriarchal and patriarchal relations combined with little tolerance of forms of difference. The moral code of the youth subculture may be a form of resistance to their histories of abuse but is also conservative in reproducing aspects of the culture that they resist. The social networks generated on the street provide a self-maintaining force which contributes to a culture of chronic homelessness. </jats:p>",

These sectors also provide a legacy of industrial organization that is oriented more towards flexible production than mass production. The technological immaturity of the EV and the uncertain market it faces, combined with the existing industrial atmosphere in Southern California, suggest that early production of EVs will be organized flexibly in an industrial district uniting firms and technologies in the production of components for an advanced ground-transportation industry. </jats:p>",

The courses of these political and economic transformations largely depended upon the ability of the emerging regimes to create legitimacy. In particular, those regimes which suffered from greater political divisiveness and significant economic problems were more likely to be confronted with a crisis of legitimacy. In this paper, the legitimation crisis theory is examined for post-communist Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is found that the developments in Czechoslovakia and Hungary during this early transition period support the hypothesis, and, in addition, they hold implications for the survival of other transitional regimes as well as those in the West which have increasingly been confronted with questions of legitimacy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1988 Housing Act signalled substantial changes in the provision of social housing in England. The act places housing associations at the centre of social housing provision. Moreover, their role as the main providers of social housing depends, in line with government intentions, on the greater use of private finance, as the proportion of public sector funds declines. The introduction of what amounts to a new regime for social housing provision in England has effectively changed the agenda of provision from one informed by public sector thinking to one established around private sector criteria. Housing associations have thus had to readjust quickly to an environment in which they are now exposed to a variety of interrelated risks. In order to manage such risks, associations have had to reorganise internally and to reevaluate their priorities. Against this background, this paper is aimed, first, at reporting on how a selection of case-study associations active across the main regions of England have faced up to the challenges that the new environment presents, and, second, at presenting the views of a selection of private sector financial institutions about their perceptions of social housing as an investment medium, the types of risk they view as characteristic of this sector, and their response to the efforts made by associations to manage the risks of social housing provision. The paper is concluded by setting out the likely shape that social housing provision will take in the immediate future. </jats:p>",

A survey of practising waste management professionals has indicated a general interest in mathematical modelling techniques to assist with decision-making, but there is a lack of practical applications of these techniques, particularly within the local and regional waste management agencies that are responsible for planning and implementing waste reduction and recycling measures. A prototype decision support system has been developed to assist with the preliminary planning of municipal solid waste composting and recycling programs and processing facilities. This prototype planning tool combines knowledge-based system components with spreadsheet models to assist with waste forecasting, technology evaluation, composting and recycling program design, and preliminary processing facility planning. The system was designed for use by local and regional solid waste management engineers and planners, and waste recycling coordinators. The prototype decision support system is considered to represent a reasonable, useful, and practical (with respect to data requirements and cost) planning tool. The knowledge bases, created for the prototype decision support system, represent the collection and organization of a significant amount of currently available expertise regarding composting and recycling program planning issues.

In this paper, the background to the new regime is discussed, noting the absence of a consumer perspective on performance indicators in much of the research literature. There is an examination of the appropriateness of the concepts of client, customer, consumer, and citizen as descriptions of tenants. The reaction of tenants in England and Wales to the first year of RTTs is then discussed. The impact on tenants was minimal, and consumers did not use the information in the reports in the way central government might have hoped. The value to tenants of the growing number of RTTs regimes is questioned. The paper concludes with a criticism of the concept of tenants as consumers in the context of RTTs regimes, and points to the inherent conflicts within these regimes. </jats:p>",

The aggregate planning process must enable the strategic business objectives of a manufacturing organization to be quickly converted into short-term operational plans that are economical to implement. This link between strategy and the day-to-day activities of an organization is becoming increasingly important in enabling organizations to cope with the faster rate at which business objectives must be changed in order to remain competitive. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper initially examines the aggregate planning process and describes the basic tasks involved.

This is a collaborative effort that involves international and indigenous non-governmental organizations and the government of Bangladesh, and is coordinated by Helen Keller International and funded by the US Agency for International Development. During the past three years the NSP has demonstrated an ability to provide regular and dependable information on the prevalence of undernutrition and morbidity in children under five years of age, household socioeconomic characteristics, food prices, and the extent of distress at household and community levels from data collected every two months by NGOs and the government in selected rural districts and urban slums in all regions of the country. </jats:p><jats:p> The system was established as a bottom-up surveillance system based on NGO-specific teams with a continuous central quality control system to ensure the collection of reliable data. The NSP has proved to be an excellent tool for policy makers from several sectors, involving health, agriculture, and food aid The NGOs use it for the continuous monitoring of their development programmes and to identify mechanisms through which services can be delivered most effectively. Regional-level analyses evaluated the impact of the universal vitamin A capsule distribution programme. After the cyclone of 1991, the NSP demonstrated its flexibility by expanding rapidly to cover affected districts and provide pertinent information to those involved in relief efforts. Most recently, the NSP has provided information on the role of food prices on nutrition status and assisted the Ministry of Food in its decision-making. The model is worthy of consideration for replication in other countries in the world. </jats:p>",

Planning for design quality should be based on sound analysis because of the serious effects on the firm's profitability. The decision about design quality is also interlinked with that about price. In this paper, we develop a control theoretic model that can effectively support the strategic planning process for design quality and price. The idea behind the optimal control formulation is to use the design quality level and the price as the control variables to maximize the discounted net present value of the total profit over the life of the product. Managerial insights through analytical results are obtained on the form of the optimal design quality and pricing policies. An extensive set of numerical experiments helped us to gain useful insights on the effects of various model parameters on the optimal policies.</jats:p>",

Of those who knew about the topic, we asked if the respondent had discussed it with a physician, who initiated the conversation, and if the respondent participated in the activity. We also asked how important the topic was to the respondent.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: We received 598 completed surveys, a response rate of 83%. Respondents had a mean age of 74 years, were predominately white (96%), and were well educated, with 44% having completed college. The respondents were all knowledgeable about the topics, and, with the exception of sigmoidoscopy, organ donation, and autopsy, more than 70% thought these topics were important. In the case of health screening and prevention activities, a large percentage of respondents reported having discussed the topic with a physician, and a slightly smaller percentage reported regular participation. In the case of health care proxies and advance directives, however, only about one‐half of those who had made these arrangements said they had discussed them with a physician. When discussion did occur, it was much more likely to have been initiated by the respondent. Controlling for level of education, age was inversely associated with the likelihood of a woman reporting she had undergone mammography (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; .05). Age, however, was not associated with decreased frequency of undergoing other screening tests.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS</jats:bold>: Among a group of well educated older adults, reported interest in and compliance with health screening, health promotion, and advance planning activities were high. However, sigmoidoscopy, a relatively more invasive procedure that is generally recommended as a screening tool, is reported less likely to be practiced than prostate cancer screening, a less invasive procedure without such recommendation. Older adults state they are pursuing health care proxies and advance directives, often without the involvement of their physicians. Of the screening tests about which we asked, age was associated only with less frequent practice of mammography.</jats:p>",

We show that under reasonable assumptions, the strategic level management can base the capacity decision on aggregated information from the shopfloor, and the operational level management, given this decision, can derive a production plan for the system, without too large a loss in optimality when compared to simultaneous determination of optimal capacity and production decisions.</jats:p><jats:p>The results are obtained via an asymptotic analysis of hierarchical investment and production decisions in a manufacturing system with machines subject to breakdown and repair. The demand facing the system is assumed to be a deterministic monotone increasing function. The production capacity can be increased by purchasing a finite number of new machines over time. The control variables are a sequence of purchasing times and a production plan. The rate of change in machine states is assumed to be much larger than the rate of discounting of costs. This gives rise to a limiting problem in which the stochastic machine availability is replaced by the equilibrium mean availability. The value function for the original problem converges to the value function of the limiting problem. Three different methods are developed for constructing decisions for the original problem from the optimal solution of the limiting problem in a way which guarantees the asymptotic optimality of constructed decisions. Finally, it is shown that as the number of machine that could be purchased tends to infinity, the problem approximates the corresponding problem with no limit on number of machine purchases.</jats:p>",
