A detailed account in the Jesuit Archives now allows a more exact chronology and shows how the design evolved over a fourteen-year period, 1658-1672. The church, which is often compared to a jewelbox, is used as the starting point for a discussion of various attitudes to wealth on the part of baroque architects and patrons. The issue of Bernini's classicism as an architect is discussed with reference to his use of geometry and his development as a designer of church façades. The famous rivalry between Bernini and Borromini is seen as a result of fundamental differences of principle, though some examples are presented from the late 17th and early 18th centuries which show attempts to reconcile the styles and approaches of the two unfriendly geniuses.</jats:p>",

We interpret this decomposition in the context of Hax and Meal's hierarchical framework for production planning. The procedure decomposes the production planning problem into two subproblems which correspond to the aggregate planning subproblem and a disaggregation subproblem in the Hax-Meal framework. The linking mechanism for these two subproblems is an inventory consistency relationship which is priced out by a set of Lagrange multipliers. The best values for the multipliers are found by an iterative procedure which may be interpreted as a feedback mechanism in the Hax-Meal framework. At each iteration, the procedure finds both a lower bound on the optimal value to the production planning problem and a feasible solution from which an upper bound is obtained. Our computational tests show that the best feasible solution found from this procedure is very close to optimal. For thirty-six test problems the percentage deviation from optimality never exceeds 4.4%, and the average percentage deviation is 2.2%. In addition, these best feasible solutions dominate the corresponding solutions obtained by a hierarchical procedure. </jats:p>",

Considerable research has been done on this planning problem and various planning models have been introduced. In those cases where linearity of the cost functions of an undertaking may reasonably be assumed, an ordinary linear programming model suffices. In many cases, however, this simple linear approach to certain essentially non-linear cost functions is unacceptable owing to the gross approximation made.Separable programming (SEP) is introduced as a solution methodology to this aggregate production planning problem in a complex, high-order cost structure case. The cost structure was used by Goodman for the application of goal programming (GP) in this field. The Goodman GP model makes provision for positive or negative slack for the production level, work-force level and inventory level with penalty costs for these slack-deviations. Goodman also made use of a 'sectioning search' model for this high-order cost case to serve as a measure for his GP model. A comparison is made between the results of these three approaches. SEP offered an improvement of more than 4% in total cost in comparison with the sectioning search model, and performs 26% better than the GP model.</jats:p>"

A framework for exploring the problem is outlined in this paper, and will be applied to one-dimensional and two-dimensional spatial interaction models in the subsequent papers. Appropriate statistics for measuring changes in spatial variation due to spatial aggregation in data sets and in model predictions of spatial interaction are derived by use of information theory; and these statistics, such as spatial entropy, have excellent decomposition properties which can be readily exploited in the study of aggregation effects in data and models. These properties involve information components associated with density, level of detail or average zone size, dimension, and level of resolution. Use of the spatial entropy function, in particular, enables consistent relationships to be developed between information components and model parameters, and these relationships are examined in detail in subsequent papers. </jats:p>",

The proper use of CAI may lead to changes in the classroom teaching as the possible applications of the computer technology are more completely realized.

Though British policy towards other dependencies was rarely co-ordinated — even so far as concerned a region like “Further India” — it was influenced by their relationship with India. India in a sense defined the limits of those policies: they must not go so far as to undermine the British position in India by untoward example; nor, on the other hand, must they make so little advance as to alienate the Indians and inhibit the availability of Indian forces. For Burma the inter-relationship was particularly close. Burma had been acquired from India, partly in order to protect British commerce based in India, but mainly to provide for the security of British India. It had been administered from India. Indian commerce, Indian labour, Indian moneylending had as a result established new ties. But India also influenced the reshaping of the constitutional as well as the administrative structure. Working both within and outside those structures, Burman nationalism was itself influenced by developments in India, though directing its criticism at Indian, even more, perhaps, than at British economic exploitation. The Burman nationalists insisted that the constitutional advance of Burma must at least keep pace with that of India.</jats:p>",

The reason for this overestimate is the neglect of the loss of electrons which are scattered into highly oblique paths and removed from the beam at relatively shallow depths. A modification of Eyges’ solution to Fermi's equation is presented to take this loss of electrons into account. Equations for the calculation of isodose distributions for any medium using pencil beams are developed. Experimental confirmation is presented for electron beams of 13 and 18 MeV in homogeneous water, polystyrene, Lucite, and aluminum phantoms.</jats:p>",

The performance of the scanner has been evaluated by imaging a variety of phantoms and an anaesthetised rabbit. The relationship between the measured linear attenuation coefficient and the known electron density was found to be linear, for a range of materials with densities between those of bone and air. For reconstructed pixels of size 5×5 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> the percentage standard deviation of linear attenuation coefficient is typically 2.4% for bone and 3.6% for muscle. The spatial resolution of the device was measured and the performance of the scanner with the maximum design source strength was predicted. In the reconstruction of a cross section of the rabbit and of a human thorax phantom, air–muscle, lung–muscle, and muscle–bone interfaces are clearly visible. From experience gained with this scanner the role of simple CT scanning devices in radiotherapy treatment planning is considered. The resolution in linear attenuation coefficient and the spatial resolution available from the scanner are considered sufficient for radiotherapy treatment planning.</jats:p>",

A point-sampling technique is used to provide answers to this question for one city, Leeds, during the period 1957–1976. The approach is through the basic questions “how much change was there?”, “where did the land for change come from?”, “who caused the change?”, and “how was it effected?”. Reuse of land already in urban use, or lying unused, is seen to be a far more important contributor to change than is extension by development on agricultural land, and the contribution of unused land in particular to the dynamic aspects of urban change is found to be both complex and important. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public-sector planning problems are typically complex, and some important planning issues cannot be captured within a mathematical programming model of a problem; such issues may be qualitative in nature, unknown, or unrevealed by decisionmakers. Furthermore, there are often numerous solutions to a mathematical formulation that are nearly the same with respect to modeled issues but that are drastically different from each other in decision space. In such cases, some of these solutions may be significantly better than others with respect to unmodeled issues. Thus, a potentially important role of programming models is to generate a small number of alternative solutions that are feasible, perform well with respect to modeled issues, and are significantly different with respect to the decisions they specify. Such a set of alternatives may aid analysts and decision makers in understanding the problem and may serve as a catalyst for human creativity and invention. </jats:p><jats:p> The Hop, Skip, and Jump (HSJ) method has been developed for this purpose. It is designed to produce alternative solutions that are very different from previously generated solutions. Each solution generated is good in the sense that it meets targets specified for modeled objectives. The technique is described in this paper, and is illustrated using a multiobjective linear programming model of a land use planning problem provided by a regional planning commission. In this case, the method is shown to be capable of generating alternative solutions that perform well with respect to the modeled objectives and that are drastically different with respect to the land use pattern specified. Differences among solutions are discussed using visual inspection as well as simple quantitative measures. The technique can be used to extend the capabilities of existing mathematical programming packages. </jats:p>",
