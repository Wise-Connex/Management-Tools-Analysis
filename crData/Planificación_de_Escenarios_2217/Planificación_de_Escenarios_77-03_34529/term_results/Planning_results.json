      "abstract": "<jats:p>Planning Review intercepted Stafford Beer after his recent luncheon address to the Montreal chapters of NASCP and PEI to extract his current views on planning and the organization. Beer has long been concerned with the rate of change which technological achievement represents, and comments: “It is to the rate rather than to the changes themselves that we have to adapt.” In the interview that follows, he defines planning as the process of adjusting to a change in the environment. From his long inquiry into the task of organization and control in a fast‐changing environment, he concludes that the line/staff distinction is now dysfunctional. Planners and other staff personnel are making many decisions because they have the information and the decision has to be made quickly. Dr. Beer argues that these people should be given the responsibility to match the power they in fact enjoy. That power derives from information, which should not be confused with the accumulation of data. Data becomes information only at the point where it effects changes in the individual or company receiving it. Beer has long been a key figure in the fields of cybernetics, operations research, and management science. He's been a full‐time senior manager in four British companies, one a large publishing house and another United Steel, where he founded and directed for 13 years what became the largest civil operations research group. He has acted as consultant to international organizations such as the UN and the OECD and to a number of governments, including those of the United States, Britain, France, and Chile, in the sciences of management and effective organization (“the science of effective organization” is his preferred definition of cybernetics). Beer is Visiting Professor of Cybernetics at Manchester University, England, as well as Adjunct Professor of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of Pennsylvania. A conference speaker, broadcaster, and writer, Dr. Beer has published more than 150 papers and articles. Probably his best known books are Cybernetics and Management (1959), Brain of the Firm (1972), and Platform for Change (1975). In his spare time, Stafford Beer paints and writes poetry in his country home in Wales.</jats:p>",

A good spill prevention plan includes many fundamental good management practices. Cleaner, more attractive facilities, accurate inventories, and safer working conditions, are some of the improvements that may go along as part of a good spill prevention program. Specific examples are drawn from experiences in SPCC planning for a variety of facilities such as home heating oil distributors, truck stop operations, and large manufacturing facilities. Facilities required to have an SPCC plan have more to gain than mere compliance with federal regulations when they put their plan into effect. With a good spill prevention plan, the facility will operate more effectively and more profitably.</jats:p>",

This involves examining physical processes so that the fate of spilled oil may be predicted, and identifying sites that are particularly vulnerable to oil spill damage, i.e., biologically sensitive areas. If these things are known about a region, spill response plans can be designed to prevent oil from entering these sensitive areas. As a consequence, environmental damage can be minimized when biological protection, as well as physical cleanup is made a primary goal in any spill response plan. Clean Seas, Inc., an oil spill cooperative in Santa Barbara is implementing such a spill response plan designed to protect identified biologically sensitive areas in the Santa Barbara Channel. Protection systems are adpated to fit each site, and the plan is practiced through regular drills. This type of planning decreases the number of decisions that must be made after a spill occurs; thereby reducing both the reaction time and environmental damage.</jats:p>",

These ideas are explored using a linear programming model, making use of known planning horizon properties. A simulation experiment tests the efficacy of short horizon deterministic models in a stochastic environment, and demonstrates that ending conditions, derived from the steady state model, improve decisions under a variety of conditions on costs and horizon length. </jats:p>",

Beaches exist in a dynamic state and are continuously changing in response to littoral processes. In addition to these temporal variations, there is frequently considerable variability of shoreline types and process characteristics within a small region. In eastern Canada, contingency planning must cover rocky shorelines, sand beaches, and muddy coasts. There also is a wide range of littoral process environments, from the exposed Atlantic coast to the sheltered Bay of Fundy, which has tidal ranges on the order of 10 to 15 meters. Three examples from eastern Canada illustrate the variability of shorelines and processes in the context of cleanup planning.</jats:p>",

This difference is significant in the characterization of the photon beam at this high energy. The measured physical data have been computerized for use in routine treatment planning. Computer‐generated beams have been found to be in close agreement with measured isodose curves.

The questions asked in the British censuses of 1966 and 1971 about migration generate tabulations of migrants over the one year, and over the five years, preceding the census date. It is often observed that the numbers of migrants in the two periods are not linearly related; that is, the number of migrants over five years is less than five times the number over one year. A simple stochastic model embodying population-accounting principles is developed to show why this is the case, and that the relationship between one-year and five-year figures is a complex one involving some multiple migrations, some return migrations, and some deaths. </jats:p>",

It compares the importance of 27 value considerations to young married couples in deciding about whether or not to have another child, Parents at two stages of family growth were interviewed: 71 couples with one chi Id and 70 with two children. It was found that both groups of parents were concerned with altruism ( \"g iving yourself to others\"), emotional and social needs of present children, spouse's workload, ti me for oneself and with one's spouse, and economic needs. One-child parents were especially mindful of providing their single child with a companion, while two-child parents concentrated more on their own personal needs. When the ratings of importance of the value considerations were subjected to a smallest space analysis, they were fitted into a two dimensional space with two orthogonal continua: (1) Maintenance versus change of oneself and one's roles and (2) Concern for the demands of family group life versus concern for the demands of the larger community and society. Appl ications of this conceptualization for future research are suggested. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines a variety of issues within the context of two main themes: the formation of travel demand models and economic evaluation measures which are mutually consistent within a theory of rational choice; and a consideration of the structure of models which are representations of the trip decision process over several dimensions: location, mode, and route. Random utility theory is invoked to explore both the role and properties of composite costs or index prices in the ‘recursive’ approach to the structuring of travel choice models, and their significance in the economic evaluation problem. It is shown that the specification of these costs must be made very precisely, with respect to the demand model form chosen, in order to retain the underlying assumption that the traveller is an optimal decisionmaker. It is argued that the structure of ‘simultaneous’ models currently in use is inconsistent with the form of utility function assumed to generate those models. Furthermore, it is shown that the ‘simultaneous’ and ‘recursive’ forms are special cases of a more general choice model structure which takes specific account of correlation or ‘commonality’ of trip attributes. </jats:p><jats:p> A number of applications are discussed in which consistent demand models and perceived user benefit measures are constructed. These include the formation of strategic transport planning models and of models for mixed-mode, multimode, and multiroute systems. The formalism allows definitive answers to be given to a number of problems of current interest in transportation planning, which have been incorrectly or incompletely treated. </jats:p>",

Recruiters and directors seem to be in complete agreement about the values of services and student data but in less agreement about the best times for using the student data.</jats:p>",

Values associated with birth planning decisions for 74 married couples were found to be good predictors, one year later, of pregnancy status. The implications of these results were discussed as they related to birth planning counseling and to population policy.</jats:p>",
