      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning community has shown a curious lack of interest in developing methods to evaluate how successfully plans are implemented. Evaluation in planning has centered primarily on methods of comparing the impacts of alternative proposed plans. The methodological problems with evaluating implementation success are many, but they are not insurmountable. A typology of planning evaluation is offered here. The need to establish a separate, distinctive form of planning evaluation focused exclusively on evaluating the implementation success of plans is discussed. This call to develop and refine methods to evaluate plan implementation success coincides with the call by many theorists to develop better theories of planning based on a keener understanding of the realities of planning practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In policy analysis, the concept of framing has become an idea of good currency. In planning, framing means giving shape, not only in a figurative but also in a literal sense of the word. So, drawn images are used to support verbal statements of policy, or they directly express policies. In this paper I will first discuss framing. Then I will focus on images. Recognising the power of images as the glue holding policy together could all too easily lead to the acceptance of the urban designer's claim for preeminence in planning. This claim rests on the alleged creativity of designers and/or their unique ability to encapsulate in their designs the totality of urban life. Although such claims are rejected in this paper, the autonomy of urban design as a field of endeavour is nevertheless recognised. The issue arising is that of crossing frames between urban designers, planners, and their clients, the public. This is all the more urgent because urban design, like planning, is in the public domain. </jats:p>",

Critics of the practice have raised concerns that merit careful consideration about issues such as the co-optation of environmental and citizens groups, protection of the public interest, and power imbalances. Three questions that arise from a critique of environmental mediation are explored here. First, how will evolving political climates, individual values, and world-views influence adoption of environmental mediation? Second, what does recent research tell us about assessing environmental mediation's successes and its applicability to different kinds of environmental disputes? Finally, what is the planner's role in mediating environmental disputes? </jats:p>",

According to this model, the articulation of the public space grid, associated to the uneven distribution of facilities, generates a powered supply network to which demand locations are related. Choice, as well as demand satisfaction, will then be a function of the relative position (centrality) and attractiveness of supply locations. The model gives a simultaneous account of the spatial opportunity of demand and the spatial convergence of supply. Concurrently it can offer a picture of the stability of space in terms of possible land-use changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper human experience and perception of phenomena and relations in space are studied. This focus is in contrast to previous work where space and spatial relations were examined as objective phenomena of the world. This study leads in turn to a goal: to identify models of space that can be used both in cognitive science and in the design and implementation of geographic information systems (GISs). Experiential models of the world are based on sensorimotor and visual experiences with environments, and form in individual minds, as the associated bodies and senses experience their worlds. Formal models consist of axioms expressed in a formal language, together with mathematical rules to infer conclusions from these axioms. In this paper we will review both types of models, considering each to be an abstraction of the same ‘real world’. The review of experiential models is based primarily on recent developments in cognitive science, expounded by Rosch, Johnson, Talmy, and especially Lakoff. In these models it is suggested that perception and cognition are driven by image-schemata and other mental models, often language-based. Cross-cultural variations are admitted and even emphasized. The ways in which people interact with small-scale (‘tabletop’) spaces filled with everyday objects are in sharp contrast to the ways in which they experience geographic (large-scale) spaces during wayfinding and other spatial activities. We then address the issue of the ‘objective’ geometry of geographic space. If objectivity is defined by measurement, this leads to a surveyor's view and a near-Euclidean geometry. These models are then related to issues in the design of GISs. To be implemented on digital computers, geometric concepts and models must be formalized. The idea of a formal geometry of natural language is discussed and some aspects of it are presented. Formalizing the links between cognitive categories and models on the one hand and between geometry and computer representations on the other are key elements in the research agenda. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the regionwide, spatial consequences of locally enacted growth controls are examined on the basis of a case study of the San Francisco Bay Region. A quasi-experimental methodology is employed. An ex post projection of population distribution among the region's cities in 1990 is generated by means of a model that represents the before growth control urban structure. A comparison is then made between the projected distribution and the actual distribution depicted by the 1990 census data. The differences, indexed as percentage projection errors, provide an empirical basis for assessing the impacts of local growth-control policies. Statistical analyses of the projection errors indicate that the local policies have caused a major redistribution of population growth from growth-controlled cities to the rest of the region. Geographic information systems-based spatial analyses of the projection errors suggest that the spatial process of growth control is driven primarily by NIMBYism. The main conclusions are that: (1) the existing decentralized system of growth management has created a spatial pattern of urban development that has undesirable economic and distributional effects; and (2) a carefully developed coordinated regional system of growth management is preferable because many critical growth problems can be addressed appropriately only at the regional or metropolitan level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this research we address factors contributing to landscape change in a midwestern (USA) watershed. Specifically, the relationship between the parcelization of agricultural land (ownership subdivisions) and changes in amounts of riparian forest cover are explored. The study area is the River Raisin Watershed in southeastern Michigan, which is typical of rural watersheds in the lower Great Lakes region. Two townships within the watershed were sampled from data spanning a 20-year time period. Using land-use and land-cover data for 1968, 1978, and 1988, combined with ownership records for the same years, we determined a relationship between rates of parcelization and changes in forest cover. These findings indicate that increasing trends in riparian forest area follow increases in land parcelization at the township scale. For these two townships, agricultural decline and land-use diversification seem positively related to larger areas and widths of riparian forests. As the number of acres being farmed and the number of farms have decreased, the land has been divided into more and smaller lots and the forests along rivers like the Raisin and its tributaries have increased in area. There are several possible factors at the township and farm scale which may influence this landscape phenomenon, including land-use policies, governmental programs, agricultural mechanization, and agricultural economics. </jats:p>",

Different perspectives in manpower planning have each been studied widely in the past. However, few insights are available on the interactions among these perspectives and the impact of these interactions on the resultant manpower plans. Describes these interactions in the form of decision and feedback loops. From this description, derives an integrated decision support system (DSS) framework for manpower planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most important problems facing many West African cities in recent times is rapid and seemingly uncontrollable urbanization. The enormous pressure which these developments have had on public systems in general - sanitation, sewage, housing, health care and transport, has forced many cities to think of innovative ways of handling these crisis. Planning departments with substantial expertise in urban problems, are being set up or are being re-organized to meet these new challenges. The powers that planning departments have, and their impact on the lives of ordinary citizens cannot be over-estimated. To prevent abuse of power and to make them responsive to the needs of citizens, several methods are used to control them. Judicial review of administrative actions is the legal method used to control many public bodies in English speaking West African countries.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In this article, I shall argue that in spite of its strengths, there is a general tendency to use judicial review to protect common law values like individual proprietary rights against the claims of state institutions. In West Africa, because of the weakness of public institutions, the intervention of the law, while protecting important private rights may hamper administrative effectiveness. Anticipating the use of the leading English case, Cooper v Wandsworth2 in reviewing planning decisions in West Africa, I shall conclude that such a position may not only diminish administrative effectiveness, but it may also diminish property rights.</jats:p>",

This paper addresses medium-term planning issues in aluminum tube manufacturing operations. First, we identify certain distinctive characteristics—the inherent process flexibility, close inter-dependence between successive stages, and economies of scale—of metal-forming operations, and identify performance trade-offs across stages. To exploit the strategic potential of process planning, it must be closely coupled with process engineering efforts, and must simultaneously consider the facility's entire product mix. In contrast, current process engineering efforts are mainly reactive, focusing on fixing problems at individual operations and with less emphasis on the interactions between successive stages. Similarly, planning activities are incremental, considering only individual products or orders one at a time rather than the entire range of product sizes to be manufactured. By working together, planners and engineers can develop effective process plans that exploit process capability, and adopt proactive process improvement strategies that focus on critical constraints. We describe a medium-term planning model to select standard extrusion sizes, illustrate the close linkages between planning and engineering activities, and identify research opportunities spanning management science, materials science, and mechanical engineering. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there have been computational and theoretical advances in the analysis both of the equilibrium and of the disequilibrium properties of pricing models in which spatial markets are dominated by autonomous firms engaged in oligopolistic competition. In this paper I develop an approach to the modeling of spatial pricing that transcends the unrealistic institutional simplification that firms are autonomous and independent of corporate organizational structures. Specifically, I hypothesize that competition between corporations takes place at two spatial scales. At the intraurban scale, corporations compete for market share through their franchise sites, where market share is contingent upon the nature and degree of competition between franchises, the spatial structure of the urban market, and the costs of production to the franchise. At the intraurban scale, competition is defined in terms of the strategies of the individual corporations as they adjust their delivered prices to urban markets in response to changes in their costs of production and distribution, the interurban transportation network, and the achieved market share in each urban market. I demonstrate that, for a general corporate objective, there exists at least one spatial price equilibrium and that the stability conditions of this model are identical for two price-setting scenarios: a partial adjustment model and a Bertrand game. For the specific corporate objective of total-profit maximization, I examine the qualitative properties of the hierarchical model.</jats:p>",

His texts are distinctly tied to a national discourse which is both consciously and unconsciously imperial, and in his narratives the political map of the nation is overlaid with a tissue of imperial and sexual symbols. I examine how the geographic signs of empire are inscribed in his first novel Il Piacere and his screenplay Cabiria, and how the metropolitan experience is foregrounded whereas the peripheral ‘other’ is both devalued and made exotic.

Focusing on the Earl of Onslow, SPFE president from 1926–1945, I suggest that the aristocratic experience with the landscape of rural England influenced conservationists' ideas for preserving an idealized wild Africa. I explore the ways in which social and cultural constructions of African nature embodied by the SPFE's proposals reflected and helped to legitimate British imperialist ideology. Ultimately, the history of aristocratic involvement in conservation is critical to understanding the development of an institutional global nature-preservation movement. </jats:p>",

Private foundations, granting agencies, and other public health organizations assume that participation of community members in health promotion coalitions will increase the likelihood of program success. This article examines whether key characteristics of coalitions are related to effectiveness as measured by member satisfaction, commitment to the coalition, and the quality of planning efforts. Member survey data from the first year evaluation of an ATOD coalition were analyzed using factor analysis, chi-square, and multiple regression techniques at both the individual and group levels. The results suggest that community leadership, shared decision making, linkages with other organizations, and a positive organizational climate were key determinants of member satisfaction and participation. These same factors were not related to the quality of coalition plans. However, the significance of coalitions for community empowerment and health promotion is discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This special issue is devoted to robot motion planning. The main scope of this issue covers research work on mobile robotics. Motion planning is necessary when the robot determines its own actions. For the last decade, the paradigm of motion planning in mobile robotics has shifted from off-line motion planning to on-line motion planning and from planning in a static environment to planning in a time-varying environment. Recent progress of computational power has enabled this paradigm shift, since on-line motion planning and planning in time-varying environments require repeated computation based on sensory information which is always renewed. The guest editors organized this special issue in order to highlight those two new paradigms. We present two survey papers: One is a survey of on-line motion planning for a sensor-based navigation of a mobile robot, and the other is a survey of motion planning for mobile robots in a time-varying environment. Along with the survey papers, distinguished technical papers are provided in this special issue. Concerning path planning, a paper describing a case study on motion planning with teaching is included (Ogata et al). Motion planning based on Fuzzy logic is one approach, and three papers from Maeda, Ishikawa et al. and Nagata et al. also belong to this category. To offer a case study on reactive motion decision making, one paper by Ando et al. is included. A recently emerging subject is related to motion planning for cooperation of multiple mobile robots or a single robot among multiple moving obstacles. Three papers from Yoshioka et al., Ota et al., and Fujimura discuss problems on motion planning for cooperation of multiple mobile robots. One paper from Tsubouchi et al. discussed the motion planning of a single robot among multiple moving obstacles. Motion planning to select an appropriate corner cube as a landmark is addressed in the paper from Hashimoto et al. The guest editors hope that this special issue will provide the readers with a lock at some current issues and new perspectives on robot motion planning.</jats:p>",

The planning engine of IMPReSS is the Berkeley Planning System (BPS), which models the problem in a form that permits linear programming optimization. BPS embeds formulation techniques for planning the requirements of binning and substitutable products, for representing dynamic capacity consumption by reentrant process flows, and for developing multiple optimization calculations that reflect marketing priorities. It uses a heuristic decomposition strategy to break the overall problem into several manageable calculations. Its implementation raised on-time deliveries of line items from 75 to 95 percent without increasing inventories, enabled the sector to expand its markets and its market share, and helped move the sector from a loss of $75 million to profit of over $40 million annually. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The continuous renewal and improvement of infrastructure within Europe are widely regarded as a very necessary part of any regional development strategy, particularly in regions which are economically and geographically peripheral to the core industrialised regions. This paper is a review of some of the problems associated with modelling the relationship between improvements in infrastructure and regional economic growth specifically in the context of the attraction of new inward investment. An illustration from northeast England is used to argue that it is increasingly untenable to regard infrastructure as an independent variable influencing the regional distribution of mobile investment. Although the presence of certain basic infrastructure may be significant in attracting the initial interest of potential new investors, success in winning inward investment projects depends increasingly upon the ability of public authorities to produce spaces which are customised to the changing needs of key firms. This process of infrastructure modification and adaptation challenges simplistic interpretations of the role of infrastructure in regional economic development. Examples demonstrate how inward investment projects can be levered into a region by means of a variety of incentives including promises of rapid infrastructure modifications. The experience of Nissan is used to illustrate how an investor can subsequently engage directly in the production of its own customised space through the control exercised over regional authorities. It is concluded that this area of research and policy formation would benefit from insights into the political processes which occur at local levels in the modification and production of space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years have seen an increase in the analysis of deprivation in Britain. In most studies the unit of analysis has been geographical, such as local-government wards or districts. This reflects, in part, a reliance on small-area statistics and local-base statistics from the censuses of population. Although useful in identifying specific problem areas, this type of approach may be subject to ecological fallacy. In other words, areas of high levels of deprivation may be home to high proportions of particular social or demographic groups, but it cannot be automatically assumed that these groups are themselves deprived. Although some studies have been based on purpose-designed individual-level survey data, these often lack sufficient sample sizes to analyse effectively small subgroups of the population or to allow geographical disaggregation. The release of the Samples of Anonymised Records from the 1991 Census allows individual-level data to be used to investigate the social, demographic, and geographical dimensions of deprivation. In this paper, a threshold of deprivation will be determined and the distribution of individual-level deprivation (deprived people) will be compared with an equivalent area-level index constructed from standard census output by the use of conventional techniques. </jats:p>",

In this study, the functional anatomy of cognitive planning was investigated further, using positron emission tomography (PET). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 12 normal volunteers while performing easy and difficult versions of (i) a modified Tower of London planning task; (ii) a mnemonic variant of this task that required short‐term retention and reproduction of problem solutions; and (iii) a control condition that involved identical visual stimuli and motor responses. Significant increases in rCBF were observed in the left hemisphere, in both the mid‐dorsolateral frontal cortex and in the head of the caudate nucleus, when the difficult planning task was compared with the control condition. Moreover, subtraction of a simple planning condition from the more difficult one revealed focal increases in rCBF in the caudate nucleus and the thalamus only. During both mnemonic variants of the planning task, changes were also observed in the mid‐dorsolateral frontal cortex and in more ventral frontopolar regions, bilaterally. When compared directly, the planning and memory conditions differed in terms of these ventral activation foci, but not in the pattern of activation observed in the mid‐dorsolateral frontal cortex. These findings further implicate frontostriatal circuitry in high‐level planning and provide evidence for functionally distinct contributions from ventral and dorsolateral frontal regions to spatial working memory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a planning method for multiple mobile robot systems. It has two characteristics: (1) Each robot plans a path on its own, without any supervisor; (2) The concept of cooperative motion can be implemented. A two-layered hierarchy is defined for a scheme of individual path planning. The higher layer generates a trajectory from the current position to a goal. The lower layer called“Virtual Impedance Metho” makes a real-time plan to follow the generated trajectory while avoiding obstacles and avoiding or cooperating with other robots. This layer is composed of four modules called, “watchdog”, “deadlock solver”,“blockade solver”, and “pilot”. The local equilibrium is detected by the watchdog and cancelled by the deadlock solver or the blockade solver. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Feminist geographers are now engaging with the gender implications of landscape representation and this paper, in which the multiple significances of the garden in Frances Hodgson Burnett's (1911) children's story The Secret Garden are explored, is a contribution to this field. Using an approach informed by feminisms and poststructuralisms I draw attention to intersections of late-19th and early-20th century discourses on Englishness, gender, class, and nature, gravitating around three children and set within an old abandoned garden. The garden is the site for a critical reading of the bodily regeneration of gendered and classed English identities whilst it is also a space of other possibilities.</jats:p>",

Planning is a highly complex process, and the decisions made result in the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars each year. By integrating heuristic rules and optimization techniques in an innovative manner, Arachne has fundamentally changed the nature of network planning at NYNEX. Arachne improves the reliability and quality of the network plans, reduces the time it takes to complete the planning task, and has led to savings of at least $33 million dollars to date. In addition to supporting the planning task, Arachne also provides a means of exploring new network technologies and planning strategies. </jats:p>",

The system is capable of accounting for uncertainty, not only in the prediction of solute transport but also in the optimization of the remediation scheme through chance constraints. The system guides users in the selection of appropriate transport models through an algorithm independently tested with machine learning codes. An application to Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is presented for which different pump‐and‐treat strategies are considered: the results are evaluated in terms of the cumulative distribution of the contaminant concentration for each case and the tradeoff relationship between the cost of remediation and the probability that the remediation strategy exceeds an established maximum allowable contaminant concentration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The design of progressive dies is a highly iterative planning process in which the designer attempts to select a die configuration which will produce a part most efficiently by minimizing material, tooling and maintenance costs while achieving the required part specifications. The planning process involves a considerable amount of human cognitive skills such as pattern recognition and matching (as in punch shape recognition) and spatial planning (as in nesting and staging of die processes) based on the geometrical features of the part. This paper describes an intelligent planning aid which can assist the die designer in planning progressive dies. The highly automated and yet flexible planning aid is developed by linking together a CAD (computer aided design) system, a knowledge-based system and a library of numerical routines. </jats:p>",

We developed a technique to generate a suboptimal path with much less search nodes than the traditional A*algorithm, and to make a heuristic function that includes task knowledge. Examples are shown to verify the effectiveness of our method.</jats:p>",
