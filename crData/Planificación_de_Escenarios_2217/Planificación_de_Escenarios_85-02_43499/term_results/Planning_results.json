The next major space initiative must build on and complement these existing space systems while significantly enhancing the national capabilities for routine and efficient operations in space. Past and current studies indicate that a permanent research and operations base in low Earth orbit is the correct next step for NASA to pursue. The operations and research base, as currently perceived, is a combination of manned and unmanned facilities located in low Earth orbit and interconnected by teleoperated transportation stages. A Space Station thus provides new and unique operational and research opportunities that complement the capabilities of the Space Shuttle principally by removing the constraint of time from future mission planning. The current assessment of requirements in the areas of science and applications, commercial utilization, technology development, and national security are discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the future plans within the Space Station Program.</jats:p>",

These guidelines are intended to expedite the decision to use dispersants in the event of an oil spill, where that will minimize environmental damage. These guidelines can be applied readily to any geographical area to answer the following questions: (1) Are there locations where dispersant application should normally be allowed? (2) In these locations, what rate of dispersant application should be allowed? (3) Are there locations where dispersant application should normally be avoided?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The logic behind these guidelines is explained so that exceptions can be identified and so that changes in the guidelines can be made as advances are made in the state of the art.

Creativity depends on the talent of the individual, not on the techniques used, and an uncreative researcher let loose with a so‐called creative research technique is a recipe for disaster. This means that this cannot be an objective, technique‐led paper, but has to be a subjective view to encourage the subjectivity of others. It also has to focus on the general principles of creative development to make its main point.</jats:p>",

The early stages of a spill are a critical time for gathering evidence and taking initial legal steps. The authors examine the need to assign specific documentation tasks to field personnel in advance and to have a team of legal staff, knowledgeable in oil spill, admiralty, and tort law preassigned to deal with spill-related legal matters requiring immediate attention. This approach should be of value to any organization involved in a spill, whether corporate owners or operators, or regulatory agencies. Finally, the authors consider whether being in a defensive or offensive legal posture should affect legal contingency planning.</jats:p>",

The areas it covers in detail include: A new national organization for the central integration of sea and shore response in a single unit: the Marine Pollution Control Unit (MPCU), responsible within central government to the Department of Transport New structures and procedures to facilitate interaction between central and local government Redirection of emphasis in the R&amp;D field, in the provision of sea and shore related response equipment, and in contingency planning in order to redress imbalances formerly existing between sea and shore related response Further development of the safe havens policy to facilitate salvage and cargo transfer operations Greater emphasis within the MPCU on the detection of violations of discharge regulations and the collection of evidence Arrangements for closer association between government and the oil industry in relation to provision of response equipment, the development of mutually supportive contingency planning, and response arrangements</jats:p>",

Such an allocation is usually undertaken with the aid of a production-constrained gravity model, although this type of model ignores the relationship between retail expenditure patterns and spatial competition and agglomeration forces. The effect of such a relationship on urban structure is examined with the aid of a production-constrained competing destinations model in three situations: (1) in a simple facility-location problem, (2) in a Garin–Lowry model, and (3) in the use of catastrophe theory and bifurcation theory to examine urban dynamics. The replacement of the gravity model by the competing destinations model is shown to produce more realistic urban models and leads to new insights into structural dynamics. </jats:p>",

The Pacific facility consists of three shore-based terminals to handle tankers from Valdez, Alaska. The Atlantic terminal contains two single-point moorings to load tankers destined for U.S. ports along the Gulf of Mexico.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Prior to the opening of the pipeline, the government of Panama contracted for a series of studies designed to better understand the shoreline sensitivity, marine resources, archaeology, and limnology along the pipeline route and adjacent to each terminal. Results of the shoreline sensitivity analysis indicate that, by far, the Atlantic terminal in the Laguna de Chiriqui is the most sensitive and likely to be damaged during a spill. The laguna has almost no tides, is relatively stagnant, and is dominated by mangroves (51 percent of the total shoreline). In contrast, the Pacific terminal contains much higher tides and currents and fewer mangroves [44 percent of the total shoreline, but less than 5 percent within 30 miles of the terminal].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In response to environmental concerns and greatly supported and advised by the pipeline user companies, PTP completed a workable spill-response plan, developed along three fronts: the active and continuing purchase of spill-response equipment for use at the marine facilities as well as in fast-moving streams; the creation of specially trained spill-response teams; and the delegation of clear lines of authority for both land and marine spills. The interrelated roles played by Panamanians, the people of PTP, and the pipeline user companies provide an example of how different groups can cooperatively work together to protect the environment and still maintain financially advantageous, oil-related projects in a lesser-developed country.</jats:p>",

The decisions are broadly conceptualized within the two main phases of the Brown–Moore model of residential mobility: (1) the decision to seek a new residence, and (2) the relocation decision (specifically, search behaviour and evaluation procedures). The data are based on an interview survey of transfer applicants on six contrasting council estates. The findings disclose that, although many households are dissatisfied with their present estate, ‘dwelling needs’ constitute the most important category of reasons for seeking a transfer. In terms of the relocation decision, most households exhibit highly constrained search spaces, and they evaluate alternative council estates on the basis of such factors as level of security, social character, general state of repair, and accessibility. Important variations are revealed among the decisionmaking procedures of subgroups of households defined according to (a) the type of estate where they reside prior to the proposed move, and (b) family life-cycle criteria. </jats:p>",

Different treatments given in sequence mean real benefit in terms of absolute cure or length of disease‐free life for many. While the details of treatment techniques can usually be worked out for each patient in expert fashion, the process of planning to fit the three main modalities together into a single plan presents complex problems. To obtain optimum results someone must assemble and coordinate the opinions of the oncologists who are consulted in each case; and someone must do it before treatment begins. Benefit is significantly reduced if the planning process is delayed until recurrence occurs. Those who act as primary physicians in caring for cancer patients have a newly defined major role to play: they must select the oncology team, coordinate the various opinions, and continue to supervise the course of the cancer throughout in order that the patients receive the best care. When a physician prepares for, and accepts, this role of leader‐coordinator, and outlines in broad general terms a properly integrated plan from the first, details of therapy fall easily into place.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> Although droughts are a frequent occurrence over much of the United States, response by state and federal government has been ineffective and poorly coordinated. Recently, several states have recognized the value of drought emergency planning and have developed plans to assist them in responding more effectively to prolonged periods of water shortage. These states have created an organizational structure to coordinate the assessment and response activities of state and federal agencies. Each state's drought response plan is unique since each state's water supply and management problems, and their consequent impacts, are unique. The drought response plans developed by Colorado, South Dakota and New York are reviewed here in detail. We recommend that other states affected by frequent and severe water shortages also develop drought emergency plans. These plans will enhance state government's ability to implement effective measures in a timely manner and, ultimately, may provide added incentive for the federal government to develop the national drought response plan called for by the General Accounting Office in 1979.</jats:p>",
