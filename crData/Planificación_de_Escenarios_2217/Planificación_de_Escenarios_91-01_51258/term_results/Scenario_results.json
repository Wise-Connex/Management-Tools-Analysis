A working classification based on ‘internal sweating’ (extravasated sweat in the dermis and epidermis) and ‘external sweating’ (sweat on skin surface) is proposed. Clinical observations suggest that transient acantholytic dermatosis is the consequence of extravasated sweat; we speculate that it is an example of sweat-related, protease-induced epidermal acantholysis. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis may represent a sweat-related drug reaction. We emphasize the well-recognized phenomenon of ‘sweat retention syndrome’ in a new scenario: hospitalized febrile patients, increasing use of chemotherapy, new life style. The concept of ‘sweat-gland-mediated cutaneous inflammation’ is proposed.</jats:p>"

After participants finished a scenario, they completed the After-Scenario Questionnaire (the ASQ). A factor analysis of the responses to the ASQ items revealed that an eight-factor solution explained 94 percent of the variability of the 24 (eight scenarios by three items per scenario) items. The varimax-rotated factor pattern showed that these eight factors were clearly associated with the eight scenarios. The benefit of this research to system designers is that this three-item questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties of reliability, sensitivity, and concurrent validity, and may be used with confidence in other, similar usability studies.</jats:p>",

A long‐term sea‐level drop at the end of the Cretaceous culminated in a short‐term regressive pulse at K‐T time. Deep‐water production was curtailed, minimizing the vertical advection of nutrients and oxygen in the oceans. Consequently, a productivity crisis developed, which could only be survived by cosmopolitan shallow‐dwellers, and the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) expanded. No sustained Oceanic Anoxic Event followed the K‐T boundary event, since productivity had dropped to extremely low values. At K‐T time, however, the short‐term expansion of the OMZ, invoked by the combination of minimized oxygen advection and abrupt mass mortality, caused dysoxic conditions even to reach up to the shelves, as can be deduced from sedimentological, chemical and faunistic observations.</jats:p>",
