Since a profit-seeking, corporate style of planning has superseded community health planning efforts, the question still remains as to who will provide health services not resulting in a profit.

The consistent siting of these projects in one area, southwest Yonkers, has re sulted in a segregated city, where most of the minority population lives in one neighborhood. This situ ation was in part responsible for the segregation of the public school sys tem. The practice of unethical deci sion making by the planners in Yon kers suggests a need for more planners focusing on issues of professional ethical decision making in potentially hostile practice envi ronments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>After nearly a quarter of a century, Artificial Intelligence, in\nspite of all its promise, has made virtually no progress in the domain\nof marketing, and whilst most interested parties view it as a\npotentially powerful way of beating the competition, there are few\nproducts and no on‐line systems available. This article explores why\nprogress has been slow in the domain of marketing and describes the\nexperience and progress of a group of major British multinational\ncompanies that have joined forces to produce an Expert Marketing\nPlanning System, EXMAR, with the author of this article as principal\nexpert. A number of conclusions are drawn, but one of the main ones is\nthat the development of EXMAR shows that it is possible to use Expert\nSystem methodologies to build support systems in complex areas of\nmarketing management, especially if the domain is well defined, has a\nlarge number of factors to be considered, and relevant expert knowledge\nis available. Also Expert Systems are shown as being useful in helping\nboth academics and practitioners to structure, validate and use\nmarketing knowledge and to understand better the interrelationships\nbetween the elements of marketing. In particular, the article forces\nmanagers to think deeply and in a structured way about the issues that\nneed to be considered in developing a strategic marketing plan.</jats:p>",

Definition A, by the medical profession, emphasizes the maintenance of technical standards in diagnosis and treatment. Definition B, by the essentially healthy general population, emphasizes preventive measures and the reassurance of the healthy status. Definition C, by the chronically sick and disabled, emphasizes rehabilitation and nursing care. Although each has its inherent weakness, each could be said to be describing an essential but distinct aspect of comprehensive health care which can be utilized to legitimize each party's claim for priority in the allocation of resources. Thus, the relative weight that is given to the three definitions of ‘best medical practice’ in society as a whole appears to be ultimately dependent on the social and cultural conditions unique to each country. In the case of Japan, Definition B has become the most dominant: it has resulted in the health care demands of the essentially healthy general population being well taken care of without excessive allocation to high technology medicine. However, a combination of demographic, technological and social changes will necessitate a different emphasis in the future.</jats:p>",

This form of management fails in the Netherlands, even in its own economic terms. We argue that best management is postmodern management and is inspired by postmodern thinking. It assumes that there is a non‐reducible plurality of forms of life in human society which mostly interact in a powerful and complex way. It, therefore, stresses simplicity and dynamics in structure making. It advocates the principle of freedom, within constraints, for the staff of the medical organization. As a paradigm of new management we suggest the deconstruction of the present piecework payment per activity of doctors: it is static, expensive and fails to control the quality of medical care. Instead, two dynamic structures are suggested consisting of a payment per treated patient, together with the creation of a limited number of teams of highly qualified medical controllers. Both of these measures should improve the quality of health care as well as its cost‐effectiveness.</jats:p>",

This article explores the concept of best medical practice in the context of mammographic screening for breast cancer. Maximizing the use of technology, ignores the risks intrinsic to technological intervention. To do no harm in modern medical practice means largely doing nothing. Best medical practice, therefore, requires a balancing of benefits and risks so that best practice is that which does more good than harm. At the same time, not all interventions that do more good than harm can be funded out of the current health care budget. Thus, best medical practice is economically efficient practice.</jats:p><jats:p>From the conceptual notion of what is best medical practice, this article turns to the problem of what that means in practical terms. Can we recognize best medical practice when it occurs? The identification, measurement and valuation of costs and benefits are discussed as a specific case study, in the context of breast cancer screening. Many of the difficulties involved here, particularly on the benefit side, are highlighted, especially in the context of QALYs. Yet, whatever the difficulties involved they have to be seen in the context of otherwise settling for something less i.e. <jats:italic>inefficient</jats:italic> medical practice.</jats:p>",

In older days, medicine aimed exclusively at maximum effectiveness through an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach, irrespective of cost considerations. Budget constraints in health care have put limits on this exhaustive form of medicine. Consequently, considerations regarding the ratio between the quality and the cost of medical care are becoming more and more important in the definition of ‘best medical practice’. Quality standards in medicine thus should not be based exclusively on medical considerations, but should also take cost considerations into account. This balanced integration of quality and cost represents a new challenge in medicine. It demands an active interest and participation of the medical profession in budget affairs, and close cooperation between health care professionals, health economists, and health care administrators. If this integration is done explicitly and quantitatively, it requires the use of decision analysis and cost‐effectiveness analysis techniques.</jats:p><jats:p>Recent experiments at the department of Surgery at the Leiden University Hospital have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. Quality standards were set by means of explicit outcome criteria, and policy changes were executed on the basis of cost‐effectiveness analysis. Quality of care could be maintained at the same or higher levels while cost savings of up to 60% were realized.</jats:p><jats:p>The advance of ‘best medical practice’ in the present and future requires a multidisciplinary approach to medicine, that is best realized by the use of explicit and quantitative quality standards. This approach can only be successful if close cooperation between professionals, administrators, economists and politicians in health care can be realized.</jats:p>",

Specifically, in order to describe potential collision between the links of two robots along the designated paths, explicit forms of virtual obstacle are adopted, according to which links of one robot are made to grow while the other robot is forced to shrink as a point on the path. Then, a notion of virtual coordination space is introduced to visualize all the collision–free coordinations of two trajectories. Assuming that a collision–free coordination curve between the two robots is given via a virtual coordination space, the minimum time collision–free trajectory pair for the two robots is sought considering dynamic constraints of torque and velocity bounds of actuators of the two robots.</jats:p>",

It further argues that even this distinction is not\nenough. The term “brand” itself may be too broad in its\nmeaning to be useful. Given the variety of meanings and roles attributed\nto brands, yet more clarification is required. It is suggested that when\na distinction is made between functional and representational brands\nthen the marketing strategies which result may be very different.

Issues discussed include the conventional problems of managing uncertainty over longer timescales and the use of relevant data. However, the need for raised awareness across all professions of the sources of influence on the service is also discussed. The use of scenario planning approaches is suggested. A case example is provided of a trial attempt to examine the major forces influencing the N.W. Thames RHA, in order to derive from them the manpower and training implications. Detailed data from the early stages of the project are presented, illustrating the impact of technological advances and of social trends on health care delivery. Interim conclusions are then drawn from this work. </jats:p>",

Film dosimetry and parallel‐plate ion chamber measurements have been used to obtain various dose parameters. Selective results of a series of systematic measurements for central axis depth dose data, uniformity index, field flatness, and relative output factors of small elongated electron beams are reported. The square‐root method is employed to predict the beam data of small elongated electron fields from corresponding small square electron fields using film dosimetry. The single parameter area/perimeter radio <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> is used to characterize the relative output factors of elongated electron beams. It is our conclusion that for clinical treatment planning square‐root method may be applied with caution in determining the beam characteristics of small elongated electron fields from film dosimetry.

By means of a variant of the mean-variance model of contemporary portfolio theory, it is demonstrated that individual bid-rent functions depend on the nature of a farmer's utility function. Because farmers' objectives affect their bid-rent functions, the spatial pattern of agricultural production is also affected. The conventional result of the von Thünen model is shown to be a special case of the more general portfolio model. </jats:p>",

Six hundred and forty-six women were derived from a stratified cluster sample and interviewed using a questionnaire. Almost one-third (31.4%) of respondents gave male opposition to family planning as the reason for current non-use. Another 13.3% expressed fear of methods, 6.3% did not want to use contraception until the first child was born, and 13.6% until the desired number of children were born. Sociodemographic variables including age, educational level, religion, and residence as reasons for non-use were reported. Other important findings included a high awareness of, low availability of, or poor accessibility to contraceptive methods. Short and long term intervention strategies using information, education and communication materials are proposed to combat low levels of contraceptive use in this area. </jats:p>",

Programmes with the highest volume of services delivered corresponded to lowest average costs: social marketing (2·8 million CYPs) and sterilization projects (960,000 CYPs) cost about $2 per CYP, on average; highest costs were for full service clinics and community-based distribution projects ($13–14 per CYP). Costs of clinics combined with community-based distribution services fell approximately midway between these two extremes.</jats:p>",

The model is macrodynamic in nature and provides both for the main secular component of the migratory flow and for transient components caused by extraordinary events. The model is expressed in a Bernoulli-type differential equation through which quantitative weights can be derived for each of the operating causes. Out-migration from the Republic of Cyprus is used to test the tenets of the model. </jats:p>",

A particularly appropriate form of the density function is the lognormal, and the broad features of this function are outlined. The concern in the balance of the paper is with certain properties of the lognormal form. These properties are descriptive in nature, but may also be of a predictive character, in the sense that the predicted property can be contrasted with its observed counterpart. Consideration is given first to properties based on density. The population form of the lognormal function is then derived, and properties based on population are examined. Attention is also given to relationships among density-based and population-based properties. An example of the approach and how it may contribute to the analysis of spatial structure, particularly over time, is illustrated with respect to a major metropolitan-area-based region. Last, possible applications of this type of analysis are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the first paper of this three-part series, Harvey's ‘circuits of capital’ argument was reviewed, and was linked first to ground rent theory, and second to forms of crisis and social change in advanced, Western-style economies. In the second paper these ideas were used to reflect on the progress of the urban housing market in Melbourne from the 1930s to the 1980s. Specifically, an attempt was made first to identify significant switchings of investment between economic sectors, and forms of crisis that might have accompanied them; and second to understand significant switchings of investment between submarkets within the housing sector, their relationship to intersectoral switching, and the changing social relationships involved. In the present paper this question of changing social conditions is pursued further. It is concluded (1) that the increasingly differentiated structure of housing submarkets, apparently ‘necessary’ for continuous seesawing investment between submarkets, is dependent on shifts in incomes and behaviour of different social groupings; and (2) that the present direction of such shifts is, however, destabilising, transforming an economic crisis into a potential ‘motivation crisis’. The paper ends with some overall conclusions to this series of three papers. </jats:p>",

Forty-one patient and disease characteristics at onset of 370 patients with MDS were analyzed to identify significant prognostic factors for survival and transformation to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and to develop and validate a regression model for predicting survival. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, age, platelet count, WBC count, and hemoglobin level were the characteristics more significantly associated with survival in the overall series. The bone marrow percentage of type I blast cells was the most important factor predicting transformation into AML. Proportional hazards regression analysis in a randomly selected training sample of 240 patients demonstrated that the combination of total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, platelet count, and age had the strongest predictive relation to survival length. The resulting regression models, continuous and categorized, were validated in the remaining test sample of 130 patients by demonstrating its capability of segregating patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with distinctively different survival curves (P less than .0001). A scoring system derived from the categorized model also had a great prognostic value (P less than .0001). These regression models and the simpler scoring system may be accurately used for decision-making regarding therapy in MDS patients.</jats:p>",

None of the 1,000 women tested was seropositive. Preventive efforts in family planning clinics are likely to be productive because few contraceptors, including those with risk factors, are already infected. The factors which determine differences in HIV positivity between childbearing and contracepting women, who are similar in demographic and HIV risk characteristics, warrant further investigation. </jats:p>",
