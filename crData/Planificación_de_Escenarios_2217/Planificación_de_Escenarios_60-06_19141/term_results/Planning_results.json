      "abstract": "<jats:p>Distribution storage is necessary in order that peak demands may be served directly, either by gravity or through pumping facilities. It is not to be confused with seasonal storage, which is the impoundment of water that varies in quantity with seasonal fluctuations and the holding of it for controlled releases throughout the year. In order to determine the proper storage capacity for each community, consideration should be given to: hourly variations in water consumption in excess of the rate of inflow; the reserve needed to fight a major fire; and, the reserve needed for a shutdown of the supply facilities for inspection and minor repairs. Determination of the amount of storage needed to provide for each of these conditions is a matter of engineering analysis and judgment. Various other considerations are discussed that are not directly associated with the size of the system and the amount of water it produces but must be considered when planning distribution storage. The article also discusses alternative types of storage facilities for a water system located in a nonhilly area such as elevated storage, ground level storage, or a combination of both. The importance of keeping records of the operations of each water system for future planning of water storage requirements is stressed.</jats:p>",
