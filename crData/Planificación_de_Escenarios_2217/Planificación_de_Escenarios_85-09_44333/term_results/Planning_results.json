The data consisted of a survey of policy-making members of the planning body that yielded background information about respondents, their views on a range of social and health policy issues, and sociometric data. Cliques within the organization appeared to be influenced by the organizational “careers” of individuals. These data suggest that policy cohesion may be a more important factor for clique formation than social ties. The significance of the findings is that interdependency may be the hallmark of health planning decision-making. Those who “act” on a particular issue may well constitute a decision network at that point in time. </jats:p>",

Drillingcontractors can improve the performance of their rigs by applyingsound management principles to repetitive tasks. A wellcan be drilled on paper, so to speak, before it is drilled in practice. This type of planning helps to positioneveryone involved on the learning curve and permits problems and potential bottlenecks to be identified in time to take alternative action. Mutual expectations are developed between the operator and drilling contractor; therefore, thecompany man and the toolpusher have a common wellplan and schedule that define these expectations. Their performance is measured so that deviations from expected performance can be identified on a real-time basis and dealt with effectively. On the basis of contemporary tests. we anticipate abouta 10% reduction in time required to drill a given well, if the program described in this paper is fully implemented.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Before drilling a well, the drilling contractor receives awell prognosis from the operator. This prognosis, or plan, outlines the various parameters under which the well willbe drilled, But even if the plan uses the latest drilling technology and if the contractor selected has the latest equipment, its ultimate success depends on the rig crew's ability to perform the drilling tasks in sequence. This paper describes a program in which the operator's well prognosis is reviewed thoroughly andsystematically. The analyses undertaken are not academic, but are entirely benefit-related. Time- and pressure-related aspectsof the plan are identified and quantified. The drilling schedule and related functions, such as rig maintenance and logistics, are separated into component parts, and planned, scheduled, and executed according to apredetermined, timed sequence. Benefits include these items:time savings,increased safety,increased control over wellprogress,creation of a data base for performancemeasurement and problem solving,application ofteaming-curve technology, andenhanced crew moraleand proficiency through goal setting and recognition.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Program Drilling efficiency is a function of three variables:technology, equipment, and performance.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>DE=P(T+E).............................................(1)</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>where</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>DE = drilling efficiency, T = technology, E = equipment, andP = performance.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The proposed five-step program considers thecontribution of \"performance\"to drilling efficiency. A basic premise provides that success depends on the rig crew'sability to understand the drilling plan. They must know and understand the duties and obligations of everyone involved and carry out the plan according to mutual expectations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Step 1. Review the operator's well prognosis and quantify pressure-and time-related aspects.The pressure profile is reviewed, and additional dataare gathered if requested by the operator. Also, someonemay add information because he has had previous experience in the area. The pressure profile is studied toidentify the existence and location of transition zones, toselect casing seats, and to define the difference between required wellbore pressure at any depth and the fracturepressure at the last casing seat. This information is veryimportant in circumstances in which a narrow band ofwellbore pressure is critical. Fig. I is a sample pressure profile.The depth-vs. -time curve (historical rig time curve)is the operator's statement of acceptable rig performance. It must be studied in detail. In addition to time expectations, the information it contains, such as hole sizes, casing sizes, setting depths, mud weights, logging intervals, etc., is the basis for the contractor's planning and scheduling.The remainder of the forecast is reviewed toprovide familiarity with special requirements and features ofthe well. Operators differ as to how much information they furnish. Ideally, the prognosis contains sufficient information on the directional program, cementing program, possible problem areas, service companies to use, mudand bit records of previous wells, and other useful proprietary information.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>By taking these review steps, the contractor becomesfamiliar with the well program and ascertains theoperator's expectations and the contractor's corresponding obligations. A degree of proficiency in understanding well plans isrequired to review the drilling prognosis adequately. Inthis regard, the program is prefaced by a training seminar for contractor rig management and supervisory personnel.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 1613^</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Die Deskription der räumlichen Verteilung ergibt, daß Ost- und Nordostbayern generell ungünstigere, Südbayem dagegen besonders günstige Sterbeziffern auf weisen: das Gefälle ist bei Männern deutlicher ausgeprägt als bei Frauen.Die Ursachenanalyse ist nach wie vor äußerst schwierig. Lediglich bei einigen Einzelaspekten sind enge Zusammenhänge plausibel, wie etwa zwischen Kfz-bedingter Sterblichkeit und Siedlungs- bzw. Altersstruktur. Bei der Überprüfung von möglichen statistischen Zusammenhängen zwischen der Gesamtsterblichkeit und 40 Indikatoren stellt sich heraus, daß die Mortalität am höchsten mit Mobilitätsindikatoren korreliert. Analytisch und methodisch gilt es bei der regionalen Mortalitätsforschung noch viele offene Fragen zu beantworten.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study is a look at the neighbourhood organisation as a pedagogie project wherein local residents undergo a subjective transformation in their level of consciousness. Within this context, two pedagogies are examined. One, which has close affinities with Marxism, seeks to expose the structural contradictions underlying the problems confronted by the organisation, and attempts to translate this knowledge into practice. The other, which is closely associated with the humanist tradition, tries to decipher intersubjective and intrasubjective barriers, to expose repressed desires, and to encourage their fulfillment in a creative manner. Neither of these pedagogies is found to be satisfactory. The Marxist pedagogy subordinates human values, that is, ‘what is' to the absolute of ‘what ought to be’. In contrast, the humanist pedagogy tends to relativise the organisation's values, and accept them uncritically and thus infer the ‘what ought to be’ from the ‘what is’. In a preliminary attempt to break away from moral objectivism and moral subjectivism, a third pedagogy is tentatively suggested: one whose essence lies in a synthesis between the two at the level of practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper is a development of the Hotelling model of population growth and migration. In the original model, a logistic growth term is combined with linear diffusion. Since man produces his own means of subsistance and himself decides which standard of living per capita is desirable, the ‘saturation’ population cannot be regarded as a constant, and production technology and technological development are introduced. At the same time it is noted that the reach of migration has increased with developments in transportation. Basic nonlinearities are introduced by use of a production technology with increasing-decreasing returns to scale. It is demonstrated how industrial takeoffs, population transitions, and agglomerative spatial patterns can emerge by changing the model parameters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the treatment of acute leukemias, high doses of chemotherapy and total‐body irradiation (TBI) are used prior to bone marrow transplantation. However, the doses needed equal or exceed the tolerance of vital organs at risk. Thus precision and reliability of treatment are required. A new concept of TBI is introduced, combining a patient translation whole‐body irradiation technique with the beam‐zone method for individual treatment planning. The patient rests first in the prone, then in the supine position on a specially constructed flat couch and is moved horizontally with a preset constant velocity, completely through a vertical <jats:sup>6</jats:sup><jats:sup>0</jats:sup>Co beam, twice for PA/AP TBI. This technique enlarges the useful beam size, improves the photon fluence uniformity, and reduces the depth‐dose inhomogeneity. In translation irradiation, the product of velocity and integrated dose is the significant measurement. This velocity–dose product can be described sufficiently as a function of the local thickness and the local effective field size. Using the beam‐zone method, calculation and checking of the dose at reference points in homogeneous, inhomogeneous, or shielded regions is simplified and reduces to taking dose measurements at the center of equivalent square phantoms. Since April 1983, about 20 leukemia patients received TBI by this individually planned translation‐irradiation technique. A dose homogeneity within ±7% is achieved in the entire body.</jats:p>",

A technically oriented task force aided by a planner was assigned the task of facilitating the production of the plan; an important first step was the production of a probable future scenario of the fishery. Interested citizens, informed by the scenario, were invited to state their goals for the fishery and to list what they considered desirable future trends and events. An options field for the research and management strategy consisting of 17 design categories was produced by the task force and knowledgeable members of NMFS management. The pros and cons for including each option in the NMFS strategy were discussed in a meeting of NMFS Headquarters, Regional and Laboratory management. A set of options was chosen by consensus to represent the NMFS strategic plan for its research and management of the north Pacific albacore fishery.</jats:p>",

In so doing, the following three steps shall be taken. First, the logical structure of the long-run incidence model is carefully explored to clarify the relationship between the long-run incidence and the short-run incidence. Second, previous work is extended to cover the long-run incidence effects of other taxes such as commodity or wage taxes.

Although the UK economy is in employment terms a service economy, contrary to some predictions, this has coincided with material need and high unemployment. Employment growth in the tertiary sector is constrained by the poor performance of manufacturing and by ‘self-servicing’ within the household economy. However, contrary to some speculation, it seems unlikely that the introduction of computer-based technology will have a major impact on service employment during the 1980s.

There is a spatial coincidence between the least innovative parts of Britain's innovation-poor economy and the traditionally depressed industrial regions. It has been suggested in government and academia that one way to help overcome both the problem of innovation lag and that of regional industrial decline is for Britain to adopt a regional innovation policy. In this paper the case for this is discussed in the context of the regional problem and in terms of problems posed by a market-led innovation process. A critical evaluation of one possible form of regional innovation policy based on the decentralisation of government research and development as carried out in France since the 1950s is presented. It is concluded that neither the present British nor French approaches are ideal but that some regionalised combination of them could be an improvement. </jats:p>",

This finding, which represents a massive jump over the 19% that would be intending to move due to stress with their actual experienced levels of their residential attributes, became the focus for challenge of a behavioural approach to modelling residential mobility by the Saskatoon Public Board of Education. Vulnerabilities of this type of modelling in an adversarial planning situation are discussed. </jats:p>",

The regional policy objectives of resource allocation equity and resource allocation efficiency form the starting point of a discussion outlining the basic relationships between the processes of ‘bridging space’ (that is, between the totality of all transport and communication processes) and the process of control of regional development. With such relationships can be associated classes of intervention measures affecting supply, adaptation, and conservation. The concept of differentiating transport policy problems according to regional policy problem areas is explained by means of examples taken from the field of passenger transport. In this context, reference is made principally to the results of recent empirical research directed by the author. It will be shown that changes in regional policy occurring within the overall process of structural change can lead to new concepts and strategies (‘rationalisation’ and ‘innovation’). </jats:p>",

In this respect, one of the most widely used models of local response has recently been criticised because of the apparent lack of correspondence between one of its predictions and the empirical facts. This failure on the part of what is referred to in this paper as the conventional theory has led to the development of the flypaper theory of local fiscal response. It is suggested in this paper that the flypaper theory also gives a prediction which is not supported by the facts and thus cannot be seen as a suitable replacement for the conventional theory. It is further suggested that it is by no means clear that the criticism of the conventional theory which led to the attempt to replace it is well founded. </jats:p>",

In comparison with the rate of urbanisation in developing countries with predominantly market economies, the rate of urbanisation in socialist developing countries usually slows down considerably after the revolution that brings the socialist regime to power, In the Murray–Szelenyi model this slowdown in the rate of urbanisation is attributed to class struggle, as a newly formed state class attempts to wrest power from the bourgeois class. With Vietnam as a case study this article is an examination of urbanisation under socialism in the light of the Murray–Szelenyi model, It is argued that the model attributes too much importance to the power of the state in socialist societies. As a result it underestimates the significance of external pressures, particularly warfare, and the structure of civil society, especially ethnic conflict, in shaping the rate and pattern of urbanisation. </jats:p>",

One relates to historical factors, mainly the poor housing stock which existed prior to 1949, and is indicated by persistent housing shortages. The other dimension concerns access and allocation mechanisms, both in rented and owned accommodation, and raises questions of social policy. Thus there are at least two ways of evaluating housing policy: In terms of absolute levels of provision—usually measured by standards and shortages—and in terms of relative levels—measured by how fair is the access to housing of different types by different groups in the population. The first method reveals that Hungary, despite severe housing shortages, has made great strides in recent years. However, in terms of equality of housing provision, the problem which seems endemic to several Eastern European countries—the better-off groups get most of the available good quality housing at low rents—is persisting through into the owner-occupied sector as this sector begins to take off because of a large expansion since 1970 of mortgage credit. </jats:p>",

An important part of the demographic model is the estimation of net migration equations based on a human capital approach and incorporating the adding-up constraint that arises since the sum of the net migration flows across all provinces must be 0 in each period. These endogenous migration flows allow for variables from the economic model (wage rates and unemployment rates) to influence the source population, the labour force and, therefore, the unemployment rate and other variables in the economic model. This economic – demographic model is then used in simulation experiments designed to show the economic – demographic interactions and how these lead to a moderation in the effect of policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The independent trade union movement has become increasingly significant in the popular struggle against racial capitalism in South Africa, yet it has so far attracted comparatively little attention from geographers in the region. One of the concerns of this paper, then, is to consider ways in which the spatial configuration of South African industry affects workers' organisations. In this context, the focus centres upon strike activity in the manufacturing sector. From an analysis of the changing composition, fortunes, and strategics of the trade union movement since the 1950s—substantially reviewed here—it can be seen how such activity is influenced by factors at work within the state apparatus and within the unions themselves, and is indicative of the everchanging relationship that exists between these two. Our major objective here, though, is to demonstrate how certain spatial and temporal variations in strike action may also be related to particular developments in the structure of South African capitalism. The forces underpinning the emergence of a spatial/sectoral division of labour and the contradictory imperatives driving industry towards the centralisation and decentralisation of capital are the developments under review. </jats:p>",

Four possible models of intermediate consumption are derived by using linear programming and entropy maximizing. The table is then linked to a coefficient representing wood use per unit of output in the Sudanese economy. A policy aimed at a reduction in wood use is tested by simulating the introduction of more efficient charcoal stoves into urban households. Implementation of the policy would lead to a significant reduction in total wood used, from 88 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to 194 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> per year, depending on which of the four models for intermediate consumption is utilized. Reallocation of the resulting savings by households into energyintensive commodities, however, reduces the effectiveness of the policy by as much as 48%. </jats:p>",
