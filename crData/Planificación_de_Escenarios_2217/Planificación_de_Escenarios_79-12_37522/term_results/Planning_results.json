A study is made mainly in terms of: (a) the number of links, l; (b) the number of joints, j; and (c) the degree of that link of the chain whose degree is greatest, Δ.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors offer a new hypothesis to solve the general theoretical and practical problem of how collaborative groups evolve: Namely, that these small groups engage in unconscious planning to solve their own problems, and that consultants work best by augmenting this group planning. This hypothesis borrows the concept of individual unconscious planning propounded by Weiss (unpublished) and furthered by Weiss et al. (1977) and Sampson (1976) from the context of individual psychoanalysis and explains group development as the coordinating of individual planning, i.e., as group planning. This involves making prominent in early meetings what general problem the group wishes to control and master, as well as a logical sequence of the order in which difficulties need to be confronted. After introducing the problem, the authors consider four major aspects of the group planning theory: First, the presentation of the theory itself, compared to previous theories of group development; second, exemplification of the theory by detailed narratives of two study groups in an experimental group relations conference conducted by the authors; third, the considerable scientific problems in this and further tests of the group planning theory; fourth, this theory as a special case of the general theory of biological evolution, and in particular the theory of more effective cultural evolution through the use of scientific method (Popper, 1972). </jats:p>",

Statistically significant differences in the preferences of shoppers are found based on the type of township the shopper lives in, the purpose of the shopping trip, and the shopper's income group. Patterns of variation on consumer attitudes as to the perceived importance of various attributes are also established. The implications of the findings for the planning of shopping centers include the noting of the complexity of consumers' images of their shopping environment, and the relatively small part that variables which can be manipulated by planners play in consumer spatial choice. </jats:p>",

The groundwater system is conjunctively managed as a water supply resource and as a storage reservoir for waste water residuals. The waste waters are discharged to the groundwater basin through injection wells. Within the groundwater system, constituents are assumed to follow first‐order chemical or biochemical reactions and linear equilibrium adsorption. The Galerkin finite element method is used to transform the flow and mass transport equations of the aquifer system into systems of ordinary differential equations which are imbedded as constraint equations in the planning model. The mathematical model, which is structured as a nonconvex programing problem, allows the planner or resource manager to determine (1) the optimal pumping and injection schedules (rates and locations) required to satisfy an exogenous water target and waste load demand and (2) the maximum injection concentrations that can be discharged to the basin without degrading the quality of the aquifer. Operational policies are developed for a 480‐day operational cycle for a hypothetical groundwater basin, where it is assumed that groundwater extraction represents the principal resource of the aquifer system. Linear programing is used to identify the optimal planning policies. The important parameters affecting the optimal decisions are discussed.</jats:p>",

The method of plan presentation is vital to the achievement of the objectives of public planning participation. The presentation of plan information succeeds to the extent that it permits the local citizens to visualize how a proposed development fits into the existing physical setting with which they are, by experience, quite familiar. The most widely used visualization tool is the planning map. The purpose of the research reported herein is to create and test the relative communication efficiency of two alternative planning map designs. Pour assurer la participation effective du public dans la formulation de projets destinés à la conception ou à la modification de l'environnement local, il faut que les citoyens d'une localité comprennent mieux le cadre matériel et les relations spatiales de la zone qu'on se propose d'aménager. La méthode de présentation des projets est vitale à la réalisation des objectifs de participation du public à la planification. La présentation des renseignements donnés dans les projets est efficace dans la mesure où elle permet aux citoyens de la collectivité de visualiser comment un aménagement proposé peut être intégré au cadre existant avec lequel ils se sont bien familiarisés à force d'y vivre. L'instrument de visualisation le plus souvent utilisé est la carte de planification.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a previous paper Kunreuther and Morton examined a single product production planning problem in which demand in each of a finite number of periods is known with certainty, and there are linear costs for holding inventory and for adjusting production levels between periods. This paper reexamines the problem, taking advantage of it being a linear program. In particular, the dual problem has considerable structure, and the patterns of variables in dual feasible solutions have interesting geometric properties that afford a great deal of intuition. The requirement of dual feasibility is a more formal approach to the “marginal cost balancing” notion of Kunreuther and Morton and provides some extension and strengthening of the earlier results. A proof with simplified logical structure for the Kunreuther-Morton planning horizon is indicated. Then a different kind of planning horizon result is given. These, in contrast to the K-M planning horizons, occur when future demands increase, such as at the bottom of a seasonal cycle. </jats:p>",

Regional planners are especially concerned with creating an efficient spatial economic structure in order to conserve capital and labor resources. Despite avowed ideological advantages and alleged planning successes, planners in East Germany face many problems encountered by their counterparts in the West. </jats:p>",

In phase one, “Mastery of Basic Instructional Techniques,” student teachers feel inadequate about the mechanics of planning and presenting different kinds of lessons. Performance criteria for specific lessons will guide them in observing their cooperating teachers, in planning such lessons, and in classroom microteaching. In phase two, “Developing Sensitivity to Pupil‐Teacher Interactions,” when student teachers are concerned about teacher and student activity during an entire class period, they may use different instruments to analyze the dynamics, behaviors, interactions, and learning that occurred. Finally, in phase three, “Overall Analysis and Evaluations of Teaching Effectivenes,” gathering data on teacher/student activities and interactions will aid student teachers in looking for recurring patterns of behavior that need changing to improve learning and those behaviors that were effective. All the activities and instruments presented are useful for student teachers in their practicum training and for experienced teachers in self‐evaluation.</jats:p>",

Penalty matrices associated with high‐and low‐yield estimates are then developed, using the results from the HEC‐4 and the dynamic programing models. A multi‐objective optimization problem is then formulated, minimizing the expected monetary penalty (in dollars) and the expected water shortage penalty (in million gallons).

The evidence strongly supports the assumption. It is shown that, given basic model parameters, predictions of duration-of-residence distributions are quite accurate; and, conversely, duration-of-residence data can be used in conjunction with the independence assumption to estimate model parameters. The implication of these findings for the design of mobility studies is discussed, and a question raised as to the necessity of gathering detailed histories. </jats:p>",

Both phone rate and syllable disfluency were progressively reduced from control to WS to PP conditions. These results strongly support the discoordination hypothesis that any condition which facilitates initiation of phonation in coordination with articulation and respiration will reduce stuttering. A broader hypothesis is that effective planning time for voice onset coordinations is the common element that explains the power of retarded phone rate, reduction of phonatory complexity, and rhythm virtually to eliminate stuttering.</jats:p>",

The three Studies were the Long Island Sound Study, the Southeastern New England Study, and the Supplemental Flood Management Study of the Connecticut River Basin Program. The research examined the criteria and procedures used for selection of members, the relevant personal characteristics of the members, the procedures employed for carrying out their responsibilities, and the relative importance of group functions as perceived by both citizen advisors and professional study participants. The impact of these factors upon the effectiveness of citizen advisory groups as a strategy of public participation is evaluated. The paper includes recommendations, derived from the research, for the use of planning agencies seeking to maximize the effectiveness of citizen advisory groups.</jats:p>",
