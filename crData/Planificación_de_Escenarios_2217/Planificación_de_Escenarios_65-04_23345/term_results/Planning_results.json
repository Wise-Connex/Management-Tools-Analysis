The improved use of ground‐water storage is one of the major goals in improving the stewardship of our water resources. While present policies and general procedures are adequate for the attainment of this goal, basic data and detailed techniques need to be further developed before ground water can assume a more significant role in water resources planning. The development of these and the solution of problems attending the use of ground‐water resources will come in time with the assistance of all parties interested in the wise use of our ground‐water resources. The development of techniques for fully integrating ground‐ water resources into comprehensive river basin planning must be accompanied by the development and implementation, at all governmental levels, of sound ground‐water management policies. Progress toward their accomplishment may seem barely perceptible at times but the present high level of interest in all of the nation's water resources bodes well for an early date when optimum use of our ground‐water resources can be planned and developed.</jats:p>",
