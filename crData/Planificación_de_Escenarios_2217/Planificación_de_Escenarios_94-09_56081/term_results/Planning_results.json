This study is motivated by the increasing importance given to IS planning in recent years, the lack of an empirical model in the IS literature to measure a construct as important as IS planning system success, and the usefulness of developing such a model to help guide future research efforts addressing the issue of IS planning effectiveness. An operational model for measuring IS planning system success is developed in terms of two interrelated dimensions: IS planning system capabilities and extent of fulfillment of key IS planning objectives. Due regard is paid to the call for greater attention to methodological issues in developing such measures. The model meets the measurement criteria suggested in the literature. </jats:p>",

By decomposable subassemblies, we mean those clusters of parts that are naturally broken apart from an assembly by decomposition forces. The key feature of the proposed approach is that decomposable subassemblies can be identified from the minimal cut-sets of force-flow networks constructed by assigning bidirectional flow capacity to individual part mating. The flow capacity between two mating parts is defined here as the maximum amount as force that one can exert against its mating part (hypothesized fixed in space) in a chosen direction. Finally, the assemblability of decomposable subassemblies is verified by testing, through force-flow networks, whether the decomposed subassemblies can be reassembled by the mating forces opposite to the decomposition forces. The proposed force-based approach is advantageous due to the polynomial time complexity of a max-flow/min-cut algorithm, as well real-world application.</jats:p>",

Such objects could result in a collision with one of the arms of the robots. Fast collision-free motion planning algorithms are therefore necessary for robotic manipulators to operate in a wide variety of changing environments. The configuration space approach is one of the widely used methods for collision-free robotic path planning. This paper presents a novel graph-based method of searching the configuration space for a collision-free path in a robotic assembly operation. Dijkstra’s graph search algorithm is used for optimizing the joint displacements of the robot while performing the assembly task. The methodology is illustrated using a simple robotic assembly planning task.</jats:p>",

A liaison graph is then formed based on assembly relations among components. The liaison graph is split into two or more pieces by removing the cutvertex from the graph. The pieces may also be split again until basic graph(bi-connected graph) are found. The basic graphs are considered as sub-assemblies. The disassembly sequence for each sub-assembly is determined. The disassembly sequences are then merged to generate a complete disassembly sequence for the product. Finally, the assembly sequence is defined by reversing the complete disassembly sequence.</jats:p>",

Design of sculptured surfaces is evolutionary, consisting primarily of incremental changes to existing part surfaces. Manual operation planning for sculptured surface machining is known to be error-prone and inefficient, which requires considerable checking, verification, and rework. Five-axis machining has higher productivity and better machining quality than 3-axis machining. However, the programming for 5-axis machining is more difficult due to the complex simultaneous cutter movements along the machine’s five axes. This paper presents a systematic methodology to generate operation plans for 5-axis sculptured surface machining. A complete operation plan and the error-free cutter path can be automatically generated from the CAD part design. To achieve design for manufacturing of sculptured surface products, the machining unfeasibility information can be fed back to the designer for further design modification. Results of computer implementation and testing examples are also presented.</jats:p>",

A single facility comprising a number of work-centers that produce multiple part types is considered. The planning horizon includes a sequence of time periods, and the demand for all part types is assumed to be known. The production planning problem consists of minimizing the holding costs for all part types as well as the work-in-process, and backlogging cost for the end items. We present a two-level hierarchy that is based on aggregating parts to part families, work-centers to manufacturing cells and time periods to aggregate time periods. The solution at the aggregate level is imposed as a constraint to the detailed level problem which employs a decomposition based on manufacturing cells. This architecture uses a rolling horizon strategy to perform the production management function. We have employed perturbation analysis techniques to adjust certain parameters of the optimization problems at the detailed level to reach a near-optimal detailed production plan.</jats:p>",

The first step is to transform the TOPP problem into a nonlinear programming problem by an iterative procedure. Then an approach to find the initial feasible solutions of the problem is proposed. Since initial feasible solutions can be found easily, the optimization process of the nonlinear programming problem can be started from different points to find the global minimum. A planar three-link robotic manipulator is used to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

The proposed Petri net model 1) represents manufacturing knowledge of the type of precedence relations constraints 2) represents dynamically the process planning procedure itself, and 3) encapsulates all possible process planning solutions (process plans). Furthermore, process planning simulation can be performed directly on the Petri net and reachability analysis of the model gives the complete set of solutions (process plans). Then, optimum solutions can be found by using a method based on heuristics.</jats:p>",

A kinematic model, including the general nonholonomic constraint equation, is developed first, followed by the analysis of some general maneuvering characteristics of the WMR. The analytic solutions to the typical path curves, such as circle and straight line, which are important in the path planning problem, are also derived. From the analysis of the established kinematic model, some factors which affect the path planning problem for a WMR and therefore must be taken into account are revealed and the general description of the path planning problem for a WMR is formuated. In conclusion, a possible architecture of the algorithm for a practical WMR is presented.</jats:p>",

This is attributed partly to the effects of the same incremental practices which termination was designed to solve; partly to the difficulties of distinguishing the categories of ‘termination’ from ‘succession’; and partly to Kaufman's assertion that organisational survival was a matter of chance, and therefore not fruitful to study. Academic interest in governmental cessations remains firmly rooted in the termination of organisations; much less attention has been paid to the ending of policies and programmes. Management science research can be used to challenge assertions about the lack of pattern in organisational survival, and the way in which political science has operationalised the concept of incrementalism, suggesting the applicability of semirationalist techniques in an incrementalist world. With a hierarchical reformulation of de Leon's 1978 categorisation of governmental functions, organisations, policies, and programmes it is here suggested that termination and succession are distinct. The aim is to demonstrate the practical utility of the termination concept, both for analysis and for practitioners whose interest is centred on the opportunity-cost savings which cessations can make available. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the purpose of the paper is to empirically verify a framework proposed by Thibault, Slack, and Hinings (1993) for the analysis of strategy in nonprofit sport organizations and to locate a sample of national level sport organizations within this framework according to their strategic type. The results of the study support the existence and utility of the two dimensions identified in Thibault et al.'s framework. They also reveal that there are common characteristics within the organizations that constitute each of the framework's four strategic types. The identification of these characteristics provides us with a preliminary understanding of the strategic initiatives being pursued by those sport organizations.</jats:p>",

The conclusion is that, for complex manufacturing systems, this cannot be done in such a straightforward way as described in literature. The original method is best used for manufacturing of parts only, i.e. to find the appropriate process variables (PVs).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the case of complex manufacturing systems, a one-to-one mapping between physical domain and process domain is not possible since not all design parameters (DP) are components. Therefore, an additional process requirement domain (PR), proposed earlier, has been used. With it, the components are extracted from the DP hierarchy and mapped to different spaces in the manufacturing world. In these spaces, PRs and PVs are selected when designing the manufacturing system. An example is given to show the deficiencies and how to use the suggested modifications.</jats:p>",

Data were also collected from registers and medical and professional records. All the 36 patients discharged to their own homes, mostly after home assessment, or to old people's homes were followed up. The median rehabilitation stay was 30 days. Their medical status was stable over time and nursing interventions remained frequent. The functional level was unchanged for 18, and further enhanced for 10 patients. Most patients felt secure at home and received the home help they anticipated. Worries were expressed by one-third on realistic grounds, mainly medical or ideas on the accommodation. Some interventions were required and carried out by the team. Home living was as expected or better for two-thirds of the patients. The timing and the patient's situation at discharge seemed to have been well assessed, with an overall positive outcome after a month at home. Further development of practical multidimensional evaluations adapted to elderly patients is necessary in a quality assurance perspective.</jats:p>"

It is a reasonable proposition that the final solution will somehow be a kind of assignment system, but it is unclear what path will have to be followed to reach that stated goal. The present system of revenue sharing is based on shared taxes and subventions. It is a two-tiered system, with the federal government laying down the rules for central–oblast sharing, and each oblast making the rules for the local governments within its jurisdiction. This paper updates a World Bank analysis of the revenue-sharing system in the Russian Federation, using actual data for 1992 and the most current tax-sharing rules and adds some empirical evidence to what is known about the intra-oblast dimension of revenue sharing. </jats:p>",

Unlike holonomic constraints, these constraints do not reduce the number of dimensions of the configuration space of a system. Therefore a nonholonomic system can access a configuration space of dimension higher than the number of the degrees of freedom of the system. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for planning admissible trajectories for nonholonomic systems that will take the system from one point in its configuration space to another. In our algorithm the independent variables are first converged to their desired values. Subsequently, closed trajectories of the independent variables are used to converge the dependent variables. We use Green’s theorem in our algorithm to convert the problem of finding a closed path into that of finding a surface area in the space of the independent variables such that the dependent variables converge to their desired values as the independent variables traverse along the boundary of this surface area. Using this approach, we specifically address issues related to the reachability of the system, motion planning amidst additional constraints, and repeatable motion of nonholonomic systems. The salient features of our algorithm are quite apparent in the two examples we discuss: a planar space robot and a disk rolling without slipping on a flat surface.</jats:p>",

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), and related regulations require public involvement in determining impacts, iden tifying threats and deciding on remedial environmental actions. Federal environmental planning is oriented towards allowing forums for airing pub lic concerns, without direct public control of decisions. The paper uses the sociology of risk literature to show how the actors and processes have been structured through law and regulation. Following Stallings's (1990) frame work of the social organization of risk discourse, this paper identifies the claims makers, stakeholders, and risk definers within the NEPA and CERCLA processes. The processes include definition soliciting, information dissemi nation, claims making and risk defining. The paper concludes by stressing the need for public involvement policy to be grounded theory and research. </jats:p>",

This generation method resembles much the reasoning pattern of a human process planner. The developments are carried out in the framework of the ongoing Esprit project 6805 COMPLAN.

This paper describes a hybrid approach for identifying the optimal operation sequence of machining prismatic parts on a three-axis milling machining centre. In the proposed methodology, the operation sequencing is carried out in two levels of planning: set-up planning and operation planning. Various constraints on the precedence relationships between features are identified and rules and heuristics are created. Based on the precedence relationships between features, an optimization method is developed to find the optimal plan(s) with minimum number of set-ups in which the conflict between the feature precedence relationships and set-up sequence is avoided. For each set-up, an optimal feature machining sequence with minimum number of tool changes is also determined using a developed algorithm. The proposed system is still under development and the hybrid approach is partially implemented. An example is provided to demonstrate this approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an examination of the critical role the assignment of expenditure responsibilities must play in building the Russian Federation. The fiscal federalism system and the expenditure assignments inherited from the Soviet Union were not truly decentralized. All the real decisions were made back in Moscow. Although subnational governments now have authority to create their own budgets, past processes and institutions still undermine local autonomy. However, the most serious threat to the Russian Federation comes from the lack of a stable assignment of responsibilities. Primarily for budgetary convenience, the federal government has jettisoned certain expenditure responsibilities onto oblast and rayon governments in the past two years, putting Russian intergovernmental relations on a perilous path. So far, the Parliament and the Executive have failed to recognize that a stable expenditure assignment is the first and necessary step in the design of a lasting system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. Instead, the political system has concentrated entirely on revenue assignments which have not endured. The author analyzes several sets of issues that must be addressed in the design of a stable assignment of expenditure responsibilities in the Russian Federation, including the reassignment of social expenditures and social safety-net responsibilities, the reassignment of capital spending responsibilities, and the divestiture of public services by state enterprises. </jats:p>",

Resource dependency theory suggests that hospital and community environments are likely to affect the discharge planning process through discharge planners'perceptions of the adequacy of resources in those environments. A stratified random sample of discharge planning coordinators in 60 metropolitan and 59 nonmetropolitan acute care hospitals in Ohio were sent questionnaires on the discharge and referral process of elderly patients. Findings indicate that discharge personnel of nonmetropolitan and large inner-city metropolitan hospitals are less likely than those of moderate-sized metropolitan hospitals to feel that an adequate amount of paid home care services is available in the community. Moreover, discharge departments of nonmetropolitan and large inner-city metropolitan hospitals are more likely to rely on patient financial information and informal care availability in discharge planning. Discharge departments in these hospitals also are more likely to train informal caregivers and maintain postdischarge contact. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The character of a trip from an origin to a destination is defined by the quasi-utility functions of place utility, trip assessment, and destination expectation. A specific place utility field is determined by a distance minimisation strategy and is generalised for a trip to a destination in any direction with a constant utility. This field is formed by assessing the direction of all trip possibilities and is shown to form rotations with discrete indexes in the psychological domain. The problem is that these trajectories imply that the individual has no memory of past trips, as for stability they tend to zero over time. A solution is to develop an analogy to a conservation principle (such as in physics) and rewrite the spatial preference results as quantum postulates. The rotations are interpreted as a Hermitian matrix and sets of commutation relations are developed for the transfer of information between psychological and physical space. The major results from this formulation are, first, that the velocity of the trip is critical in determining the uncertainty of the transformation of utility from the psychological domain. Second, the individual's speed is related to the probability of route selection. An equation is defined for the trip in a general place utility field and the result is applied to illustrate the initial spatial preference formation and the axis of indifference. It is shown that an individual with no place utility will resort to maximising choice at a point with the most destination alternatives. </jats:p>",

Decentralization represents both a reaction from below to the previously tight political control from the center and an attempt from above to further the privatization of the economy and to relieve the strained fiscal situation of the central government. Although there are of course many variations in this process from country to country, some important common elements arise from the similar institutional starting point in all countries and the common transitional problems most of them are facing. The on-going reforms of subnational finance in the transitional economies are more important than seems generally to be recognized. The design of a well-functioning intergovernmental fiscal system is key to many of the major reform goals of the transition economies—macroeconomic stability, privatization, and the social safety net. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last twenty years, fundamental changes have taken place in the structure of employment in the highly developed countries. In particular, the number of jobs in manufacturing has decreased, but service employment has increased considerably. This has been associated with an increase in the number of women in paid work, as well as with regional shifts in growth and decline. However, despite these fundamental changes, in Germany the pattern of female labour-market participation has, in contrast, been stable over the last 100 years. The authors aim to develop an explanation for this contrast. </jats:p><jats:p> Labour-market analysis does not provide an adequate explanation, for there is no simple relation between female participation in employment and the presence or absence of typical ‘female’ jobs. Rather, explanations lie outside the remit of current labour-market explanations. To this end the authors examine regional differences in the ‘modernisation’ of life-styles since industrialisation in the nineteenth century. Industrialisation progressively removed paid employment from the home, which became more purely a site for housework undertaken by women. However, this process varied regionally, and resulted in regionally specific female roles of dual orientation to paid work and unpaid housework. Female participation in the labour force, therefore, took different forms—and means different things—in different regions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper British politicians' understanding of, and attitudes towards, an important element of global environmental change are analysed through study of the parliamentary record Hansard, especially questions to ministers. In particular, attention is given to the evolution of debates concerning stratospheric ozone depletion during the period 1970–92, This focus reflects the importance of ozone depiction as an issue per se, but is also consistent with the wider argument that we need to study the development of specific environmental issues if we are to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the greening of politics; a process hitherto frequently considered as a somewhat incoherent whole, The aim is to trace the chronology of concern about stratospheric ozone, to identify the stimuli to interest in the issue, and to analyse the content and limitations of discussion. This last involves examination of interaction between a global environmental issue and the ideologies of the British national party-political system. The value of consideration of national debate about global issues is thus asserted, National and international debate and diplomacy form interacting elements of a ‘two-level game’ through which politics and environmental concerns become engaged. Previous studies which were focused chiefly on the evolution of a new environmental diplomacy at the international level thus tell only part of the story.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Central and Eastern European countries are undergoing a radical transformation from command to market economics. Although priority has focused on privatisation, these countries have intitiated extensive political and fiscal decentralization. Despite the recent establishment of new local governments, these countries arc struggling to develop rapidly the legislative and administrative foundations related to expenditure and revenue responsibilities, control of state-owned assets, and the relationship between regional and central governments. One remaining obstacle to effective decentralization is the lack of adequate local revenue. Although there is a wide diversity in the structure of local revenue systems, theory and experience indicate that user charges and property taxes traditionally provide the primary base for an effective and stable local revenue system. This paper focuses on the important role which property taxation can play in providing the foundation for stable local revenue systems in the transitional countries. The paper begins with a brief summary of the current international experience with property tax reform. These international lessons are then applied to two transitional countries, namely Poland and Albania. </jats:p>",

Assigning resource revenues entirely to subnational governments would undermine the fiscal capacity of the central government, Resources arc so concentrated geographically that allocating revenues primarily to jurisdictions where production occurs would create large fiscal disparities among subnational governments. Either of these policies could encourage the disintegration of the Federation—as could a contrary policy. </jats:p><jats:p> After a brief review of the concept of economic rent, the theory of tax assignment is examined and applied to taxes on natural resources. Whereas economic arguments tend to favor centralization of resource rents, political realities suggest decentralization. It is noted that there will be many claimants to potential rents from Russian natural resources, including consumers, native peoples, suppliers of oilfield equipment, pipeline companies, foreign investors, and managers and employees in the energy sector and its suppliers. Last, consideration is given to whether resource rents should be placed in trust funds, by either native peoples or the government of producing regions, and the experience of Alberta and Alaska in this area is reviewed. </jats:p>",

This study examines whether state family planning expenditures and abortion funding for Medicaid-eligible women might reduce the number of low-birthweight babies, babies with late or no prenatal care, and premature births, as well as the rates of infant and neonatal mortality. METHODS. Using a pooled time-series analysis from 1982 to 1988 with the 50 states as units of analysis, this study assessed the impact of family planning expenditures and abortion funding on several public health outcomes while controlling for other important variables and statistical problems inherent in pooled time-series studies. RESULTS. States that funded abortions had a significantly higher rate of abortions and significantly lower rates of teen pregnancy, low-birthweight babies, premature births, and births with late or no prenatal care. States that had higher expenditures for family planning had significantly fewer abortions, low-birthweight babies, births with late or no prenatal care, infant deaths, and neonatal deaths. CONCLUSIONS. Funding abortions for Medicaid-eligible women and increasing the level of expenditures for family planning are associated with major differences in infant and maternal health in the United States. </jats:p>",

The concepts of a ‘gender contract’ and of the ‘family and integration model’ are used. </jats:p><jats:p> It becomes clear that, in Germany, part-time work has been an important means for the modernisation of the gender contract concerning the family and integration model during the tertiarisation process. In Finland, where a family model based on partnership dominates, the sociocultural and institutional basis for this form of employment is almost entirely lacking. Tertiarisation did not lead to an expansion of part-time employment. </jats:p><jats:p> It is argued that sociohistorical factors related to the industrialisation process are highly significant in the explanation of these differences. It is possible to distinguish ideal-typically two different models of the development of the industrial society, in which those factors are shaped and combined in a characteristic way. These different models lead to different types of gender contract and different chracteristic patterns of labour force behaviour, by women, in the transition to a service society. </jats:p>",

Dependence on welfare, in particular, is often offered as evidence of their marginalised, disadvantaged status. We argue, in contrast, that being ‘on welfare’ can be seen as a positive opportunity for certain groups of lone mothers at certain periods in their lives. Our research revealed an ambivalence in these women's attitudes towards welfare. On the one hand, they feel various constraints as a result of their dependence on welfare; on the other, however, they feel it also enables them to lead the life-style they prefer. They are unwilling to marry or remain in marriages simply because of the presence of children. They are willing to take responsibility for child care themselves and to abandon or cut back paid employment, at least for a period of time; but they refuse to depend upon a husband's maintenance. In this situation, the state becomes the more acceptable breadwinner. </jats:p>",

In this paper this proposition is tested by examining the impact of economic restructuring on West Germany's foreign work force in the 1980s. With data for the socially insured section of the employed population it is demonstrated that male foreign workers in particular have been differentially and adversely affected across the entire range of manufacturing and construction industries, with a gradual replacement of foreign by indigenous workers. Contraction of employment in these crucial sectors was only partially compensated by a limited expansion of employment for mainly female foreign workers in selected service activities. The analysis also indicates that this general retreat of foreign labour has been mediated by regional differences in overall economic performance, expressed in a widening north-south divide and a growing focus on core areas of foreign population. It is concluded that the German economy in the post-Fordist phase has witnessed a further marginalisation of its foreign work force, long seen as a ‘structural necessity’. </jats:p>",

The authors discuss these recent reforms in Budapest, and examine their impact on the solvency of local governments there. The analysis suggests that a continuation of the current pricing policies now in place in Budapest will pose serious long-run solvency problems for the new local governments that have been given ownership of the assets, effectively decapitalizing many of them. Even so, the privatization is unlikely to lead to a change in these pricing policies, and it may well lead the local governments to undertake actions that adversely affect the broader stabilization program. </jats:p>",

After a general outline of the changing distribution of work, the example of financial services, which are of enormous significance in global cities such as London, will be taken to investigate the consequences of the coincidence of these changes for employees in professional occupations. The particular empirical illustration of the arguments is an analysis of the social division of labour in merchant banks in the City of London in the early 1990s. </jats:p>",

Inherent in these initiatives, however, are a number of possible sources of tension which, left unresolved, may hamper the intentions of governments to seed grass-roots solutions to community problems. A qualitative research methodology was used to examine the nature of the relationship between government and community representatives (both residents and local service providers) in establishing community-based primary prevention programs under the auspices of the Better Beginnings, Better Futures initiative of the Government of Ontario. We examine a number of issues and tensions that have arisen from this project, both during the development of the program model by the government, and through to its implementation in several communities in the province. </jats:p>",
