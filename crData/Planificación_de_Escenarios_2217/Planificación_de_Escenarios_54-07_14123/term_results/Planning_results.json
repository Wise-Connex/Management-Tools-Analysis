A cooperative program was launched by the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, the Extension Service, TVA, PMA, and BPISAE of the USDA, in Lawrence County, Tenn., to help meet this need. A detailed soil survey of the county, the first step in this program, was begun in 1948. This was a cooperative project involving the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, TVA, and BPISAE. Soil maps of the separate farms were made subsequently. The soils, grouped according to their management requirements, were represented on these maps by distinguishing colors. A bulletin was published by the University of Tennessee in which the management requirements of each soil group were given for the crops important in the agriculture of the area. Group meetings of farmers were used as the chief channel through which the farm maps and copies of the bulletin were distributed and discussed by Extension workers.</jats:p><jats:p>Such a program is an approach to the task of bringing about a more efficient use of the farm resources that should be of interest to agricultural workers.</jats:p>",
