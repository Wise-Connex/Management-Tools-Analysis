It is likely that such nonmarket factors as local building restrictions, differential mortgage financing policies, and real-estate agent behavior contribute to the relative inability of the cross-sectional model to predict change. In addition, the relationship of independent variables to price change shows great variation among different housing submarkets, casting doubt on the assumption that elasticities derived by a hedonic study for the metropolitan area as a whole represent the utility functions of buyers within more limited housing submarkets. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the major functions of State and Federal Public Health agencies is the collection and maintenance of large amounts of data. The utilization of this data for research and planning may be impaired by such factors as: lack of organization and accessibility of the data, users lack of knowledge of statistical and operations research techniques, inability to determine important variables from a large selection, and the need to present results in a form which is understandable and useful to the general public.This paper presents interactive graphics approaches which are designed to aid the public health planner and administrator through presentation of data in map and table form. Interactive graphics is a form of real time computing in which all or part of the input and output operations are handled through a graphics terminal. The systems described below present statistics for different civil divisions and allow the user to display and compare data from a large set of variables. These variables include locational data such as the position of emergency medical services, hospitals, cities and towns; quantities such as travel distance, travel time, service area, and service population; and summary statistics. The display is controlled either through light pen activated commands or the use of a \"button board\". The systems have been applied to problems in administrative area designation and emergency service placement.The use of interactive graphics allows the public health planner and administrator to handle large data bases with minimal expertise. Data may be reviewed quickly and useful variable selected. These systems also allow for the maximum use of the administrators experience and knowledge of the areas particular needs and qualitative factors by allowing direct interface to the data. These systems require a minimal amount of training to use, thus allowing interested public groups to use them to develop and compare different solutions to health planning and administrative problems.</jats:p>",

Analogies can be found with paths of light and other least-time paths, and with geodesics. The problem is often solved by finding a path through a lattice of sample costs, with the use of modified shortest-path algorithms. Lattice paths do not converge to continuous-space paths. The differences are shown to depend on the set of permitted moves in the lattice, with the use of three cases. The continuous-space problem is solved for surfaces described by simple functions and for choropleth surfaces, and compared with lattice solutions. Three heuristic approaches for large problems are reviewed, with emphasis placed on regular spatial aggregation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes an operations research procedure based on the theory of graphs. It serves to determine optimal locations for the facilities of a regional system of solid-waste and wastewater disposals, with consideration of transportation costs, processing costs, and pollution standards. In the literature, planning problems of this kind are solved by means of combined, binary, linear optimization algorithms. The procedure presented here is based on a branch-and-bound method and a flow-graph algorithm. Within this approach it is possible to integrate explicitly equipment such as incinerators, or composting plants, or sewage treatment plants, where quantity reducing processes occur. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An initial reaction among many observers of urban America to recently released data showing a net migration out of its metropolitan areas is that this phenomenon must reflect nothing more than an accelerated expansion of these areas beyond their conventionally defined borders. This paper tests this hypothesis by tracing out the behavior of the Hoover index for five levels of areal disaggregation in the US. In Statistical Geography, Duncan and his collaborators found that for the period 1900–1950 there was dispersal at the finest and coarsest grains of areal disaggregation (reflecting city—suburb and East—West dispersal, respectively) and concentration at intermediate grains (reflecting rural-urban migration). We find that, by 1970, dispersal was occurring at all levels of areal disaggregation. That is, using the county as our basic unit of analysis, and building up increasingly more aggregated regions based on these units, we are unable to find an increase in concentration at any level of areal aggregation. We conclude that dispersal is more than a statistical artifact of the way in which metropolitan areas are defined. </jats:p>",
