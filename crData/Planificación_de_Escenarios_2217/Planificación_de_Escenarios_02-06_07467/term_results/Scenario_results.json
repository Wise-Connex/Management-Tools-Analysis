      "abstract": "<jats:p>Exposure scenarios are a critical part of risk assessment; however, representative scenarios are not generally available for tribal communities where a traditional subsistence lifestyle and diet are relevant and actively encouraged. This article presents portions of a multipathway exposure scenario developed by AESE, Inc. in conjunction with the Spokane Tribal Cultural Resources Program. The scenario serves as the basis for a screening‐level reasonable maximum exposure (RME) developed for the Midnite Uranium Mine Superfund site. The process used in developing this scenario balances the need to characterize exposures without revealing proprietary information. The scenario and resulting RME reflect the subsistence use of original and existing natural resources by a hypothetical but representative family living on the reservation at or near the mine site. The representative family lives in a house in a sparsely populated conifer forest, tends a home garden, partakes in a high rate of subsistence activities (hunting, gathering, fishing), uses a sweat lodge daily, has a regular schedule of other cultural activities, and has members employed in outdoor monitoring of natural and cultural resources. The scenario includes two largely subsistence diets based on fish or game, both of which include native plants and home‐grown produce. Data gaps and sources of uncertainty are identified. Additional information that risk assessors and agencies need to understand before doing any kind of risk assessment or public health assessment in tribal situations is presented.</jats:p>",

That interval includes sedimentary facies otherwise unknown in older Wenlock to early Ludlow strata on Gotland. The identified sequence of changes includes a detailed record of, in order: two extinctions (Datum points 1 and 1·5); widespread deposition of carbon-rich sediments extensive enough to cause a <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C increase of <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 4.8‰, the onset, maximum and end of a sea-level fall and rise of at least 16 m during 30 kyr; a third extinction (Datum 2); a disaster fauna; and a slow faunal recovery. Thus, a secondary result of the event was a weakened greenhouse effect triggering a glaciation: the Gannarve Glaciation (new term). The order of changes proves that regression did not cause the extinctions. Faunal and sea-level changes, as well as the sedimentary succession, fit well with predictions based on an oceanic model. Extinctions were primarily caused by a severe drop in primary planktonic productivity, causing starvation among planktonic larvae in non-coastal settings. The Grötlingbo Bentonite (new term), the thickest in the Wenlock of Gotland, was deposited across the basin shortly after Datum 2. Temporal resolution is high enough to permit some comparison with Quaternary glaciations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Contingency management, in particular the management of unanticipated events outside the control of an ordinary planning system has, in the last 50 years, become an important and frequently debated issue in the scientific literature on complex systems management under risk conditions. The urban system can be regarded as such an open complex system where external events, not always foreseeable with a closed system’s model, may strongly impact on the internal dynamics of an urban area. Conventionally, planning the future presupposes collecting information and analyzing it rationally in order to control for unexpected contingency events. But it is an important question in the field of urban planning how proper strategies can be developed to deal with external uncertainty and shocks that transcend the imagination of policy‐makers. How should decision‐makers respond to such unforeseen jumps in a system? The aim of this article is to present and apply a new <jats:italic>scientific</jats:italic> decision support method based on the future studies literature, with the aim to help decision‐makers in the strategic management of uncertainty and risk in order ‘<jats:italic>to anticipate the extraordinary events correctly in order to act more effectively</jats:italic>’ (Godet, 1987). In particular, we here deploy the scenario methodology in combination with multicriteria analysis and fuzzy set theory, as a useful learning tool for the governance of complex dynamic systems. In current debates on policy‐makers’ possible reactions to uncertainty (e.g., in the context of sustainability strategies), very often the socalled ‘no regret’ principle is advocated. The validity of this approach is tested, in the context of the present article, on real‐world threats in the Vesuvio volcanic area in the vicinity of the densely populated city of Naples, Italy. Four different policy scenarios are developed with the purpose to examine, control and reduce the risk for the people concerned in case of a future volcanic eruption and to lay, at the same time, the foundation for a drastic rehabilitation of the entire metropolitan area.</jats:p>",

Angiography showed the following: the right coronary artery (RCA) had a normal course, whilst the left anterior descending (LAD) as well as the left circumflex (LCX) branches both originated separately from the proximal RCA, which served as a common mixed trunk. The LAD crossed to the left in front of the right ventricular outflow tract, whilst the LCX, taking a retroaortic course to the atrioventricular groove, had a distal occlusion. According to an anatomically based classification considering all imaginable variations, this configuration corresponds to a II‐D‐1 pattern, which previously has been described only in a single postmortem case. After the LCX was reopened with a guide wire, a coronary stent was successfully inserted, resulting in TIMI‐3 flow. Recovery was uneventful.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Union Territory of India, are home to six primitive tribes. Studies carried out earlier among these tribes revealed very high rates of hepatitis B infection. We have now studied hepatitis A and E infection among them. A total of 951 serum samples were collected from four accessible tribes (Nicobarese, Shompens, Onges and Great Andamanese) and tested for antibodies against hepatitis A and E viruses. In addition, 240 serum samples collected a decade earlier from age‐stratified Nicobarese were also screened. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection was found to be highly endemic among all the tribes, whereas hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection was common among the Nicobarese and Shompens. The age group‐wise prevalence of these infections among the Nicobarese showed different patterns, HAV prevalence rising significantly from those aged 10 years and thereafter reaching a plateau, whereas HEV prevalence was found to be more evenly distributed over all age groups, but rising somewhat after 30 years of age. Over the last decade, the prevalence of HAV among the Nicobarese has declined slightly, particularly in those aged 10 years or less whereas HEV infection has more than doubled over all age ranges. Different HEV prevalence observed among the tribes could not be attributed to differences in sanitation or water supply. This fact and the different age‐wise patterns of HAV and HEV prevalences is suggestive of different modes of transmission of HEV that are not shared. The highest rates for HEV were among those tribes which reared pigs suggesting that pigs might serve as reservoir of HEV. Further studies are needed, however, to validate these findings.</jats:p>",
