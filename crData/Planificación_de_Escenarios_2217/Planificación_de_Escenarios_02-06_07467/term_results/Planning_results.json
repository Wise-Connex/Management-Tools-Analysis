      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much communicative planning is consensus oriented and rests on ideas of deliberative democracy. Planning recommendations made by dialogue are based on the intellectual force of arguments giving reasoned rankings of the planning alternatives. Dialogue encompasses the amalgamation of arguments in accordance with democratic criteria ensuring the communicative rationality of the process and the legitimacy of the recommendation. The balancing and weighing of arguments should avoid decision cycles that would make the recommendation of a plan arbitrary. By an analogy with Arrow’s theorem on the general impossibility of consistent and fair social choice, it is demonstrated that dialogue cannot ensure consistent recommendations and simultaneously prepare for political decision making in a democratic manner. The result is valid for debates over planning alternatives when differences in quality are not comparable across all the important arguments (concerning noise, safety, visual standard, social impact, etc.), which is the most common situation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides an answer to what has been called the biggest problem in theorizing and understanding planning: the ambivalence about power found among planning researchers, theorists, and students. The author narrates how he came to work with issues of power and gives an example of how the methodology he developed for power studies—phronetic planning research—may be employed in practice. Phronetic planning research follows the tradition of power studies running from Machiavelli and Nietzsche to Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. It focuses on four value-rational questions: (1) Where are we going with planning? (2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What should be done? These questions are exemplified for a specific instance of Scandinavian urban planning. The author finds that the questions, and their answers, make a difference to planning in practice. They make planning research matter. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The poor performance of most family planning programs in the 1980s, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa, generated concern among researchers and led to a quest for explanations. In most countries, the alienation of men from participation in these programs was subsequently identified as one of the major causes, a finding that led researchers to redirect their attention to couples instead of individuals as the focus of such programs. Lack of spousal communication about family planning was identified as one reason for the low level of contraceptive use among women. Subsequent research has persistently demonstrated a positive relationship between spousal communication and contraceptive use. Most prior studies on this topic have been based on cross‐sectional data, so that whether the identified relationships are causal remains unclear. Does communication, in fact, predict contraceptive use, or does the use of contraceptives generate communication among couples? This study addresses the question of causality by using longitudinal data from the Navrongo Health Research Centre panel survey. Results from both cross‐sectional and longitudinal analysis demonstrate that spousal communication does, indeed, predict contraceptive behavior, even when other factors are controlled.</jats:p>",

This is not true in real cities because densities vary substantially from city to city and from urban center to periphery areas. Development density, which affects urban form, is an important factor in urban planning. The authors present a CA model that incorporates density gradient in the simulation of urban development for different urban forms. Development density is obtained from density-decay functions and assigned to the cells when they are converted into developed cells according to CA transition rules. The model, which is based on the concept of ‘grey cells’, can be used as a planning model to explore various combinations of urban forms and development densities. The authors also evaluate and compare the development patterns generated by different density gradients. It is found that development scenarios with high-density development can significantly reduce encroachment on agricultural land and other important environmentally sensitive areas. </jats:p>",

Planning instruction related to computing technologies should include critical appraisal of their potential for distortion of communication. The findings from an assessment reveal that students’ naive use of spreadsheet technologies increases the likelihood that analytic reports will be marred by distortions of communication. Planning students should be taught to anticipate systematic communication distortions that may arise as inevitable consequences of technological dimensions of everyday decisions. Further investigation is needed into the roles of computing technology in planning classrooms. </jats:p>",

This is a gap in the literature that this article attempts to fill. Two data sets lie at the heart of this work: (1) a census of the WWW sites of Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning (ACSP)-accredited planning programs and (2) a student survey of online information preferences. Findings indicate that the supply of information reflects demand rather well, with only a few existing gaps in online information. Despite this, a number of shortcomings remain concerning online information provision by planning programs. Web sites should emphasize content, but organization, connectivity, and style all play important roles in effective recruitment as well. </jats:p>",

It is argued that traditional rules of composition favour fractal forms such as these, and advice on composition, taken from Ruskin, is examined to support this view. Because fractals are ubiquitous in nature their use in design offers a way to appear natural. The lack of fractals in modern architecture may therefore be connected to a lack of interest in picturesque composition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the course of a broad liberalisation and globalisation of South African society, the transformation of the apartheid city to the postapartheid city has contributed to an increase in crime as well as a feeling of insecurity among the people. Urban blight has changed a lot of the inner cities into ‘no-go areas’ for blacks and whites. For personal protection, since the end of the 1980s (the phase of the abolition of apartheid laws) living areas have been created in the suburbs whose uniqueness and exclusiveness are defined by the amount of safety measures. These are called gated or walled communities, or security villages, and their population structure combines social and racial segregation. The authors made a complete survey of two housing areas in northern Johannesburg in 1999. The traditional wish of South African families for a big estate and a home of their own has been replaced by the wish to live in town houses, cluster housing, and sectional title flats with shared use of swimming pools or tennis courts. </jats:p>",

New development covered a wide geographic area in 1990 but became more geographically concentrated with time. Metropolitan Phoenix is organized into five belts: (1) an outer rural zone, (2) an area of pioneer settlement where the construction of single-family housing began in 1990, (3) a peak zone of intensive development, (4) a zone of infill, and (5) a built-up area where little new construction occurs. Multiple-family housing construction occurs primarily in the infill zone. Between 1995 and 1998, new home construction moved outward at the pace of almost one-half mile per year to an average distance of 18.94 miles from the metropolitan center. Planners can use information about the size, shape, type, and timing of urban fringe development to anticipate infrastructure and service needs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Discussions about gated communities, shopping malls, and industrial parks—proprietary developments produced by entrepreneurs—frequently espouse overly simplistic notions of private and public realms, viewing the encroachment of the latter by the former as a threat. In this essay I develop the thesis that, in reality, cities naturally fragment into many small publics, each of which may be thought of as a collective consumption club. The club realm may, therefore, be a more useful—and theoretically more powerful—idea than the public realm. I argue that proprietary communities are a particular case of urban consumption club—one in which legal property rights over neighbourhood public goods are assigned by property-market institutions. In other respects, the club realms that they create are not dissimilar from club realms created by other urban governance institutions. Government, the markets, and voluntary community action can all effectively assign property rights over shared neighbourhood goods, and in so doing create a set of included ‘members’ and a set of excluded ‘nonmembers’. In contextualising the discussions of gated communities in this way, I draw connections between three interrelated concepts: public goods, the public domain, and the public realm. </jats:p>",

This study examines how changes in socioeconomic conditions in Mongolia have affected fertility patterns in recent times. It also provides an outline of changes that have taken place in terms of pronatalist policies. Data are drawn from the Reproductive Health Survey of Mongolia conducted in 1998. Among the older cohort, the relationship between economic activity and fertility is inverse but weak, whereas among the younger cohort, the economic downturn has had a strongly depressing effect on fertility. Important effects of micro‐level variables, including education and housing, are also noted. The findings suggest that the fertility decline observed for the older cohorts is part of the first demographic transition, in which the collapse of pronatalist policies was influential</jats:p>",

In the 15 countries included in this analysis, the total fertility rate would be between 28 and 64 percent lower if the births following discontinuations that were not the result of a desire to become pregnant had not occurred. The all‐method discontinuation rate for quality‐related reasons emerges as the most likely candidate for a summary measure of quality of care. Within a year of starting use of a method, between 7 and 27 percent of women cease to practice contraception for reasons related to the quality of the service environment. The results imply that as fertility declines, family planning programs would profit from a shift in emphasis from providing methods to new clients toward providing services to reduce discontinuation rates.</jats:p>",

Their question is to what extent these developments represent a reappearance of the fragmented settlement patterns in many of the old towns. On the one hand, new compounds of several villas and common facilities housing extended families in Riyadh may be interpreted as a revival of certain sociospatial settings in the old town, in which extended families often shared a common courtyard. The compounds for Western foreigners in Saudi Arabia follow the principle of spatial seclusion of social groups with different cultural and religious backgrounds—a principle of the sociospatial organization of many old towns in the Arab world. The emergence of gated housing estates in Lebanon, on the other hand, has obvious and specific sociopolitical origins in the 20th century. The failure of public regimentation and provision created a gap, which was partially filled by the private sector. For their mostly wealthy clientele, gated housing estates offer private small-scale solutions to nationwide problems. </jats:p>",

As a result, many of them soon have a subsequent unplanned pregnancy or a repeat abortion, placing their health at increased risk. This report presents the results of a prospective intervention study on postabortion family planning conducted in the two largest public hospitals in Zimbabwe. Women at Harare Central Hospital, in the capital, received a postabortion family planning intervention, and Mpilo Central Hospital, in Bulawayo, served as the control site. The study cohort was 982 women, 527 of whom were followed for a 12‐month period. During the follow‐up period, significantly more women used highly effective methods of contraception, significantly fewer unplanned pregnancies occurred, and fewer repeat abortions were performed at the intervention site than at the control site. These results offer compelling evidence that ward‐based contraceptive services provided to women treated for incomplete abortion can significantly reduce subsequent unplanned pregnancies. The results also suggest that postabortion family planning services can reduce the incidence of repeat abortion.</jats:p>",

Although univariate analyses suggest that genital cutting is associated with delivery complications and procedures, multivariate analyses controlling for sociodemographic factors and delivery setting show no difference between cut and noncut women's likelihood of reporting first‐delivery complications or procedures. Whereas a clinical association between genital cutting and obstetric morbidity may occur in populations that have undergone more severe forms of cutting, in this setting, apparent associations between cutting and obstetric morbidity appear to reflect confounding by social class and by the conditions under which delivery takes place.</jats:p>",

However, in this research it is not made clear what choice opportunities were available for travel behaviour of the various population categories, given their desired activities and time–space opportunities. The authors describe a time–space theoretical and methodological framework based on the concept of action spaces, within which the choice opportunities of different types of households of various areas can be analysed. On the basis of a pilot study among the residents of a suburban neighbourhood in a Netherlands new town, the time–space opportunities they have to use alternative transport modes other than the car are brought into the frame. It is shown that residents have more time–space opportunities to make use of existing environmentally friendly, transport modes than had been expected. The possibilities differ between types of action spaces and types of households. Some implications for policymaking are discussed. The authors state that policymakers should be more sensitive to interpersonal differences in accessibility. </jats:p>",

Elderly individuals in a case study in Calgary, Alberta, were measured on the short index of self actualization and a series of multivariate ‘structures’ of place — community associated with behavioral, cognitive, and affective features of community derived from a principal components analysis of community indicator variables. Self-actualization tendencies were not found to differ by residential context. Multiple regression models showed a similar overall contribution of all community structures to self-actualization in the different residential contexts, but different sets of community structures were identified as unique and significant predictors of self-actualization in the two residential settings. This differential impact may signal that a variety of forms and structures of person–environment congruence amongst the elderly yield similar psychological outcomes. </jats:p>",

Findings show that knowledge of methods and supply sources increased as a result of exposure to project activities and that deployment of nurses to communities was associated with the emergence of preferences to limit childbearing. Fertility impact is evident in all treatment cells, most prominently in areas where nurse‐outreach activities are combined with strategies for involving traditional leaders and male volunteers in promoting the program. In this combined cell, the initial three years of project exposure reduced the total fertility rate by one birth, comprising a 15 percent fertility decline relative to fertility levels in comparison communities.</jats:p>",

However, scenario planning requires both left‐ and right‐brain thinking styles. The elements of left‐brain thinking reflect the planning side of strategy making, while right‐brain thinking mirrors the thinking component of strategy making. The relationship between the factors that enable strategic thinking and the level of “emotional intelligence” of business leaders is also considered.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The influence of organ volume sampling, lateral scatter inclusion, and the selection of objectives and constraints on the inverse treatment planning process with a commercial treatment planning system is investigated and suitable parameters are identified for an inverse treatment planning replacement of a clinical forward planning technique for prostate cancer. For the beam geometries of the forward technique, a variable set of parameters is used for the calculation of dose from pencil beams. An optimal set is identified after the evaluation of optimized plans that correspond to different sets of pencil beam parameters. This set along with a single, optimized set of objectives and constraints is used to perform inverse planning on ten randomly selected patients. The acceptability of the resulting plans is verified by comparisons to the clinical ones calculated with the forward techniques. For the particular commercial treatment planning system, the default values of the pencil beam parameters are found adequate for inverse treatment planning. For all ten patients, the optimized, single set of objectives and constraints results in plans with target coverage comparable to that of the forward plans. Furthermore inverse treatment planning reduces the overall mean rectal and bladder doses by 4.8% and 5.8% of the prescription dose respectively. The study indicates that (i) inverse treatment planning results depend implicitly on the sampling of the dose distribution, (ii) inverse treatment planning results depend on the method used by the dose calculation model to account for scatter, and (iii) for certain sites, a single set of optimization parameters can be used for all patient plans.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.90.+y</jats:p>",

It has also been acknowledged as a key objective of relationship marketing, primarily because of its potential in delivering superior relationship economics, i.e. it costs less to retain than to acquire new customers. This paper reports an investigation, through case studies, that is concerned with testing whether or not a theoretical position relating to strategies for retaining customers reflects practices in four firms. The assumption is that generalised theories, which imply universal applicability, tend to overlook the distinctive impact of contextualised business conditions on effective customer retention strategies. The paper recommends that both theoreticians and managers should consider “business context” in developing and implementing customer retention strategies.</jats:p>",

The collaboration came about as a result of the EU-India Cross-Cultural Innovation Network collaboration programme, a project involving several universities and organizations across Europe and India. The authors of this paper both lecture in the area of computer networking. Following meetings in Delhi, they agreed to work together to produce a Web-based networking resource to be generated by the students of both institutions. The first phase of development involved the mounting of Web-based tutorials and documents produced by the students. The second phase will centre on the development of a knowledge base generated by the interaction of the students within an asynchronous forum. Running alongside these phases will be a collaborative bookmarking system, a database in which the students will post URLs of Web-based resources that they find useful in their studies. This system incorporates a form of collaborative filtering, an evolutionary mechanism which seeks to embody the qualities that students value in resources to provide a dynamic set of ratings to assist in the selection of those of most use. The planning of such a system raises some unusual issues, not least in the process of collaboration itself, with concerns as diverse as technical compatibility, institutional and cultural differences, timezones and the reliability of email. Limited bandwidth between our institutions causes special problems with the interactive elements of the resource. We present the methods we are investigating to reduce the impact of this. The fact that the students share an intellectual discipline but are otherwise separated by a cultural and geographical divide is expected to lead to fruitful diversity in thinking and approaches to problem-solving.DOI:10.1080/0968776020100204</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A recurring theme in recent Australian reports on integrated catchment management (ICM) has been the need to institutionalise more formally the cost-sharing commitments made within this domain. This represents a significant departure from earlier visions of ICM as essentially promoting voluntary uptake of resource-conservation measures. Two important questions raised by this nascent policy shift are addressed in this paper. Firstly, how might cost-sharing arrangements be given greater formality without undermining the efforts of ICM to increase the preparedness of civil stakeholders to voluntarily, or informally, accept responsibility for sharing costs? Secondly, how is it possible to formalise cost-sharing arrangements so that the transaction costs of enforcing compliance with them remain affordable? Answers to these questions are explored through a case study of the Land and Water Management Planning Program now being successfully implemented in the irrigation districts of the central-Murray region of southern inland New South Wales (NSW) surrounding Deniliquin. The sophisticated system of institutional arrangements introduced in the program to facilitate monitoring, enforcement and adaptive management of cost-sharing commitments is discussed, and insights into how informally motivated cooperation can enhance the affordability and political feasibility of formal arrangements are presented.</jats:p>",

The findings also indicated that excessive emphasis on short‐term profitability, lack of resources, business planning and vision, and misperception of TQM practices are among the main obstacles to the adoption of a formal TQM program.

In order to understand suppliers' locational calculus, I analyze the power relations between the national state, assemblers as the chaebol, and suppliers and offer a multifaceted causal analysis of suppliers' spatial patterns. I show that only more dedicated suppliers producing either bulky or modular components tend to be co-located with their assembly plants for economic benefits resulting from geographical proximity. I also show that suppliers who transact with several assemblers are relatively more powerful in their markets and thus freer in their location decisions than are dedicated suppliers and prefer remaining in the Seoul metropolitan area, the major agglomeration of R&amp;D activities, markets, and government organizations. These findings challenge the assembler-centric spatial logic of the business network approach, which has the hypothesis of co-location between assemblers and suppliers. </jats:p>",

Casemix and service delivery specifications for the HDU need to be defined and agreed upon within the institution. Establishing a new HDU service requires changes to care delivery. Many potential HDU patients are currently managed in general wards or in the intensive care unit. The service should be discussed widely and marketed within the institution, and the development of defined working relationships with the ICU and primary care teams on the wards is mandatory. </jats:p>",

Ninety-five new clients at a university counseling center agreed to participate in the study and completed the BTPI as part of the intake evaluation. Premature termination occurred when a participant missed a scheduled appointment and unilaterally dropped out of counseling. Higher scores on Closed-Mindedness, Problems in Relationship Formation, Somatization of Conflict, Self-Oriented/Narcissism, Perceived Lack of Environmental Support, and the Treatment Difficulty Composite were associated with premature termination. The General Pathology Composite, a general index of symptomatic distress, also enhanced the prediction of premature termination by suppressing irrelevant variance in other BTPI scales. The results provide support for the validity of the BTPI in identifying clients at risk for premature termination from counseling. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin rail, a project that will complete a transcontinental railway linking the southern coast of Australia to the north. It is argued that the railway will constitute a specific kind of place, a corridor, involved in a complex, paradoxical, and, at times, highly contentious gathering, one that embraces both the macrolevel of regional and Federal politics, as well as the microlevel of local concerns and individual experiences. In addition to developing the phenomenology of ‘corridors’, I show that the rail project is deeply implicated in an ongoing resignification of several technologies and their associated cultural regimes. It is also argued that locating the rail proposal within specific historical and social contexts allows numerous crucial inflections and meanings to be understood. In particular, it is suggested that the rail proposal is located at the heart of a contemporary unease and unsettling of Australian national identity and its relationship to the land, an uncertainty that runs hand in hand with a new confidence and, at times, triumphal, rhetoric. </jats:p>",

One manifestation of this is that households of diverse means and circumstances may be found living in proximity to one another, particularly in urban areas. In this paper we argue that in these changed circumstances conventional deprivation indicators fail adequately to detect within and between small area variations in socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Using a case study of Bristol, England, we develop an analysis around Gordon and Forrest's Breadline Britain indicator in order to reveal the diversity of economic conditions that exist within wards that might be labelled as either affluent or deprived. We argue that adequate representation of diversity requires a greater sensitivity to difference at fine scales. In this context, we begin to evaluate the claims of marketeers who use commercial sources of data to model incomes at unit postcode and even household scales. We undertake an evaluation of such data and extend their application to calculation of Breadline Britain index scores. The results suggest some potential for using unconventional sources of data to ‘freshen up’ census information and provide direct, meaningful, measures of deprivation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper deals with the quantitative modeling and planning of the product development process in concurrent engineering (CE). CE requires that product design and its related process design be carried out concurrently. Many existing CE models highlight the impact of the upstream design on the downstream design. While in our research, a quantitative model of the product development process in CE based on the network of product-process design activity pairs is presented to describe both the impact of the upstream product design on the downstream process design and the process design's ability of discovering the faults in the product design. Based on this model, a method is presented to determine the appropriate concurrency degree between the product and process design activities and estimate the mean duration of product-process design activity pair. Then an approach is proposed to solve the integrated optimization problem of both the allocation of resources and the planning of the product development process in CE. Its objective is to allocate the resources for the product development project reasonably to complete it before the due date, minimize its lead-time and keep the average resource utilization rate above a given level. Unlike other project scheduling problems with pre-determined numbers of the resources allocated for the project, in our research, the numbers of the resources allocated for the project are determined along with the project planning. To solve the problem, a branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed and a heuristic rule is introduced to improve its efficiency. The computational result of an example from an automobile factory shows the effectiveness of the algorithm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within the context of contemporary discussion over geography and developmental ethics, this paper examines part of the genealogy of a modern British sense of responsibility for the plight of distant strangers. The frame of reference for this sense, known as humanitarianism, was first cast overseas through debates over the slave trade in the late 18th century, and its remit was further extended as a result of the contested processes of colonial settlement in the 1820s and 1830s. This geographically expansive discourse is analysed through a study of two exemplary statements of humane intervention: the Aborigines Committee (1835–37), and the military Court of Enquiry into the death of the African Xhosa King Hintsa (1836). Each demonstrated a new-found concern for the fate of colonised individuals. They established that the sufferings of distant others were inextricably connected to the everyday privileges enjoyed by Britons. However, they also formulated prescriptive principles targeted not only at the relief of suffering, but at the moral and material improvement of distant subjects—principles which continue to inform more recent debates over global ethics. </jats:p>",

We analyze leaving home to go to college, the choice between returning home and becoming independent after living away at college, and the influence of experience with living away at college on becoming an independent household. We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and multilevel event-history and logistic-regression models to show that the likelihood of leaving home for college is positively affected by the father's education and the parental income.

First, given the fact that inside the West much theorization of power and social relations has assumed a geohistorical context that is intrinsically Western, to what extent and in what ways does this particularity constrain the conceptual and thematic effectiveness of the perspectives employed and especially in relation to the politics of democratization? Second, as it is most appropriate to argue that power shapes social identities, and that democratic politics cannot dispense with power, a key question becomes how to generate relations of power that are compatible with democratic values and opposed to ethnocentric privilege. Third, how can we open up a discussion of democratic politics so that the geographies of democratization can be explored in a way that might broaden our vision of power and geopolitics? These questions are pursued in the context of the coloniality of power and an exploration of the territoriality of democratization in the Peruvian and Bolivian cases. The overall objective is to go beyond the limits of a Euro—Americanist frame and open up the analysis of the complex and dynamic geographies of democracy. </jats:p>",

It is revealed that in-house research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, rather than imported technologies, are the primary sources of industrial innovation in China. Regarding in-house R&amp;D efforts, it is found that in-house R&amp;D laboratories are important sources for the creation of new products as measured by patents, though it is enterprise-wide R&amp;D spending rather than the mere presence of in-house facilities that is more likely to lead to market success. Concerning importation of technologies, it is revealed that the limited nature of efforts to absorb imported technologies has become a serious barrier to fulfilling the potential of these technologies and to upgrading China's internal creative capabilities. In addition, domestic technology markets have not been effectively linked to large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, despite China's enduring efforts in this direction since the middle 1980s. It is therefore concluded that the organization of R&amp;D activities in China's industrial enterprises is still fragmented, with only weak linkages between technology importation and assimilation, between industrial R&amp;D and domestic technology markets, and between business and R&amp;D activities within enterprises.</jats:p>",

An analysis of 100 advertisements looked at title, skills, caseload, qualifications and evolving roles. The analysis comprised aninitial quantitative descriptive account of data, followed by further analysis of the text using thematic analysis and coding. The skills identified were compared to those identified by Proctor et al. (1999). The most commonly occurring skills were interpersonal (35%), multi-professional team working (33%), clinical (28%), management (18%) and leadership (16%). The analysis was limited, but provides a unique insight into employers’ perceived needs in providing CCN services, evolving titles and roles and could inform practitioners, contribute to service evaluation, future service provision and workforce planning. </jats:p>",

Major findings derived from the study revealed that: bank branch effectiveness is affected by effective management practices; the overall performance of the branch depends highly on both long term thinking and innovation; long‐term thinking seems to have also a high degree of impact on strategic planning effectiveness; and finally, the degree of precision attached to planning, programming, budgeting and control seems to trigger high levels of marketing effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Cultural geographers have generally overlooked this mode of tourist communication. Yet, the postcard is an example par excellence of both a genre of popular art and an ephemeral cultural artefact. The ritual practice of selecting, writing, and sending a postcard is explored within the themes of souvenir, testimony, and anticipation. A report is provided of methods designed to reveal how individual tourists interpret these postcards as semiotic texts. Results suggest that postcards seem to perpetuate, almost unchallenged, experiences associated with Australian frontier mythologies. The Kimberley is experienced as a remnant of a former pristine environment and a place uninhabited or, at best, inhabited by ‘primitive’ people. This version of the Kimberley relies upon many of the categorical binaries between society and nature; human and animal; civilised and wild. The silences and priorities created by such textual imagery in the public geographical imaginary are argued to be far from trivial in a place subject to native land claims and proposed extensions to irrigation schemes. </jats:p>",

These dimensions refer to delivery of basic services as well as to public or collective demands and goals. Enablement is central to new decentralisation in which the role of government is to facilitate and regulate the overall framework within which other actors can make their most effective contribution. After situating decentralisation, I explore the notion of enablement. Subsequently the concept of local-government enablement of communities is operationalised. Criteria are formulated and applied to a (nonrepresentative) sample of local governments in seven countries. It is concluded that introducing enablement in local planning is comparatively easy. However, changing regulatory, administrative and financial public decisionmaking processes is much more difficult. In the final part of the paper I examine a number of issues in the local-governance debate. Decentralisation to local government takes place in the context of decentralisation to market and to communities. Issues are identified on the supply and demand sides of governance, and on the question of embedding of government. New decentralisation raises a new class of problems, for which, as yet, few answers are available. </jats:p>",

State‐centered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the New Deal era, when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate Congress and the administration. This paper shows that in river policy, the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered. The TVA bill was passed in 1933 because reformers skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opposing lobbyists. In 1936, however, after regrouping, opposing river lobbyists and legislators took advantage of the New Dealers' spending mood by expanding the Corps' flood control program. They also helped defeat further valley authorities, the most promising of the New Deal water policy reforms.</jats:p>",

In this paper I investigate how trade associations can induce member SMEs to use a research institute. The case of a public research institute and SMEs in the textile industry in Kyoto, Japan is examined. Evidence from the case suggests that trade associations facilitate the use of the institute by expressing a collective ‘voice’ to the management of the institute. The effect is evident among active members in the use of services involving a large information gap as to their benefits. I also consider a shortcoming of the collective approach and suggest some measures to be taken on the part of research institutes. </jats:p>",

The innovatory work of Aschauer, and the ensuing debate between himself, Munnell, and Holtz-Eakin regarding the role of infrastructure in the development process in the USA, has spawned much interest in the issue. The authors aim to assess the impact of public capital on Greek manufacturing industries, especially focused at the regional scale. Capital stocks were estimated for the private and public sectors and Cobb—Douglas production functions were used in the analytical framework. The results suggest that the role of private capital in economic development in recent times has been marginal, as private investment has declined, whereas the role of labour and public capital has been both positive and significant. The authors segregate public capital into ‘productive’ and ‘social’ infrastructure; they argue that when productive infrastructure makes a positive contribution to production output, the impact of social infrastructure is insignificant and/or negative in most cases. The network effects of infrastructure are also estimated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors consider the role of institutional networks in integrated and inclusive coastal-zone management in Trinidad and Tobago. Drawing on theories of social institutions, a framework for understanding the institutional prerequisites for participatory management is developed. In this framework, distinction is made between institutions at the community, formal-organisational, and national regulatory levels and the means by which institutions adapt to and learn about new issues in terms of networks of dependence and exchange are characterised. The immediate networks between actors (their spaces of dependence) are augmented by wider networks between institutions at various scales (their spaces of exchange). This framework is applied to a case study of resource management in Trinidad and Tobago. Semistructured interviews with key government urban and economic planners, fisheries regulators, and other agents in Trinidad and Tobago, and a participatory workshop for resource managers, are used to identify the perceived opportunities and constraints relating to integrated and inclusive resource management within the social institutions. The findings are analysed through an exploration of the spaces of dependence and exchange that exist in the various social networks at the different institutional scales. The prescriptive relevance of this approach is in the demonstration of the nature of change required in social institutions at all scales to facilitate integrated and inclusive resource management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The production, certification, and marketing of organic agriculture developed slowly in the West as a nongovernmental, community-based response to concerns over food safety and the environmental impacts of chemical agriculture. The current emergence of organic agriculture in less-developed nations is following a very different trajectory owing to the presence of an established global market for organic products and the developmental goals of interventionist states. In this paper I examine the emergence of state-sponsored organic marketing and certification programs in the Peoples' Republic of China as an extreme case of developmental state intervention in organic agriculture. I find that the predominance of state and market instead of community and ecology in the Chinese organic ‘movement’ has profound implications for the ability of organics to promote environmentally sustainable agriculture in less-developed nations. Direct state intervention may overcome some of the public-goods and collective-action problems often associated with organic agriculture. However, conflicts of interest between the state as regulator and as producer erode the consumer trust upon which organic markets rely. The use of political authority to organize organic production allows state entrepreneurs to capture market premiums, reducing farmer innovation and long-term incentive, and exacerbating free-rider problems. The case of organic agriculture in China demonstrates the need for caution when applying universalistic economic theories about environmental problems to diverse political economies. This has important implications for international environmental regimes as well as the globalization of eco-consumerism or eco-labeling strategies. </jats:p>",

The system described here allowsplacing ribbons of different strengths and of different lengths along and across the implant plane. The program takes full advantage of the availability of different source strengths in inventory, and attempts to find configurations of ribbons that result in optimal dose uniformity over the prescription plane. Dosimetry is based on the AAPM TG 43 Report [R. Nath <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., Med. Phys. 22, 209–234 (1995)]. Compared with TG 43 parameters, the classical tables underestimate the I‐125 source strengths needed by 40%. The use of several source strengths improves the plan. Typical optimization yields dose uniformity of 10%, and computing times are within 2–3 min No further enhancement is obtained if ribbons are placed in a grid pattern as opposed to the (simpler) arrangement along parallel lines. Nor is it valuable to have variable ribbon lengths. For an I‐125 implant the optimization system described here is a practical alternative to the (strictly speaking inapplicable) classical systems. It calculates correctly the total source strengths, and ‐ most notably ‐ generates plans with optimal dose uniformity. The fast computing time is well suited for planning during surgery in the operating room.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53Jw, 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

Such information would help donor and recipient countries to put pressure on badly performing IFIs and to farther the better ones. The authors therefore discuss the subject of the efficient use of financial resources by IFIs. They develop a set of determinants of spending efficiency, structured by (1) the general features of an institution, such as being public or private; (2) the organisational elements of an institution; and (3) the type of problem an institution deals with. This set of determinants also constitute a research design for the comparative analysis of the spending efficiency of IFIs. </jats:p>",

There are various types of spatial tessellations such as administrative units, school districts, and census tracts. Spatial tessellations are often closely related to each other; school districts are determined by, say, administrative units and land uses; electoral districts are related to administrative units, local communities, census tracts, and so forth. Such relationships among spatial tessellations have drawn the attention of geographers; to what extent is the development of a spatial tessellation affected by a set of other tessellations? To give a clue to the answer to this question, in this paper I propose three methods for analyzing a spatial tessellation in relation to a set of other tessellations: the region-based method, the boundary-based method, and the hybrid method. They are all designed for exploratory spatial analysis rather than confirmatory analysis. The methods are evaluated through an empirical study, analysis of the administrative system in Ponneri, India, in the late 18th century. </jats:p>",

The commercial HD‐270 MLC™ (HDI) technique provides a software solution of the conventional MLC to achieve smoothed edge and optimal penumbra of the MLC shaped field. We implemented the HDI functionality on a 3D treatment planning system and compared the dosimetric effects of the HDI delivery in simulation with those in experiment for a number of the MLC fields. The fields from the contour of varied shapes with different sizes of the leaf stepping were tested for the HDI delivery. There is a good agreement of the dose distribution between the calculation as implemented in the planning system and the measurement performed on the treatment machine. It has been shown that the HDI delivery significantly smoothes the stepped field edge with the reduced isodose undulation and effective penumbra. A problem may be present when the HDI is applied for the treatment of the circular contour of smaller diameter, and the conformity of the MLC shaping may not be achievable satisfactorily with the existing system. The optimization of leaf configuration is suggested to improve the conformity of the HDI technique. The HDI planning then can be used to assist in the decision making of applying the HDI treatment delivery.</jats:p>",

Extended Kohonen networks which contain an additional lattice of output neurons are used in conjunction with PID controllers in position control to minimize command tracking errors. The extended Kohonen networks are trained using reinforcement learning where the overall learning algorithm is derived from a self-organizing feature-mapping algorithm and a delta learning rule. The results indicate that the extended Kohonen network controller is more efficient than other techniques reported in early literature when the robot is operated under normal conditions. Subsequently, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to solve an optimization problem related to time-optimal control. This problem involves the selection of actuator torque limits and an end-effector path subject to time-optimality and tracking error constraints. Two chromosome coding schemes are explored in the investigation: Gray and integer-based coding schemes. The results suggest that the integer-based chromosome is more suitable at representing the decision variables. As a result of using both neural networks and a genetic algorithm in this application, an idea of a hybridization between a neural network and a genetic algorithm at the task level for use in a control system is also effectively demonstrated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the basic building blocks in virtual manufacturing is a 3D facility. An automated method for reconstructing a 3D facility from a 2D layout is presented here. The 3D facility is reconstructed using spacefilling curves (SFC), and simultaneously creating hierarchy levels within a scenegraph structure, which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). An iterative process is used to acquire knowledge about the layout, and reorganize the scenegraph structure based on the acquired knowledge, and cell formation within the layout. Additional CAD data models for the equipment within the facility provide depth within the scenegraph framework to synthesize generic manufacturing operations, such as load, unload, move and process, in a virtual manufacturing environment. The objects within the 3D facility have been modified to provide the links required for synthesizing the generic manufacturing operations in the virtual manufacturing environment. The generic manufacturing operations are realized by updating the hierarchy links between the manufacturing resources and the parts being produced, within the scenegraph framework. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed reconstruction method. </jats:p>",

As a national state within the accumulation of global capital, however, Japan's specificity only existed as ‘difference-in-unity’. Furthermore, I suggest that the 1980s real-estate ‘bubble’ and 1990s banking crisis were specific and culminating expressions of changes within the form of those social relations, as mediated by Japan's changing position within the process of global uneven development. Important in this respect was the way in which credit, fictitious capital, and spatial restructuring became precarious expressions of attempts to achieve a temporal and spatial displacement of crisis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An iterative algorithm has been developed to analytically determine patient specific input parameters for intensity‐modulated radiotherapy prostate treatment planning. The algorithm starts with a generic set of inverse planning parameters that include dose and volume constraints for the target and surrounding critical structures. The overlap region between the target volume and the rectum is used to determine the optimized target volume coverage goal. Sequential iterations are performed to vary the numerous parameters individually or in sets while other parameters remain fixed. A coarse grid search is first used to avoid convergence on a local maximum. Linear interpolation is then used to define a region for a fine grid search. Selected parameters are also tested for possible improvements in target coverage. In several representative test cases investigated the coverage of the planning target volume improved with the use of the algorithm while still meeting the clinical acceptability criteria for critical structures. The algorithm avoids time‐consuming random trial and error variations that are often associated with difficult cases and also eliminates lengthy user learning curves. The methodology described in this paper can be applied to any treatment planning system that requires the user to select the input optimization parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.90.+y</jats:p>",

This framework is applied to arrangements for the regulation of direct labour and direct service organisations in Scotland and Wales prior to the ‘Best Value’ regime. The results support the practical relevance of the analytical framework. Furthermore, whereas conventional perspectives suggest that the source of regulatory problems is the behaviour of regulatees, our evidence shows that the behaviour of regulators can also lead to regulatory failure; for example, through ritualistic compliance with procedures. The evidence also reveals a previously unidentified problem concerning a ‘fear of regulation’ on the part of regulators. </jats:p>",

Ninety-four consented and completed the trial. Patients were assigned to one of two visit preparation interventions before their appointment with either a surgeon or a medical oncologist. In the control intervention, called Productive Listening, a researcher listened to and prompted patients to reflect on their experiences communicating with physicians. In the experimental intervention, called Consultation Planning, a researcher elicited questions and concerns, generated a printed agenda for the upcoming consultation, and engaged patients in techniques to improve communication with their physicians. Valid and reliable surveys measured communication barriers, satisfaction with the intervention, and patients’ and physicians’ satisfaction with the consultation. </jats:p><jats:p> RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of the patients reported three or more communication barriers. Patients reported a significant reduction in communication barriers after both the intervention and the control session. Patients reported significantly higher satisfaction after the Consultation Planning sessions. Physicians reported significantly higher satisfaction with those patients who had participated in a Consultation Planning session. </jats:p><jats:p> CONCLUSION: Visit preparation sessions help patients prepare for medical consultations and reduce barriers to communication. Consultation Planning sessions, in which a researcher solicited the patient’s agenda, were more satisfying to patients and physicians than the Productive Listening sessions. </jats:p>",

The government, with support from the Vale of Glamorgan, the county of South Glamorgan and the City of Cardiff, created the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC). Its remit was to regenerate some 1100 ha in this area of south Cardiff. The keystone to this strategy was the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, to impound the estuaries of the rivers Taff and Ely, creating a 200 ha fresh water lake and about 12 km of attractive waterfront. Works of this magnitude and scope on tidal waters at that time required an Act of Parliament. The 1100 m long barrage includes sluices, locks, an outer harbour, fish pass, embankment and bridges. The sluices have a capacity of 2300 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s, to discharge combined flood flows from the Taff and Ely. The gates close to exclude the highest tides, allowing bay water levels to be controlled even in extreme conditions.

Voters evaluate governments both at the national scale (the performance of the national economy) and at the individual or household scale (changes in their own perceived financial situation). Results of a cross-sectional study of the respondents to a survey conducted after the 1997 General Election are consistent with this argument. The case is developed, however, that additional variables should be added, representing: an intermediate spatial scale—perceived changes in the voters' local economy; the attribution of credit/blame—governments should only be rewarded (punished) if voters associate economic changes with government policies; the local context—the actual situation in the voters' milieux; and the electoral context—do voters' economic evaluations have a differential impact depending on whether they voted for the successful party at the previous election. Expansion of the basic economic voting model to incorporate all four of these provides improved insights to voter decisionmaking at the 1997 election. </jats:p>",

Traumatic injury is the principal cause of death in patients aged 1‐44 years and the overall leading cause of life‐years lost in the United States. Recognizing this, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in conjunction with other federal agencies, organized a conference in June 2000 to discuss the basic and clinical research needs that could lead to improved outcomes following cardiopulmonary or post injury resuscitation. The Post Resuscitative and Initial Utility of Life Saving Efforts (PULSE) Workshop resulted and eight work groups were established to focus on various aspects, including organ systems, pharmacology, epidemiology, and trauma. The Trauma Work Group recommendations are presented in this article. Despite the recognition of improved survival and outcome through advancements in trauma systems and trauma care, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support ratio for trauma research is only 0.10, compared with 1.65 for cancer research and a remarkable 3.51 for AIDS and HIV infection research. The successful federal HIV research program has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality over the last ten years at a cost of $1.4 billion per year. A coordinated trauma research program should aim to replicate the success achieved by such programs; however, a centralized federal “home” for trauma research does not exist. Consequently, the existing limited research support is derived from NIH institutes in addition to other federal and state agencies. This report serves to describe some of the obstacles and outline various strategies and priorities for basic science, clinical, and translational trauma resuscitation research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1994, Sunpine Forest Products Ltd. sought permits from Alberta government to construct a permanent log hauling road and approvals from the federal government for construction of required bridges associated with the road. A concerned citizens group challenged the Federal Government's subsequent bridge approvals in court, claiming that cumulative effects assessment was not adequately conducted under Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The original Sunpine court decision agreed with the citizen group that the federal government erred in law by not including related projects and adequately considering associated cumulative effects, sending the approval back to the federal government for reconsideration. Government regulators, industrial foresters, and environmental groups across Canada awaited the appeal to the Sunpine federal court decision. The Sunpine Appeal reversed the original position with much relief from industry and government. The Sunpine case raises important issues about how federal and provincial authorities address environmental impacts, uncertainty in scoping assessments, factors to be considered, and cumulative effect assessments. This paper evaluates the cumulative effects assessment processes followed in the Sunpine case study under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act within an analysis framework of comprehensiveness, fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness. Land use planning models, like the British Columbia land resource management plans and Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act, offer alternative approaches to legislated cumulative effects processes. Sustainability may be better realised with a combination of strategic environmental assessment tools, utilising environmental assessment at the project-level within the context of a regional resource planning process.</jats:p>",

Our study indicated that the Varian CadPlan was outstanding in the plotting and network transfer of treatment plans to other workstations, the CMS Focus performed better in the construction of treatment aids, and the ADAC Pinnacle in the outlining, modification of field parameters, control of graphics and normalization of dose. In terms of dosimetric accuracy, the measured and the calculated data for the 3 TPSs showed fairly good agreement. Except for the field with median block, in which the Focus presented with the best result, the differences in other irradiating conditions were not obvious with the percentage dose deviations within ±3%.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusion:</jats:italic> In conclusion, for the 3 TPSs evaluated, each had its own strengths and weaknesses, and no TPS was superior in all test conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A near-optimal solution to the path-unconstrained time-optimal trajectory planning problem is described in this paper. While traditional trajectory planning strategies are entirely based on kinematic considerations, manipulator dynamics are usually neglected altogether. The strategy presented in this work has two distinguishing features. Firstly, the trajectory planning problem is reformulated as an optimal control problem, which is in turn solved using Pontryagin's maximum/minimum principle. This approach merges the traditional division of trajectory planning followed by trajectory tracking into one process. Secondly, the feedback form compensates for the dynamic approximation errors derived from linearization and the fundamental parameter uncertainty of the dynamic equations of motion. This approach can cope with flexible robots as well as rigid links. The terminal phase of the motion is controlled by a feedforward controller to reduce chatter vibrations. Results from simulations and an on-line implementation to a general-purpose open-chain industrial manipulator, the CRS A251, confirm the validity of the approach and show that maximizing the capabilities of the device can lead to an overall improvement in the manipulator time response of up to 24 per cent, while retaining an acceptable overshoot and steady state error regime. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study, we present our experiences of personal computer-based 3D reconstructions of MRA for pre-treatment planning and post-treatment follow-up for cerebral aneurysms. Twenty-nine ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysm patients with 36 intracranial aneurysms, who underwent embolization and pretreatment and/or follow up 3D MRA were included in this study. All 29 patients were examined by DSA and MRA before (18 patients, 24 aneurysms) and/or after embolization (16 patients, 17 aneurysms). The MRA source images were transported to a personal computer in DICOM format for viewing, post-processing, and 3D reconstruction. DSA and PC based SSD 3D MRA equally well demonstrated most aneurysms before embolization (17 patients, 22 aneurysms). The depiction of aneurysm morphology, neck evaluation and branch vessel interpretation were much easier on 3D MRA, which has the ability to manipulate images in real time. When the vascular anatomy was complicated by another vascular system, the anterior or posterior circulations were separately reconstructed easily by using PC based reconstruction software. The 3D MRA also well demonstrated post-embolization recurrence or remnant aneurysmal cavities. In one giant aneurysm, the 3D MRA was unable to show the entire aneurysmal sac due to a blood flow saturation effect, but this was resolved by additional contrast material injection. PC-based 3D MRA proved to be a useful tool for the pretreatment planning of embolization procedures and for follow up after treatment in the case of cerebral aneurysms. </jats:p>",
