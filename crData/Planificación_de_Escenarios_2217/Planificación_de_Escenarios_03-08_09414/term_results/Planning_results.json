      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores several aspects of the new interstate highway program during the Eisenhower Era of the 1950s. Federal Interstate legislation left state highway engineers in control of routing and constructing the big new roads that were certain to shape future metropolitan growth patterns. Planning professionals soon criticized the road builders' failure to integrate highway building with metropolitan land use planning, as well as their lack of interest in mass transit alternatives and relocation housing for those displaced by interstate highway construction. Urban renewal legislation required comprehensive planning and relocation provisions, but Eisenhower's economic advisers resisted parallel mandates for the Interstates. Within the Eisenhower administration, however, several key figures were pushing for metropolitan planning, mass transit, and relocation housing. White House domestic adviser Robert E. Merriam and public works planning adviser John S. Bragdon argued the merits of comprehensive planning and uniform requirements for federal construction programs. The stage was set for structural change, policy initiatives that came together in the Highway Act of 1962 and subsequent legislation in the sixties. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article seeks to explore the place of planning history in the discussion of the destruction of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and of its aftermath. It is based on an analysis of a range of articles and messages published on this subject, particularly within a month of the attack: newspapers, a planning Web site, a listserv for urban historians, and academic planning journals. After indicating the types of presence that planning and urban histories have had in the post-9/11 discourse, the article outlines some of the debates on urban futures—and assumptions about urban pasts— that have been common in this period, before concluding with observations on the various identities of those involved in these discussions. The article not only seeks to assess the lessons from this retrospective process of looking toward the “ghosts” of wars and reconstructions past but also examines how these—as well as planning history—have been instrumentalized to imagine alternative urban futures. </jats:p>",

Although GIS is now used by most public sector planning agencies and private planning firms, planning schools have been slow to adapt their core curricula to ensure that all students gain some exposure to this technology before entering the job market. A review of the core curricula of accredited programs in North America revealed GIS to be a rare element of the core. This paper outlines potential reasons that GIS has been slow to emerge as an element in the planning core and offers some guidance on how to remedy this situation with a minimum of disruption to existing programs. </jats:p>",

Control of highway building rested exclusively in the hands of state and federal highway engineers. In 1991, however, President George H. W. Bush and members of Congress approved the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Although the federal government would still pay most of the cost of highway building, day-to-day control of projects devolved into the hands of local politicians located in Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). Moreover, leaders of those MPOs were authorized to spend money not only on highways but also on bicycle paths, buses, and on projects dubbed “intermodal.” In great measure, approval of the ISTEA represented another triumph of suburban politicians seeking federal funds and local control over their use. Both in 1956 and in 1991, federal officials had framed the institutional relationship that guided transportation politics and subsequent land uses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Existing research suggests that tenant-based subsidies (housing vouchers) can help to deconcentrate poverty and improve the quality of life of low-income families. The Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program and the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration program have been shown to help families move to safer neighborhoods and ones with better public schools. The regular Section 8 program has been successful in facilitating moves to low-poverty areas in places like Alameda County, California, but public housing families have had difficulties in Chicago. Research on mixed-income communities has provided little evidence that social mixing has any direct positive impacts through social interaction and/or social networks. However, the lack of research on the long-term impacts on children, such as future improvements in their employment circumstances due to better educational attainment, makes it impossible to offer conclusive assessments on the connection between income mixing and social mobility.</jats:p>",

The evaluation concludes that the overall quality of the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) process and resulting plans appears high, that EDDs focus on activities central to national goals, and that most stakeholders consider such activities effective in increasing cooperation and communication within the region. However, EDDs have not been completely successful in ensuring that CEDS committees fully represent their communities, policies outlined in the CEDS do not appear to match needs and goals as closely as would be desired, and the larger community tends to be unaware of valuable EDD activities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the principle criticisms of urban sprawl is that it undermines the cost-effective provision of public services. In this paper the authors examine whether or not this is true through an exploratory analysis of the influence that alternative development patterns have on twelve measures of public expenditure: total direct, capital facilities, roadways, other transportation, sewerage, trash collection, housing and community development, police protection, fire protection, parks, education, and libraries. The objectives of the analysis are threefold. First, the authors, through a background discussion, provide a brief overview of previous research on the relationship between urban development patterns and the cost of public services. Second, through empirical analysis, they examine how the character of urban development affects per capita public outlays in a cross-section of 283 metropolitan counties during the 1982–92 time period. A separate equation is estimated for each measure of expenditure, providing substantive evidence on how density, the spatial extent of urbanized land area, property value, and political fragmentation affect the cost of services. Finally, the authors use the results of the empirical analysis to develop a set of policy recommendations and directions for future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an attempt to understand the relationship between power and space constituted in traditional Korean society, a strictly status-oriented society. The author speculates on two traditional villages and houses within them. The analysis of the villages shows not only different patterns of spatial morphology but also different spatial strategies for consolidating power innate to each community. In Hahoe, with a spatial structure in the form of a concentric circle, the ruling class located their houses in more easily accessible and exposed spaces with the lower class's houses in secluded spaces. By contrast, in Yangdong, with its more complicated spatial and power structures, the ruling class appeared to locate their houses in an opposite way to that of Hahoe. The analysis of the positioning of important houses shows a basic principle of sustaining the power structure, that is, a strong congruence between consanguine hierarchy and spatial hierarchy. The analysis of the historical transition of the spatial structure of houses suggests a shift of power structure between male and female members within a family. The study clearly illustrates that a spatial structure can be understood as a historical text on which one can read a history of producing and sustaining the power structure within a society as shown in the analysis. The findings also imply that the power-space relationship can be meaningfully described only in its cultural context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A prototype decision support tool is described which provides options for the management of existing green spaces and for the establishment of new green space in suburban neighbourhoods. Suggested neighbourhood greening techniques include the naturalization of existing parks and increased foliage along streets and rights of way. The naturalization approach involves less frequent cutting in grassy fields, the introduction of native species, and the cessation of pesticide and herbicide applications. Increased plantings along streets and boulevards would improve the aesthetics of neighbourhoods, and may provide some relief from climatic extremes and urban heat island effects. The creation of new green space in already-built suburban neighbourhoods provides a longer term challenge to neighbourhood planners. Potential strategies include the introduction of small pocket parks and community gardens in vacant lots and school yards. Modelled outcomes from such neighbourhood greening strategies could be used in public meetings both to incorporate attitudes of the impacted community and to demonstrate benefits to a wider community. In particular, strategies should take into account issues of safety and perceived safety that commonly arise with the greater use of naturalization in green space management. The developed prototype decision support tool has been coded as an ArcView GIS extension and provides the opportunity to model and evaluate future scenarios better aligned to principles of sustainable community development. Three applications of this tool are discussed to illustrate some of the benefits of undertaking a range of neighbourhood greening strategies. </jats:p>",

Unlike traditional libraries based on print media, these new technologies facilitate the sharing of any information that can be expressed in a binary alphabet. Environmental models expressed as computer codes are instances of such information objects, and codes are the last of a four-stage process of model formulation. The transition to digital technologies changes the relative importance of the four stages. We present a six-stage model of the process of searching for information in distributed digital libraries. Search is made possible by metadata, which serve several distinct purposes, including description of the contents of information objects and their fitness for specified use, and the details needed to make use of information objects once accessed and retrieved. We present a straw-man structure for model metadata, explain the process used in its development, and invite its evaluation. </jats:p>",

This approach reflects the hierarchical order found in the urban environment: dwelling unit, building, neighbourhood, etc. This index expresses oppenness to natural light, air, and near and distant views, for each level in the hierarchical order. At the basis of this work is the assumption that the SOI is correlated with the ‘perceived density’, evaluated by people responding to alternative spatial configurations. A preliminary indication test was carried out in order to justify this assumption. In this test, groups of spatial configurations with equal built masses were ranked both by their calculated SOI and by statistical analysis of perceived density evaluated by participating individuals. Good agreement was found between pairs of results obtained for most of the spatial configurations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Design guidelines for dementia care homes have, in recent years, acknowledged the important role the internal environment plays in influencing the functional capabilities and emotional well-being of people with dementia. However, although the majority of people with dementia live in the community, similar guidance does not exist in relation to the outdoor environment. To identify aspects of design that should be considered in making the outside world dementia-friendly an analysis of the literature on the needs of older people with dementia and on current knowledge of best practice for internal environments was carried out. By drawing parallels with the outside environment this paper demonstrates that design solutions do potentially exist which would enable older people with dementia to continue to negotiate and use their local neighbourhoods. Familiarity, legibility, distinctiveness, accessibility, comfort, and safety all appear to have a major influence. Small street blocks with direct, connected routes and good visual access, varied urban form, and architectural features, and distinctive, unambiguous environmental cues could enhance successful orientation and wayfinding. Services and facilities within walking distance with adequate seating, lighting, shelter, and well-maintained, smooth, level, plain paving would ameliorate attending problems of physical frailty. The authors are now empirically testing these initial findings.</jats:p>",

However, it is often difficult even for the specialist to find his or her way among current and older scholarly studies dealing with various aspects of planned languages ([“artificial”] world [auxiliary] languages). The current study is intended to facilitate access to the scholarly literature by drawing the reader’s attention to the myriad sources of material worthy of use by the researcher. Particularly included, in addition to monographs, are such sources as anthologies, Festschriften, conference proceedings, university dissertations, and planned-language periodicals both current and older. Especially valuable for up-to-date information are general and specialized interlinguistics bibliographies, bibliographically oriented bulletins, and periodically published international bibliographies with sections on interlinguistics. Yielding most information is the bibliography on modern languages and literatures published by the Modern Language Association (MLA) in New York, which registers the newest materials annually. Specialized libraries, more and more easily consulted on-line, provide large quantities of materials worthy of research. The Internet is playing a growing role in making literature in the field available.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, planning based on answer set programming has been proposed as an approach towards realizing declarative planning systems. In this paper, we present the language Kc, which extends the declarative planning language K by action costs. Kc provides the notion of admissible and optimal plans, which are plans whose overall action costs are within a given limit resp. minimum over all plans (i.e., cheapest plans). As we demonstrate, this novel language allows for expressing some nontrivial planning tasks in a declarative way. Furthermore, it can be utilized for representing planning problems under other optimality criteria, such as computing ``shortest'' plans (with the least number of steps), and refinement combinations of cheapest and fastest plans. We study complexity aspects of the language Kc and provide a transformation to logic programs, such that planning problems are solved via answer set programming. Furthermore, we report experimental results on selected problems. Our experience is encouraging that answer set planning may be a valuable approach to expressive planning systems in which intricate planning problems can be naturally specified and solved.</jats:p>"

We begin by reviewing traditional approaches to diffusion within geography and explicating a specifically queer approach to the topic. Our approach builds on existing critical perspectives and certain principles of structurationism. We then apply this approach to our empirical research and activism in two very different locales: Duluth, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington.

The current drive to harmonize these standards on a global scale is supposed to reduce technical barriers to trade and create conditions for fair and free trade. However, as the case of the Polish meatpacking industry shows, standards often create new barriers because they are embedded in specific geographies. On the one hand, many harmonized standards favor large-scale multinational capital and bar local small-scale producers. On the other hand, the social legacies of previous economic systems—in this case, state socialism—give small-scale producers tools such as informal markets, personal social ties, and political organizing skills that can be used to create barriers for large multinational competitors. </jats:p>",

The user interface model begins with the weather generation submodel, which produces daily weather data, which is based on long‐term monthly average and standard deviation data from Delta, Utah. To simulate the daily crop water demand and relative crop yield for seven crops in two command areas, the information provided by this submodel was applied to the on‐farm irrigation scheduling submodel. Furthermore, to optimize the project benefit by searching for the best allocation of planted crop areas given the constraints of projected water supply, the results were employed in the genetic algorithm submodel. Optimal planning for the 394·6‐ha area of the Delta irrigation project is projected to produce the maximum economic benefit. That is, projected profit equals US$113 826 and projected water demand equals 3·03 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Also, area percentages of crops within UCA#2 command area are 70·1%, 19% and 10·9% for alfalfa, barley and corn, respectively, and within UCA#4 command area are 41·5%, 38·9%, 14·4% and 5·2% for alfalfa, barley, corn and wheat, respectively. As this model can plan irrigation application depths and allocate crop areas for optimal economic benefit, it can thus be applied to many irrigation projects.

We apply the concept to the relationship between rural communities and public land management. A 1999 study of residents in 12 communities neighboring the Chugach National Forest in Alaska was used during the revision of the Forest's land and resource management plan to assess the relationships between quality of life components and possible management activities being considered. Specifically, we addressed the following five questions: (1) What QOL components are most important to residents of the 14 neighboring local communities? (2) How satisfied are residents with the current status of the QOL components in their communities? (3) How do local respondent perceptions of QOL component importance compare with those of their peers nationwide? (4) If proposed forest management activities may adversely affect resident perceptions of QOL, what are the possible consequences to the communities? (5) How prepared are the communities to address any possible adverse consequences on their own? Our findings confirm that the Forest, probably not unlike other public land management units, has the ability to affect the quality of life of the communities neighboring it for better or for worse. However, the degree to which the communities' residents themselves are prepared for such change is equally significant. FOR. SCI. 49(4):479–498.</jats:p>",

Second, timeline concept is used to describe simultaneous activity, continue time, resource and temporal constraints. Third, for every planning agent in the MAPS, its layered architecture is designed and planning algorithm based on the temporal constraint satisfaction is given in detail.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The struggle between Yiddishism and Hebraism in the interwar Baltic states still awaits systematic investigation and requires the use of sources in many languages. Paul Ariste (1905–1990), a famous Estonian linguist and polyglot, learned Yiddish as a young man and remained fascinated with the language for his whole life. This case study of non-Jewish support of Yiddishism in Estonia examines the arguments Ariste used in a Yiddish-language speech in 1933 in the general context of Yiddishist ideology. A member of a small people himself, Ariste was mostly concerned with assimilation. Apparently he did not consider hebraisation of the diaspora a possibility and therefore did not see Hebrew as a serious rival of Yiddish. There are marked parallels between Estonian and Yiddish language planning problems in the interwar period: despite obvious differences in their sociolinguistic history, the languages faced somewhat similar problems. The language planning climate in both cases was characterised by sensitivity towards German. In Ariste’s view, German, attractive to Jews as a powerful language of high culture and a means of modernization, posed an ideological threat, but not a threat to Yiddish corpus planning, since Yiddish is different from German by definition. His advocacy of Yiddish differs from usual Yiddishist argumentation only in minor details. He might be compared to moderate Yiddishists.</jats:p>",

Accessing and interviewing chemically dependent pregnant women presents significant ethical challenges which are compounded by the vulnerability of this group, who often experience feelings of guilt, mistrust of health professionals, and a myriad of related health problems which can impact on their unborn child. This paper explores some ethical issues in relation to access, informed consent, the interview process, potential exploitation, invasion of privacy, and confidentiality related to information obtained and the publication of results.

On the other hand, it is not at all clear to any of the authors of these studies that the phenomenon is a necessary consequence of the political weight of international domination by the United States and the English-language world, and that accordingly a remedy must be found — above all the creation of a political power with a consistency at least comparable to that of the English-speaking world, and, secondarily, the adoption of a European federal language — and future world language — in the form of a planned language (Esperanto is the only one that is ready to use), which, not being the native language of any single people, nor the official tongue of a great power, would not have the “glottophagic” effect of English. Entirely utopian are those alternatives — merely apparent alternatives — currently being proposed in the face of the hegemony of English, such as mass multilingualism, which is neither realizable in practice nor capable of constituting a valid substitute for a single, worldwide language of communication. Such alternatives, almost certainly doomed to failure, will only confirm the conclusive victory of English and the progressive disappearance of other languages.</jats:p>",

The focus of this special issue was to determine if these articles are both consistent with extant research and advance the field. We identify at least two general definitions of coping, as used in these articles. We refer to one definition as reflecting one's “coping style.” This is largely a descriptive concept and closely related to one's enduring behavioral traits. It is closely related to other personality characteristics such as introversion–extroversion, stability, etc. The other definition of “coping” in the literature is much more specific to stressful environments and to the changes noted in one's behavior and cognitions during times of stress, than the first definition. We refer to this broad stress response as one's “coping response.” Coping response, unlike coping style, includes both a cognitive and an affective component. We conclude that it may be advantageous to differentiate between these two broad definitions in future research. We also conclude that the articles in this issue provide information that advances the field's understanding of coping styles and coping responses. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, one potentially overlooked aspect of the decision to buy or sell a home concerns the spatial characteristics associated with the property itself. To this end, the authors utilize the Cox proportional hazards approach to model housing duration as a function of spatial and property-specific variables. They incorporate exogenous spatial variables into their model by using GIS-based spatial modeling. They find that spatial factors, such as commuting time zones, as well as aspatial characteristics, such as equity constraints, are important for explaining housing turnover. Moreover, the applicability of the Cox proportional hazard model to the spatial analysis of housing duration is demonstrated. </jats:p>",

It investigates the diverse strategies of young people living in the border region in dealing with their life opportunities, and reflects upon the influencing factors such as the affiliation and connectedness of young people to their home area, the incentives to leave the home district and move to the urban centres versus staying in the area, the perception of the neighbouring country, and the motives behind going abroad for study or work. </jats:p>",

These findings are the basis for the use of clinical periodontal microbiology. Microbiological information can assist in diagnosis and treatment planning in periodontics, and is essential for the rational use of topical and systemic antimicrobial treatment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Interrogations of diasporic relations between place, subjectivity, and sexuality have transformed representational practices and paradigms of both Cuban and Cuban-American identity on multiple fronts. Through a consideration of two texts representing the Cuban diaspora-Achy Obejas's 1996 novel Memory Mambo and Carmelita Tropicana's performance piece “Milk of amnesia/Leche de amnesia”, first developed in 1994–I explore the centrality of sexuality in constructions of self, community, and nation. These works effectively ‘queer’ notions of immigrant belonging and Cuban diasporic consciousness, particularly in the sense of exploring the spatial imaginary of diaspora to expose and question the heteropatriarchal, and hence nationalist, underpinnings of more dominant models of diaspora. In their work, Obejas and Tropicana indicate the spatial dimensions of cultural memory and the imbrication of diasporic politics and sexualities. Attending to differences in genre, each work mines a crucial interplay between diasporic and sexual histories. In Tropicana's performance piece she uses a parodic sensibility and the broad humor enabled by the stage to engage, in a new register, with the politics of memory and the uses of place and sexuality, both in relation to Cuba and to the United States. Obejas works through and against the conventions of the contemporary novel (both immigrant and lesbian coming-of-age stories, in particular) to undo many of the assumptions regarding memory, sexuality, and cultural nostalgia as they are represented in her narrative. Both Obejas and Tropicana assert an imbrication of histories of colonialism, migration, and national attachment with experiences and practices of sexuality and gender in ways that underscore the importance of space and place in the constitution of collective memories. </jats:p>",

This stands in glaring contrast to the budgetary difficulties of most nonfunded European pension arrangements, which are a result of the changing demographic composition of the population. As a result, a growing number of European states is trying to transform the existing pay-as-you-go systems into funded pension arrangements. After a critical examination of these demographic projections, the claim that funded pension systems are not subject to ‘demographic stress’ is critically assessed. Finally, given the logic to which funded pension arrangements are subject, it is argued that the introduction of such institutions could result in a growing financialisation of the economy. It is claimed here that this is not without dangers for the long-term wealth-generating capacity of firms. So, not only are the reasons for pension restructuring less compelling than is generally thought, restructuring could also result in unwanted side-effects. </jats:p>",

Using a detailed mail survey (N = 407, response rate = 26.7%), a categorization indicating four planning levels was devised: nonplanners, short-term planners, short- and long-term planners, and long-term planners. Attractions with greater levels of planning were shown to have higher levels of perceived performance and faced the future with better growth prospects and business confidence. They also reported higher management turnover. Attraction research, it was argued, needs to develop with studies from different regions and histories to test the value of specific findings. In addition, multimethod approaches are needed to disentangle causality issues linking planning and attraction characteristics. </jats:p>",

A schedule is an order or sequence of harvest areas assigned to each crew. The harvesting of areas is planned in order to meet industrial demand. The total cost includes harvesting, transportation, and storage. One considerable cost is due to the quality reduction of logs stored at harvest areas. There are a number of restrictions to be considered. Areas are of varying size and the composition of assortments in each area is different. Each harvest team has different skills, a different home base, and different production capacity. Another aspect is the road network. There is a cost related to road opening (restoring, snow removal). In this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for the problem. The schedules are represented by 0/1 variables. With a limited number of schedules, the problem can be solved by a commercial MIP solver. We have also developed a heuristic solution approach that provides high‐quality integer solutions within a distinct time limit to be used when more schedules are used. Computational results from a major Swedish forest company are presented.</jats:p>",

The model addresses the tax burden that faces small firms at their different stages of growth and development, but the emphasis is on the start-up phase where small firms need more cash or liquidity relative to businesses at more developed stages of the business life cycle. It is recognized that one of the ways of bolstering the availability of cash and short-term liquidity for small firms is to offer them tax incentives and to design a system that reduces their compliance costs. The author looks at the importance of the small business sector and the stages of development and growth of firms; presenting the small business tax policy, and then providing some policy and managerial recommendations. The author's intention is not to measure direct tax and compliance costs, but simply to reflect on some key policy parameters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimization algorithms in inverse radiotherapy planning need information about the desired dose distribution. Usually the planner defines physical dose constraints for each structure of the treatment plan, either in form of minimum and maximum doses or as dose‐volume constraints. The concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was designed to describe dose distributions with a higher clinical relevance. In this paper, we present a method to consider the EUD as an optimization constraint by using the method of projections onto convex sets (POCS). In each iteration of the optimization loop, for the actual dose distribution of an organ that violates an EUD constraint a new dose distribution is calculated that satisfies the EUD constraint, leading to voxel‐based physical dose constraints. The new dose distribution is found by projecting the current one onto the convex set of all dose distributions fulfilling the EUD constraint. The algorithm is easy to integrate into existing inverse planning systems, and it allows the planner to choose between physical and EUD constraints separately for each structure. A clinical case of a head and neck tumor is optimized using three different sets of constraints: physical constraints for all structures, physical constraints for the target and EUD constraints for the organs at risk, and EUD constraints for all structures. The results show that the POCS method converges stable and given EUD constraints are reached closely.</jats:p>",

The change that took place in this short period of time is striking, with a falling level of ownership concentration, dissolving cross-holdings, and financial sector institutions losing their position as blockholders. The concentration of voting rights is lowest in companies included in the DAX30 stock-market index. Factors affecting the types of holders of voting rights in a company include the company size, age, economic sector, and location. The analysis shows that Germany made a quick step towards some aspects of the Anglo-American system of corporate governance. However, there are also areas of strong persistence of the German model. In addition, I show that the German model is far from uniform, with different types of companies and different regions demonstrating a variety of corporate governance arrangements as well as distinctive development trajectories. </jats:p>",

Efforts to map the geography of the epidemic served to reinforce the illusion that the borders of the nation might effectively be defended against the incursions of HIV via the bodies of those marked as outside the proper citizenry. The representation of Africa as the ‘cradle of AIDS’, the images of crack houses in narratives about urban AIDS in the United States, and stories of White gay men ‘going home to die’ in the ‘heartland’ constructed a geography of danger linking race, sexuality, and ‘home’ that promised security for those within particular borders. Emphasizing the power of racialized maternal compassion as a model for the national response to AIDS, these stories described normative heterosexual domesticity as a means of fixing sexuality in place. This geography proposed that individual family units might reinforce national borders which seemed increasingly fluid in the context of global flows of populations, a construction that illustrates the intersection of space and sexuality in the representation of an emerging global health crisis and produces spatializations of danger that continue to shape the construction of ‘global AIDS’. </jats:p>",

Targeting problem locations and developing plans to reduce collisions are vital and have proven to be very successful. Transportation professionals, however, should also take a proactive approach to address road safety before problems emerge. This paper describes an evolving need of how to deal with road safety in a proactive manner. Although a proactive approach should improve the overall safety performance, there is currently a poor understanding of how to proactively plan for road safety. Several logistical and technical obstacles hinder the effective planning for road safety. Each of these obstacles is presented in detail, followed by a description of the opportunity to overcome each obstacle. The paper also includes the results of a case study used to demonstrate the proposed process. A proactive approach to road safety complements traditional, reactive methods currently in use. Significant progress will be realized once safety professionals shift their focus from fixing existing problems to helping plan roads that attempt to be problem free. The net result should be a safer road system.Key words: proactive road safety, safety audits, safety planning, safety evaluation, safety improvements. </jats:p>",

Having discussed issues of nation-state fiscal capacity and the consequences of the technology, media, and telecommunications speculative bubble for stock market returns it is suggested that pension security is also a matter of institutional integrity. This is illustrated with reference to debate in US Congress over the proper response to the Enron debacle. It is argued that no public or private institutions (including the nation-state and large corporations) can now guarantee the final value of pension benefits. As the baby boom generation comes to retirement across the Western world, pension security in the form of guaranteed pension benefit value is a hollow ideal; a chimera on the horizon of nation-state politics that cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the commitment of many to social justice and social solidarity between the generations. </jats:p>",

It is variously described as a situational and as a trait‐like response, as a response to stress and as a disposition to respond to change. In this article, we review the current research on coping within the context of considering the contributions of the articles presented in this series. We present two broad views of coping, the more general one under the title of “coping response” defines coping as containing emotional, behavioral, and cognitive qualitites. It is generally considered to be a stress‐specific pattern by which an individual's perceptions, emotions, and behaviors prepare for adapting and changing. The more narrow view of coping is described here as “coping style” and represents a more observable but general style of interacting. In this usage, coping is a trait‐like variable that is activated when an environment changes in some way. It resembles other personality qualities and describes dispositions to respond in certain ways. In this article, we consider the implications and extant knowledge about coping within these two definitions, with special consideration to the prediction of treatment processes and outcomes. The articles in this series are discussed both in terms of extant research on these two views of coping and in terms of their contributions to the available literature on coping and coping responses. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) are increasingly regarded as engines of innovative activity, especially in some of the most dynamic local areas in Western Europe. However, most SMEs lack the adequate resources to conduct research and development (R&amp;D), which is traditionally considered as the main source of innovation. This apparent contradiction has induced several researchers to try to answer the question of where SMEs get their knowledge inputs. This literature, which has tended to use patents as a proxy for public research, has found that SMEs are particularly sensitive to spillovers from university and public research. In this paper the authors readdress this question by using a bibliometric indicator of public research output, instead of patents, for 100 Italian provinces during the 1990s. The results highlight that there is a strong geographical connection between the territorial concentration of SMEs and public research and that this connection is sensitive to firm size. </jats:p>",

Taagepera and Shugart argue, wrongly, that a fractal electoral map implies this. In fact, their premises imply that the seats' ratio will be the votes' ratio to the power of √3, not 3. However, in the six countries we examine, the figure is between 2 and 3. This implies that the electoral map is nonfractal, political allegiances becoming less ‘clustered’ as you move from a macro to a micro scale. Taking the United Kingdom, we ask if this is a result of the geographical pattern of income distribution, and find that this is even further away from fractality than is voting. This fits the well-known ‘neighbourhood effect’ whereby poor (rich) people in rich (poor) constituencies vote as if richer (poorer) than they really are. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors present findings from the initial phase of an ongoing externally funded research project into senior executive perceptions of the impact of capital taxation upon unquoted companies incorporated in the United Kingdom. Open-ended interviews were conducted with the senior executives of six unquoted companies which are also multigenerational family businesses. The interviews guided the executives to explore the history of their company; the values and aspirations of the founding or owning family(ies); the impact of capital taxation regimes, previous and current, both on ownership and on management succession; and strategies being pursued. Using content analysis to identify key themes, the authors suggest that their findings indicate that capital taxation may have a major impact both on ownership and on management succession as well as on succession planning. However, the current capital tax regime in the United Kingdom is perceived to be more favourable than that of previous regimes and vis-à-vis the regimes currently operating in most European countries. Capital taxation is not thought to influence strategic or operational decisions either positively or negatively. Companies use taxation-planning devices, frequently involving trusts, in order to reduce the actual burden of capital taxation falling upon individual shareholders at ownership succession. The present capital taxation regime, which includes gift relief and business asset taper relief within capital gains tax, and 100% business property relief within inheritance tax, eases succession planning. Business asset taper relief also facilitates shareholder exit strategies. </jats:p>",

However, rather than wholeheartedly embracing the logic of environmental economics, governments have preferred to introduce MBIs alongside more traditional command-and-control measures, ostensibly to guarantee that policy objectives are met. Where such regimes of governance have underperformed, this raises the question as to whether difficulties are caused principally by flawed theory or regulatory failure, namely errors in policy design that distort MBIs from intended changes in market behaviour. Analysis of a tradable-permit scheme in Packaging Recovery Notes introduced to implement the UK Packaging Regulations reveals that, in this case, the difficulties experienced with an MBI were, in fact, traceable to regulatory failure. Different types of regulatory failure are identified and discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the literature of corporate greening, the regulatory domain has been identified as a key influence on the environmental behaviour of firms and has been linked to actions beyond compliance and to the pursuit of competitive advantage. That said, studies of the environmental performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) suggest that, on the whole, smaller firms tend to take a more reactive and compliant stance with regard to environmental legislation, with little evidence existing to suggest that regulation provides a strong baseline for internally driven change. The authors report the findings from empirical research undertaken to assess the impact of environmental legislation upon the activities of SMEs within the screen-printing sector in the United Kingdom and explore the motivations that have driven responses to such legislation. The aim of the research was to examine the extent to which regulation was a factor in explaining SME environmental behaviour, and to identify the nature of corporate responses to environmental change. In addressing these issues a hybrid methodology was adopted, based on a quantitative survey of 200 firms in the UK screen-printing industry and a qualitative analysis of five organisations chosen from the survey respondents. The results of the survey—which had a usable response rate of 33%—and from the case-study interviews shed important light on SME attitudes, awareness, and responses to existing regulatory requirements. The authors comment on how far the evidence supports the propositions in the extant literature and examine possible policy implications of the findings. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In late modernity there has been a shift in the ways that individuals relate to society, in which traditional ideas, expectations, and hierarchies are being reworked. Released from the constraints and social norms of tradition, individuals, it is argued, are now freer to choose between a range of options in the pursuit of their own happiness. Notably, these social changes have been understood to provide more opportunities for lesbians and gay men to ‘come out’—disclose their sexuality and live the lifestyle of their choice. Coming out is often implicitly discussed in academic literatures as an individual decision, and the consequences of coming out are also usually explored in relation to the personal narratives of the individual who has disclosed a lesbian and gay sexuality. To date, little attention has been paid to the actual processes through which sexual dissidents negotiate their identities with others, and to the consequences of such disclosures for those who are close to them or share their lives in various ways. In this paper we address this omission by focusing on young people's experiences of coming out with, and in, families of origin. We begin by examining what is at stake in the decision whether to come out or not by examining the role that families of origin play in young people's lives. We then explore how the process of coming out is actually negotiated within different families. Finally, we consider the ‘outcomes’ of these choices. In doing so we contribute to research on geographies of sexualities, geographies of the ‘family’, youth transitions, and the emerging field of social studies of emotions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As firms grow, taxation and, in particular, value added tax (VAT), is one of the first areas in which they must deal with government regulations. It has been argued in the United Kingdom that regulatory requirements are burdensome and can even be a constraint on the development and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors focus on SMEs and link the literature on VAT regulations and compliance costs to wider issues relating to SMEs. The costs of complying with VAT regulations are separated into core costs and total costs. Core costs are the mandatory costs that SMEs have to incur in order to comply with the VAT legislation and regulations. Total costs include VAT planning and one-off costs. For SMEs core costs represent a larger proportion of total compliance costs than is the case for larger businesses. A reduction in core costs would have a significant impact on the total VAT-compliance costs for SMEs. Factors expected to be associated with higher compliance costs are identified and tested in a multivariate framework. Empirical data were obtained from a survey of 4796 firms resulting in a final sample of 1085 firms and a response rate of 25.1%. Higher compliance costs (in absolute terms) are associated, inter alia, with increased turnover, newly registered firms, and increased complexity. Firms with higher compliance costs also perceived high psychological costs of VAT compliance. Compliance costs were also higher for individuals who did not have English as their first language, and individuals with special needs. The important implications of the findings for policy are highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment planning for brachytherapy requires the acquisition of geometrical information of the implant applicator and the patient anatomy. This is typically done using a simulator or a computed tomography scanner. In this study, we present a different method by which orthogonal images from a C‐arm fluoroscopic machine is used for high dose rate brachytherapy treatment planning. A typical C‐arm is not isocentric, and it does not have the mechanical accuracy of a simulator. One solution is to place a reconstruction box with fiducial markers around the patient. However, with the limited clearance of the C‐arm this method is very cumbersome to use, and is not suitable for all patients and implant sites. A different approach is adopted in our study. First, the C‐arm movements are limited to three directions only between the two orthogonal images: the C‐orbital rotation, the vertical column, and the horizontal arm directions. The amounts of the two linear movements and the geometric parameters of the C‐arm orbit are used to calculate the location of the crossing point of the two beams and thus the magnification factors of the two images. Second, the fluoroscopic images from the C‐arm workstation are transferred in DICOM format to the planning computer through a local area network. Distortions in the fluoroscopic images, with its major component the “pincushion” effect, are numerically removed using a software program developed in house, which employs a seven‐parameter polynomial filter. The overall reconstruction accuracy using this method is found to be 2 mm. This filmless process reduces the overall time needed for treatment planning, and greatly improves the workflow for high dose rate brachytherapy procedures. Since its commissioning nearly three years ago, this system has been used extensively at our institution for endobronchial, intracavitary, and interstitial brachytherapy planning with satisfactory results.</jats:p>",

Some forms of social networks, such as contact with friends and participation in organised groups, promoted trust, attachment to neighbourhood, and tolerance or respect for others. Notably, neighbourhoods in which family ties were predominant tended to be less tolerant. The cognitive aspects of social cohesion (trust, attachment, practical help, and tolerance or respect) tended to be lower in more materially deprived areas.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The manual verification of a radiotherapy treatment, where a portal image is matched onto a planning image, is very time consuming and subject to inter‐ and intraobserver variability. Therefore, a fully automatic matching procedure (image registration) is required. Existing automatic matching algorithms are confounded, however, by irrelevant information in the portal images (i.e., air in the intestines). Therefore, we have developed a new method, which is an extension of chamfer matching and uses, apart from the distance to the nearest edge, additional information on the correspondence of the gradient angle and magnitude of the edges, making the method less sensitive to confounding information in the images. To validate the automatic matching procedure in clinical practice, we applied the new method on 157 images of 29 randomly selected patients treated for carcinoma of the prostate. Three experts manually matched these images in consensus. Subsequently, the same observers assessed the results of the automatic registration. When regular chamfer matching is used for the fully automatic matching procedure, only 5% of the image pairs could be matched correctly, whereas the new method successfully registered 80% by using additional information on the angle of the edges. From the results of the validation study it can be concluded that a significant reduction in workload for the physicians and technicians can be achieved with this method.</jats:p>",

If conflicts prove to exist between different goals, road-pricing schemes are not likely to achieve the environmental goal. To investigate the degree to which these goal conflicts exist, members of the local governments in the three major metropolitan areas of Sweden responded to a survey questionnaire. In the questionnaire they rated a number of principles guiding the setting of road-pricing fees hypothesized to correspond to the three goals. The results showed that, for the political majority, the hypothesized goal conflicts existed in that no single goal was optimized. It is concluded that in particular fairness may prevent road pricing achieving the environmental goal. </jats:p>",

There exists a dynamic phenomenon that clothes may unfold naturally under the influence of gravity if they are hung-up under clothes that have been grasped at two points on their outline. Humans skillfully deform clothing with this technique, and this is a useful method to unfold clothes for a robot. Initially, the conditions for determining the grasping points to enable the robot to unfold clothes were determined based on the observed phenomenon. Secondly, the task of deformation of clothes that includes an action for restoring torsion on a sleeve of a shirt is described. Lastly, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental evidence.</jats:p>",

To assist in recovery planning, we determined the population structure of sockeye salmon in the region by assaying the genetic variability of 10 microsatellite DNA loci in samples of sockeye salmon from 22 sites associated with 15 rearing lakes. Samples of sockeye salmon from the watersheds with the largest historical runs in the region were studied. Special emphasis was given to investigating genetic divergence among sockeye salmon spawning in seven rivers of the Owikeno Lake watershed, which once supported the largest sockeye salmon run in south-central British Columbia. Across the region, a mosaic of genetic divergence was evident. Reproductive isolation among watersheds was pronounced in all but one case, making transfer of fish between watersheds inadvisable. Genetic stock identification simulations demonstrated that fish from different watersheds could be accurately distinguished—which will allow for identification of threatened stocks in coastal mixed-stock fishery samples. Within the Owikeno Lake watershed we found little evidence of persistent genetic structure, which precludes the use of genetic stock identification to estimate escapements to its glacially turbid tributaries. Lack of persistent structure supports managing the majority of Owikeno Lake sockeye salmon as a single population.</jats:p>",

This explorative study is part of the ongoing small business taxation research programme undertaken in association with NatWest Bank. The research involves (a) the computation of the tax position of a sample of UK-based small businesses (a self-employed person, a partnership, and a small limited company); (b) the application of the tax regime of New York State to the UK business cases studies; (c) the development of two computer simulation models that estimate the direct tax burden incurred by small businesses in the United Kingdom; and (d) the application of the tax regime of New York State to the UK models. This research forms the basis of a comparative discussion about the business tax regime in the United Kingdom and USA and throws some light on the on-going debate about the development of the tax regimes applicable to small businesses in OECD countries. The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings and policy implications and offers a brief discussion on progress towards tax harmonisation from the small business perspective. </jats:p>",

The article examines three federal agencies in the United States with a potential role in planning and coordinating library services: the Library of Congress, the National Commission on Library and Information Science (NCLIS), and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The principal function of the Library of Congress is to serve as the primary source of library resources and services to the Congress of the United States. Over the years, however, the mission of the Library of Congress has expanded to serve the nation as a whole. NCLIS was created in 1970 with the charge to advise Congress and the President on matters related to library and information services, however it does not undertake planning of library services at the national level. IMLS is an independent federal agency that now serves as the primary source of federal grants for the nation's libraries and museums. Since the vast majority of all funding for libraries of all types is local, the federal role in the United States has therefore been limited to leveraging state and local support, and to fostering the development of standards and best practices and supporting leadership and education for the profession of librarianship. State Five-Year Plans submitted to IMLS in order to qualify for funding under the state grant program constitute, in aggregate, a de facto national plan for library services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intravascular brachytherapy (IVB) can significantly reduce the risk of restenosis after interventional treatment of stenotic arteries, if planned and applied correctly. To facilitate computer‐based IVB planning, a three‐dimensional vessel model has been derived from information on coronary artery segments acquired by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and biplane angiography. Part I describes the approach of model construction and presents possibilities of visualization. The vessel model is represented by a voxel volume. Polygonal information about the vessel wall structure is derived by segmentation from a sequence of IVUS images automatically acquired ECG gated during pull back of the IVUS transducer. To detect horizontal, vertical, and radial contours, modified Canny‐Edge and Shen‐Castan filters are applied on Cartesian and polar coordinate representations of the IVUS tomograms as edge detectors. The spatial course of the vessel wall layers is traced in reconstructed longitudinal IVUS scans. By resampling the sequence of IVUS frames the voxel volume is obtained. For this purpose the frames are properly located in space and augmented with additional intermediate frames generated by interpolation. Their spatial location and orientation is derived from biplane X‐ray angiography which is performed simultaneously. For resampling, two approaches are proposed: insertion of the vertices of the rectangular goal grid into the cells of a deformed hexahedral mesh derived from the IVUS sequence, and insertion of the vertices of the hexahedral mesh into the cells of the rectangular grid. Finally, the vessel model is visualized by methods of combined volume and polygon rendering. The segmentation process is verified as being in good agreement with results obtained by manual contour tracing with a commercial system. Our approach of construction of the vessel model has been implemented into an interactive software system, <jats:italic>3D IVUS‐View</jats:italic>, serving as the basis of a future system for intracoronary brachytherapy treatment planning being currently under development (Part II).</jats:p>",
