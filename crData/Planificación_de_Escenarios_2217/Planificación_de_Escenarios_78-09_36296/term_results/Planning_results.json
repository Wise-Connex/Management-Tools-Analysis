It was found that at lower levels of nuisance, household income and related variables were major determinants of monetary estimates and played a greater part than noise or traffic variables. The results appear to be comparable with estimates derived by economists from the study of depreciation of house prices as a consequence of noise. The general significance of the findings is discussed and suggestions for further study are made. </jats:p>",

There is an increasing need for this kind of information in order to complement information about stock. In this sense certain aspects of the methodology employed in a multipurpose household survey for Greater Buenos Aires are examined (in section 2 of the paper). The design of this survey permits the reinterviewing of a part of the sample, and therefore the measurement of flows is possible. However, certain shortcomings arise from the method used, and these are analysed. Then some ways of improving the information by changing some aspects of the survey are put forward. Section 3 of the paper deals with nonsurvey methods for improving the quality of the information by use of data from other sources. Therefore alternative methods for the adjustment of matrices (which are frequently used for updating input–output tables) are discussed and applied to one of the tables presented in section 2. Finally, in section 4, an evaluation of this method is given in order to gain some insights into the possibilities of this approach. </jats:p>",
