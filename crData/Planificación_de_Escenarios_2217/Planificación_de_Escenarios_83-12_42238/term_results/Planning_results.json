These interventions are explained dialectically as attempted solutions to the contradictions and conflicts surrounding the use of urban land. The major contradiction centers around the necessity for a more rational urban development and the private control of urban land. The conflicts generated by this contradiction arc seen as historically specific and tied to changes in the class struggle. Through historical analysis, I show how various planning laws were the response to legitimation needs raised by developments in the class struggle. The Italian State, however, is constrained by: (1) its commitment to supporting capital accumulation through the private appropriation of urban land; and (2) its political indebtedness to real-estate interests, thus making attempts at land-use planning cither stillborn or inadequate and contradictory, generating, in turn, other contradictions and struggles. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Analysis of the practice of planning is increasingly being used to develop planning theory, The papers by Roweis and Forester in the second issue of Environment and Planning D: Society and Space base analysis of planning practice on hermeneutic, linguistic, and phenomenological approaches, as an alternative to the technical -rational approach to planning theory, In the present paper, I argue that the approaches adopted by these two authors create more problems than they solve, and a critique of Roweis's and Forester's theoretical ideas is made, It is argued that these approaches rest upon idealist ontological assumptions, rendering explanation of qualitative change (development) impossible. Discussion of Giddens's concept of structuration and of the negative consequences for scientific explanation of Habermas's epistemological position is presented, as both approaches are used by Roweis and Forester. Criticism is also made of the separation of territorial relations from relations of substance. Finally, the serious consequences of their approaches for scientific and social practice are outlined. I conclude that this type of approach cannot provide a satisfactory basis for planning theory, and furthermore, that the approach is inherently conservative. Some ideas arc presented concerning planning theory based on materialist ontological foundations. </jats:p>",

This represents young, small, simple organizations at the one end and older, large, complex organizations, at the other end of the continuum. As the size and complexity of organizations increase, their characteristics change so as to meet their more complex differentiative or integrative needs. In addition to changing the characteristics of the internal decision structure along the continuum to achieve integration, it is found that organizations also increase their involvement in planning as their size and complexity increase. With the aid of an environmental cluster analysis it is also observed that organizations which operate in increasingly complex operational environments tend to increase their degree of involvement in corporate planning.It is possible to conclude with confidence that the greater the differentiation and environmental uncertainty caused by growth, diversification and organizational complexity, the greater become the integrative needs provided by the range of facilities of corporate planning. The survey results reveal a facet previously ignored in the classic concept of corporate planning. While environmental uncertainty does play a part in determining the degree of an organization's involvement in the corporate planning process, the complexity of the organization itself plays a stronger and more dominant role in dictating the degree of involvement. In the South African context, planning is primarily a powerful internal integrator of complex organizations, and only secondarily, a management technique for coping with uncertain future business environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Palazzo Pitti was the center of courtly life in grand-ducal Florence. This study contributes to our knowledge of daily activity within this immense structure by examining the scattered but extensive sources for its later history. It focuses on a set of plans by G. M. Marmi indicating the major divisions between ceremonial and residential functions in the palace. The most important feature of its internal arrangement-the clustered plan for the family apartments, modelled on that of Giuliano da Sangallo for the villa at Poggio a Caiano-may be seen as a characteristic feature of contemporary Medicean residences. Records of official visits suggest that the Pitti's great size was due to diplomatic protocol, namely, the constant entertainment and housing of visitors to the Medicean court. In addition, a study of population statistics shows the Pitti's impact on the social composition of its surrounding area.</jats:p>",

From comments on the implications of this definition, the prospects for PB being present in Britain are discussed from a back-cloth comparison between political systems in Britain and the United States of America. The ‘motives’, ‘means’, and ‘opportunities' for PB in Britain are adjudged, and a review made of possible areas of such political activity, among individual members of parliament, in one-off Westminster decisions, in more continuous streams of central government policy, in the spheres of parliamentary boundary reform and the Rate Support Grant, and among the political activities of local authorities. There is little indisputable evidence for PB in Britain, and the conclusion suggests this may be consequential on a number of different factors. </jats:p>",

Four marital statuses are used: never married, presently married, divorced, and widowed. Marital status life tables are computed for three periods: 1960–1965, 1965–1970, and 1970–1975, and, for each period, differences between males and females and between whites and blacks are described. We examine the proportion of a life-table cohort ever marrying, the mean age at first marriage, the number of marriages per person marrying, the proportion of marriages ending in divorce, the average duration of a marriage (or a divorce, or a widowhood), and the like. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally, negotiations in Connecticut concerning teacher contract renewal are conducted at the local level between members of the district board of education and members of the district teacher union. However, with the adoption in Connecticut of ‘issue last offer’ binding arbitration, there has been an acceleration in the use of professional bargaining representatives, including attorneys and Statewide union agents. The proliferation of professional representatives, together with the introduction of professional arbitrators, helps explain many of the phenomena associated with the early years of this new procedure: namely, an initial increase in the proportion of school districts going to arbitration rather than settling during an earlier negotiation phase; an upsurge in the standardization of collective agreements at the expense of innovation and situational responsiveness; and, more important, a loss in the local ‘flavor’ of the negotiation process. This paper will critically examine the implications of these trends both for the political nature of educational dispute resolution in Connecticut and for the spatial distribution of bargaining power. </jats:p>",

In an attempt to restore profitability, private capital, national states, and the supranational EEC (European Economic Community) initiated a series of severe capacity and employment cuts, which were unevenly distributed within the EEC, concentrated both at national and at regional scales. This distribution was intimately related to the strategies of those directly employed in the steel industry and those indirectly dependent upon steel employment in contesting proposed closure plans. This paper examines in detail anticlosure campaigns in the Northeast of England and in the Nord and Lorraine in France, interpreting them in terms of territory and class as bases for social organization, and attempts to draw some more general theoretical and political implications from these specific cases. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The enormity of many cities today poses special problems for authorities supplying emergency medical services. The scale of the emergency system and variations in the operating conditions rule out some of the traditional methods developed to deal with the complexities involved. In cities the provision of services is affected not only by the daily varying locations of the populations at risk, but also by the prevailing traffic and weather conditions that can hinder ambulance access to the site of an incident or to a treatment facility. The controlling authorities of these services nevertheless like to maintain the highest possible levels of service given the available resources. They are interested in knowing which facilities to open and when, what resources and staffing levels are required, and what the long-term and short-term implications of changing operating conditions and of other unforeseen circumstances are on operating standards. In this paper the authors present research into a set of methods that are designed to assist in finding solutions to these problems or, at least, in understanding how to deal with them. The methods are based on the efficiency of movement in cities, particularly the time it takes to access different locations in different traffic conditions, and on the likelihood of incidents occurring at different times of the day. Initial results are presented based on the London area, but the main conclusions are transferable to many other cities of comparable scale. The distinguishing feature of the methods is that they are based on a type of non-Euclidean geometry that arises from the generalized profiles of the average speeds of traffic flow in cities. </jats:p>",

LULUs are development projects that are predictably objectionable to many of their neighbors. Examples are nuclear power plants, hazardous waste facilities, refineries, and airports. The paper begins by elaborating the idea of LULUs, focussing on those whose planning typically requires or invokes some form of LP/HC risk analysis. It then discusses how land planning and planners actually use the LP/HC approach to deal with LULUs. It argues that in practice land‐use planners and their associates employ a concept of risk different from that of economists, scientists, and engineers and more like that of political decision‐makers and the public at large. It concludes with a political interpretation that offers some suggestions for productively reducing this divergence in the treatment of LULUs that pose LP/HC risks.</jats:p>",

This paper re-examines the role of manpower planning in the university sector, in light of new economic imperatives and new data production initiatives by Employment and Immigration Canada. It concludes by rejecting what is conventionally referred to as manpower planning, and offering, instead, a set of guidelines for improving the linkage between universities and the labour market within the framework of existing institutional and policy structures.</jats:p>"

The author presents a general matrix model of the framework, shows how its parameters can be estimated from fixed-interval census migration data, and discusses how the framework can be employed to ‘update’ population projections when recent, more limited data sets become available. These features of the framework are demonstrated with intrametropolitan central-city-suburb projections for selected US Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas over the period, 1970–2020. </jats:p>",
