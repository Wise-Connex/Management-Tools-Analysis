This paper describes a general approach to planning and control which is aimed at overcoming these problems. How best to set up the organisation and management is considered, a planning method is outlined, and the major factors which influence the control of cost and schedule are discussed.</jats:p>",

Up to now they have used and developed the theory to clarify and modify the practice and study of Tavistock Self-Study Groups. The authors believe that the theory can be applied to natural work groups as well. They examine the protocol of a day's meeting of the management team of a social service organization. By examining the latent and manifest content of the protocol and by studying the impact of their own interventions as consultants to the team, they show how the group was unconsciously struggling to solve a developmental problem. Most importantly, the group was trying to discover how to criticize their beloved leader in the face of his fear that if they did he might abandon them. The authors suggest that the theory of unconscious group planning may enable theorists and consultants to better understand the problem-solving processes of natural work groups. </jats:p>",

The problems that arise, especially in the areas of lot‐sizing and sequencing/scheduling, and their possible solutions are discussed. Since increased adoption of GT is expected within the next decade, an intensified research effort is warranted in these and other areas so that existing MRP systems can be modified or extended to handle cellular manufacturing control problems.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Subject Areas: Material Requirements Planning and Production/Operations Management</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Four land-use policies containing timber harvesting, dispersed recreation, developed recreation, hunting and wildlife management are considered for a parcel of land incorporating 11,070 ha. The goals for each type of land-use are analyzed in terms of land-use capability coefficients, various priority settings, and planning horizons spanning from 2 to 36 years. It is shown that multiple-use conflicts can be resolved by either changing the priorities associated with conflicting uses, and (or) by extending planning horizons from short- to medium-term or long-term. Key Words: Land-use planning, multiple-use, goal programming, timber, developed and dispersed recreation, hunting, wildlife.</jats:p>",

Five shift-share analyses are used here to explore the data on employment and redundancies, three of them conducted at ‘minimum list heading’ level. The period 1976 to 1979 is one of poor performance by regions of traditional policy interest, whereas the events of 1980 are seen as essentially a national phenomenon. However, bias in the industrial composition of the recession towards manufacturing in general and towards certain individual products is sufficient to focus its very worst effects on Wales, the West Midlands, and the North West. </jats:p>",

It discusses the results of the application to Sapporo in Japan of a set of measures intended for the comparison of accessibility patterns between, within, and across cities in Pacific Rim countries. After detailing an appropriate conceptual framework attention is focused on measuring the opportunities various groups have of participating in urban activities. Mesoaccessibility and macroaccessibility measures are both used for this purpose. First, Sapporo is put into its regional and national context. Then the mesoaccessibility measures are presented as a means of understanding the local area impact of national and metropolitan level policies. Macroaccessibility measures are illustrated with specific reference to the labour market in 1975 before they are applied as a means of ‘teasing out’ the distributional consequences of the proposed Sapporo regional land-use and transport plan for 1995. The implications of the results of these analyses for Japanese planners are specified, and a reassessment is made of the accessibility measures as the basis for comparative urban studies in the Pacific Rim. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The financial health of local authorities in England and Wales is examined over the period 1974/1975-1980/1981 to determine the manner in which financial positions have been affected by central government transfers under the rate support grant. The results of the analysis are preliminary pending fuller analysis of needs positions, but they do demonstrate that local party control has very little relation to grant allocations. This is mostly because of the interrelation with levels of urban stress, which is found to be a very significant correlate with levels of grant received. It is concluded, therefore, that in contrast to the USA, local authorities in England and Wales have received progressively larger grants in relation to higher levels of urban stress. </jats:p>",
