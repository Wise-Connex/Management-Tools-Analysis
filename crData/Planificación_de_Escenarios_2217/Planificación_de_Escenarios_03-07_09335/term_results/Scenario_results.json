Goal programming as a methodology emphasises the resolution of conflict among criteria; scenario planning focuses on the treatment of uncertainty relating to future states of the world. Integrating the two methodologies is based on the simple formulation of a super‐goal programme consisting of one scenario‐specific goal program in each scenario. Issues relating to the structuring of the super‐problem, aggregation both within and over scenarios, and the incorporation of probabilistic information are discussed.

Sea-level fall resulted from sudden cooling due to increased volcanic activity. This generated global thermal insulation and subsequent glaciation. The regression is responsible for a major hiatus over NW-European epicontinental seas and is later followed by the well-known Lower Toarcian transgression. The interval corresponding to this hiatus allowed vegetation to colonise vast newly emerged surfaces. The leaching and drowning of the accumulated organohumic matter then triggered the anoxic cycle at the transgressive maximum, concomitant with a global warming.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Salt accumulation in soil is a global problem. This paper investigates salt‐affected soils on a global scale through spatial modeling within a Geographical information system (GIS). As salt‐affected soils arise due to a range of processes that can be very localized and complex in nature, three main indicators have been developed to provide insight into areas at risk of salinization at a global scale. At this scale, climate and topography are the main factors influencing solute accumulation. The paper derives salinity indicators from global data sets and compares them to independent maps of salt‐affected areas. The primary indicators are (1) low relief, (2) high two‐way annual moisture flux, and (3) local flow deficit in large catchments. The first two of these are related for conditions where there is potential for a large vertical flux of salts, and where groundwater levels may be high, providing conditions for salt accumulation locally or at the base of slope catenas. The third indicator is related to conditions where there is a risk of accumulation of salts in floodplains and adjacent irrigated areas. These salinity indicators are then estimated for future GCM scenarios of climate for 2079–2099. Comparison of the current and scenario indicator distributions shows that the areas at risk of salinization may increase globally, through both expansion of existing areas and the creation of new ones. Current distributions of risk, and to a greater extent future scenarios, are limited by the quality and resolution of available data, and have the potential for enhancement as these data improve.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, we analyse the effects of vibrations and the atmosphere on the performance of a broadband laser inter‐satellite link (BLISL) which was studied within the framework of the BLISL joint Israeli–German applied research project. The use of optical radiation as a carrier between satellites and in satellite‐to‐ground links enables transmission using very narrow beam divergence angles. Due to the narrow beam divergence angle and the large distance between the satellite and the ground station or airplane the pointing is a complicated process. Further complication results from vibration of the pointing system caused by two fundamental mechanisms of a stochastic nature: (1) tracking noise created by the electro‐optic tracker and (2) vibrations caused by internal satellite mechanical mechanisms. Additionally an inhomogeneity in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere leads to variations of the refractive index along the transmission path. These variations of refractive index as well as pointing vibrations can cause fluctuations in the intensity and the phase of the received signal leading to an increase in link error probability. In this paper, we develop a bit error probability (BEP) model that takes into account both pointing vibrations and turbulence‐induced log amplitude fluctuations (i.e. signal intensity fading) in a regime in which the receiver aperture D<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> is smaller than the turbulence coherence diameter d<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>. Our results indicate that BLISL can achieve a BEP of 10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> and data rate of 1Gbps with normalized pointing vibration of G<jats:sub>T</jats:sub>*σ<jats:sub>θ</jats:sub><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.05 and turbulence of σ<jats:sub>X</jats:sub>=0.3.
