      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents a personal review by the author of Collaborative Planning: Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies, published in 1997. It explains how the book came to be written and makes some comments on the various criticisms it has attracted. The first section introduces key experiences that fed into the book followed by a brief summary of the key ideas that underpin its arguments. In reviewing the critiques, the article focuses in particular on the treatment of `context', the emphasis on `process', the use of `social theory', and `power', and the development of `institutionalist' analysis. This is followed by a comment on the normative biases in the work. In conclusion, the author makes a plea for continuing attention to the complexity and diversity of urban governance contexts and the importance for practical action of grasping the particularities of situated governance dynamics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article revisits Throgmorton's 1996 claim that planning can be thought of as a form of persuasive storytelling about the future. It responds to three broad lines of critique, connects the claim to contemporary scholarship about `transnational urbanism' and the `network society,' and revises the author's initial claim. This revision suggests that planners should tell future-oriented stories that help people imagine and create sustainable places. It further argues that, to be persuasive to a wide range of readers, planners' stories will have to make narrative and physical space for diverse locally-grounded common urban narratives. It recognizes that powerful actors will strive to eliminate or marginalize competing stories. </jats:p>",

They are not sufficient in case of large-scale inner-city developments. Following an „intermediary peak” in the last decade, new urban districts in the surrounding areas are not cosistent anymore with the emerging demographic development. Traffic remains a problem for intermediate city and suburbia: it is too dispersive for local public transport, the distances are too large to go by bicycle and foot. The dependence on the car binds a considerable part of budgets. Inner-city development benefits from the proximity to already available uses. The way in which mixed land use is individually handled, determines traffic-related effects. The related (controversial) discussion will be presented in the following.</jats:p>"

It involves significant investment and it is necessary to account for a large number of geologic, economic, and technical parameters. Most of these parameters are uncertain and these uncertainties must be considered when evaluating the risks associated with the projects.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An appropriate choice of production strategy will ensure proper reservoir performance, leading to a satisfactory recovery.

The procedure was developed for several types of reservoirs and includes producer and injector vertical wells. Furthermore, it uses reservoir simulations to provide reliable production/injection forecasts for the evaluation of an objective-function. The procedure was developed in a flexible way and can be adapted to different situations.

This methodology helps in the decision-making process, looking to maximize the profits and minimize the risks associated with the investment. An example, based on an Atlantic offshore field in Campos Basin, Brazil, is presented. It shows the importance of reservoir simulation in field development planning for petroleum reservoirs, including water injection.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Methodology</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>This work proposes a methodology to support managers in the decision-making process for the initial field development stage. It presents a set of alternatives that are analyzed to select the water injection pattern that leads to the best reservoir performance, utilizing the objectives previously defined for the project. This methodology is comprised of six steps that can be simplified or discarded depending on the characteristics of the problem. These steps are presented in the flowchart in Figure 1 and the optimization algorithm is presented in Figure 2.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Case Study</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The example used for the validation of the methodology developed in this work is water injection planning for an Atlantic offshore field in Campos Basin, Brazil.

In order to respond to accusations of ageism within the industry it is suggested that regulation may be required to raise the awareness of advertisers and agencies to the importance of older people, and to encourage more age diverse advertising. This paper presents the findings of a study conducted to elicit the opinions of advertising industry commentators about the issue of ageism in advertising. The general opinion was that the industry was ageist, and may require the incentive of regulation before it will respond to the needs of the older population.</jats:p>",

However, during the last two decades, companies have developed their international activities more on a contingency basis. The international market behaviour has also been influenced by a need to take advantage of different market opportunities and by an increasing need to serve customers in the global market environment. Due to the competitive situation, it might also have been necessary to introduce products more quickly on different international markets. In other situations it has been of importance to acquire companies to be able to build up a market position in the local market The purpose with this paper has therefore been to study the need for changes in the international marketing strategy due to requirements from the customers in the local marketplace.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses the strategic planning needs of the KM deployment process, and develops a framework that could be used specifically by engineering firms to guide the KM implementation process.</jats:p>",

One way of improving competitive advantage is to attract more customers and increase customer retention; for example, by developing long‐term, secure relationships between the buyers and sellers. Little empirical research has been conducted on the link between customer relationship management and customer loyalty within an Internet, or e‐commerce, context. This study provides evidence of how to improve planning for customer management by presenting and testing a conceptual model of the process by which the implementation of electronic relationship marketing (e‐CRM), can enhance loyalty. While building the research framework, price sensitivity was found to be a primary confounding element on loyalty and was included in the study for control. An exploratory study of Internet retailers, e‐retailers, and their customers was conducted and the findings revealed that e‐retail companies (with CD, DVD, video and book products) should consider customers’ perceptions of relationship marketing efforts, as they are fundamental to enhancing customer loyalty and that an enhancement of customer loyalty reduces price sensitivity.</jats:p>",

Using historic data taken from the patient administration system of a large district general hospital situated in Plymouth, England, the model shows the importance of understanding the profile of risk behind non‐elective planning. This understanding may lead to more robust waiting times planning, promoting open dialogue between the trust and its commissioners on how such risk is managed. It also allows for the setting of clear goals for admission avoidance and early discharge schemes. At a strategic level, an understanding of the stochastic nature of non‐elective admissions raises questions about the potential cost of entirely ring‐fencing elective workload, disallowing the sharing of beds in times of peak demand. As a specific policy manifestation of this proposed ring‐fencing, the development of “diagnostic and treatment centres” may need to be more pragmatic than the “purist” view being expressed in the <jats:italic>NHS Plan</jats:italic> if overall efficiency is not to be significantly reduced.</jats:p>",

However, future utilisation of UAVs for applications such as bistatic synthetic aperture radar and stereoscopic imaging, will require the use of multiple UAVs acting cooperatively to achieve mission goals. In addition, to de-skill the operation of UAVs for certain applications will require the migration of path-planning functions from the ground to the UAV. This paper details a computationally efficient algorithm to enable path-planning for single UAVs and to form and re-form UAV formations with active collision avoidance. The algorithm presented extends classical potential field methods used in other domains for the UAV path-planning problem. It is demonstrated that a range of tasks can be executed autonomously, allowing high level tasking of single and multiple UAVs in formation, with the formation commanded as a single entity.</jats:p>",

This paper primarily stresses the identification of specific constructs which can contain the potential variables/critical success factors in audit engagement planning that contribute to the success/failure of audit engagement in e‐commerce‐centric technological scenario, and the same can be used to build a model for its empirical validity in future studies. The objective of this paper is to devise a model, based on the variables turned potential critical success factors to successfully perform audit engagement planning for the current state‐of‐the‐art e‐commerce technologies. The available literature is analyzed to identify appropriate candidates for factors that appear to materially affect the success of the e‐commerce audit resource planning function.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment planning involves selecting delivery parameters that distribute the dose to nontumor tissue in such a way as to minimize the risk of complications. This work studied the relationship between nontumor integral dose (NTID), the fractional energy deposited in nontumor tissue, and a variety of delivery parameters for three clinical cases: nasopharynx, pancreas, and prostate. Integral dose for an organ of uniform density is simply the product of the organ density, volume, and mean dose. For each case, conventional plans were generated with 2, 4, 8, 12 and 36 equally spaced beams. All plans were normalized to the same tumor mean dose <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1991-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1991:mp1991-math-0001\" /> which is equivalent to the same tumor integral dose. For the pancreas and prostate cases, the patients were assumed to be uniform density. For the nasopharynx case, bones and air cavities were outlined and each assigned a uniform non‐unit density. With four or more beams and clinical margin values, the variation in NTID was <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1991-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1991:mp1991-math-0002\" /> as a function of number of beams. With eight or more beams, the variation was <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1991-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1991:mp1991-math-0003\" /> Reducing the beam margin decreased the NTID because less normal tissue was irradiated. However, the effect of the number of beams on NTID was independent of margin size. Higher energy beams reduced the NTID, as expected, and the effect was independent of the number of beams. With four or more beams, variation in beam direction changed NTID by less than 1.5%. Changing beam weights changed NTID by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1991-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1991:mp1991-math-0004\" /> for plans with four to eight beams. For the body sites studied, the majority of energy was deposited in nontumor tissue, ranging from 72% in the nasopharynx case to 97% for the prostate case. The NTID decreased with increasing tumor size for similar anatomic sizes and increased with increasing size of anatomical region for similar tumor size. Finally, the effect of heterogeneity‐corrected doses on the NTID was found to be <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1991-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1991:mp1991-math-0005\" /> for the nasopharynx case. These data support the hypothesis that the NTID is approximately independent of beam orientation or relative weighting when many beams are used. Optimization, therefore, can only find the best distribution of dose; it cannot reduce the energy imparted. NTID may be useful in establishing an upper bound on the quality of plan that can be achieved by optimization.</jats:p>",

As enterprise resource planning continues to evolve, its importance seems likely to grow. This evolution will allow ERP to expand to serve smaller and smaller businesses and businesses with more specialized enterprise resource planning needs. To truly serve these institutions, ERP deployments must become more reliable through the further refinement of success factor analysis.</jats:p>"

The practitioner needs to have effective listening skills to ensure that both practical and psychological care are patient-centred. The patient and his/her carers must be involved in all aspects of care planning and establishing goals for rehabilitation. The specialist practitioner should adopt an evidence-based approach to care, ensuring that important aspects of care, such as the early teaching of stoma management skills, are not neglected. The specialist practitioner may not be able to meet all the patient's needs and should refer on to other specialist staff where these services are available. Such multidisciplinary input, utilizing appropriate problem-solving approaches with the involvement of patients and their carers, can only enhance the quality of care delivered and optimize the process of rehabilitation. </jats:p>",

Twenty-one 10-month-old infants were encouraged to either throw a ball into a tub or fit it down a tube. Kinematic measures of the approach phase of the reach toward the ball were obtained using a motion analysis system. Infants, like adults, reached for the ball faster if they were going to subsequently throw it as opposed to using it in the precision action. The perceptual aspects of the ball were the same and cannot account for these kinematic differences. Infants appear to be planning both segments of their actions in advance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been argued that patrilineal joint family systems tend to bias family planning decisions in favour of sons. A simple model suggests that in such societies, any given son will be more highly valued by his parents (1) the \nfewer his brothers and (2) the earlier his birth is in the brother series. A daughter's value will be greater (1) the fewer brothers she has and (2) the earlier her birth is relative to other sisters. This study first addresses the extent of son preference as inferred from family composition data for 772 Taiwanese first-graders born in the mid-1970s in two socioeconomically distinct communities in Taipei, Taiwan. It then uses linear regression to consider whether the model criteria help account for statural variation among children in each study area when controlling for differences in measurement age, parental education and housing. With respect to family composition and gender preference, available evidence was consistent with previous surveys. While better-educated parents in the more affluent study area had significantly fewer children (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0·0005) and were more willing to stop without a son, girls there, as in the less affluent area, were still significantly more likely than boys to belong to large sibships (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>≤0·005). Evidence from mean height of males and females partially accords with hypothetical predictions. In the less affluent area, the interaction effect of male birth order and the presence of younger siblings was significantly associated with mean stature (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0·002). Males without brothers were 2·0 cm taller than males with either an older or a younger brother (116·3 ± 0·5 cm vs 114·3 ± 0·4 cm). Males who had both younger and older brothers, but often no sisters, were about as tall, however, as those without brothers. A similar, but less pronounced, pattern was found amoung males in the more affluent area, but only among those who had sisters. These boys were also consistently shorter than boys without sisters (115·6 ± 0·6 cm vs 117·7 ± 0·6 cm; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0·001). Patterns of mean female stature did not clearly support the hypothesis. Girls in the more affluent area were relatively tall and did not show significant variation. Results among less affluent girls showed significant contrasts, but not necessarily in the predicted direction.</jats:p>",

The object of the studies was an inventory of all EU projects in the city of Oldenburg in the period from 1997 to 2002, and a quantitative analysis of seven selected EU projects. The study concludes that municipal efforts to obtain EU subsidies are well worthwhile. Many EU projects in Oldenburg target typical municipal fields of policy and action, such as urban development, promotion of economic development, social integration, and vocational qualifications. However, effective municipal involvement in obtaining EU funds also requires a qualified and differentiated advisory service.</jats:p>"

Goal programming as a methodology emphasises the resolution of conflict among criteria; scenario planning focuses on the treatment of uncertainty relating to future states of the world. Integrating the two methodologies is based on the simple formulation of a super‐goal programme consisting of one scenario‐specific goal program in each scenario. Issues relating to the structuring of the super‐problem, aggregation both within and over scenarios, and the incorporation of probabilistic information are discussed.

This fundamental shift in telecommunications has led many to believe that wireless technologies will break the ‘tyranny of geography’, help close the digital divide between core and periphery locations, and allow firms to be more footloose. This paper will examine the spatial distribution of wireless infrastructure in the United States to determine if the core–periphery relationship of cities is altered by wireless technologies. To do so the analysis will compare wireless infrastructure with Internet infrastructure and telephone switch infrastructure with a focus on data infrastructure in all three categories. The infrastructure datasets will be then compared with population distributions to determine their impacts on a spatial digital divide. The results of the study will provide a snapshot of the geography of wireless technologies, a comparison with other terrestrial communications, and insight into the policy of infrastructure delivery. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been much hype and speculation in the media and in academe on the vitality and future of the ‘Internet economy’. In this paper the author uses case studies from Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States to assess the strengths and weaknesses of online grocery retailers, from national chain stores pursuing a ‘bricks and clicks' strategy to ‘pure-play’ startups. He argues that delivering groceries via the Internet to customer doorsteps requires ways of solving space and time that are markedly different from previous trends in food retail logistics. He holds that solving problems of space management creates problems in the management of time and vice versa. In particular, ‘e-tailers’ struggle with fulfilment costs and logistics, and have attempted to manage customers' time and locations to reduce these costs. Store-based operations may be best suited for short-term profitability (or loss minimisation), whereas warehouse-based fulfilment may hold future promise of greater efficiency and flexibility. The author suggests that online organic home delivery may be the most successful type of online food retailer, for its size, given greater customer commitment and problems with store-based supply of organic food. </jats:p>",

There is a voluminous literature examining the economic structure and operation of urban housing submarkets, with much of the associated empirical work based on static cross-sectional studies. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of local markets has tended to be perfunctory. As such, our understanding of structural change over time remains underdeveloped. In this paper we construct repeat-sale indices at the urban submarket level and deploy cointegration analysis to examine the stability of spatially defined housing submarkets within Glasgow between 1984 and 1997. Specifically, we consider whether price differences between submarkets have been eroded by a process of arbitrage operating through supply-side responses and/or migration flows. The empirical analysis shows that a stable system of housing submarkets persists throughout the study period. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a case study of the Internet adult industry in order to study the ways in which electronic commerce interacts with geography. Digital products, low barriers to entry, cost differentials, and sensitivity to regulation have created a pervasive and complex geography of models, webmasters, and consumers around the globe. With a series of specially developed datasets on the location of content production, websites, and hosting it is shown that the online adult industry offers people and places outside major metropolitan areas opportunities to become active purveyors of this type of electronic commerce. The roles of these actors, however, are not simply determined by a spaceless logic of cyber-interaction but by histories and economies of the physical places they inhabit. In short, the ‘space of flows’ cannot be understood without reference to the ‘space of places’ to which it connects. This geography also provides a valuable counterpoint to mainstream electronic commerce and highlights the ability of socially marginal and underground interests to use the Internet to form and connect in global networks. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For those who have online access, the Internet significantly reduces the cost and time of transferring information over distance. This paper explores the potential of the Internet to improve people's employment opportunities by increasing their access to job information beyond that provided via their grounded social networks. Information circulating through grounded social networks is biased socially and geographically toward the life experiences of network members. The tendency for those members to have similar life experiences dampens the variability in the information exchanged in such networks. What is the potential for the Internet to expand people's access to information about jobs and employers' information about workers? We report on a pilot study undertaken in Worcester, Massachusetts, that examined employers' use of Internet recruiting for employees. The results of this qualitative study indicate that these employers use the Internet strategically to enhance the volume of applications when the labor market is tight and to segment the applicant pool when the market loosens and the number of resumes is overwhelming. As a result, we conclude that many grounded social relations that have been integral to the hiring process are resilient to the Internet; pre-Internet geographies shape Internet geographies, and grounded social relations continue to define access to information about job opportunities even online. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an analysis of the degree to which the population of Britain has become more or less geographically polarised as compared with 1991 and earlier censuses. We use the Key Statistics for local authorities from the 2001 Census, released on 13 February 2003 by the census authorities. All of the variables from the 26 Key Statistics tables which can be compared over time with the 1991 Census are examined. The analysis is then extended for a subset of variables that were similarly measured in 1971 and 1981. We conclude that for key aspects of life in Britain, as recorded by the censuses, the nation has continued in the 1990s to divide socially geographically, often at a faster rate than was occurring in the 1980s or 1970s. Where there appears to have been a reduction in polarisation it tends to have been for those aspects of life which are now poorly measured by the census. The paper concludes with speculation about the possible reasons for the continued division of the country into areas now more easily than ever typified as being old and young, settled and migrant, black and white, or rich and poor. Finally the potential for the continued sociospatial polarisation of Britain is discussed. The paper begins with a fictional vignette. </jats:p>",

This paper reviews the use of environmental compensation in Germany, the USA, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden. In Germany compensation methods have been used since the 1970s. In the USA there are requirements for mitigation and compensation measures for wetland losses. In the Netherlands, the compensation measures are focused on certain protected areas. In the UK there are few legal instruments that formally require environmental compensation. In Sweden the new environmental legislation has made it possible to legally demand environmental compensation measures to gain permits for exploitations. However, these new Swedish requirements have only been available since 1999 and the use of compensation measures needs to be developed. In this article we argue that the German environmental compensation practice is most developed and is worth further study in order to develop the use of environmental compensation methods in the Swedish planning system.

Physical examination of the upper extremity alone may be inadequate for selection of arteries and veins that will mature into a functioning AF. The purpose of this paper is to determine how duplex ultrasonography can be used as an effective modality for the preoperative evaluation of vessels before construction of arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. The author have used duplex ultrasound (DU) to assess upper‐extremity vasculature for planning of dialysis access procedures. Criteria for selection of arteries and veins and a detailed description of DU examination protocol are reviewed. Routine use of upper‐extremity DU has identified many patients with veins that are suitable for use and determined arteries with optimal arterial inflow for successful AFV creation.</jats:p>",

Public investments governed by transportation, water, wastewater, parks, and other public administrators join the private investment streams managed by private sector business organizations to create the urban and regional built environment. Therefore, the capacity of local public works officials to engage in planning street, water, and other public infrastructure will likely affect the coordination of investments by public agencies and private firms. These analyses examine a 44-county region in Central Indiana to determine how closely public investments in infrastructure systems co-vary with private built investments among counties with measurably different capacities for local planning. Counties that use more planning tools, such as capital improvement plans, full-time planners, and subdivision regulations, show a closer coordination between public infrastructure and private built investments. The policy implications suggest that public works managers should pay close attention to the available planning tools to assure a productive articulation of public infrastructure and private investments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Isolated iliac artery aneurysms are rare but dangerous aneurysms associated with a high incidence of rupture (between 14 and 70%). Rupture is frequently associated with an exceedingly high mortality primarily because of the elusive nature of the presenting symptoms and the resulting major delays in treatment. Accordingly these aneurysms are best managed aggressively. Although emerging endovascular techniques show promise surgical resection and reconstruction remains the gold standard for definitive management and has withstood the test of time with excellent durable and unparalleled results. That said, from an operative perspective these aneurysms are technically demanding and remain one of the more formidable technical challenges in vascular surgery. To highlight the key elements involved in a successful repair we present a right internal iliac artery aneurysm with an associated contralateral common iliac artery occlusion, review the necessary preoperative planning and the available surgical treatment options, and detail the technical steps leading to a successful reconstruction. Careful operative planning is critical. Inadequate preoperative studies, inadequate preoperative decision making, and a poorly formulated operative strategy can lead to catastrophic results. Some of the most feared complications include pelvic venous injury with resulting massive hemorrhage and postoperative pelvic ischemia (with resulting rectal and/or spinal cord ischemia) which occurs as a result of inadequate contralateral collateral pelvic blood flow when the internal iliac artery is not reimplanted. Accordingly the preoperative workup must include a careful analysis of the adequacy of the contralateral pelvic blood flow to supply collateral flow in the event that the internal iliac is not reimplanted. In the presence of compromised contralateral internal iliac perfusion, resection and reconstruction or an alternative form of pelvic revascularization is mandatory. Excellent and unencumbered exposure is mandatory for a safe and successful repair. The retroperitoneal approach as illustrated in this case is strongly recommended. Although it is challenging excellent results can be achieved by resection of the aneurysm and reconstruction.</jats:p>",

The current use of advance directives fails to respect patient autonomy. This paper proposes using the family covenant as a preventive ethics process designed to improve end‐of‐life planning by incorporating other family members—as agreed to by the patient and those family members—into the medical care dialogue. The family covenant formulates advance directives in conversation with family members and with the assistance of a physician, thereby making advance directives more acceptable to the family, and more intelligible to other physicians. It adds the moral force of a promise to the obligation of respecting a patient's preferences about end‐of‐life care. These negotiations between patient, family, and physician, from early planning phases through implementation, should greatly reduce the incidence of family disagreements on what the patient would have wanted. The family covenant ensures advance directive discussions within the family, promotes and respects the autonomy of other family members, and might even spur others in the family to complete advance directives through additional covenants. The family covenant holds the potential to transform moral quagmires into meaningful moral conversation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demining and unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance are extremely tedious and dangerous tasks. The use of robots bypasses the hazards and potentially increases the efficiency of both tasks. A first crucial step towards robotic mine/UXO clearance is to locate all the targets. This requires a path planner that generates a path to pass a detector over all points of a mine/UXO field, i.e., a planner that is complete .The current state of the art in path planning for mine/UXO clearance is to move a robot randomly or use simple heuristics . These methods do not possess completeness guarantees which are vital for locating all of the mines/UXOs. Using such random approaches is akin to intentionally using imperfect detectors. In this paper, we first overview our prior complete coverage algorithm and compare it with randomized approaches. In addition to the provable guarantees, we demonstrate that complete coverage achieves coverage in shorter time than random coverage. We also show that the use of complete approaches enables the creation of a filter to reject bad sensor readings, which is necessary for successful deployment of robots. We propose a new approach to handle sensor uncertainty that uses geometrical and topological features rather than sensor uncertainty models. We have verified our results by performing experiments in unstructured indoor environments. Finally, for scenarios where some a priori information about a minefield is available, we expedite the demining process by introducing a probabilistic method so that a demining robot does not have to perform exhaustive coverage.</jats:p>",

It allows the clinical implementation of highly conformal nonconvex dose distributions. This complex but promising treatment modality is rapidly proliferating in both academic and community practice settings. However, these advances do not come without a risk. IMRT is not just an add‐on to the current radiation therapy process; it represents a new paradigm that requires the knowledge of multimodality imaging, setup uncertainties and internal organ motion, tumor control probabilities, normal tissue complication probabilities, three‐dimensional (3‐D) dose calculation and optimization, and dynamic beam delivery of nonuniform beam intensities. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to guide and assist the clinical medical physicist in developing and implementing a viable and safe IMRT program. The scope of the IMRT program is quite broad, encompassing multileaf‐collimator‐based IMRT delivery systems, goal‐based inverse treatment planning, and clinical implementation of IMRT with patient‐specific quality assurance. This report, while not prescribing specific procedures, provides the framework and guidance to allow clinical radiation oncology physicists to make judicious decisions in implementing a safe and efficient IMRT program in their clinics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Acrylamide (AA) is a reactive compound widely used as an industrial chemical. It is also, as recently shown, present in heated foodstuffs. AA is known to cause tumors in rodents and is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. The metabolite glycidamide (GA) is assumed to be the predominant genotoxic agent in AA exposure. Therefore, knowledge about <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> doses of GA is essential for cancer risk assessment of exposure to AA. The <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> dose of GA could be inferred from the level of the adduct formed by GA with N‐terminal valine (GA‐Val) in hemoglobin (Hb), detached as a pentafluorophenylthiohydantoin (PFPTH) and measured by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (GC/MS/MS) analysis. However, due to the highly polar character of the GA‐Val‐PFPTH derivative, it was found necessary to modify the method through further derivatization. This paper presents an evaluation of acetonization for derivatization of the adjacent OH and NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> groups in the adduct formed from GA. Good reproducibility was obtained. Also, acetonization improves the response and thus increases the sensitivity of the GC/MS/MS analysis of the PFPTH derivative of GA‐Val. The sensitivity obtained is sufficient for studies of background adduct levels of GA in animals and in humans. Acetonization as a method for derivatization is robust and simple.
