Administrative occupational groupings are unreliably defined by subjective assessment of similarity of job types. Observations of mobility between 161 condensed KOS (Key Occupations for Statistical Purposes) from the 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, and 1983 Labour Force Surveys input into an Intramax regionalisation procedure produce occupational groups defined by internal mobility relations. This is a repeatable and more reliable method for the definition of occupational groupings. The twenty-eight groupings produced by the procedure reveal some interesting and in some cases disturbing features of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and Department of Employment occupational groupings. The procedure could reasonably form the basis of a better administrative classification system incorporating the effects of structural changes in labour demand. Just like travel to work areas, functional occupations could be updated after each census. </jats:p>",

A number of well developed physical habitat analysis and prediction procedures are presently available. Several computerized systems available from the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service (Habitat Suitability Index - HSI and PHysical HABitat SIMulation - PHABSIM) provide macrohabitat definition. We have developed a water quality based habitat component which operates effectively for general analysis. With an emphasis on site specific management in the United States, the macrohabitat definition procedures may not meet all river basin management and planning requirements. This paper reviews the results of research which characterizes microhabitat in streams and rivers and provides a valuable extension to basin management procedures.</jats:p>",

Dabei besteht die Möglichkeit, entweder eine selbständige Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (UVP) einzuführen oder die UVP in bereits bestehende Verfahren zu integrieren. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht in diesem Zusammenhang die Frage, ob die UVP in das Raumordnungsverfahren (ROV) integriert werden könnte, und kommt zu dem Ergebnis, daß das ROV zwar als erste Stufe der UVP geeignet ist, die UVP jedoch im nachfolgenden Genehmigungsverfahren fortgeführt werden sollte und somit zweistufig durchzuführen wäre.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aktuelle Forschungsberichte signalisieren, daß die regionalen Entwicklungs- und Strukturdisparitäten auch in Zukunft – unter Umständen sogar verstärkt – fortbestehen werden, begünstigt u. a. durch weit- und binnenwirtschaftliche Strukturverschiebungen, technologische Entwicklungsprozesse und die Überlegenheit der dominierenden Wirtschaftszentren mit ihren institutionell und infrastrukturell überragenden Ausstattungen. Trotz überproportionaler finanzieller Förderung der wirtschaftsschwachen Regionen – vor allem im Bereich der regionalen Wirtschaftsförderung – ist es nicht gelungen, die regionalen Ungleichgewichte auf den Arbeitsmärkten entscheidend und nachhaltig zu verringern oder gar zu beseitigen. Ein Grund liegt mit darin, daß die staatlichen Fördermaßnahmen zu wenig die eigentlichen Ursachen regionaler Entwicklungs- und Strukturprobleme berücksichtigen und die regionalspezifischen Defizite und Engpässe nicht gezielt durch z. B. ressortkoordinierte Maßnahmen unter Beachtung der regionalen Prioritätserfordernisse angehen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird aufgezeigt, welche konkreten Möglichkeiten bestehen, auf Basis des vorhandenen (Planungs‑, Organisations- und Förderungs‑) Instrumentariums eine wirksamere und umfassendere regionale Entwicklungspolitik als bisher durchzusetzen, die nicht nur globalen staatlichen Zielvorstellungen, sondern auch den Prioritätsüberlegungen der betroffenen Regionen gerecht werden.Ausgangspunkt einer solchen Politik ist eine Strategie der staatlich gestützten regionalen Eigenentwicklung, d. h. eine Mobilisierung, Nutzung und Stärkung des in der Region ansässigen Potentials bei gleichzeitiger flankierender staatlicher finanzieller und institutioneller Förderung. Von entscheidender Bedeutung sind hierbei sowohl die institutionalisierte Zusammenarbeit der insbesondere arbeitsmarktpolitisch bedeutsamen regionalen Organisationen als auch die Koordinierung von Planungen und Maßnahmen auf horizontaler Ebene (Fachressorts) und in vertikaler Richtung (Kommunen/Regionen/Land). Das zur Durchsetzung dieser Strategie geeignete planerische, organisatorische/institutionelle und förderpolitische Instrumentarium ist bereits existent. Es kann jedoch erst dann seine Wirkung entfalten, wenn die politische Bereitschaft und die administrative Fähigkeit zu seiner Anwendung gegeben sind und der Wille zur Konsensbildung der Beteiligten – unter Zurückstellung ressort- und gruppenspezifischen Konkurrenzdenkens – besteht.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a review of Italy's stuttering progress towards regional autonomy. At the unification of Italy in 1860, a centralised administrative structure was adopted, as prescribed by the Piedmontese Constitution of 1848. Centralisation of political power reached its apogee during the Fascist period. Regionalist sentiment resurfaced strongly after the last war and gained formal expression in the 1948 Republican Constitution, which provided for the creation of five ‘special’ and fourteen (later fifteen) ‘ordinary’ regions. The special regions—regions of special linguistic or political sensitivity (Valle d'Aosta, Trentino-Alto Adige, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sicily and Sardinia)—were established between 1948 and 1963, but delays orchestrated by the Christian Democrat-dominated central government, reluctant to relinquish its power, postponed the establishment of the ordinary regions until the 1970s, when pressure from the Socialist Party prevailed. The legislative powers of the regions are of three forms: Exclusive (available only to the special regions), complementary, and integrative, the order representing progressively diminishing elements of decisionmaking autonomy. Several regions in central Italy have elected Communist regional governments. However, hopes that the regional governments would be instrumental in ending corrupt and inept government and eradicating regional disequilibria, have mostly been misplaced, although some progress has been made, especially in the northern regions, in the fields of administrative reform, social service organisation, and regional economic planning. The principal reason for lack of progress is the continuing central government control over regional government funds. In many regions considerable amounts of unspent funds have accumulated owing to a combination of political stalemate at the regional level and central government veto. Special attention is given in this paper to the relationship between regional autonomy and (1) local government, and (2) regional planning. To conclude, the present state of play represents an uneasy compromise between the two contradictory historical forces of centralism and regionalism, present since unification. Although there has been a significant departure from the rigid centralisation of the past, the retention of most of the important powers by the central government frustrates the ambitions of the regions to really organise their own affairs. </jats:p>",

One method of achieving stability is to freeze some portion or all of the MPS. While freezing the MPS can limit the number of schedule changes, it can also produce an increase in production and inventory costs. This paper examines three decision variables in freezing the MPS: the freezing method, the freeze interval length, and the planning horizon length. Simulation experiment results are reported which suggest that freezing up to 50% of the planning horizon has a marginal effect on production and inventory cost under a wide range of operating conditions. These results also suggest that an order based freezing method produces superior results in comparison with a period based method. </jats:p>",

The present shared quasi-federalism will prove inadequate in the long term because it fails to recognize that, for most of the time, political centralization and economic growth cannot occur together in Spain. This fact arises because Spain is a country with an ‘inverted centre-periphery’; the political and economic centres are at different locations. As a result future policy should be orientated towards greater decentralized powers, but with more effective integration of the nationalist parties of the Autonomous Communities into national policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Military activities currently play a major role in social and economic development, even in noncombatant countries, This fact has received remarkably little attention in the social science literature, until recently. As a result, the theoretical frameworks which are available for the analysis of military activities arc underdeveloped. In this paper it is argued that there are in effect two such frameworks, derived from the Marxist and Weberian traditions, respectively. The many weaknesses of these, and the conflicts between them, are blurred rather than resolved in most recent studies of military phenomena, such as the ‘military industrial complex’. This is because the theory of the relationship between capitalist production and state institutions embedded in each perspective is seriously inadequate. A realist reconstruction is presented which highlights the significance of the national form of the state, and the contingent nature of capitalist production. This is designed to provide a new framework for appraising military activities, but it has implications for a wide range of questions concerned with the relationship between capital and state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Shipboard damage control is almost totally reliant upon manual means for information processing and suffers from additional problems involving an ad hoc approach to casualty control, the need to condense highly specific useful information from general documentation (e.g., fire boundaries), and the variety, complexity and sometimes unavailability of required information (e.g., booklets of general plans which open out to the size of a large table; isometric diagrams each with their own sets of symbology; electrical distribution data contained on hundreds of aperture cards). A prototype computer system called SNIPE (Standard Naval Information Program — Engineering) was installed aboard USS <jats:italic>Peterson</jats:italic> (DD‐969) in April 1985 using an IBM micro‐processor. SNIPE uses contingency planning concepts to define the fire doctrine for every space on the ship. Thus, when a fire location is entered into the computer, SNIPE advises the ship's damage control personnel of the following predetermined information: the closest fire‐fighting equipment, fire boundaries to set, nearby hazards (e.g., magazines), vent systems and closures to secure, other spaces served by common vent systems to be checked, and electrical circuits to be secured. Computer disk “pre‐positioned” messages directing repair party action can also be printed for any of the above actions, speeding up the damage control central message output process. This paper describes the firefighting system in use aboard USS <jats:italic>Peterson</jats:italic>, the day‐to‐day readiness monitoring capabilities of the system, and some of the planned future enhancements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The gentrification literature is initially reviewed in this paper, and Marxist, institutionalist, and individual approaches are distinguished. The theoretical and empirical weaknesses of each are indicated. It is argued that two factors are central to an understanding of gentrification: first, the economic restructuring of central London, which has resulted in the growth of corporate—professional employment; and second, demand factors that are divided into the economic and the environmental. In part 2 of the paper, Battersea (the case study area) is set within the context of Inner London and the Borough of Wandsworth, of which it is a part. Census data are used to indicate the marked changes in tenure, socioeconomic composition of residents, and the employment structure. Then in part 3, the characteristics of gentrifiers are examined through a survey conducted in an area of Battersea, and the expressed economic and cultural preferences of these gentrifiers are focused upon, therefore emphasising ‘demand’. It is argued that in stressing supply, Marxist and institutionalist explanations of gentrification have ignored demand, and that individualist work, which although recognises demand, fails to place it in the correct economic and cultural context. In sum, the restructuring of employment in central London and the factors of demand are seen as inextricably linked in an explanation of gentrification. </jats:p>",

The joint space obstacles represent forbidden space that limits the allowable robot configurations.

Als Oberbegriff für diese Tatbestände verwenden wir den Begriff „Kontrolle“. Im räumlichen Kontext steht dabei die sogenannte externe Kontrolle – abhängige und beherrschende Einheiten haben ihren Standort in unterschiedlichen Regionen – im Vordergrund. Mit der Kontrollstruktur wird damit ein Strukturmerkmal in die Regionalforschung eingeführt, das zumindest im deutschsprachigen Raum noch neu ist.Zunächst werden die definitorischen Grundlagen gelegt und der Kontrollbegriff abgeklärt. Wir unterscheiden nach verschiedenen Abhängigkeits- und Beherrschungsarten und danach, ob eine Kontrollmöglichkeit besteht (potentielle Kontrolle) bzw. von dieser Möglichkeit auch Gebrauch gemacht wird (faktische Kontrolle). Anschließend stellen wir die empirischen Quellen zur Kontrolle, ihren Informationsgehalt und ihre Probleme vor. Zu nennen sind hier die amtliche Statistik – insbesondere die Kartei im Produzierenden Gewerbe –, Untemehmenshandbücher, die Fusionsdaten des Kartellamtes sowie die Informationen aus Primärerhebungen.Im letzten Abschnitt werden dann ausgewählte empirische Befunde zum Stand und zur Entwicklung räumlicher Kontrollverflechtungen im Verarbeitenden Gewerbe der Bundesrepublik Deutschland vorgestellt. Das räumliche Bezugsraster besteht aus den siedlungsstrukturellen Raumtypen bzw. den Arbeitsmarktregionen.Insgesamt kann gezeigt werden, daß die externe Kontrolle quantitativ bedeutend ist und ihre Einbeziehung in die regionale Strukturforschung von daher geboten erscheint. Vorliegende Wirkungsuntersuchungen zeigen deutlich, daß es vor allem sehr enge Zusammenhänge zwischen der Funktionalstruktur einer Region und der in diesem Beitrag behandelten Kontrollstruktur gibt, wobei die Kontrolle im theoretischen Wirkungsmodell die unabhängige (erklärende) Variable darstellt.</jats:p>"

It is a specific feature of late capitalism that the process of integration acquires a nonterritorial character as the evolution of functional (corporate and sectoral) integration leads towards the disarticulation of territorial productive systems. As the various local, regional, or national interests realise the negative effects of their dependence upon international branch circuits, they demand greater autonomy and strive towards the achievement of greater territorial self-reliance. In this way, the social, political, and economic conflicts and contradictions about the location of productive activities (that is, the spatial aspects of ownership and control of the means of production) become the major force behind the transformation of the international division of labour. </jats:p>",

The objectives of the evaluation were to: 1) assess the extent of overall performance improvement, if any, over existing manual methods, 2) diagnose the impact of computer-aiding on each of the different components of planning performance, and 3) Identify potential deficiencies and needed improvements in specific computer-based aids. The evaluation approach was based on the decomposition of planning into specific components and the measurement of each component within a specific mission context. Within a latin-square experimental design, eight tank platoon leaders first used present paper-map methods to solve tactical problems and then used a system of computer aiding to solve comparable but different problems. Seven objective performance measures assessed different components of planning performance under map and aided conditions; an objective measure of overall mission success and subjective assessments of individual planning aids were also obtained. Results provided a multi-dimensional basis for assessing the potential value of computer-based aids and for further enhancement of the planning aids. Overall, use of the prototype planning aids resulted in a significantly greater rate of mission success, 94 percent vs. 44 percent. </jats:p>",

We interpret the convex distribution which emerged following World War 2 as reflecting an economically integrated but politically and demographically partitioned global urban system. Our interpretation of changes in size distribution of cities emphasizes demographic considerations, largely neglected in previous investigations, including migration and relative rates of population change.</jats:p>",

After 1974, the slowdown of economic growth rates coincided with the increasing economic, social, and political dynamism of these intermediate areas. These phenomena are poorly explained by many liberal and Marxist regional development approaches. Their almost exclusive attention to industrial production, to capital–labour movements or to the ‘basic’ formal, full-time, skilled, male industrial employment in an area, reproduces a production determinism which seems inadequate for the present period of crisis and deep restructuring. These approaches neglect certain key features of modern Greek capitalism such as the widespread pattern of multiple employment, the growing role of informal activities, the new function of the household in relation to outworking, and the gender dimension. It is hypothesised that these features reproduce a new mode of social reproduction in Greece which is illustrated in three short case studies: in Mesolóngion–Agrinion area in west–central Greece, in Kastoria in northwest Macedonia, and in Náxos in the Cyclades Islands. </jats:p>",

Das Technopoliskonzept ist durch drei Grundgedanken gekennzeichnet: Außerhalb des großen Industriebandes von Tokyo nach Osaka werden Zentren der hochtechnologischen Produktion errichtet und damit die Voraussetzung einer räumlichen Dezentralisierung des Wachstums an gewerblichen Arbeitsplätzen geschaffen. Diese Technopolisstandorte sollen in enger Verbindung mit einer leistungsfähigen Bildungs- und Forschungsinfrastruktur ausgestattet werden und sie sollen auch im Wohnungsbereich attraktive Anziehungspunkte werden.In seiner Replik auf diesen Beitrag stellt Professor Makoto Yamada nun Gesichtspunkte heraus, die der Verwirklichung dieser Technopoliskonzeption entgegenstehen könnten.

Existing economic theory of fiscal federalism, which is the main source of information on tax assignment, is reviewed and various criticisms of this theory, as a normative theory, are outlined which indicate major difficulties in application to practice. Where a strong desire for decentralisation exists, such as in Spain, an alternative political-economic approach is suggested. This is then used to comment on developments in Spain where, it is concluded, the present assignment of taxing powers is insufficient to guarantee the autonomy of the regional governments. For Spain, regional access to a share of the VAT or personal income tax is suggested as the best option for tax reform in order to offer sufficient regional tax autonomy. </jats:p>",

Approaches to set societal norms in this realm became common in the development of Raumordnung (regional policy) as a public task, as it has been developed for example in the Federal Republic of Germany, in Switzerland, and in Austria. The author first introduces political theory from the perspective of General Systems Theory, and then discusses the dynamics of legislation in Austria 1958–1985.

First, the conditions under which the growth rate of a region can be said to be structurally determined are considered. These conditions are not only restrictive, but are also at odds with the expressed views of those who support such a theory. Second, it is shown that, even if the identified conditions hold, the repeated application of the shift-share technique will lead, in general, to an incorrect measure of the importance of these structural factors. An accurate simple procedure is given as an alternative to shift-share in these circumstances. Last, analysis of variance is considered and it is shown that the assumptions required for this technique to be appropriate are essentially the same as those required for the regional growth rate to be structurally determined. Although the use of analysis of variance is not advocated, it is suggested that it is incorrect for shift-share to be portrayed as a superior alternative. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When the European Community (EC) created the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRD) in 1975, regional policy was established at an international level for the first time ever. Because of the chosen instruments and the ‘additive’ mechanism of implementation—via the administrative bodies of the member states—this policy seemed at first to mean little more than a reinforcement of regional policies at a national level. Since then, the EC has considerably intensified its regional policy and diversified its instruments. However, the recent reforms of the Community's regional policy serve not only to achieve (certain) development effects with respect to the economic structure of less-developed areas, but also as a means of reorganizing governmental (planning) bodies and regional development policies in the member states, that is, as a means of inducing modernization and differentiation of state intervention in the countries concerned. </jats:p><jats:p> Thus, the EC intervenes’ in the affairs of the member states: Not in the shape of more or less authoritarian intervention by a superior body—EC powers do not permit this—but via the indirect effect of market mechanism. Subsidies are the economic incentive to collaborate. </jats:p>",

The module was implemented for two consecutive classes (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 19) and was evaluated through a quasi‐experimental design that measured changes in (1) students' attitudes toward community health assessment and program planning as part of the nurse practitioner role, and (2) their ability to conduct community health assessment and program planning.

This comparison was made in order to assess the accuracy of family planning professionals' perceptions of the practices and needs of Mexican American women, a high fertility group. While there were points of agreement between the two samples, discrepancies were found in reports of problems in obtaining family planining services, fertility-related values, and in the acceptability of female sterilization as a birth control method. It was concluded that family planning professionals in these service areas tend to stereotype Mexican American women, and may not yet realize that the family planning attitudes and behavior of these women are probably changing in significant ways. </jats:p>",

Initial audit planning is manipulated by identifying certain audit areas as critical in the planning memo. Time pressure and individual auditor characteristics also are examined because auditing literature suggests that they may affect managers' review. The analysis is based on the responses, to an audit case, of 73 audit managers from ten large accounting firms. The results indicate that: 1) the managers exhibit reasonable agreement in budgeting over half of audit management time to review, 2) the initial audit plan directs their subsequent review, 3) time pressure does not significantly affect their estimated review times, and 4) firm affiliation, auditor experience level, and initial planning effort are associated with differences in managers' review practices and perceptions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for practice and further research.</jats:p>",
