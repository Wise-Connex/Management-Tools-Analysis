      "abstract": "<jats:p> Injuries to fingers accounted for the highest proportion of injuries (17%) during a five year period in a large petro-chemical manufacturing complex. The injuries occurred most frequently for those jobs that involve manipulating tools, machinery, and materials. Scenario analyses carried out on the 1223 finger injuries indicated that the most common prior activities were assembling or disassembling equipment (32%) and materials handling (28%), accident events were impact with an object (40%) or a tool that slipped or missed the workpiece (27%), and injury events were being caught between objects (25%), being hit by moving objects (19%), or being cut by objects (13%). Some suggestions for interventions follow from these patterns. </jats:p>",
