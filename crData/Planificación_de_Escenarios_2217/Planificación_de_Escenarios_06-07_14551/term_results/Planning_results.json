      "abstract": "<jats:p> How do we plan for collective decision-making without sacrificing the benefits of democratic pluralism to planning demands for rational consensus or precision? Seymour Mandelbaum argues that we adopt and promote open moral communities. Using ideas of political theorist James Bohman, I review and critique Mandelbaum’s emphasis on critical irony and communitarian sensibility as these take for granted the important role planning plays helping us coordinate and cope with social complexity in modern societies. We can take Mandelbaum’s critical insight that we enliven and improve the quality of public deliberation using a robust pluralism. However, binding that pluralism together will take more than respectful reciprocity and civic virtue, it requires that we do plans and planning to help guide collective decisions in an increasingly complex and interdependent world. Planning and plan-making play an important role coordinating these complex relationships. I offer two brief planning examples - one fitting Mandelbaum’s ideal and another that does not to show how a plan can still offer practical guidance even as the deliberations that frame it fail. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mandelbaum argued against the possibility of a complete general theory of planning set out along the lines of a generalist, a priori, covering-law model. In this article we draw on Miller and Hurley to elaborate a coherentist approach to planning theories that achieves some of the aspirations Mandelbaum sought for a general theory. We argue that this perspective is more inclusive, vis-à-vis what can count as theory for planning, and widens the circle of intellectual conversations in which productive disagreements on points of theory can be sustained. We show how the coherentist approach is useful in focusing the attention of planning theorists on productive inquiry. Finally, by analogy, we argue that a coherentist attitude toward how plans can and should be made and used in particular situations is more useful than the traditional approach of comprehensive plans. </jats:p>",

Literary theory thus addresses the recent resurgence in planning interest in design. The technique is used to follow the implementation of one particular design idea (conservation subdivision design) as legislated in one particular place (Amherst, Massachusetts) and applied to one particular residential development. The substantive analysis demonstrates that conservation subdivision design, at least in this case, fails to achieve some of the theorized ideal goals, and instead achieves different outcomes. Sources for distortion are theorized, and the application of literary theory to planning process is discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>New and continuing environmental demands and competitive forces require healthcare organizations to be increasingly careful in thinking about their strategies. They must do so in a highly unusual (multi‐actor) marketplace where a variety of system interdependencies complicate decision‐making. A good strategy requires an attempt to understand the <jats:italic>real</jats:italic>, as distinct from the <jats:italic>perceived</jats:italic>, environment, and is characterized by explicit tradeoffs along three dimensions: service or program variety, patient needs, and patient access. The quality of these tradeoffs can be assessed in terms of whether the strategy is (a) attuned to critical success factors in the organization's environment, (b) highly focused, (c) linked to the organization's capabilities, and (d) accompanied by an activity set that is difficult for competitors to imitate. An organization also must be capable of adapting appropriately to changes in its environment. Thus, even the best strategy must be reviewed constantly if it is to remain viable. A strategy's sustainability can be adversely affected by increased buyer or supplier power, lowered barriers to entry, growing rivalry, the threat of substitutes, and increased slack in resource usage. By thinking more creatively in the future than they have in the past, healthcare organizations can make tradeoffs and choose a focused strategic position. They then can design an activity set that is appropriate for that position, and that will assist them to achieve both financial viability and superior programmatic performance. A well‐designed activity set also will assist them to sustain their performance in the face of changing environmental demands and competitive forces.

Shifting priorities by local governments in Uganda's decentralized health system away from provision of primary health care, in particular the provision of public goods or goods with substantial consumption externalities, and toward provision of private health goods such as curative care are linked to shifts in individual‐level care utilization behaviors. This analysis finds that, while the country has been undergoing a multitude of changes in recent years, decentralization appears to have led to increases in the use of curative services with largely private benefits, perhaps at the expense of the use of primary health care services and services with consumption externalities. A longer period of analysis is required to determine the persistence of these effects. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Using data from the pilot experiment conducted in Zhenjiang, this study examines changes in the pre‐ and post‐reform distributions of out‐of‐pocket (OOP) expenditures across four representative groups by chronic disease, income, education, and job status. Major findings suggested increased OOP expenditures for all groups after the reform. However, the redistributions in OOP appear to be in favor of the disadvantaged groups, suggesting a more equitable change led by the reform. This study concludes that the post‐reform insurance model did not compromise equity in cost‐sharing while containing cost inflation and increasing insurance coverage for the urban population.

The assessment of the equity implication is clearly important, given the potential impact that alternative finance sources have on households. Households incur out‐of‐pocket payment directly from their budget, apart from their public or private insurance. Out‐of‐pocket payment is the primary concern, given their undesirable impact on households. Progressivity measures departures from proportionality in the relationship between out‐of‐pocket payment and ability to pay. It is the most frequently used yardstick to assess the equity of out‐of‐pocket payments in empirical studies. This paper provides an evaluation of such progressivity measures, undertaken using four approaches (proportion approach, tabulation approach, concentration curve and Kakwani's index), in order to reveal their usefulness and underlying notion. It is illustrated empirically with data on out‐of‐pocket payment for health care in Malaysia for 1998/1999, based on the nationally representative Household Expenditure Survey. Results indicate that out‐of‐pocket payments are mildly progressive, whilst the four approaches have their benefits and limitations in assessing equity implications. This analysis is of interest from a policy perspective, given Malaysia's heavy reliance on out‐of‐pocket payments to finance health care. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fast Downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic search. It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative representation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators.\n\nIn this article, we give a full account of Fast Downward's approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downward's best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way.\n\nFast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical'' (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.\n</jats:p>"

This study estimates treatment costs for these diseases in health facilities in the Northern Areas of Pakistan. Health facility resources are organized by categories—including salaries, capital costs, utilities, overhead, maintenance and supplies—and quantified using activity‐based costing (ABC) techniques. The average cost of treatment for an outpatient case of child pneumonia is $13.44. For hospitalized care, the health system spent an average of $71 per episode for pneumonia, $235 for severe pneumonia, and $2,043 for meningitis. These costs provide important background information for the potential introduction of the conjugate <jats:italic>Haemophilus influenzae</jats:italic> type b (Hib) and <jats:italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:italic> vaccines in Pakistan.

To that extent a new delineation is required. The authors use a factor analysis with an oblique rotation and receive 150 labour market regions, which consist of one or more administrative units (Kreise).

However, with failure rates estimated to be as high as 50% of all ERP implementations, companies can be negatively impacted by a poorly performing ERP system. The research on ERP has focused on events leading to the selection, evaluation, and implementation of the ERP system. The intent of this research is to identify new or lightly researched theories regarding the difficulties of ERP implementations that can help practitioners successfully manage ERP implementations by performing a post-ERP implementation examination of eight corporations. We examine operations management (OM) literature rather than information systems (IS) literature in order to provide IS readers with an alternative yet valuable analysis. Further, we purposely avoid well-established findings by performing a large literature review. This article is based on a qualitative research design using case-study methodology. The propositions derived from the case studies form solid insight into the considerations that may influence the success of an ERP system.</p>",

How can we account for the proliferation of homogeneous, isolated, and car-oriented enclaves when those who regulate land use advocate quite different options? This article identifies the principles that planners agree on and uses a case study of Canadian planning practice to illustrate why gated projects get approved regardless of planners’ preferences. In an environment where affluent consumers prefer homogeneity and exclusivity, and where local government is looking for cost-effective options when investing in new urban infrastructure, decision makers may feel compelled to accept gated enclaves as a viable development option.</jats:p>"

A minimum-jerk 3D model is used to obtain the desired path in Cartesian space, which is widely used in the prediction of human reach movement. Instead of inverse kinematics, a direct optimization approach is used to predict each joint's profile (a spline curve). This optimization problem has four cost function terms: (1) <jats:italic>Joint displacement function</jats:italic> that evaluates displacement of each joint away from its neutral position; (2) <jats:italic>Inconsistency function</jats:italic>, which is the joint rate change (first derivative) and predicted overall trend from the initial target point to the final target point; (3) The <jats:italic>non-smoothness function</jats:italic> of the trajectory, which is the second derivative of the joint trajectory; (4) The <jats:italic>non-continuity function</jats:italic>, which consists of the amplitudes of joint angle rates at the initial and final target points, in order to emphasize smooth starting and ending conditions. This direct optimization technique can be used for potentially any number of degrees of freedom (DOF) system and it reduces the cost associated with certain inverse kinematics approaches for resolving joint profiles. This paper presents a high redundant upper-body modeling with 15 DOFs. Illustrative examples are presented and an interface is set up to visualize the results.</jats:p>",

Humans interact with animals in the food chain, train them for entertainment, and often accept them as integral members of their families. Recent disasters have shown the strength of the human-animal bond; for example, a number of people have refused to leave flooded homes without their pets.Organizations that deal with animal control can play a vital role during disasters. This case study highlights the employment of emergency management principles at a community animal shelter. The study follows the project from initial assessments through the development of an initial emergency program. Key elements in this process include a realistic risk assessment, training, and available local support, as well as economic concerns.

However, the critics, in defending old pragmatism against new, miss some useful insights. Rorty basically helps us to grasp the hubris of claiming epistemic trump and to beware the quest for certainty in the service of the powerful. For instance, how would pragmatic ideas compare with more conventional theoretical expectations rationalizing the recent combination of federal intelligence agencies into a new Homeland Security Agency? Rorty describes and celebrates the critical irony of self-perfection as a resource best nurtured in private while insisting that public expectations be shaped by practical alternatives sensitive to compromise and consensus. We theorists should not be distracted by philosophical debate but focus instead on inventing and comparing practical organizational alternatives that meet public needs without sacrificing individual freedom. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As new functional requirements of products lead to the definition of more complicated shapes, reverse engineering is playing a more important role. The process consists in defining a CAD model of the object surfaces from the measurement of the real object. Reverse engineering takes advantage of new advances in noncontact measuring systems leading to a representation of the surfaces as large clouds of points. Nevertheless, scanning without path planning may affect completeness and accuracy of the measured data. This paper addresses the problem of intelligent scan planning within the context of reverse engineering. A measuring system allows us to acquire a cloud of points, which represents the first measurement of the free-form object. This incomplete and locally inaccurate cloud of points is used as a basis to generate an intelligent scan planning. A pretreatment of the point cloud is performed to determine the quality of the first scan and to find out the characteristic edges. The method relies on a voxel representation of the data. According to given thresholds of quality criteria (noise and completeness), unsatisfactory quality zones and digitizing gaps are identified. The new scan paths for an optimal digitizing are then calculated including optimal orientation search. An experimental application of the presented work is described through the digitizing of a face mask.</jats:p>",

Indeed, most primary and community care workforce planning and development issues are universal. Demand 1–1 side workforce planning is concerned not only with the number, but also with staff mix; but how these autonomous and isolated practitioners spend their time is unique. The other side of the equation, workforce supply, raises many recruitment and retention challenges for managers in many countries. Any country's main workforce planning methods apply equally well to primary care, but each is flawed. A second, main problem is that the methods lead to fragmented services, whereas modern workforce planning methods should be multidisciplinary. Consequently, it has never been more important for managers to have data and algorithms to develop appropriate care teams.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method. </jats:bold> A large and versatile workforce database, profiling 304 English primary care trusts using demographic, socio‐economic, mortality, morbidity, staffing and performance workforce‐related variables, compiled in 2002 and updated yearly, is described. Data were supplemented with a systematic literature review leading to a 340‐item annotated bibliography; and qualitative interviews with managers.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold> Workforce size and mix are historical and irrational at best. Moreover, the number of variables that influence staffing is growing, thereby complicating workforce planning.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion. </jats:bold> Evaluating and adjusting the size and mix of teams using empirically determined community demand and performance variables based on the area's socio‐economic characteristics is feasible.</jats:p>",

The problem of path planning in robotics can be defined as follows: To find a collision free trajectory from an initial configuration to a goal configuration. In this paper a collision-free path planner for manipulators, based on a local constraints method, is proposed. In this approach the task is described by a minimization problem under geometric constraints. The anti-collision constraints are mapped as linear constraints in the configuration space and they are not included in the function to minimize. Also, the task to achieve is defined as a combination of two displacements. The first displacement brings the robot towards to the goal configuration, while the second one allows the robot to avoid the local minima. This formulation solves many of classical problems found in local methods. However, when the robot acts in some heavy cluttered environments, a zig-zaging phenomenon could appear. To solve this situation, a graph based on the local environment of the robot is constructed. On this graph, an A* search is performed, in order to find a dead-lock free position that can be used as a sub-goal in the optimization process. This path-planner has been implemented within SMAR, a CAD-Robotics system developed at our laboratory. Tests in heavy cluttered environments were successfully performed.</jats:p>",

Two main hypotheses have been proposed regarding this reference frame: an eye-centered and a body-centered frame. Here we evaluated these hypotheses using the pointing errors that subjects made when planning and executing arm movements to memorized targets starting from various initial hand positions while keeping gaze fixed in various directions. One group of subjects ( n = 10) was tested without visual information about hand position during movement planning (unseen-hand condition); another group ( n = 8) was tested with hand and target position simultaneously visible before movement onset (seen-hand condition). We found that both initial hand position and gaze fixation direction had a significant effect on the magnitude and direction of the pointing error. Errors were significantly smaller in the seen-hand condition. For both conditions, though, a reference frame analysis showed that the errors arose at an eye- or hand-centered stage or both, but not at a body-centered stage. As a common reference frame is required to specify a movement vector, these results suggest that an eye-centered mechanism is involved in integrating target and hand position in programming reaching movements. We discuss how simple gain elements modulating the eye-centered target and hand-position signals can account for these results. </jats:p>",

In Vietnam, a country characterized by recent significant achievements in family planning, not much is known about the linkages between service accessibility and quality and contraceptive behaviour. Data for this study come from the Vietnam 1997 Demographic and Health Survey, with individual contraceptive use information recorded in the calendar section. Measures of access to and quality of services come from the Community/Health Facility Questionnaire, with key informant interviews and facility visits. The study focuses on the effects of the outreach programme and commune health centres on contraceptive method discontinuation for three modern, temporary methods: the IUD, oral pills and condoms. Longer travel time to commune health centres is found to be associated with significantly increased risks of first- and all-method discontinuation for any reason, while residence in communities with higher quality health centres is associated with significantly lower risks of method discontinuation. Access to and quality of the outreach programme are, in contrast, not significant determinants of method discontinuation for any reason. Similar results are found for first- and all-method discontinuation for service-related reasons. The effects of programmatic factors are more pronounced among older women and during the first three months of method use. This study provides evidence for the importance of family planning services for contraceptive method continuation in Vietnam. The results also highlight the need for a thorough evaluation of the family planning outreach programme in terms of its facilitation of women’s continued use of contraception.</jats:p>",

The Pinnacle model parameters that were adjusted to improve the fit to measured data were C2, K and ECD10×10, as well as the source size.

Previous papers focused on the visibility determinations using spherical geometry in a three axis environment. Here, the latest developments are presented. They enable one to improve this approach by taking into account a five axis environment. Using a new approach based on the Minkovsky operations to calculate the visibility of the different face of the B-Rep model of the part, the minimum set of directions required to entirely digitize the part is computed.</jats:p>",

How does the probability measure used for sampling a robot’s configuration space affect the performance of a PRM planner? These questions have received little attention to date. This paper tries to fill this gap and identify promising directions to improve future planners. It introduces the probabilistic foundations of PRM planning and examines previous work in this context. It shows that the success of PRM planning depends mainly and critically on favorable “visibility” properties of a robot’s configuration space. A promising direction for speeding up PRM planners is to infer partial knowledge of such properties from both workspace geometry and information gathered during roadmap construction, and to use this knowledge to adapt the probability measure for sampling. This paper also shows that the choice of the sampling source—pseudo-random or deterministic—has small impact on a PRM planner’s performance, compared with that of the sampling measure. These conclusions are supported by both theoretical and empirical results. </jats:p>",

In pelvic cancer patients with hip prostheses, the metal implants produce artifacts in the diagnostic CT images such that both the location of the tumour and accurate electron densities are either difficult or impossible to obtain. We have used megavoltage CT (MVCT) images for treatment planning in an attempt to quantify the impact of metal artifacts and overcome the problems they introduce. This has been done in three different sets of experiments. The first was a calibration of the megavoltage CT number‐to‐electron density curve using a CIRS phantom. This also allowed for measurements of the impact of metal artifacts on apparent relative electron density in both kVCT and MVCT images. The second was the comparison of treatment plans generated for patients with metal implants using both diagnostic and megavoltage CT studies. This allowed for quantitative measurements of the calculated dosimetric effect of metal artifacts. The final set of experiments compared MVCT and kVCT treatment plans of a water tank containing a stainless steel 316L rod. Dose measurements were taken at various points and compared to the doses calculated using both MVCT and kVCT studies.</jats:p>",

In this study, IMRT plans of ten randomly selected prostate patients are performed using Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> V 6.2b planning system. The DVH control points and prescriptions for contouring of the PTVs and OARs were adapted from the prescriptions of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol P‐0126.

This paper presents a new model for determination of the rectal NTCP (<jats:sub><jats:bold>R</jats:bold></jats:sub>NTCP). The method uses a special function, named GVN (from Gy, Volume, NTCP). It describes the <jats:sub><jats:bold>R</jats:bold></jats:sub>NTCP if a volume of 1 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of the intersection between the PTV and rectum is irradiated uniformly by a dose of 1 Gy.

Also, a correction of the <jats:sub><jats:bold>R</jats:bold></jats:sub>NTCP for different prescribed doses was used.

However, there are conflicting consequences as a result of this policy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy modulated electron therapy (EMET) with conventional clinical accelerators has lagged behind photon intensity modulated therapy (IMRT) despite the potential of the former modality to achieve highly conformal dose distributions tailored to superficial targets which are inherently difficult to plan with IMRT. The main reason for this lag is the lack of an automated collimating device that allows sequential beam shaping of a series of variable field openings. In this study, we present a novel technique to deliver EMET using a prototype of a “few leaf electron collimator” (FLEC) that consists of four motor‐driven leaves fit in a standard clinical applicator. An inverse treatment planning procedure was developed using a Monte Carlo‐based optimization algorithm that makes use of patient‐specific dose kernels. With this procedure optimal plans of three clinical sites were compared to 3D‐conformal radiation therapy and IMRT. Output measurements using radiochromic film and ionization chambers were obtained to validate the Monte Carlo calculations. Further comparisons of 2D dose distributions were also performed using gamma‐index analysis. The FLEC was CAD designed and constructed after optimizing its physical configurations based on Monte Carlo studies. Treatment planning Monte Carlo studies also showed that EMET, delivered using FLEC, is able to provide conformal dose to the superficially located targets, reduce dose to organs at risk, and lower whole body dose without significant perturbation of the dose homogeneity in the target. Comparisons between Monte Carlo calculations and measurements of complex delivery maps show an overall agreement within 3%.</jats:p>",

After a brief conceptual discussion of GPN, standard setting and embeddedness, their analysis proceeds in four further stages. First, they consider how technological change has driven the development of complex mobile telecommunications GPNs in a sector previously characterised by relatively linear and simple value chains. Second, they show how processes of deregulation and privatisation over the past two decades have enabled the internationalisation of mobile telecommunications provision. Third, they explore the delicate power balance between embedded state and corporate actors in telecommunications GPNs through a consideration of the changing bases of standard setting in the industry. Despite ongoing processes of globalisation, the continuing importance of national policies and strategies is clear. Fourth, they demonstrate the continuing importance and differentiating role of embeddedness in the transformation of corporate mobile telecommunication GPNs. In sum, it is argued that the mobile-telecommunications sector should be understood as a constellation of multiscalar manufacturing and distribution networks connecting together firms, organisations, and customers in geographically uneven ways. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors explore the opportunities for existing Indian IT clusters to upgrade and undertake financial research activities. Wholesale financial activity and the accompanying financial research in banks are still highly concentrated in Western financial centers. Increasing competition in the financial services industry, as well as regulatory pressure, place the options of outsourcing and offshoring activities, especially research, to low-cost locations high on the agenda of financial institutions. For the first time, complex tasks at the core of financial activity are being offshored, which makes this an interesting case for a lot of other industries and their spatial economic organization in an ever-globalizing world. Will there be a World Financial Research Centre in Mumbai? With the aid of qualitative interview data as well as a quantitative analysis, the authors argue that research activities are locally embedded in Western financial centers to an extent that such a development is not likely. Two different research activities, country analysis and institutional equity analysis, are examined. The analysis suggests, however, that there is a certain potential for some research activities to be relocated to India. So far, investments take place in a very few existing IT clusters which have already gained a reputation in the financial community. </jats:p>",

To explain this, we focus on the role of different stakeholders involved in brownfield development and critically examine their actions and decisions. We establish which stakeholder types (for example, architects, planners, councillors, developers, investors) are more likely to attempt to introduce sustainability into development projects and which are more successful in meeting their agendas.

Whereas most research on the Indian software industry thus far has emphasized the role of the state and multinational corporations, in this paper we argue that active local entrepreneurship is playing an increasingly important role in technological upgrading and in the shift from low-skill to high-skill services in Bangalore. These shifts are being facilitated by growing institutional thickness, as evidenced by the accumulation of local expertise, increasing local entrepreneurship addressing specific market niches, and the development of a local technical community. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing upon studies of subnational (internal) family migration, in this paper we link international family migration to differential labour-market participation in Great Britain. We extend Kofman's fourfold categorisation of international family migration processes to develop a typology of scenarios that acknowledge the important role of the family. We match scenarios to different out-comes using a subsample of partnered migrants from the Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR) of the 1991 Census. In line with subnational family migration literature, descriptive analyses of the SAR point to a ‘gender gap’ between the labour-market participation of partnered men and partnered women moving into Great Britain between 1990–1991, with males twice as likely to be attached to the labour force compared with women. We contribute to debates on changing family organisation and employment returns to international migration by arguing that the magnitude of this gender gap varies across migration scenario and family structure. In this paper we stress the need for more interchange between international and subnational family-migration scholarship, and provide valuable entrees for analyses of the forthcoming microdata of the 2001 Census. </jats:p>",

The impact of residential density on journey patterns is limited by an imperfect juxtaposition of density and public-transit service peaks. Another impediment is the difficulty of associating density with other variables needed for it to translate into increased walking and public-transit modal shares. We attribute this situation to insufficient planning capacity owing in large part to generalized neighbourhood opposition to high-density residential developments and disagreement between levels of government. In this paper we both narrate events of relevance to the distribution of high residential density over the last five decades and analyze present relationships between high-density areas and journey patterns. We conclude by discussing the possibility of achieving residential-density layouts and distributions that are more conducive to walking and public-transit use than the tower-in-the-park model and the scattering of high-density pockets, both of which predominate in Toronto. </jats:p>",

To investigate the adverse effects of chlorophenols on microorganisms, synthetic wastewater containing 2,4 dichlorophenol (DCP) was biologically treated in an activated sludge unit at different hydraulic residence times (HRTs) between 5 and 40 hours, whereas the feed chemical oxygen demand (COD), DCP concentrations, and sludge age were kept constant at 2500 ± 50 mg/L, 150 mg/L, and 20 days, respectively. The resazurin method based on dehydrogenase activity was used for assessment of the feed and effluent wastewater toxicity. Percent COD, DCP, and toxicity removals increased, and the effluent COD, DCP, and toxicity levels decreased with increasing HRT. Biomass concentration in the aeration tank increased with increasing HRT because of low levels of DCP at high HRT levels, resulting in high COD, DCP, and toxicity removals. The sludge volume index decreased with increasing HRT, yielding well‐settling organisms as a result of low levels of toxicity and high concentrations of active cells. Percent DCP and COD removals decreased with increasing specific DCP loading rate. The rates of DCP and COD removals showed a maximum at a low DCP concentration of 6 mg/L in the aeration tank, corresponding to a 25‐hour HRT.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We have developed a method that leverages the image‐guided radiotherapy capabilities of a tomotherapy unit to adapt daily treatments to changes in bladder shape and volume. Each patient receives three treatment‐planning CT scans: empty bladder; partially full bladder; and full bladder. For each scan, the radiation oncologist contours the initial and boost target volumes (PTV1 and PTV2) and organs at risk, and an initial treatment plan is generated to deliver 40 Gy in 20 fractions to PTV1. A second treatment plan is designed to deliver 20 Gy in 10 fractions to PTV2 (a total of six treatment plans per patient). Patients are asked to void immediately before each treatment. An MVCT of the pelvis is performed before each fraction to verify patient position and to assess the bladder volume. If the treating therapist concludes that the patient's bladder extends to within 10 mm of the PTV contour, then the corresponding treatment plan for a larger bladder volume is downloaded and the MVCT is repeated. Approximately 20% of fractions required a treatment change based on perceived bladder volume. Three of four patients treated to‐date have required the use of a larger volume treatment plan at least once, even though they are always instructed to empty their bladders just prior to treatment. Our early experience is that relying on patient compliance for treating “empty bladder” is insufficient to ensure proper target coverage, and that generous internal margins are required to ensure target coverage in the absence of adaptive IGRT capability.</jats:p>",

Our study proposes that the radiological penumbra for an intermediate energy photon beam (IEP, 0.2 – 1 MeV) is greatly reduced compared to a megavoltage beam. From Monte Carlo simulation, an 800kV beam of field size less than 2×2 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> was generated from electrons impinging upon a 0.5mm tungsten target. This beam generated a radiological penumbral width (80%–20%) of less than 300μm for small field sizes at depth=5cm in water. A virtual IEP treatment unit (PDD's and profiles generated from Monte Carlo) was created in a Pinnacle treatment planning system (v6.2). An 11 beam non‐coplanar arrangement was used to cover a target volume situated in the middle of a phantom head and at 1mm from a critical structure. Dose volume histograms generated for both the 800kV and a standard 6MV beam showed that the volume of critical structure receiving 10% of the prescription dose was 27% versus 41%. The maximum dose received by the target was 110% (800kV) and 127% (6MV). The 800kV and 6MV beams were dosed to 92% and 78% isodose lines respectively for comparable target coverage. The reduction of radiological penumbra is linked to reduced photon scattering (using small field sizes) and the reduced secondary electron range (using IEP). An 800 kV beam shows superiority over a standard 6MV beam resulting in greater homogeneity and conformality to the target and better sparing of a critical structure in close contact with the target.</jats:p>",

This paper identifies several symptoms related to potentially catastrophic failures during product development.

Social cognitive theory (SCT) specifies determinants of dental flossing: Cognitions about risk, positive and negative outcome expectations and the perceived ability to perform behaviour predict motivation, which in turn predicts behaviour. Recent research suggests that motivation alone may not suffice to predict behaviour, and proposes if‐then‐planning. This study aims to predict flossing adherence from social cognitive variables and planning.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Material and Methods: </jats:bold> Questionnaire data from 157 non‐dental university students on flossing, SCT variables and planning were gathered at three measurement points over 6 weeks. Residual floss was used to validate behaviour self‐reports.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> Social cognitive variables and planning correlated significantly with flossing at all times. Discriminant function analysis suggests that after controlling for Time 1 flossing, planning Time 2 (Wilk's <jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>=0.77; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.01) is more important in discriminating between adherent and non‐adherent participants at Time 3 than Time 1 social cognitive measures. Regression analyses confirmed this result with planning as only predictor of flossing change (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.05).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> These results suggest targeting planning in interventions to increase compliance with flossing recommendations. Implications for such interventions are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Current efforts to conserve Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) rely on a variety of information sources, including empirical observations, expert opinion, and models. Here we outline a framework for incorporating detailed information on density-dependent population growth, habitat attributes, hatchery operations, and harvest management into conservation planning in a time-varying, spatially explicit manner. We rely on a multistage Beverton–Holt model to describe the production of salmon from one life stage to the next. We use information from the literature to construct relationships between the physical environment and the necessary productivity and capacity parameters for the model. As an example of how policy makers can use the model in recovery planning, we applied the model to a threatened population of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snohomish River basin in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. By incorporating additional data on hatchery operations and harvest management for Snohomish River basin stocks, we show how proposed actions to improve physical habitat throughout the basin translate into projected improvements in four important population attributes: abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and life-history diversity. We also describe how to adapt the model to a variety of other management applications. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Hip resurfacing is an alternative to total hip replacement (THR) and is particularly suitable for the younger, more active patient. However, it is a more demanding procedure. This paper describes a system that enables the surgeon to plan the surgery preoperatively with optimally sized and placed components, and then transfer this plan to an intraoperative system that registers computer models to the real patient and tracks surgical tools, allowing the surgeon to ensure that the bone is resected correctly and that the components are fitted in accordance with the plan. The paper describes a series of instruments used with the system which are locked to the bone. These instruments serve the dual purpose of soft tissue retraction and bone immobilization. The system will shortly be the subject of laboratory and clinical evaluation. Registration, a cornerstone of the tracked instrument system, has been tested, and accuracy measures are provided. Experimental results for the remainder of the system will be provided after clinical trials. </jats:p>",
