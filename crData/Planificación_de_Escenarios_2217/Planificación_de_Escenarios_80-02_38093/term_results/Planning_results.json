      "abstract": "<jats:p> The rationale which welfare economics provides for urban planning activity seems to be fairly well established, and welfare economic theory can thus be seen as a valuable basis for a theory of planning. However, two major issues concerning the impact of planning activity on social welfare still need to be considered even if this basis is accepted. The first of these is the question of distribution. If society considers some distributions of welfare superior to others and if, as welfare theory demonstrates, each resource (re)allocation has different distributions associated with it, then the degree to which planning activity in affecting the allocation of resources actually leads to an increase in social welfare depends on the distributional effects of that activity and the criteria by which they are judged. The second issue is that of the legitimacy of the sort of intervention into individuals' activities which planning represents, and the degree to which intervention, even if justified theoretically, is in practice welfare-maximizing. It is concluded that although welfare economic analysis does provide many insights into the implications of urban planning for social welfare, the issues of distribution and intervention which are crucial to any consideration of the welfare effects of planning can be resolved only by reference to values the justification for which lie outside traditional welfare economic theory itself. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although there are many motives for farming, the achievement of a worthwhile financial return, coupled with a good standard of living, ranks high among them. This implies the need for sound business organisation - the more so as holdings become larger, more specialised and more capital intensive. The present book offers a comprehensive treatment of farm business organisation and control. Although designed primarily as an intermediate text for students in universities and agricultural colleges, it is of interest and value to all those concerned with farm business, including business advisers, land agents, accountants and bank managers. The book's wide coverage is made possible by a mainly non-mathematical presentation coupled with a liberal use of examples drawn from farming practice. The book is divided into four parts: the organisation of resources, the organisation of enterprises, the combination of enterprises and the control of resources and enterprises. The overtaking theme is that, in order to make the most economic use of the resources at his disposal, the farmer has to decide what resources to use, how to organise their use within individual enterprises and how to combine the enterprises into an integrated farming system. Lastly, if these efforts are not to be largely wasted, he must initiate the keeping of suitable records to provide both planning data and a system of checks and controls when his plans are put into practice.</jats:p>",

The very day after his gloomy forecast in the Economic Report to Congress, the Labor Department unveiled the lousy productivity score for 1978—a trifling 0.4 percent increase, the worst since the 1974 depression.

The approach is that of a fixed-time-interval simulation with a one-year time step which traces individuals forward in time according to a set of policy inputs. Implementation has been successful at institutions ranging from small schools to large state universities. </jats:p><jats:p> Three explorations are presented to illustrate the use of the model. First, benign, conservative, and draconian scenarios are examined and it is determined that the conservative policy maintains steady state. Second, sensitivity to variation of policy inputs is considered, with the following results: (1) Stringent promotion and tenure policies for senior appointees have marginal effects, but tenure rate for assistant professors is significant. (2) Early retirement provides short-term but not long-term advantages. (3) Resignation rates for senior faculty have more impact than many of the controllable policies. </jats:p><jats:p> The third exploration demonstrates that once a school falls behind the “availability pool” for a specific group, such as women, it requires a long-term effort, including hiring at considerably above quota, to catch up. </jats:p>",

This is particularly so in Australia, which is one of the most highly urbanized nations in the world with a high degree of dependence on automotive transport. The paper discusses planning changes to cope with future oil shortages in terms of modifying urban form, community hardware (buildings, infrastructure, and rolling stock), and community software (life-styles, rules and regulations, fuel economics, etc). Energy savings of at least 40% are possible in the larger cities through changes such as increasing vehicle operating costs, increasing vehicle occupancy, higher-density development, and shorter-trip behaviour. Subcentre development within the urban area is found to be less energy expensive than fringe or satellite development. </jats:p>",

First the paper describes how attitudes and social categories can theoretically be linked to innovation adoption, and proposes a comprehensive model in which the two sets of variables are viewed as explaining both unique and common variance in adoption behavior. The paper then empirically examines the intercorrelations of attitudes, social categories, and innovation adoption in a real-world situation: The diffusion of five agricultural innovations in a portion of Appalachian Ohio. </jats:p><jats:p> The results indicate that some attitudes are significantly related to social categories, whereas others are not; both sets of variables are highly associated with innovation adoption, but attitudes more so than social categories; finally, each set of variables explains some unique aspects of innovation adoption. Thus the findings suggest that comprehensive behavioral models must include psychological as well as socioeconomic and locational variables. </jats:p>",

As such, both the influence of map pattern and the friction of distance should be explicitly incorporated into spatial interaction models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper examines a model of sequential search and information revision in a housing-market context and relates the outcome of search to the sequence of vacancies observed. The model implies the existence of a critical frontier that separates acceptable from nonacceptable vacancies in the price–quality plane characterizing housing vacancies. The searcher's beliefs concerning the distribution of vacancies change as vacancies are viewed, resulting in shifts in the frontier. In the present case, increases in perceived mean market price or price–quality covariance shift the frontier downwards, whereas increases in perceived mean market quality and in price and quality variances shift the frontier upwards. The observation of a single vacancy causes the frontier to shift downwards if and only if the vacancy is contained in a set of vacancies lying below the frontier. The set is characterized by finite upper and lower limits on the quality of the vacancy for any given price, and contains a line of maximally effective vacancies. The greatest downward shifts in the frontier result from the observation of vacancies with relatively extreme prices. Similar results hold if several vacancies are viewed. The revision of beliefs appears to reduce average search time when vacancies are generated at random. By ordering a given set of vacancies in a nonrandom manner, an agent may significantly affect the search time, the price and quality of the vacancy purchased, and the utility level of the vacancy purchased under conditions of information revision. The showing of relatively extreme vacancies may induce shorter search times as well as higher purchase prices than would otherwise hold for a given buyer, although the particular set of vacancies chosen to be shown by an agent, and the sequencing of the vacancies, depends on the goals of the agent. </jats:p>",
