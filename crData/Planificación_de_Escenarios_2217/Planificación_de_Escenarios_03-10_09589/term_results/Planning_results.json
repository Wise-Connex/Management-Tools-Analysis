The first visibility algorithms in computer graphics aimed to determine visible surfaces in a synthesized image of a three-dimensional scene. Nowadays there are many different visibility algorithms for various visibility problems. We propose a new taxonomy of visibility problems that is based on a classification according to the problem domain. We provide a broad overview of visibility problems and algorithms in computer graphics grouped by the proposed taxonomy. We survey visible surface algorithms, visibility culling algorithms, visibility algorithms for shadow computation, global illumination, point-based and image-based rendering, and global visibility computations. Finally, we discuss common concepts of visibility algorithm design and several criteria for the classification of visibility algorithms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently there has been a revival of interest in visibility analysis of architectural configurations. The new analyses rely heavily on computing power and statistical analysis, two factors which, according to the postpositivist school of geography, should immediately cause us to be wary. The danger, they would suggest, is in the application of a reductionist formal mathematical description in order to ‘explain’ multilayered sociospatial phenomena. The author presents an attempt to rationalise how we can use visibility analysis to explore architecture in this multilayered context by considering the dynamics that lead to the visual experience. In particular, it is recommended that we assess the visual process of inhabitation, rather than assess the visibility in vacuo. In order to investigate the possibilities and limitations of the methodology, an urban environment is analysed by means of an agent-based model of visual actors within the configuration. The results obtained from the model are compared with actual pedestrian movement and other analytic measurements of the area: the agents correlate well both with human movement patterns and with configurational relationship as analysed by space-syntax methods. The application of both methods in combination improves on the correlation with observed movement of either, which in turn implies that an understanding of both the process of inhabitation and the principles of configuration may play a crucial role in determining the social usage of space. </jats:p>",

In this paper we introduce a model of natural surveillance in public space which uses visibility graph analysis. The model is applied to two study areas with very different urban morphologies: a traditional street network and a modern university campus. Levels of surveillance in the traditional street network are found to be much higher than in the university campus. It is suggested that the model can be used to test for the importance of natural surveillance as a risk-reduction factor in crime prevention through environmental design. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes the history and current state of archaeological visibility studies. The first part is a survey of both GIS (geographic information systems) and non-GIS studies of visibility by archaeologists, which demonstrates how advances in GIS visibility studies have tended to recapitulate, albeit over a compressed timescale, theoretically driven developments in non-GIS studies. The second part presents an example of the kind of methodological development required for the use of GIS to contribute to the agenda set by certain strands of a more humanistic archaeology. An algorithm developed to retrieve various summaries of the inclination at which points on the horizon are visible from a specified viewpoint was applied to nineteen recumbent stone circles in the Grampian region of Scotland. The results suggest that these summaries provide a useful tool for ‘unpacking’ what archaeologists mean when they claim that the topographic setting of certain stone circles creates an ‘impression of circularity’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile cellular communication has already entered the mass market, and mobile Internet services will soon become a reality. The frequent use of mobile radio technologies wherever people are has a direct impact on the deployment of base stations or radio access points, including antennas. Put simply, to serve an increasing number of users requires an increasing number of base stations. Thus, operators must carefully plan the deployment and configurations of radio base stations in order to support voice and data traffic at a level of quality expected by customers. Planning tools are used to help radio engineers in their difficult tasks of balancing requirements or radio coverage and quality with economic and other practical aspects. These planning tools make extensive use of terrain databases and of visualisation tools that lead some tool vendors to offer functionalities very similar to a geographical information system (GIS) or even to base their product on a GIS. Futhermore, because radio communication between base stations and users is crucial, all computations in a planning tool are based on the use of radio-propagation predictions. Until recently, empirical propagation prediction seemed sufficient. However, more efficient planning and the planning of nonvoice services or of a mixture of voice and nonvoice services require more accurate propagation-prediction models. These propagation models are usually based on the computation of the physical interaction of ratio waves and the environment. Thus more detailed databases are required, especially in urban environments where most users are located. Although the authors are not GIS specialists, they aim to expose some of the relationship between radio-propagation models used for mobile radio network planning and databases for terrain and buildings. For example, an accuracy of about 1 m on the coordinates of building corners is found to be acceptable in terms of accuracy in radio coverage. As another example, simulation results show that the use of conventional propagation models and rough geographical databases for the planning of future cellular systems like UMTS might cause serious difficulties. </jats:p>",

Indeed, much of the early development of what became geographic information systems (GIS) and three-dimensional landscape simulation was undertaken by landscape architects. Mapping of viewsheds quickly became a key element of the landscape-planning process. The process was applied to determination of both view characteristics and potential visual impacts. The algorithms for viewshed analysis were incorporated into GIS products at an early stage in their evolution, but have evolved very little since despite the identification of significant potential enhancements. Extension of the simple binary mapping of GIS has therefore depended on specific developments by individual researchers. These GIS extensions have generated models of visual quality and visual impact using mapped variables. More recently it has become apparent that the essentially two-dimensional approach to view analysis afforded by GIS is inadequate in situations with strong three-dimensional elements. The upsurge in agent-based modeling has demanded a new standard in computer-based visual interpretation of landscape. Both the historic role of GIS-based visual modeling and the potential of 3D-based visual modeling are reviewed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article contributes to the sparse empirical material on the position of health workers within health sector reform. Using qualitative data gathered in 1999, it shows how staff at rural health units in Tororo and Busia Districts experienced the reforms during the first 5 years of decentralization in Uganda. The analysis builds on a framework proposed by Franco <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> to examine the relation between health sector reform and health worker motivation. However, it diverges from their objective description of the factors determining motivation, giving more emphasis to the subjective perspective of the health workers. The categorical distinction between organizational and cultural/community factors was less relevant for them as actors. Two themes cross‐cut their lives inside and outside the health facilities: professional identity, which entailed recognition by both the organization and members of the community; and ‘survival strategies’, which were necessitated by the desire to maintain a status and lifestyle befitting a professional. Reform weakened workers' positions as professionals and hindered facility‐based ‘survival strategies’ that helped them get by on poor salaries. With an overall fall in remuneration, they were more motivated than ever to establish supplementary sources of income outside the formal government health care system.

Using aggregated data from the World Bank and UNICEF this study examined which factors, both within the health care system and outside of it, are associated with under‐5 mortality rates in 22 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1990s. In a multivariate analysis using generalized estimating equations for repeated measures, five factors were found to be independent predictors of lower under‐5 mortality rates (U5MRs). These were vaccination levels, female literacy, the use of oral rehydration therapy, access to safe water and GNP per capita. When the magnitude of these associations were assessed, higher levels of GNP per capita was found to be very weakly associated with lower U5MRs, compared with female literacy and vaccination rates. These findings suggest that government policies which focus only on promoting economic growth, while not making important investments in PHC services, female education and access to safe water are unlikely to see large improvements in health status.

As the New Palestinian Curriculum shows, an international orientation is clearly part of the policy, and accordingly the learning and teaching of languages are a primary concern in identity formation. Through Arabic the relations with the Arabic countries in the region can be maintained, while Hebrew and also English will serve as the medium of communication with Israel, which will remain part of the Palestinian reality. Knowledge of other foreign languages will be needed to maintain contacts with other parts of the world. For historical reasons, Palestine has been in contact with many different countries all over the world, probably more than most other Arabic-speaking countries. It remains to be seen how the current battle between Arabization and Muslim fundamentalism on the one hand, and westernization and desecularization on the other will be resolved, but, whatever the outcome, Palestine cannot allow itself to turn away from the rest of the world.</jats:p>",

The most powerful communication technology from this point of view is phonetic writing, which has a double effect on language: on the one hand it impoverishes suprasegmental linguistic resources; on the other hand it evokes in language a profound and sophisticated semantic precision, and also syntactic complexity. The huge progress in abstract human thought that has taken place over the past three or four centuries has come about on the basis of these linguistic changes. Today, when writing seems to be losing its earlier hegemony over communication, the question arises as to whether this will lead to the erosion of human language, and also of human thought.</jats:p>",

A new method to improve the problem is proposed in this paper. It is noticed that when the temperature of the working area, being raised by the laser beams, reaches the “decomposition temperature” of the adhesive, the stickiness of the adhesive will “burn out”. Based on these findings, a novel laser path planning strategy is introduced. The threshold value of the slope of the part which determines whether the burning‐out rule should be applied in laser path planning is derived. If the slope of the part falls below the threshold value, the burning‐out rule is utilized. Under such circumstances, an optimal laser path according to the proposed thermomechanical model is designated to the overlap zone to burn out the binder. Experimental results indicate that the method increases the de‐cubing efficiency, reduces the de‐cubing time required and damage the part less likely.</jats:p>",

Although no stochastic uncertainty simulations are reported here, the effort of simplifying models is motivated by this. Cases with and without optimization are compared. Additionally, one case with a stuck valve indicates the sensitivity of equipment failures. We also discuss interactive use of the software as a learning tool for improved understanding of reservoir properties and behavior.</jats:p>",

These pressures have prompted a range of innovations in how organizations such as the National Audit Office carry out their evaluations. Related to these pressures is the rise of formal futures within the public sector. The implications of this thinking for VFM public auditing are examined. It is argued that, although conventional VFM auditing remains appropriate for much of the public sector, there are a growing number of public sector activities requiring a different approach. Such approaches include scenario planning. These not only present methodological problems for auditors but also raise important issues about the role of audit more generally. Finally, although these new tools may be helpful in many respects, it is suggested that they may increase the tension between anchoring parliamentary accountability in some statements of fact and contributing to improvements in the quality of public services. </jats:p>",

Data reflect the utilization and outcomes of the process along with the perspectives of 331 individual team members. Findings indicated that the process assisted school teams in self-assessing their paraeducator practices, identifying priorities, and developing action plans and implementing them. Individual team members reported that the process did what it purported to do and rated it highly on consumer-oriented variables. Culminating reports documented impact on school personnel and student outcomes. Implications for schools and future use are discussed for improving paraeducator supports and educational supports for students with disabilities. </jats:p>",

I call attention to two related developments that have occurred during the process. First, a number of manufacturing firms have acquired enough autonomy to develop and exercise their own strategies, have upgraded their operations, and, as original brand-name manufacturers, have evolved into global competitors. Second, some large domestic manufacturers have experienced a cautious and gradual transformation from industrial capital to commercial and financial capital. The findings show the necessity of seeing firms as intentional agents of change with some autonomy of their own as well as the importance of maintaining a structural understanding of power relations in the networked relationships of the global economy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increasing attention has been paid to forms of urban governance, or how public and private sector actors cooperate in generating new policies. In fact, almost everywhere where urban governance structures have been looked for, they have been found. This apparent ubiquity of governance networks has ushered in a new era for urban studies, but it raises the issue of whether such structures vary and whether the differences can be measured and used in explaining other dimensions of city difference. The author argues that the ubiquity problem does not reflect a fatal deficit in urban governance concepts but is, rather, a correctable problem of methods. Urban governance research would benefit greatly from the more widespread use of existing descriptive methods and techniques which produce results that are easy to compare across cities, and thus expand the basis for inductive theory building. As the high cost of such methods discourages comparative research designs with multiple cases, a similar but more cost-effective research method—which has advantages and disadvantages—is discussed. The kinds of simple structural features of governance networks it reveals represent a new potential dimension of explanation in urban research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Clinical results from various trials have demonstrated the viability of protons in radiation therapy and radiosurgery. This has motivated a few large medical centers to design and build expensive hospital based proton facilities based proton facilities (current cost estimates for a proton facility is around $100 million). Until this development proton therapy was done using retrofitted equipment originally designed for nuclear experiments. There are presently only three active proton therapy centers in the United States, 22 worldwide. However, more centers are under construction and being proposed in the US and abroad. </jats:p><jats:p> The important difference between proton and x-ray therapy is in the dose distribution. X-rays deposit most of their dose at shallow depths of a few centimeters with a gradual decay with depth in the patient. Protons deliver most of their dose in the Bragg peak, which can be delivered at most clinically required depths followed by a sharp fall-off. This sharp falloff makes protons sensitive to variations in treatment depths within patients. </jats:p><jats:p> Treatment planning incorporates all the knowledge of protons into a process, which allows patients to be treated accurately and reliably. This process includes patient immobilization, imaging, targeting, and modeling of planned dose distributions. Although the principles are similar to x-ray therapy some significant differences exist in the planning process, which described in this paper. </jats:p><jats:p> Target dose conformality has recently taken on much momentum with the advent of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with photon beams. Proton treatments provide a viable alternative to IMRT because they are inherently conformal avoiding normal tissue while irradiating the intended targets. </jats:p><jats:p> Proton therapy will soon bring conformality to a new high with the development of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Future challenges include keeping the cost down, increasing access to conventional proton therapy as well as the clinical implementation of IMPT. Computing advances are making Monte Carlo techniques more accessible to treatment planning for all modalities including proton therapy. This technique will allow complex delivery configurations to be properly modeled in a clinical setting. </jats:p>",

Demutualisation resulted from cultural change within senior management in mutual societies, which undermined their support for the idea of mutual ownership. This cultural change was a consequence of the deeper integration of mutual societies into the retail financial services sector where a different business culture was dominant. Though government has ignored the wider social impact of demutualisation, it has in fact undermined their attempts to encourage more socially inclusive forms of delivery for personal financial services. The paper makes a case for recognition of the contribution of mutual building societies to the development of more socially responsible corporate strategies. The recent wave of demutuahsations also highlights the need for mutuals to encourage greater membership involvement in the running of the organisation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The reform of regional governance in the United Kingdom has been, in part, premised on the notion that regions provide new territories of action in which cooperative networks between business communities and state agencies can be established. Promoting business interests is seen as one mechanism for enhancing the economic competitiveness and performance of ‘laggard’ regions. Yet, within this context of change, business agendas and capacities are often assumed to exist ‘out there’, as a resource waiting to be tapped by state institutions. There is little recognition that business organisations' involvement in networks of governance owes much to historical patterns and practices of business representation, to the types of activities that exist within the business sector, and to interpretations of their own role and position within wider policymaking and implementation networks. This paper, drawing on a study of business agendas in post-devolution Scotland, demonstrates that in practice business agendas are highly complex. Their formation in any particular place depends on the actions of reflexive agents, whose perspectives and capacities are shaped by the social, economic, and political contexts within which they are operating. As such, any understanding of business agendas needs to identify the social relations of business as a whole, rather than assuming away such complexities. </jats:p>",

Numerous examples are shown in a three-stage process consisting of a) planning, b) processing and interpretation, and c) validation and integration.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First, modeling is performed to assess the NMR contrast, using any available information concerning anticipated fluid types. Knowledge of downhole conditions also allows the estimation of the NMR signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from which the sensitivity and statistical error can be evaluated. The outcome of the planning process is a suite of NMR pulse sequences that optimizes resolution of the different fluids and minimizes error with the shortest possible acquisition time.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Interpreting fluid-characterization NMR logs is relatively straightforward when the fluids have large NMR contrast and obey the standard correlations. However, dissolved gas, wettability variations, internal field gradients, and restricted diffusion can cause deviations from model behavior and have significant effects on NMR relaxation data. These effects need to be recognized and accounted for.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To gain insights into the NMR-based fluid evaluation process, we have developed a model-independent technique that gives various sets of D-T1-T2 maps. The maps are analogous to the crossplots commonly used in log interpretation practices and are indispensable in the interpretation of the data. We also explain quantitative interpretation techniques from D-T2 maps.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Integrating NMR fluid-characterization results with other information and openhole logs constitutes the final step. As with any technique, results need to be crosschecked with other log data for consistency. The answer gives a water saturation that can be verified with other tools and techniques such as the dielectric log, resistivity logs, and the density magnetic resonance technique method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The alternative political discourses and identities associated with social movements in Latin America are frequently examined at the height of mobilization and visibility of these same movements. In response to growing concern about the limits of such analyses, I propose thinking about the ‘sedimentation’ of social-movement discourses in place. ‘Sedimentation’ refers to the complex processes through which discourses (including ‘identities’, political vocabularies, and practices) deployed in moments of collective organization and protest become translated and socially embedded by a variety of actors, not only over time but through disparate social and political arenas. Social-movement theorists in geography and other disciplines could more fully understand the longer term political and cultural impacts of social movements if they engaged theories of place—particularly in ways that decenter ‘the movement’ as the central category of analysis. An approach that centers on place and sedimentation processes, rather than on the fate of ‘the movement’, facilitates understanding the complex (and often contradictory) ripple effects of collective protest over time and through various social arenas—some seemingly far removed from ‘the movement’ itself. To illustrate my argument I draw on ethnographic research that explores, over a ten-year period (1988–98), collective mobilization and changing political discourses in a Purhépechan indigenous community of Mexico. </jats:p>",

Market approaches to public goods provision emphasize the competitive state, and attribute limited degree of privatization to bureaucratic resistance. Rural development theory emphasizes the uneven impact of market solutions in rural communities. Using national data on US local government service delivery from 1992 and 1997, we analyze differences in local government service-delivery patterns by metropolitan status. Discriminant analysis suggested that structural features of markets are more important than the managerial capacity of government leaders in explaining lower rates of privatization among rural governments. These structural constraints limit the applicability of competitive approaches to local government service delivery. Our results suggest that cooperation, as an alternative to privatization at the local level and as a source of redistributive aid at the state level, may provide a more equitable alternative for disadvantaged rural communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the objectives of the ongoing research and development work at the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (NPTC) in Boston is to perform optimized intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatments. Such treatments may be delivered by magnetically scanning a narrow proton pencil beam across the target volume, while both the scanning speed and the intensity of the beam are modulated. Localization of the proton dose in space allows one to yield dose distributions that are highly conformal to the target volume, thus minimizing the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissue. The aim of the current research is to determine technically optimal and clinically relevant specifications for the scanned beam delivery system, which is being developed in collaboration with Ion Beam Applications (IBA); and to create a link between the treatment planning and the beam delivery. IMPT treatment planning is performed for patient cases treated at the NPTC, with KonRad Pro software developed at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). For the IMPT delivery, the proton intensity maps, optimized for discrete pencil beam spots, need to be translated into continuous scanning patterns. At the same time it is necessary to minimize the discrepancy between the planned and delivered doses which may result from such conversion, as well as from the technical limitations of the delivery system. Possibilities have been investigated for improving the proton dose conformity by optimizing the beam and scanning nozzle parameters, and by taking the specifics and limitations of the system into account in the treatment planning stage. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I focus upon a sociotechnical network made possible through the combination of software, the Internet, and peer-to-peer computer networks. These sociotechnical networks have destabilised the regime of governance that supports what I describe in the paper as copyright capitalism by creating a series of gift economies where the products of those industries are given away. This development has significance for a wide range of creative industries that are dependent upon copyright protection for their reproduction, including motion pictures, publishing, and software engineering. The main empirical focus of this paper is the music industry because it is there that the challenge to the mode of reproduction of copyright capitalism has been most acute. I look at the origins of these gift economies, which can be traced back to the academic roots of the Internet. A musical gift economy centred upon MP3 (a software format) emerged during the early 1990s, but was only constituted as a problem for the music industry after the commercial invasion of the Internet during the late 1990s. Dot.com start-ups transformed the specialised knowledge that was once the preserve of hackers and hobbyists into generic knowledge through the development of ‘user-friendly’ file-exchange systems, thereby providing mass access to a once underground musical gift economy. Copyright capitalists mobilised the powers of law enforcement to reassert their control over the circulation of recorded music, and have successfully tamed many of the firms that sought to extend this gift economy for commercial gain. However, there has emerged a set of networks that are both ideologically and substantively opposed to the interests of copyright capitalism, and that are more resistant to attempts to reassert the control of the large corporations. In this paper I argue that the continued existence of these networks will undermine the ability of large media companies to control copyright in the way they have in the past. Although the communities that facilitate such economies are themselves unstable and rely, like other ‘alternative’ economic systems, upon a narrow band of active participants, such gift economies may emerge as the most significant and problematic legacy of the ‘new economy’. </jats:p>",

I argue that, for Ecuadorian indigenous organizations, international development provides an idiom for negotiating civil and resource rights. This process is demonstrated through an institutional ethnography of an indigenous federation in the Ecuadorian Amazon, which highlights the ways that the federation uses the discourses of nationalist development and environmentalism in order to contest official understandings of citizenship and the nation. </jats:p>",

Mobility growth is also central to issues of global warming and the need for sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to elucidate empirically some properties of recent developments in international mobility. A theoretically informed understanding of changing patterns of long-distance travel is briefly outlined. This understanding is confronted with empirical findings concerning the actual development of international travel from Sweden during the 1990s. The findings confirm expected trends of further increasing intensity, extensity, and velocity in long-distance mobility. A tendency towards globalisation is observed, though an intraregional transnationalisation is the dominant process at work. It is concluded that an increasing short-term flexibilisation in people's use of time and space is a more important driving force behind the transnationalisation of mobility, than is the geographical extension of more enduring social relations. Influencing factors behind the social division of mobility are addressed by identifying the hypermobile segment of the population. Implications for the wider issues of globalisation and environmental sustainability are discussed. </jats:p>",

A total of 21 professionally managed public airports were studied, representing a mix of airline-based and general aviation facilities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current state‐of‐the art of clinical inverse planning, the design of clinically acceptable IMRT plans is predominantly based on the optimization of physical rather than biological objective functions. A major impetus for this trend is the unproven predictive power of radiobiological models, which is largely due to the scarcity of data sets for an accurate evaluation of the model parameters. On the other hand, these models do capture the currently known dose‐volume effects in tissue dose‐response, which should be accounted for in the process of optimization. In order to incorporate radiobiological information in clinical treatment planning optimization, we propose a hybrid physico‐biological approach to inverse treatment planning based on the application of a continuous penalty function method to the constrained minimization of a biological objective. The objective is defined as the weighted sum of normal tissue complication probabilities evaluated with the Lyman normal‐tissue complication probability model. Physical constraints specify the admissible minimum and maximum target dose. The continuous penalty function method is then used to find an approximate solution of the resulting large‐scale constrained minimization problem. Plans generated by our approach are compared to ones produced by a commercial planning system incorporating physical optimization. The comparisons show clinically negligible differences, with the advantage that the hybrid technique does not require specifications of any dose‐volume constraints to the normal tissues. This indicates that the proposed hybrid physico‐biological method can be used for the generation of clinically acceptable plans.</jats:p>",

The demand-driven model is traditional for this type of analysis and examines the effects of a demand pull (for example, an increase in exports). For an open economy, however, it is not only important to investigate the effects of a demand pull, but also to examine how a cost push (for example, an increase in import prices) affects total gross output, value added, or labor income, for example. To study the effects of a cost push we introduce the partially closed supply-driven input–output model. Instead of analyzing the effects of a specific exogenous demand pull or cost push, we focus on various types of multiplier. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The ability of firms, industries, and regions continually to translate information and knowledge into viable new products, services, and production processes in the face of constantly changing technology and market conditions is increasingly at the core of competitive success in the contemporary economy. Such economic learning is ultimately dependent on the ability of individuals to learn, and yet most of the literature in this area has focused on firms and organizational learning processes, and is only beginning to engage seriously with people's learning processes. This paper explores the links between social learning processes and dynamics of innovation in Silicon Valley, arguing that cross-firm, occupationally based, ‘communities of practice’ provide a critical context for individuals to learn and maintain the competencies they need to be successful in the region's dynamic but volatile economy. These cross-firm occupational learning communities in many cases are being built through the activities of formal professional associations, which are playing an increasingly important role in providing the organizational infrastructure to sustain these learning communities. Using a case study of an association of women in Internet design and development occupations, the author illustrates the value of such communities in supporting individual and collective learning processes. These findings suggest that economic development strategies could productively be focused on identifying, strengthening, and expanding access to such cross-firm occupational learning communities. </jats:p>",

Considered ‘out of place’ in urban public space, street children create their own niches in the marginal spaces of the city. By looking at untouchable spaces, underground spaces, and rooftop spaces I show how they develop their own place identities. For survival, street children react to their exclusion by resisting this out-of-place image and encroaching into crowded spaces or by dominating the street under the cover of darkness. However, in certain city spaces, street children are also legitimised and accepted by other street users if they conform to the desired behaviours of that space. The place of street children in Kampala is one which is contested, resulting in a multiplicity of street children's niches being created which vary both spatially and temporally. </jats:p>",

A survey of German subsidiaries in North West England is used to test the significance of the variables that are identified as likely to affect employment. The results of logit regression indicate that entry mode, technology transfer, and firm age affect the growth of employment. The study also highlights that other factors, such as sector, organisational structure, the level of diversification of operations by subsidiaries in the local economy, and range of markets supplied may have important affects on employment. The research indicates that further conceptual and empirical work is required to clarify our understanding of how the organisational, operational, and diversification characteristics of subsidiaries affect employment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two experiments are reported, which consider planning behaviour in the context of a well-structured problem. One question in the problem-solving literature is to what extent planning a solution to a problem takes place before attempting that problem and whether this takes precedence over planning while solving a problem, hereafter referred to as “concurrent planning”. An additional question is whether the adoption of one mode of planning confers a performance advantage and under what circumstances one strategy is adopted in preference to others. The studies reported here set out to investigate the effects on performance of adopting different modes of planning and whether there is any relationship between the adoption of different strategic approaches and problem-solving performance. The results of these studies suggest that initial planning can enhance problem-solving performance, but only when problems remain relatively simple. As problem complexity increases the effects of initial planning appear to have little or no effect upon performance. In conclusion it is suggested that strategy use depends upon the interactions between individual preference for a given strategy, problem complexity, and the stage that one has reached in the development of a solution to a problem. </jats:p>",

Themes derived from a series of focus group discussions from a larger study, including individuals (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 83) from multiple community sectors, guided development of the measure. Participants in three follow‐up focus groups (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 32 participants) reviewed the measure, which was then pilot tested in two phases. Guided by information from the first phase, in which respondents indicated the measure was too complex, the measure was simplified and field tested in phase two. Results from both phases were similar. The GFM score was significantly higher for the program selected by the respondent before completing the measure than the nonselected program (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). Participants indicated that the tool was helpful in articulating the specific factors for their decisions. Participants underscored the utility of the tool in facilitating program planning by individual providers and interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary teams. The GFM provides systematic consideration of multiple factors that motivate public health nurses and other community providers in their decision‐making process when planning prevention strategies, increasing the likelihood of successful programs.</jats:p>",

The authors propose an approach to the geographical analysis of regional economic issues based on theoretically informed empirical modelling. The authors operationalise the approach by distilling eight measurable dimensions from a set of six institutionalist theories of local growth, with each theory being a unique combination of subsets of these dimensions. The impact of these dimensions on local economic growth is then explored in the empirical context of regional change in Australia. The results of this linkage of theoretical and empirical research suggest that local growth, at least in Australia, is fostered by two sets of processes associated with (1) ‘human resources’; and (2) an enterprising culture. The processes revealed suggest general lines that policy development might follow. </jats:p>",

This increased effectiveness also characterizes the advantage of heavier ions compared to proton beams. The increased effectiveness has to be taken into account in treatment planning in order to estimate the corresponding photon equivalent doses in normal and tumor tissues, thus allowing a link e.g., to normal tissue dose limits in conventional photon therapy. </jats:p><jats:p> Due to the complex dependencies of RBE on parameters like dose, beam energy, LET, atomic number and cell or tissue type, the relevant RBEs cannot be solely determined from experimental data. Therefore, within the framework of the pilot project of tumor therapy with carbon ions performed at GSI Darmstadt, treatment planning is based on a biophysical model, which has been extensively tested. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper first summarizes the essential systematic dependencies of RBE on different parameters like e.g., dose, LET, atomic number and cell type. The basic principle of the biophysical model is then introduced, and special emphasis is given to the application of the model to in vivo and clinical endpoints. Model predictions are compared to experimental data in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the implementation of the biophysical model in the treatment planning procedure is presented. The biological verification of the whole treatment planning procedure is explained and examples of patient treatment plans are given. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, the development of policy partnerships enables environmental groups to influence policy formulation processes directly. However, it also means that such groups must ‘sell’ the agreed policy line to local members. Using the case study of the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), we investigate how environmental groups manage the relationship between national policymaking and local support. Through the investigation of three CPRE county branches we reveal an uneven geography of environmental governance and show how this geography affects the diffusion of environmental policy objectives. We argue that the implementation of environmental policies must be set within local economic, political, and social conditions as these conditions ensure considerable variation in modes of environmental governance. </jats:p>",

Records of patient registrations with general medical practices offer the opportunity to examine the geographical distribution of choice for an essential service. This population study of two million residents of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk used postcodes extracted from patient registers and estimated car travel times from residential locations to general practice surgeries in a geographic information system. Only 56% of the population were registered with the practice nearest their home. People were more likely to use the nearest practice if they lived in rural rather than urban areas and where a surgery was within walking distance. Choice, as measured by the number of practices used by 95% of residents, was highest in the larger urban areas and lowest in small towns and rural areas with a local surgery. Ten percent of the population were served by monopoly practices. Overall, the distribution of registrations reflected a regular and predictable substitution of choice for increased travel time. People were 29% less likely to register with a practice for every additional minute of travel time: an almost perfect distance-decay relationship that was used to calibrate a potential model of accessibility over the study area. The resulting values of potential accessibility were found to approximate the combination of travel time to the nearest surgery and the actual range of choice exercised by residents. This demonstration that the potential accessibility model reflects consumer behaviour has applications beyond the health field. </jats:p>",

The product of IM Step 1 was a series of program objectives specifying what drug users should learn in order to use condoms consistently. In Step 2, theoretical methods for influencing the most important determinants were chosen and translated into practical strategies that fit the program objectives. The main strategy chosen was behavioral journalism. In Step 3, leaflets with role-model stories based on authentic interviews with drug users were developed and pilot tested. Finally, the need for cooperation with program users is discussed in IM Steps 4 and 5. </jats:p>",

In rural landscapes in Victoria, this will require the restoration of habitat and biophysical processes to levels that can sustain the majority of species. Planning is required at scales large enough to have ecological relevance. In this study, a land‐use change scenario that plans for the conservation of native biodiversity within the Goulburn Broken Catchment was developed using simple ecological principles. A set of indicative rules for restoring remnant native vegetation was modelled within a geographical information system. The modelling of the rules resulted in a change in rural landscapes from highly fragmented (with few large remnants) to highly connected. Future applications of this approach include incorporating the biodiversity rules into a biophysical model to assess the effect of planning landscapes for the conservation of biodiversity on hydrological and economic outcomes for the region. In addition, the rules are to be refined so that the priority landscapes for biodiversity planning can be identified.</jats:p>",

Evidence from Swansea reveals a stark twofold temporal division between a frequently visited daytime city and a much less frequently visited evening and nighttime city. Furthermore, lower intensity evening activities such as theatres and cinemas are distinguished from the higher intensity nighttime activities of pubs and clubs, with restaurants and cafés occupying an intermediate position. The evening clientele visit less frequently and are disproportionately drawn from the older and higher status social groups, whereas later at night, pubs and clubs are visited more frequently, and by imbalances of the young, lower status groups, and students. The city centre is seen as an area of spatial, temporal, and social segregation, with implications for policies that aim towards a more inclusive and safer 24-hour city. The conclusions emphasise the importance of time in urban geographical research and in policies for city-centre revitalisation. </jats:p>",

Surface grafting of mesoporous silica having amino groups as initiator sites was prepared from γ‐aminopropyltrimethoxysilane by sol‐gel process. The postgrafting reaction of Congo red onto silica with terminal amino groups was achieved by a repeated step of the addition of methyl acrylate to amine groups followed by the amidation of the resulting ester moieties with ethylene diamine. Postgrafting efficiency of all materials has been outlined. Because postgrafting efficiency values have been found to be smaller than theoretical values, it is concluded that the resulting product was more likely to be a hyperbranched polymer rather than a true dendrimer at higher generations. The postgrafted structures with amino‐terminal groups provide an attractive site for binding Congo red dye that not only persists in its characteristic properties, but also has exceptional hybrid properties possessed by mesoporous silica. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This hypothesis was empirically tested by combining Dutch data on the self-reported health of over 10 000 people with land-use data on the amount of greenspace in their living environment. In the multilevel analysis we controlled for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as urbanity. Living in a green environment was positively related to all three available health indicators, even stronger than urbanity at the municipal level. Analyses on subgroups showed that the relationship between greenspace and one of the health indicators was somewhat stronger for housewives and the elderly, two groups that are assumed to be more dependent on, and therefore exposed to, the local environment. Furthermore, for all three health indicators the relationship with greenspace was somewhat stronger for lower educated people. Implications for policymaking and spatial planning are discussed briefly. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The challenges of real‐time Gamma Knife™ inverse planning are the large number of variables involved and the unknown search space <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic>. With limited collimator sizes, shots have to be heavily overlapped to form a smooth prescription isodose line that conforms to the irregular target shape. Such overlaps greatly influence the total number of shots per plan, making pre‐determination of the total number of shots impractical. However, this total number of shots usually defines the search space, a pre‐requisite for most of the optimization methods. Since each shot only covers part of the target, a collection of shots in different locations and various collimator sizes selected makes up the global dose distribution that conforms to the target. Hence, planning or placing these shots is a combinatorial optimization process that is computationally expensive by nature. We have previously developed a theory of shot placement and optimization based on skeletonization. The real‐time inverse planning process, reported in this paper, is an expansion and the clinical implementation of this theory. The complete planning process consists of two steps. The first step is to determine an optimal number of shots including locations and sizes and to assign initial collimator size to each of the shots. The second step is to fine‐tune the weights using a linear‐programming technique. The objective function is to minimize the total dose to the target boundary (i.e., maximize the dose conformity). Results of an ellipsoid test target and ten clinical cases are presented. The clinical cases are also compared with physician's manual plans. The target coverage is more than 99% for manual plans and 97% for all the inverse plans. The RTOG PITV conformity indices for the manual plans are between 1.16 and 3.46, compared to 1.36 to 2.4 for the inverse plans. All the inverse plans are generated in less than 2 min, making real‐time inverse planning a reality.</jats:p>",

Though plans are driven by the intent of the commanding officer, the quality of plans are heavily dependent upon the level of situation awareness of officers involved in the process. To support Army planning in command and control, it is important for us to understand planning and the challenges to providing the critical information underlying it. We conducted a theoretical investigation of maneuvers planning in combat situations. We used results from goal-directed task analysis, and insights from observations of Army training exercises and experiments, to make inferences on the activities carried out in preparation for tactical maneuvers. Our goal was to identify major characteristics of the planning process in current and future Army force structures. We were also interested in identifying human factors issues associated with planning in a rapidly evolving environment, and generating computer-based design concepts to support situation awareness and decision making. </jats:p>",

The proposed approach uses a parameter that serves as a mechanism for guiding multicriteria evaluation procedures. The parameter is incorporated into a method for obtaining the optimal order weights and for developing a transformation function. The function provides us with a consistent way of modifying the criterion values so that the multicriteria combination procedures can be guided by specifying a single parameter. The parameterized-OWA method has been implemented in a GIS environment as a GIS–OWA module and it has been tested in a real-world situation for developing management strategies in the Cedar Creek watershed in Ontario, Canada. Given a set of evaluation criteria, the problem is to evaluate areas in the watershed for rehabilitation and enhancement projects. Using the GIS–OWA method, a number of alternative strategies for rehabilitation and enhancement projects have been generated and evaluated. </jats:p>",

Seventy-seven novice and expert pilots were asked in multiple trials to choose control actions that would change a current flight state depicted by cockpit instruments into a goal flight state, and then to judge whether a subsequent display of cockpit instruments showed the future state of the aircraft relative to the stated goal. Control movement selection, a measure of action planning accuracy, and future state judgment accuracy were recorded. The results suggest that expert action planning is directly linked to an ability to project forward a future state. In contrast, novice ability to project forward is independent of action planning accuracy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When a Navrongo Health Research Centre experiment demonstrated that community-based health services could reduce child mortality and fertility in impoverished communities, the Government of Ghana launched the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Initiative to scale up results. This article reports on a “Qualitative Systems Appraisal” (QSA) of factors explaining why CHPS is implemented in some districts, but stalled in others. QSA consists of groups representing levels of the service hierarchy (community members, frontline service providers, supervisors, and district managers) to portray systemic reactions to CHPS. Community members are enthusiastic about CHPS and willing to mobilize labor and resources for constructing nurse accommodations. Participating staff are supportive, but staff not yet participating are apprehensive about the program. Nurses worry about their transfer to communities; supervisors and managers worry about constrained fuel, equipment, drugs, facilities, and manpower resources. Demonstrating CHPS at functioning sites clarifies ways to bridge resource gaps, address concerns, and build consensus for the implementation process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The realization of agile enterprises requires substantial development of the underpinning modelling, information management and knowledge representation technologies. This paper introduces a resource model that has been developed to support the dynamic, aggregate planning of manufacturing operations within large, complex production networks during the formative stages of design. The main goal of aggregate planning is the measurement of product manufacturability and the evaluation of alternative design configurations and manufacturing scenarios, through the allocation of multiple parts to remote facilities within the supply network. The term ‘resource aware’ planning is used to indicate the creation of a dynamic interrelationship between the planning entities (products and processes) and the enterprise resources, including humans and machines. The technologies employed for implementing the pilot methods include the aggregate resource modelling methodology, a web-centric co-development environment, unique methods for enriching planning entities with knowledge and evolutionary computing methods for the rapid generation and optimization of production routes. A pilot resource aware planning system has been implemented that supports many innovative modes of operation, the initial testing of which was very encouraging. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a novel methodology for optimizing the wide range of early planning choices available for the manufacture of complex products, across a distributed and dynamically changing enterprise. A hybrid simulated annealing and greedy algorithm has been developed to optimize such planning decisions. The hybrid algorithm and associated methods detailed within the paper allow the utilization of key attributes from the core product, process and resource digital models to create an initial valid plan and a dynamic ‘manufacturing phase space’. Within this phase space, the detailed methods, heuristics and algorithms are deployed in order to optimize the initial plan by evaluating alternative processes and resources. The evaluation is based on an alternative's impact on the overall solution obtained by applying user-defined cardinal weightings on quality, cost, delivery and knowledge (QCD + K) metrics. To enable the application of business objectives on QCD + K, methods were developed for the conversion of quality, delivery and knowledge into a cost equivalent. The paper is concluded with an example based upon the collaborating company's aerospace products. </jats:p>",
