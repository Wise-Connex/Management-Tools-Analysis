These pressures have prompted a range of innovations in how organizations such as the National Audit Office carry out their evaluations. Related to these pressures is the rise of formal futures within the public sector. The implications of this thinking for VFM public auditing are examined. It is argued that, although conventional VFM auditing remains appropriate for much of the public sector, there are a growing number of public sector activities requiring a different approach. Such approaches include scenario planning. These not only present methodological problems for auditors but also raise important issues about the role of audit more generally. Finally, although these new tools may be helpful in many respects, it is suggested that they may increase the tension between anchoring parliamentary accountability in some statements of fact and contributing to improvements in the quality of public services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Business today is being impacted by multiple forces and is under an unprecedented pressure to perform. The key to performance lies in anticipating the future and working towards it. This means asking the question: How much of its resources is the company putting in renewal and innovation, i.e., in activities like R&amp;D, quality and process improvement, industrial design, market research, and so on? </jats:p><jats:p> What is the record of Indian companies when it comes to innovation? This article briefly surveys the Indian scenario and quotes examples of innovation, or lack of it, in sectors such as automobiles, FMCG, telecom, etc. While impressive strides have been made by certain companies, the same cannot be said of the entire Indian industry. It is mostly the MNCs, driven by their worldwide processes, that have been at the forefront of innovation. There have been some Indian companies too doing a good job but the majority seems to be ill-prepared to meet the global onslaught or even the Chinese one. </jats:p><jats:p> In this context, this article examines the following issues: What is the concept of innovation? How do Indian companies achieve a grasp of it? Is innovation an ongoing process? Should companies strive for breakthrough developments or focus on continuous improvement? </jats:p><jats:p> “It is not the strongest who survive nor the most intelligent — but those most responsive to change” (Charles Darwin). If this is true, are the Indian companies doing enough to respond to the changing times? Again, this article examines the Indian scenario in the manufacturing and services sector. While many companies are adapting fast, there are many that are still to awake to the changing times. </jats:p><jats:p> Total Quality Management (TQM) has made impressive inroads in to the manufacturing and service sectors. Organizations have finally realized the difference between seeking an ISO certification and launching a process to improve continuously. The manufacturing sector is focusing on aspects like lean management, TQM, Quality Circles, and Kaizen. Its essential approach has been influenced significantly by the Japanese approach to TQM. The service sector has been using the Six Sigma banner to further its movement. Benchmarking is a common thread between the two sectors to drive improvement. Organizations have also been using variations of the business excellence models to drive their improvement. </jats:p><jats:p> There are many reasons that go into making process improvement the most challenging exercise. This article examines the fundamental causes and recommends that this is one area where improvements will directly impact customer satisfaction. </jats:p><jats:p> As we move into the 21st century, what are the key traits required in an organization to achieve excellence? These are as follows: having key customer insights focusing business strategies on customer value quality commitment upgrading knowledge and processes management by facts and feedback. </jats:p><jats:p> In the Indian scenario, it is mainly the MNCs, driven by their global processes, that are driving business excellence. The same culture needs to be cultivated by the Indian companies be they large or medium ones. </jats:p>",

However, the pathogenesis of this disease is still not well known. It is believed that renal dysplasia is caused by a nephron induction deficit due to ampullary inactivity, or an abnormal budding of the ureteric bud from the mesonephric duct. Renal dysplasia is frequently associated with urinary tract obstruction, suggesting an alternative mechanism whereby urinary retention causes abnormal kidney development. Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and obstructive renal dysplasia (ORD) are two different phenotypes of dysplasia associated with urinary tract obstruction. From detailed morphological studies using fetal dysplastic kidneys, nephron induction with filtrating function occurs before cysts are formed. Moreover, three‐dimensional reconstruction of dysplastic nephrons showed that cysts developed in the once‐induced nephrons as the result of fluid retention in both MCDK and ORD. <jats:italic>In utero</jats:italic> urinary tract obstruction may cause urine retention in functioning nephrons and lead to multiple cyst formation in the nephrogenic zone. These findings are common to MCDK and ORD, although there may be a difference in the obstruction site. Expansion of cysts with tubular dilatation (cysts) disturbs the subsequent nephrogenesis by the deregulated expression of growth and transcription factors, and may contribute to the misdevelopment of fetal kidneys.</jats:p>",

Using the letter to Thyatira (Rev. 2.18-29), and the attention given the woman prophet in the Thyatiran community, this study surveys interpretations from other woman scholars and introduces anthropological studies that link women, sex and food, a triad John also utilizes in the Thyatiran letter. In sum, Thyatirans are literally 'eating culture', and the conflict represented in the letter is a conflict for authority, a conflict about who will set and maintain group boundaries—a woman prophet who is an insider in the community or John, an outsider, who has the only voice the reader hears? </jats:p>",

Our goal is to develop and demonstrate a training approach that uses advanced distance learning technology to provide portable training to small, flexible, quickly reconfigured, rapidly deployed military teams. The program is a web-enabled, scenario-based teamwork skills training program comprised of: information about and examples of teamwork skills; scenario-based training exercises that provide practice in teamwork skills; guidelines for team-conducted exercise debriefings that do not require the presence of a training instructor; and a leader's manual that helps team leaders to conduct web-based training sessions. The version we are currently developing is focused on physicians under training (fellows and residents) working in an academic trauma center. </jats:p>",
