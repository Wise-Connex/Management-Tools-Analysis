      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a linear-programming model for the formulation of a joint policy for land use and environmental pollution. The theoretical framework is an extension of the residential-location model originally suggested by Herbert and Stevens (1960). Environmental policy is introduced by setting environmental standards which can be spatially differentiated. According to the characteristics of the diffusion process and of the discharge location of the residuals into the environment, these standards can be expressed as the permissible concentration of pollutants, the total allowable pollutant emission, or the required treatment of the residuals. The model considers the locational choice of the various urban activities as well as the available technological alternatives for residual treatment. In the analysis of the dual it is shown that a policy which uses environmental standards can efficiently be implemented by using a system of emission or pollution licenses, performance standards, and zoning restrictions. </jats:p>",

Certain comparisons between the operation and maintenance requirements of these special-purpose vessels and Government operated and maintained vessels are made because it is the latter group to which most intensive and comprehensive programs have been applied. Such programs are comprehensive in scope and are well supported at all levels with management and technical personnel, logistics, and industrial and intermediate repair activities. As extensive administrative organization designed to utilize the commercial repair capabilities country wide; an efficiently administered and staffed training organization; and, finally, a substantial financial base are integral to these programs.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes a simple, effective, systematic approach to the complex problem of ship maintenance management, particularly as might be applied to drillships. The system contains a provision for cyclic maintenance which will tend towards the gradual elimination of outside assistance. The paper also contains the author's opinion drawn from involvement in a variety of existing maintenance methods and philosophies which have had varying degrees of success. In most cases, results have been below expectations, at least from the point of view of the onboard operator/maintainer.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The progress of time, technology and methodology has resulted in a reorientation of our society away from a broad distribution of basic mechanical skills and towards many narrow, highly developed skill disciplines. This has in turn resulted in a \"use and throwaway\" attitude rather than one oriented towards endurance and maintainability.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>SHIP MAINTENANCE PLANNING SYSTEM</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The ship maintenance and overhaul management system is designed to assist the ship operator in the management of corrective and routine maintenance, and in the orderly phase-in of modifications. Properly implemented, the system maximizes operating capability, minimizes shipyard costs, and optimizes personnel utilization.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The system consists of five elements or modules that define and pace the material condition of a ship along an orderly, planned path from one of some degree of degradation (corrective maintenance posture) to one of reliable and predictable operation (preventive maintenance posture).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Figure 1 is a flow diagram which shows the transition of work defined in the baseline survey through the planning modules to accomplished corrective or maintenance actions. The initial module in the plan accurately defines the existing material condition, updates the equipment inventory, identifies equipment essential to safety, and evaluates the supporting technical documentation. It is at this point that the collection of maintenance data begins. The condition baseline survey enables comparisons between conditions of maintenance urgency within a ship or between conditions among ships. Funding and scheduling can then be managed to bring about the Corrective Maintenance.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>When maintenance deficiencies are corrected, the Preventive Maintenance Plan is implemented. On new construction, the overall plan would be initiated at this point. The objective of the Corrective Maintenance is to develop and sustain a posture of reduced corrective maintenance requirements. Once corrective action is completed, corrective repair requirements will become minimal and the ship will enter the preventive maintenance condition, and there begin the cycle from preventive maintenance planning to maintenance action to maintenance data collection.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

To meet this challenge, the planner must be familiar with the diverse kinds of problems and opportunities confronting his organization, as well as with the resources available to solve the problems or respond to the opportunities. Unfortunately, being familiar with the problems, opportunities, and resources is not enough. If corporate planners are to go beyond recommending direction and approach, they must understand the nature of power and how to use it effectively. The objective of this article is to discuss the various types of power available to planners and how this power can be used to improve the effectiveness of planning skills.</jats:p>",

We still have much to learn, but compared with the early efforts we are now high on the learning curve. 3) The fundamental lessons we have learned in the private sector in doing comprehensive long‐range planning are applicable to the introduction, development, and success of aggregate integrated long‐range planning in the public sector. 4) It is imperative that a dialogue begin immediately between practitioners of long‐range planning in the private sector and those in the public sector who are directly involved in the development of this process. Both groups have much to learn from each other, but it is particularly important that those in the public sector be exposed to the first‐hand experience of those in the private sector. </jats:p>",

Initially the client's needs must be identified, in some cases this being no easy task as the perceived and actual client needs are not identical. Secondly, the strategy for aiding the client must be defined and the resource requirements specified. Finally, the effectiveness of the chosen strategy in meeting the client need must be determined such that if unsatisfactory, some corrective alternative solutions can be devised within the resource constraints that are prevalent.</jats:p>",

But in order to work with opinion leaders, it is necessary first to identify them For family planning studies, the operational indicators used in past studies do not appear to be adequate. These indicators do not accurately identify persons who will take an opinion leadership behavior in the future, do not measure knowledge by the opinion leader, do not distinguish positive from negative opinion leaders, and do not take account of the bi-directional flow of information and advice both to and from the opinion leader. Drawing upon data from a family planning study in Baltimore, various examples for inadequate opinion leadership indicators are given. The paper suggests the need to revise these indicators and then outlines a simple and inexpensive program that might be used to channel the energies and activities of family planning opinion leaders towards the fulfillment of program objectives. </jats:p>",

The fitting of the two functions is done by two different methods in order to find out the influence of the method of measurement on the type of pattern generated.

The effect of these policies in achieving objectives, such as the reduction of unemployment and underemployment, will differ from industry to industry. Thus it is most important to investigate the production function parameters of each of the industries which are likely to be attracted to these regions, so as to determine to what extent the devised policies will achieve their declared objectives. This paper shows that no single policy can be applied for all industries. It is therefore necessary first to identify the industry and thereupon to devise the proper policy that will advance the overall set of objectives. Finally, we describe in a graphical form in the appendix the gaming process of the on-the-job-training programme which takes place between the trainee and the employer through time. </jats:p>",

This paper challenges the usual view of wage rate as an equilibrating mechanism whereby unemployment leads to lower wages which in turn encourage the introduction of more labor-intensive capital that increases demand for labor. The rational reasons for the introduction of laborsaving equipment even under conditions of unemployment is derived by considering the concept of effort per worker. Because labor contracts for continuous relationships are imprecise with regard to effort, effort variation exists. The degree to which inputs are underutilized is the degree of ‘ X-inefficiency’. Since effort depends partly on motivation, lower wages may result in more than a proportionately lower value of effort; firms will not want to minimize the wage per man-year that they pay but the wage per unit of effort. Capital-intensive techniques may (up to a certain point) be ‘effort-stretching’, stimulating a higher level of effort per worker. Under such circumstances unemployment would not lead to the introduction of more labor-intensive capital nor necessarily to the absorption of the unemployed. </jats:p>",

Spatial pricing schemes that use a distance criterion, especially distance from city center, are shown to be inadequate for purposes of equity and efficiency—the reason being the weakness of distance as an underlying variable in urban social ecology. One should, therefore, resort to a pricing scheme which comes as close as possible to the actual residential pattern. This paper suggests the use of a zonal and parcel pricing scheme which takes into account data on density and income by zone, or neighborhood, and by parcel. Usually such zonal and parcel data are quite readily available and are often used for such purposes as land use regulation or property taxation. With little additional effort a more refined spatial pricing scheme would be reached, thus equity and efficiency considerations would be more properly satisfied. By introducing additional data on the spatial distribution of peak and offpeak users, such a spatial scheme could replace temporal pricing in urban areas where peak-load pricing through metering is not feasible. </jats:p>",
