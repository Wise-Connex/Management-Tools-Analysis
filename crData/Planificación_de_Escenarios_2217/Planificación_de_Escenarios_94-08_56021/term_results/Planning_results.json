Because of its emphasis on people and their environments, this emerging discipline has many possible planning applications. This review summarizes the characteristics and concepts of landscape ecology and the existing approaches of its application for planning. Even though the theories of landscape ecology and the concepts of landscape ecological planning are not yet well established, they show potential to change the traditional environmental planning approach toward a true synthesis of people and nature. </jats:p>",

In the context of the current ‘greening’ of British land-use planning, it poses the question: “How is the term ‘environment’ articulated within planning discourse?” With the use of material from development plans and development-control decision letters, an analysis is made of the term ‘environment’ which distinguishes ‘mundane’ and ‘sublime’ interpretations. The function of the texts analysed is then related to the dominant meaning given to the term, This raises further questions concerning the current preoccupation with using the land-use planning system to implement environmental policy and identifies the problems of moving between strategic planning and detailed development-control levels, a problem reflected in and compounded by the distinct operation of planning discourse at the two levels. </jats:p>",

Ault relied on a cross functional team of company personnel and an external consultant to develop a model of its facility network. Ault management used the results from the model to make a number of important changes, closing several plants and warehouses and shifting production and distribution responsibilities. These changes improved Ault's competitive position. The main reason for the project's success was not the technical beauty of the network model but that the project team developed a network model that Ault management understood and results it could accept. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ireland has recently been characterised as a country dominated by private patriarchy. One indicator of private patriarchy is the incidence of women engaged in full-time ‘home duties’ rather than in paid employment. The participation of women in the Irish labour force has been comparatively very low because the majority of married women in Ireland are full-time housewives. Persistently high fertility rates—in 1987 the highest in Europe—and a state ideology which enshrined women's position in the home explained this phenomenon in the past. One might have expected industrialisation to have promoted greater change, yet its influence was minimal. Early industrialisation did not create a demand for female labour. In the 1960s export-oriented industrialisation generated a demand for female labour but this was obstructed by patriarchal state policy. In the 1970s, EU membership removed many legislative restrictions on the labour-force participation of married women. However, a patriarchal family based taxation policy and the absence of state supported child care still perpetuate private patriarchy in Ireland. </jats:p>",

The City of London provides the service space, as it were, through which Henri Lefebvre's ideas are examined and illustrated. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first section we set out the main ideas of Lefebvre on questions of social space, in particular the notions of representations of space, representational spaces and spatial practices, and how they have been taken up in the work of Harvey, Shields, and Soja. In the second section we use the example of the abstract space of finance to show how a particular dominant coding of space has been achieved through the routine spatial practices and global networks of those who work in the City's financial markets. In particular, the modes of power and the different sets of relationships through which a dominant financial space is secured are highlighted. In the third section we draw attention to the people who disappear within the financial spaces of the City, those who clean, cater within, and secure the abstract space of finance on a subcontract basis. Focusing upon the spatial practices of this contract work force, we show the manner in which they use the dominant space and their ability to subvert or contradict the dominant coding of finance. In short, the two work forces occupy the same place, yet live their everyday lives within different spaces. </jats:p>",

Data were also collected from registers and medical and professional records. All the 36 patients discharged to their own homes, mostly after home assessment, or to old people's homes were followed up. The median rehabilitation stay was 30 days. Their medical status was stable over time and nursing interventions remained frequent. The functional level was unchanged for 18, and further enhanced for 10 patients. Most patients felt secure at home and received the home help they anticipated. Worries were expressed by one-third on realistic grounds, mainly medical or ideas on the accommodation. Some interventions were required and carried out by the team. Home living was as expected or better for two-thirds of the patients. The timing and the patient's situation at discharge seemed to have been well assessed, with an overall positive outcome after a month at home. Further development of practical multidimensional evaluations adapted to elderly patients is necessary in a quality assurance perspective.</jats:p>"

The importance of these forms of work is very likely to increase and several regions in Southern Europe present ‘ideal conditions’ for their proliferation. The bulk of women's work cannot be adequately grasped by looking exclusively at employment categories of economic and statistical surveys. These relegate to ‘nonwork’ many forms of women's labour in society. The authors discuss these ‘other’ forms of labour, focusing mainly on three issues: (a) the meaning and content of work for women in Southern Europe; (b) the connotations associated with terms such as ‘atypical’, ‘irregular’, ‘informal’, and so on, usually used to describe such activities and forms of work; (c) the effects of women's overrepresentation in such forms of work on gender divisions and on their own work prospects. </jats:p>",

In addition, urban analysis has attempted to link concepts of political ‘agency’, institutional arrangements, and notions of community to the economic and political history of places. In recent years, scholars in the humanities have been carefully examining the philosophical and political underpinnings of concepts of ‘the subject’, self, and agency. I contend that if geography is to have a place in the analysis of identity, political agency, and political action, the places to look are not necessarily at the pinnacle of theoretical, architectural, or political sophistication or at places with the highest demographic or economic magnitudes. Important places to look are ‘low places’. In this paper I propose six places to look for identity and political action that are normally overlooked, ignored, or excluded from serious consideration for revealing urban issues and potential change. </jats:p>",

It works by using a set of domain constraints to prune away plans that do not “make sense,” or are temporally incoherent. Our analysis shows that, while intuitively appealing, temporal coherence can only be applied to a very specific implementation of a partial‐order planner and still maintain completeness. Furthermore, the heuristic does not always improve planning efficiency; in some cases, its application can actually degrade the efficiency of planning dramatically. To understand when the heuristic will work well, we conducted complexity analysis and empirical tests. Our results show that temporal coherence works well when strong domain constraints exist that significantly reduce the search space, when the number of subgoals is small, when the plan size is not too large, and when it is inexpensive to check each domain constraint.</jats:p>",

The focus is on the gender structure of the labour market today compared with the situation thirty years ago. To what degree has the Swedish welfare model increased opportunities for women? The author analyses both integration and segregation processes in the labour market but concentrates on different labour-market situations in order to highlight the everyday experiences of women in recruitment, in restructuring at specific workplaces, and in the workplace closure. The focus on particular situations allows for an examination of the processes of labour-market segregation—and integration—more effectively than with aggregate statistics. The crucial question is how the mechanisms of gendering are implemented in the modern gender contract in the Swedish labour market. Finally, the future possibilities of changing the gendering of the labour market is analysed. The forthcoming changes in the Swedish welfare system, resulting from cuts and notification in the public service sector, and the consequence of the application for EC membership are particularly important as women especially depend on the welfare system for jobs, and benefits, and as consumers. </jats:p>",

It is argued here that such a view is inadequate based on a knowledge of behavior in emergencies and the model is dysfunctional for planning. A more adequate model is presented, based on conditions of continuity, coordination and cooperation. This problem solving model, based on research rather than military analogies, provides a more adequate set of assumptions as the basis for planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The transformation from a centrally planned economy to a market economy involves a wide-ranging redistribution of paid employment, income, and individual opportunities. Men and women in the former East Germany (GDR)—who before reunification had equal roles of participation in paid labour—have been affected in different ways by the restructuring of the East German economy. Women are now more often unemployed, and for longer periods, and face greater difficulties in finding a job. In order to explain these differences between men and women, the authors investigate the economic, social, and political dimensions of the transformation process. The main argument is that economic and social disadvantages affecting East German women are not just related to the economic and political transformation as such. Rather, they are rooted in a traditional gender division of paid work in the former GDR which was reinforced by the paternalistic family and social policy developed by the East German state. At the same time, however, East German women's experiences of being fully integrated into employment, and enjoying greater economic independence, make it unlikely that they will easily accept the West German model of partial labour-market integration. </jats:p>",

The common feature of this drive towards the targeting of public policy is the need for improved information on the candidate areas and better methodologies to aid the prioritisation process. The pressure for more and better information is also increased by recent academic and policy debates around the importance of identifying the distinctiveness of individual regions and localities in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, four basic steps for a well-founded targeting analysis are identified. There is a need: to clarify the concept to be measured; to specify the key issues by which the concept is to be represented; to identify adequate statistical indicators covering those issues; and to create an overall index to summarise the information. In the penultimate section of the paper it is emphasised that there are numerous ways to produce a multivariate index and that the choice between them is not simple but will greatly affect the results obtained. Although it is stressed that different options will be more appropriate for different purposes, some ‘best-practice’ guidelines are identified. </jats:p>",

After an appropriate preprocessing, including radiometric corrections and image enhancement procedures, a precise geometric correction is performed in order to achieve a very high co‐registration of the images with the elevation model. A mosaic of several images at various resolutions is stored together with the DEM in a data set covering an extensive area. These data are then input to an efficient hardware‐independent terrain rendering algorithm based on a forward projection. Atmospheric effects can be simulated. The concept of a virtual scene allows an automated embedding of raytraced 3D objects.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills can, and usually do, have a significant adverse impact on the individuals who own property in, reside in, or otherwise use, areas near the landfill. This leads those who stand to be adversely affected by a landfill to take a justifiable “NIMBY” (Not in My Back Yard) position against it. In the past and even today the approach that is used for siting landfills is to select one or more specifically rural areas as candidate sites and then through a contrived process, force one or more of those sites on those who own or use nearby properties. If those in the potential sphere of influence of the landfill, which is often several miles from its location, are sufficiently politically powerful or have sufficient financial resources to actively oppose the siting of the landfill in their region, they can usually be successful in stopping the landfill from being sited in their area.</jats:p><jats:p>Some jurisdictions purport to involve the public in the site‐selection process by appointing a “citizens advisory committee” (CAC). The CAC is then “allowed” to select and rank the parameters of concern with respect to the landfill. Based on an arbitrarily developed numeric scoring system, various potential candidate sites are ranked and those with the highest ranking are selected as the “best available sites. ” While the site‐selection process and the design of the landfill should be coordinated and concurrent activities, they are typically pursued sequentially which contributes to the unreliability of the process. While this process appears superficially to have a technical aura about it, and public participation components in it, it is highly arbitrary and frequently capricious in its implementation. Rarely does this process lead to “the best available site” that would enable the development of a particular landfill at the particular location without a significant adverse impact on the current owners and users of nearby lands, future generations who may own or use those lands, and those who would use groundwaters hydraulically connected to the area at some time in the future.</jats:p><jats:p>There is need to take a significantly different approach to landfill siting than is being used today. Systems engineering provides a potential methodology for rigorous incorporation of the various factors that need to be considered in developing solid waste management capacity for a region. This paper reviews the issues of site selection for MSW management, legitimate NIMBY concerns, and how systems engineering could be used to more appropriately select a site/method for MSW management for a region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Geography and the Human Spirit, Buttimer argues that the history of geographical concern is marked by cyclical time, which is distinguished by three phases: Phoenix, Faust, and Narcissus, By taking a longer look at one of these myths, Narcissus, it is possible to suggest that Buttimer bases her account on some problematic assumptions. Thus, the figure of Echo, absent from Buttimer's telling of the myth, can return to disrupt her story. This mytho-poetic assessment reveals something of the way in which ‘others’ are constituted in her story: I take this erasure to be symptomatic of an ‘othering’ humanism, which is predicated on the other, but considers itself self-grounded and thereby distances itself from others. The conclusion questions Buttimer's universalism, her concept of cyclical time, and her sense of a liberation cry of humanism, I suggest that an emancipatory geography cannot rely on undisclosed and marginalized ‘others’, in this case represented by the figure of Echo. </jats:p>",

This model simultaneously considered first-order and second-order measurement models as well as the structural model. Methodological emphasis was placed on developing expanded conceptualizations of these strategy constructs by modeling them as second-order factors and expressing their defining constituent domains of content as first-order factors. Results indicate a strong causal linkage between management participation and two classes of strategic benefits, suggesting that management participation enhances the effectiveness of the strategy process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Owing to the significance of shade, wildlife habitat, soil stabilization, and water-filtering effects of streamside vegetation on the riparian zone, spatial restrictions are imposed on both public and private harvesting areas along the stream by state and federal agencies. Analysis of both short– and long–term impacts of the riparian zone spatial restrictions as well as spatial restrictions on harvest units is presented. The heuristic model called SSMART, for spatially constrained harvest scheduling problems, is used to solve the proposed problems. The Green River sub-basin on the Alsea Ranger District, Siuslaw National Forest, Oregon, is used for the analysis. Our computational experiments show that the marginal reduction of the total present net worth in dollars is about 6.2% per 100-foot (1 foot = 0.305 m) width of the riparian management area, and about 6.7% for the average annual harvest flow. It is also shown that increasing the exclusion period to two or three periods could cause major reduction (25–40%) in both the total present net worth and the average annual harvest flow. The linear programming relaxation is revealed to provide a good approximation for impacts of the size of riparian management areas, while it cannot be used for examining impacts of the exclusion period. </jats:p>",

The channel dimension data is used to route flows and sediment through the basin. The cost of obtaining actual surveyed data for large watersheds is typically prohibitive. Predictive equations have been developed based on 674 stations from watersheds across the United States which encompass a wide variety of channel types and sizes. These equations were tested against an independent data set and found to be adequate for use in planning‐level models. Future research is advocated which would include data from regions and stream types not included in this study.</jats:p>",

Although many auditing expert systems have been developed for individual components of the audit risk assessment process such as inherent and control risk assessment, none integrate these assessments to arrive at the ultimate objective of assessing the allowable level of detection risk which drives audit procedure selection. This paper discusses critical design concerns for audit planning expert systems in light of the integrated nature of the steps involved in the audit planning process. The design and development of an integrated audit planning expert system called APX (Audit Planning eXpert) is also discussed. A distinguishing feature of APX is that it not only performs the individual types of risk assessments but it also integrates the resulting assessments to arrive at allowable detection risk. The knowledge acquisition and system development process are described to illustrate some of the mechanics of developing such a system.</jats:p>",
