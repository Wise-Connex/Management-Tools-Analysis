Today Bata operates 190 plants in 100 countries, and its roughly 90,000 employees speak more than 140 languages and dialects. Last year the company sold over 300 million pairs of shoes, or one‐third of all the shoes produced in the free world.</jats:p>",

The investigation centres on ‘behavioural problems’ encountered by managers of strategic planning systems. Two general issues are addressed. The first concerns the frequency of occurrence of these problems among managers and their impact on the effectiveness of the planning process. The second issue pertains to whether the constellation of behavioural problems managers confront varies in accordance with the role of the manager in the planning system. Implications of the findings for practitioners and researchers are discussed.</jats:p>",

Seagrams, Bendix, Northwest Industries, Cities Service, Borden, American Can, GAF, and dozens more have pioneered and implemented restructuring on a radical scale in recent times. In all these instances, management has shed not just a doggy division but a whole line of endeavor—typically representing a third to a quarter of its asset base—with the intent of using the proceeds to plunge into entirely new activities.</jats:p>",

Of eight possible causes of planning failures obtained from our model, the ambiguity in the utility functions, the wrong forecast of the alternatives, and the wrong forecast of planning alternatives are identified as important and crucial.

A systematic formulation of the problem is provided leading to an array of 25 alternative systems versus 13 criteria, only 5 of which are quantified. A procedure for ranking these alternatives is presented which uses ELECTRE I to obtain preference graphs as input into ELECTRE II, which is then used to obtain the ordering. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the weights assigned to each criterion has a greater effect on the results than does changing the scales. However, neither effect is very significant. It is recommended that ELECTRE I be used for screening purposes to narrow the set of alternatives under consideration. ELECTRE II can then be applied to this reduced set to obtain a complete ordering. For the case study the preferred systems include reservoirs and channelization and the least preferred systems include new groundwater development.</jats:p>",

Models are developed that investigate the effects of various communication rates and information retention levels on vacancy and labor-force population trajectories. It is found that attempts by planners to reduce regional inequities in vacancy rates through controlled advertising may be successful, but at the possible cost of increasing temporal fluctuations of regional vacancy rates. </jats:p>",

A least-squares analysis of the skew-symmetric part can indicate the degree of complexity of model that is consistent with data and this can be combined with some suitable model for the symmetric part. The joint model may then be fitted by maximum likelihood based on suitable distributional assumptions. This approach is used for an analysis of Australian interstate migration for 1960–1966 and indicates a model with independent in-migration and out-migration rates proportional to a symmetric function of population sizes and interstate distance. Problems of identiflability of parameters are especially interesting and relevant to the formulation of models in this field. There is strong support for a modified gravity model, and some evidence that the out-migration rate is constant for most states. </jats:p>",

The integration of the different methodologies outlined is sought, and the models developed in a way which allows policymakers to explore the consequences of their decisions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper, the second of four, is concerned with applying a methodology for analysing the spatial aggregation problem in gravity models outlined in the first paper. The methodology is based on a consistent framework for linking measures of pattern in interaction data to the derivation and estimation of related interaction models using spatial information theory. In this quest, a link is forged between information in data and the parameters of an associated model, and in part 1 it was suggested that if this link could be formalised then a means would be available for predicting changes in model parameters from different aggregations of the data, prior to the actual estimation of the models themselves. This relationship can be formalised for the case of the continuous one-dimensional interaction model such as the population density model, and this paper is concerned with demonstrating such an application to aggregations of zones in the Reading region. The framework is first described and two continuous models are presented. Then, the discrete model is estimated by means both of regression and of entropy techniques applied to various aggregations of the region, and the resulting parameters are related to the predicted and observed informations. Finally, the parameters approximated from observed information by use of the theoretical models are compared with the estimated parameters, and the approximation is deemed good, thus providing some confidence in the general concepts developed to handle these types of problem. </jats:p>",

By using the sequence of “overview, prime, drill, and check,” beginning teachers can be certain that they have included an introduction and motivation to an activity, examples and review of material necessary for conducting the activity, varied and appropriate drilling techniques, and evaluation of students' progress. This sequence gives new teachers a secure base for lesson planning, and attempts in this way to reduce the insecurities and anxieties felt by so many novices at the start of their practicum. In addition, this approach can be used as a means of analyzing the teaching and learning actually accomplished in a class, first under the guidance of a supervising teacher and later by beginning and experienced teachers on their own. Thus, it could become an instrument for developing skill in self‐critiquing which may well be the most valuable and long‐lasting skill that methods teachers and supervisors can develop in their student‐teachers.</jats:p>",

Monitoring and evaluation requirements in relation to upgrading projects are then analysed in more detail, in terms of organizational requirements, methodology, and the utilization of findings. The discussion is illustrated with examples of the monitoring and evaluation systems established in upgrading projects in Zambia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Finally, some of the substantive issues which are relevant to the evaluation of upgrading are outlined and briefly discussed. These include the efficiency of project implementation, progressive development and self help construction as a means of increasing the low cost housing stock, community participation in planning and implementation, affordability and project impact.</jats:p>",

Open-ended interviews with the husband, separate structured interviews with each of three wives, discussions with officials at a laparoscopic sterilization camp, reports from family planning fieldworkers, the author's field notes, and a follow-up report a year later are the basis of the case description. The social reasons for polygyny, the role of the husband and wives in decision making, and the value of children are discussed in terms of the national family planning programs. </jats:p>",

These moves were to have been the relocation of the Property Services Agency to Cleveland and part of the Ministry of Defence to the county of South Glamorgan. The multiplier formulation explicitly takes into account an important feature of Government office dispersal; that is, that a large proportion of the employees move with the job. The importance of the first round in the multiplier process is stressed, and quantitative estimates of the effects of varying the nature of the initial injection are given. </jats:p>",

Three New Hampshire towns were selected to illustrate the usefulness of a mixed integer multiperiod programming model that utilizes hydrologic and economic data for identifying the discounted least cost of water supply, distribution, and scheduling. Comparisons are made regarding the feasibility of a regional water system approach versus independent “town by town” water supplies that presently prevail. To analyze the sensitivity of optimal water planning solutions to projected water demands, variations in these demands are made.</jats:p>",
