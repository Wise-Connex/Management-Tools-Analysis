Three sites were selected for a pilot planning study: the Shaw Festival, Toronto Free Theatre, and Comus Music Theatre (large, medium, and petite). Each theatre was assigned a society member accountant to work with the theatre’s finance officer. The resulting planning document, Financial Management of Canadian Theatres, was released in June 1984.

These studies demonstrate the value of the simulation process and how it can be used to weigh the options facing an operator and determine their effect on the final well cost.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The example results indicate not only that the simulator is capable of modeling the drilling process accurately and in great detail, but that each alternative that is simulated can have a cost calculated for it so it can be compared against the other options. This ability to evaluate different options is shown to be an integral part of the well planning procedure. The use of the simulator can help develop and improve comprehensive drilling plans more quickly than the use of conventional analysis. This allows faster learning and cost savings in actual field operations.</jats:p>",

The paper has six sections, After a brief introduction (section 1), it is shown in section 2 why it is important to delimit class struggle theoretically and empirically. In section 3, the recent recognition that struggles outside the capitalist workplace can be class struggles is documented. Criteria to identify class struggles in empirical practice are presented in section 4, with the focus on the definition of class struggle as activities which increase class capacity (the capacity of a class to act in relation to other classes), In section 5, three recent conflicts in inner-city Montreal are assessed using the criteria proposed. In each conflict a local community and a working class confronts the state over the form of state-funded housing or health care. In section 6, the conclusion, problems which remain in the conceptual formulation of class struggle in community conflicts are described. </jats:p>",

This method uses a matrix transformation method to achieve a least‐squares fit to doses at preselected points in a target volume. This method is more general than the conventional least‐squares method in that it allows one to incorporate as constraints maximum allowable doses delivered to critical organs, as well as the requirement that all beam weights be non‐negative. A computer algorithm DOSEOPT has been written which takes a matrix of doses to various points from beams whose field sizes and orientations have been predetermined, and performs the constrained least‐squares fit to desired doses in the target volume and maximum doses to critical organs. Implementation of this algorithm and its application to several cases are discussed.</jats:p>",

I emphasize the following conjunctures in the debate on the status of the indigenous languages: (1) the simultaneous efforts to restrict the inroads of bilingualism in the legal and political domain and to encourage bilingualism among local headmen so as to facilitate indirect rule in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries; (2) the debate as to the role of the vernacular in religious education and missionary work in the same period, a debate in which the position favoring use of the vernacular held out for a time against calls for forced liquidation of the indigenous languages; (3) the ascendancy of the position calling for liquidation in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; and (4) the role of Southern Peruvian Quechua as a nationalist emblem during the eighteenth century.</jats:p><jats:p>These conjunctures have considerable relevance today. Differences in vocabulary and ideological justification have obscured the continuity between colonial and modern language policy. The issues debated, the limits of the alternatives proposed as solutions, and even the practical efforts carried out on behalf of alternative policies, have been surprisingly perdurable. For four and a half centuries the “Andean language debate,” the issues and terms of language policy, have continued to have at their center the question of whether or not the Quechua have a right to exist as a separate community.

Although virtually all Marxists agree on certain general concepts, such as capital accumulation, agglomeration in space, spatial division of labor, capital mobility, the role of the state, etc, there is strong disagreement on how these processes operate and on the nature of their impact on various places. In this paper, a critical evaluation of two dominant lines of thought, the autonomous or semiautonomous development thesis and the transfer-of-surplus-development thesis, is presented, A third approach, based on the notion of the geographical transfer of value, an attempt to use the labor theory of value in geographical terms, is also introduced. This view is further elaborated by focusing first on the articulation of production and circulation, second on state and local state intervention in this articulation, and third on the contradiction between equalization and differentiation. Throughout the paper, a special emphasis is given to the determinant role of class struggle and to the absence of any ‘iron laws of motion of capitalism’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The dynamism of US federalism has been the object of considerable scrutiny among scholars in recent years as federal aid to states and localities increased dramatically. Among the various forms of aid that emerged over the past decade were block grants designed to give greater autonomy to local decisionmakers. However, it is possible to undermine that process goal by aggressive federal administration of the funds. In this paper, the question posed is: ‘whose policy preferences—national or community—have the greater effect’? Data from the field network evaluation study of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by the Brookings Institution for the period 1974–1980 are used to examine local decisionmaking during the Ford and Carter administrations. Analysis of the decisionmaking process indicates the domination of local, as opposed to national, actors over the content of local CDBG programs. Findings concerning program choices and beneficiaries show the exercise of considerable local autonomy, at the same time that localities are responding to the preferences of the national government. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the future of community development processes and programs, given the preference of the Reagan Administration for greater local flexibility. </jats:p>",

In addition, supply and demand imbalances are treated simultaneously. Last, a model for handling steady state supply–demand equilibrium is developed, which includes the effects of delays between customers entering the housing or land markets and finally making a choice. The case of uniform steady state supply is distinguished from that where new supply occurs at discrete intervals. </jats:p>",

The cost of waiting is of more than esoteric interest, impinging on several questions of policy, such as the use of waiting times as indicators in assessing need, the sale of council housing, and the efficiency of a nonprice method of resource allocation. The model predicts the maximum length of time a person will be prepared to wait, given his/her life expectancy in the authority's house, the relative cost to the person of alternative housing, and his/her time-preference rate. Risk preferences are also incorporated to assess the ‘risk premium’: The extra cost a person would sacrifice to be certain of obtaining public housing at a specified time. Estimates of the cost of waiting are derived from the model and also from a questionnaire survey of housing waiting-list applicants in North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough. </jats:p>",

The geographical outlines of the local labor market for animated film workers are described, An attempt is then made to analyze the observed spatial patterns by means of standard gravity-entropy equations, It is demonstrated that there is a trade-off between commuting distances and wage rates in this labor market. The relations between labor turnover, employment, and location are examined, and it is hypothesized that there is a positive correlation between high turnover rates and the geographical agglomeration of employment places. The politico-geographical consequences of these manifold relations are examined. It is indicated that animated film studios are in practice engaging in strategies of the redeployment of production capabilities and this is leading to a marked transformation of the local labor market. In the final section of the paper an attempt is made to distill the lessons of the analysis in terms of a suggested theory of territorial reproduction and transformation. </jats:p>",

Safety issues were of concern to the respective local authority councils and planning departments, the Health and Safety Executive, the developers seeking planning permission, and, in various instances, port authorities, Secretaries of State, and public-interest groups. The assessment of potential risk to the public by each of these main agencies is analysed and evaluated, illustrating key features from a decade which has seen significant changes in the art of risk assessment in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, and related, though rather more modest, changes in practice. </jats:p>",

Additional parameters are introduced to allow for the effects of a third party, considerably extending the scope of application. The model is applied to the electoral voting histories for 1964, 1966, and 1970 of 671 individuals from sixty-seven English constituencies. </jats:p>",

This was so particularly in Wales. This diversity was encouraged on the basis of local performance, rather than on the basis of measured local needs. Was this diversity encouraged to further local ‘autonomy’, or simply to achieve expenditure targets when local authorities were underspending in the central government's view? This thesis raises questions as to the role of consensus between central departments and local authorities, and about the constitutional location of public-housing provision in Britain. </jats:p>",

Empirical results derived from a recently conducted spatially disaggregate consumer-panel survey in Cardiff, the United Kingdom, are reported. These results suggest that store loyalty and brand loyalty are both extremely low. On this basis it is argued that store and brand choice might profitably be regarded as a nested choice process, with store choice preceding brand choice. The application of the Dirichlet model to patterns of multibrand purchasing within individual stores is then discussed. </jats:p>",
