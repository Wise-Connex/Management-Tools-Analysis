      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, possible directions for research concerned with service-sector development in developing countries are given. Two avenues of work are suggested: (1) to analyse the assumptions about market structure which underlie World Bank adjustment programmes and, with that knowledge, to contribute to the design of alternatives to these programmes; and (2) to extend Sen's ‘entitlement approach’ to public service provision, including geographical accessibility as an integral part of the study of entitlements. In these two topics a sociospatial perspective is applied to critical development issues, but the analysis remains focused on the same objects of concern as central-place theory and location-allocation models—wholesaling and retailing activities. It is argued that service development planning needs to be wider in scope than this. By using an analysis by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, some broader directions are suggested. </jats:p>",

The module employs symbolic and numerical analyses at different levels of detail, from fast geometric checks to more time consuming force and friction analyses, depending on the completeness of the machining plan. In this paper we focus on the approaches used for analyzing fixture kinematics and clamping forces, including the analysis of friction. Since many fixture arrangements rely on friction to hold a part, the ability to reason about friction is an important component of fixture planning. Limit surfaces in force/moment space are introduced as a convenient formalism to check whether parts will slip and to help in specifying clamping forces.</jats:p>",

The problem can be characterized as a pickup and delivery problem with time windows and node capacities. The constraints on the capacities of the nodes (airfields) limit the rate at which the aircraft can be serviced and the amount of requirements (tonnage of cargo, number of passengers) that can be loaded and unloaded at an airfield per day. The execution planning algorithm described can be used daily to modify the existing airlift operations plan. An algorithm based on the insertion heuristic was selected for implementation due to its computational feasibility and its capability to absorb complex constraints arising in the execution planning problem. The insertion heuristic has the additional desirable feature of keeping intact as much of the existing schedule as possible. </jats:p>",

The leaders of Blue Cross and their allies used the hospital planning process in the city and the state as a means to extend and protect corporate authority in what they took to be the public interest. When Blue Cross was established in the 1930s, its leaders used the mechanisms of formal planning as part of their solution to pressing problems in the organization and distribution of hospital services. In the decade after World War II, Blue Cross had an immense impact on hospital planning in New York as a result of its growth and its underwriting policies. Conflicts between Blue Cross and state regulators beginning in the 1950s led to a new formulation of the politics of planning. Blue Cross became a partner with the state in regulating hospitals. The state and Blue Cross behaved as co-regulators until the 1980s. The interpretation in this paper revises the earlier accounts of health politics in New York by Law (1976) and Alford (1975).</jats:p>",

Discovered in 1969, the Kuparuk reservoir contained an estimated 5 billion bbl of original oil in place(OOIP) with estimated recoverable reserves of nominally 1.6 billion bbl.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The reservoir is made up of two distinct sandstone members within the Kuparuk River formation, a Lower Cretaceous, shallow, marine-shelf sanddeposit. The members are separated by a major unconformity, and two units arerecognized within each member. As Fig. 2 shows, the lower member contains Units A and B (informally named), with reservoir-quality sands present primarily in Unit A. The upper present primarily in Unit A. The upper member contains Units C and D, with reservoirquality sands present only in Unit C. Fig. 3 illustratesthe lateral extent of the Kuparuk sands. The A sand extends over the entirefield; the C sand covers a smaller area.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Fig. 4 shows the dominant structural aspects of the Kuparuk sands. The Kuparuk interval forms a gently dipping anticline ranging in depth from 6,500to 8,500 ft across the structure. The trapping mechanism is a combination ofstratigraphic pinchout, erosional truncation, structural closure, pinchout, erosional truncation, structural closure, and a water/oil contact. Thereservoir is highly faulted by normal faults with up to several hundred feet ofthrow, which has a significant impact on flow unit continuity and fluidmovement. The predominant north/south fault trend density is nominally 3faults/sq mile. Faulting occurred during different depositional periods of the Kuparuk sands, influencing the character of the sand accumulations. Faultingoccurred primarily postdepositional to the A sand and postdepositional to the Asand and syndepositional with the C sand. Consequently, faulting frequency andpatterns are dissimilar for the two sand bodies.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The Kuparuk sands are fairly thin, averaging 50 to 100 ft of grossthickness, but laterally extensive, covering roughly 200 sq miles. The C sandcontains several highly permeable, very prolific, interbedded zones permeable, very prolific, interbedded zones having an average permeability thickness of5,000 md-ft. Reservoir quality of the C sand, expressed by the distribution ofreservoir properties, is highly influenced by diagenesis and indirectly relatedto depositional facies. The A sand is characterized by sheet-like sandstonebodies interbedded with shales and mudstones. The A sand reservoir quality iscontrolled by depositional environment, and this sand, with its averagepermeability thickness of 1,000 md-ft, is permeability thickness of 1,000md-ft, is much less productive than the C sand.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 974</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Potential uses of 2 arm robot path planning include terrestrial and space based construction, and general movement of objects. The U.S. space station will most likely be built using robots so that humans do not have to be put into space regularly at great expense and risk. Control of robots from Earth via telerobotics is not practical because the robots will be so far away that there is a delay in the signals due to the great distance between the robots and the controllers and the fact that the signals are limited by the speed of light. The robot arms could also be controlled remotely from space, but only one at a time could be controlled and thus many people would need to be sent up to control all of the robots. One pair of robot arms can replace one human to manually build a structure. However, there would not be any savings in the number of humans sent into space because each pair of robot arms would require a human operator in space. Thus the robot arms should be autonomous or at least semi-autonomous to reduce the number of humans required in space for construction of the space station.</jats:p>",

First, it is found that irrespective of what type of strategy is followed to improve environmental quality, both output and consumption decline as does household utility. Hence, there is a quantifiable trade-off between economic activity (economic growth) and the quality of the environment. Beyond this, the aggregate loss in production and economic welfare (measured by consumption expenditures and utility) is less under a policy which stresses reliance on alternative fuels (brought about by taxation) than through one that requires the installation of pollution-abatement devices (that is, regulation). </jats:p>",

The free space is represented by a set of binary strings. These strings are manipulated through Boolean algebra to yield the largest convex areas in which the gripper can move without colliding with any obstacles. The largest convex areas then become the nodes of two networks (one for each of the orthogonal orientations of the gripper), the arcs of which indicate the possible gripper paths and roll locations. Based on these networks, a search procedure can produce the shortest path from a start to a target position.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Sculptured surfaces often appear in mechanical parts of various industrial products as external form or the functional surface and are commonly found in molds and dies. In this study a sculptured surface is defined by a Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURB) surface that provides the flexibility and freedom for surface description. The work proposed here includes the evaluation of machining information, decision for machining process sequence selection, automatic cutter selection, and cutter path generation. Machining information is first evaluated by using series of hunting planes, calculating the geometric shape and constraints of the machining cavity. A decision on the process sequence is made based on the evaluated machining information. The cutter size is automatically determined by considering geometric constraints, the maximum material removal rate in roughing process and the minimum cutter movement with the required accuracy in finishing process. The roughing process is done by some pocketing procedures that consider arbitrary shaped pockets with islands on the cutting planes. Cutter movement and cutter selection are optimized by considering machining conditions on adjacent cutting planes. An integrated system called CASCAM has been developed to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article we consider the problem of task-directed information gathering. We first develop a decision-theo retic model of task-directed sensing in which sensors are modeled as noise-contaminated, uncertain measurement systems, and sensing tasks are inodeled by a transforma tion describing the type of information required by the task, a utility function describing sensitivity to error, and a cost function describing time or resource constraints on the system. </jats:p><jats:p> This description allows us to develop a standard condi tional Bayes decision-making model where the value of information, or payoff, of an estimate is defined as the average utility (the expected value of some function of decision or estimation error) relative to the current proba bility distribution and the best estimate is that which max imizes payoff. The optimal sensor viewing strategy is that which maximizes the net payoff (decision value minus observation costs) of the final estimate. The advantage of this solution is generality—it does not assume a particular sensing modality or sensing task. However, solutions to this updating problem do not exist in closed form. This motivates the development of an approximation to the optimal solution based on a grid-based implementation of Bayes' theorem. </jats:p><jats:p> We describe this algorithm, analyze its error properties. and indicate how it can be made robust to errors in the description of sensors and discrepancies between geomet ric models and sensed objects. We also present the results of this fusion technique applied to several different infor mation gathering tasks in simulated situations and in a distributed sensing system we have constructed. </jats:p>",

Three questions are examined. First, the extent to which migration rates within and from London differ by tenure and their links to differences in the socioeconomic composition of tenures; second, the extent to which different tenure structures are associated with different migration patterns; and third the relationship between patterns of tenure origins and destinations. It is argued that geographical differences in housing tenure structures play an important part in influencing migration flows, and that changes in tenure structure may influence migration. </jats:p>",

Two questions are explored: (1) What is the extent of disaster evacuation planning? and (2) What factors account for the variation in these planning initiatives? Data were collected in three communities with large tourist industries through interviews with 65 owners or managers of tourist oriented firms. While a limited degree of planning has occurred, the overall portrait indicated serious shortfalls. Although individual and community characteristics were relevant, organizational qualities accounted for most of the variation in disaster evacuation planning. </jats:p>",

We use an approach based on known facts about the manipulator geometry and physical constraints coupled with heuristics to generate physically attainable joint solutions from the inverse kinematics. The conditions that cause solution degeneracy will be demonstrated to be related to singularity conditions, and allowable solutions will be selected based on physical constraints of the joints.</jats:p>",

Few have incorporated the effect of an induced change in consumption spending as a consequence of different levels of income. In this paper an approach is proposed which is more comprehensive than those previously employed. A flexible approach which allows for adjustment in production technology in response to an altered climatic regime is incorporated. Also explicitly incorporated in the analysis are households, in order to capture induced changes in consumption spending. With use of this approach, impacts of hypothesized climatic change are much more pronounced than those produced in previous studies in which less comprehensive methods of analysis were used. </jats:p>",
