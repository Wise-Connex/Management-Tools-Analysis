Indices of reproductive input (three ends, three means, and three conditions) and of conventional reproductive output (such as the mean number of unintended births) are derived from these observations. The outputs are expressed as deterministic equations in terms of the inputs; this permits the study of the structure of fertility determination. The model provides a parsimonious description of the sources of change in fertility and an instrument of possible use in policy.</jats:p>",

This is believed to be an interesting result in itself, as it shows how the programming approach can unify different strands of research in this field. Moreover the mathematical-programming tools allow a deep analysis of the properties of the solution points, which can be difficult with other methods. Also the interpretation of facility location as an optimization problem not only gives theoretical support to some well-known location algorithms but also shows how to generalize and improve them. </jats:p>",

The importance of the results is that the data and the structure of the two planning problems come from real organizations—a cooperative slaughterhouse and a forecast model for Danish agriculture. Thus conclusions based on using a price-directive and a budget-directive planning method to simulate decentralized planning in these organizations have relevance to the potential value of using such methods in real organizations. The main conclusions concern the importance of and the difficulties in finding good starting strategies for the two methods and the impact of the organizational structure on the rate of improvement for the methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Strongly asymmetrical spatial flows are analyzed by using as example the flows of news between major Canadian cities. Conceptually such flows can be modelled by combining a vertical dimension of dominance with two spatial dimensions. The conceptual model is interpreted mathematically by appropriate use of the attraction and emissivity terms in the spatial interaction model. A family of models is identified and calibrated using the Canadian data, allowing the positions of cities on the dominance dimension to be identified. By inverting the model it is possible to scale positions in the spatial dimensions to reflect interaction more correctly. The result is a three-dimensional image which gives a ‘fuzzy’ interpretation to the conventional topological tree model of a hierarchy. Relationships with Tobler's ‘winds' model are examined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Location—allocation models jointly specify the optimal locations of service facilities and the allocation of patrons to them. Almost without exception, the allocation rule employed in these models has assumed that patrons wish to use the facility at the least travel cost away from them. Spatial interaction theory suggests that a person's travel behaviour is influenced by many other factors, among them differential facility attractiveness and uncertainty about travel costs, and that the least-cost allocation rule is unrealistic. This paper presents a location—allocation model employing an entropy-maximizing interaction model to allocate patrons to facilities. A heuristic solution procedure is proposed and found to be effective and reasonably efficient for small problems. Insofar as travel behaviour in the system is suboptimal, the location—allocation model produces suboptimal solutions. In the interests of providing realistic solutions to real-world problems, however, it is essential that planners accommodate the behaviour of those they plan for, be it normative or not. </jats:p>",

Normal seasonal changes in storage are compared with those of 1975–76 and conditions during this period compared with previous droughts. Problems that arose in the summer of 1976 are considered together with the measures taken by water authorities to overcome local shortages. The implications of the shortages are considered in relation to methods of determining and defining the reliability of supplies. Criteria for planning the future development of water resources are discussed in the light of conclusions drawn from the 1975–76 drought and in relation to general planning considerations. There is no basic shortage of water and the extent of restrictions which may have to be applied during drought events is largely determined by the price the consumer is prepared to pay for the safeguard of additional capacity and assured supply.</jats:p>",

In some planning situations, such as the design of new towns, all activities can be initially manipulated under very few constraints, and a large number of alternative plans are possible. The generation and selection of the ‘best’ plan is further complicated when we consider the interrelationships between the locational activities. This paper proposes a multistage planning approach capable of producing and selecting ‘best’ allocation plans. The structural features of the model are discussed and an optimization procedure is presented. The latter combines the exchange-elements allocation technique with the Newton-penalty-function optimization method. The model's proficiency as a planning tool is examined by use of data drawn from a real-world case study. </jats:p>",
