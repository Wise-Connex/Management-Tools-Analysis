The relationship is much weaker than hypothesised, however, which implies that transport accounts for only a small fraction of distance costs. Further analyses point to the importance of factors associated with the particular plants concerned, such as size of firm or regularity of demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dr Clark has presented an excellent review of the theory of the step drawdown test and its applications. The purpose of this communication is to comment on the use of the recovery portion of a step drawdown test to calculate aquifer transmissivity. The Theis method may be applied if the variable discharge rate is replaced by the average of the pumping rates. This average may be expressed as:</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>where Q̄ = mean pumping rate, V = total volume pumped, t = total pumping time.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Equation (1) is equivalent to Clark's formulation. Although it is a useful working approximation, more accurate results would be obtained if Q̄ were calculated by weighting each discharge rate by the time elapsed since that rate began. Sternberg (1967) has described such a method which can be modified slightly to determine transmissivity from the recovery portion of a step drawdown test. The transmissivity T, of an infinite, confined aquifer is shown to be:</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            where t\n            <jats:sub>e</jats:sub>\n            = 2{t-(ʃ10Q(γ)γ dγ /V)}, γ = time from start of pumping to time t, ť = time since pumping stopped, Q\n            <jats:sub>e</jats:sub>\n            = V/t,\n            <jats:sub>e</jats:sub>\n            , Q(γ) = variable pumping rate, sW' = residual drawdown in the pumped well (replacing the residual drawdown at any point radially distant r from the well in Sternberg's derivation).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            For short step drawdown tests with steps of equal length, t\n            <jats:sub>c</jats:sub>\n            may be approximated by: where n = number of steps, Δt = length of each step, t\n            <jats:sub>e</jats:sub>\n            = time intervals since pumping started, Q\n            <jats:sub>ti</jats:sub>\n            +\n            <jats:sub>ti+1</jats:sub>\n            =\n          </jats:p>",

To begin, we discuss the model structure of a generalized network (GN) and provide a brief survey of applications which have been modeled as GN problems. Next we explain a somewhat newer modeling technique in which generalized networks form a major, but not the only, component of the model. </jats:p><jats:p> The later sections give a technical exposition of the design and analysis of computer solution techniques for large-scale GN problems. They contain a study of GN solution strategies within the framework of specializations of the primal simplex method. We identify an efficient solution procedure derived from an integrated system of start, pivot, and degeneracy rules. The resulting computer code is shown, on large problems, to be at least 50 times more efficient than the LP system, APEX III. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with the problems arising from the changing temporal perspective that accompanies the execution of extended plans. In particular it raises the question of the intertemporal consistency of a sequence of decisions, each consisting of the implementation of the early stages of an extended plan, when the passage of time leaves the underlying objective of the decisionmaker unchanged but nevertheless leads to revisions of the plans. The paper contains a discussion of the possibility of achieving intertemporal consistency in various ways: Through the prior commitment of actions (that is, the deliberate foreclosing of future options); through modifications in the procedure for discounting the future; and through the adoption of a dynamic-programming approach to the problem (that is, the construction of the plan by starting with the final element and successively choosing each previous element in the light of the subsequent sequence). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The simple cash balance problem is to determine the timing, direction, and magnitude of transfers between a firm's earning asset (e.g., bonds) and cash balance. Recently, Blackburn and Eppen developed a forward algorithm and limited planning horizon results for a dynamic, deterministic, discrete-time version of this problem. They were able to obtain planning horizons only if an optimal plan for some subproblem included conversion of bonds to cash in the final period and a certain condition on demand was fulfilled. We derive much more general planning horizon results—the transaction is allowed to be conversion of cash to bonds, it need not be in the final period, and the special condition on demand need not be fulfilled. The methodology used is an extension of that developed by Lundin and Morton for the ordinary dynamic lot-size model. Under mild restrictions the planning-horizon procedures derived here can also be shown to be “protective”; that is, any occurring planning horizon will eventually be detected. </jats:p>",

A number of underlying issues that affect the day-to-day exercise of health planning are considered, including the contest between state and local and federal government for program control, jurisdictional conflict between state and local planning agencies, and the unsettled roles to be played by professional planners, consumers, and providers. When we assess regulatory policy in health, these complicating factors must be added to the long list of handicaps that already exist. One important finding is that local planning agencies have embraced the task of health regulation somewhat more fully than had generally been expected. A number of explanations for this are offered. In short, the controlling factors in health planning are political, not technical, and there is more occurring at the state and local levels than many had predicted, although any impact is not likely to be dramatic.</jats:p>",

The strongest commitment to decentralization comes from residents most dissatisfied with current service delivery and from a small but politically active segment of the public.

More recently, multivariate statistical techniques have been utilized to classify land areas into groups with similar suitability for urban development. A test was made of one of these numerical taxonomic techniques on a data set from Medford Township, New Jersey, and the results analyzed in terms of the pros and cons of these methods. A group of 484 forty-acre grid cells with forty-two environmental variables was collapsed into a ten variable set for ten groups of grid cells having like characteristics. The analysis involved two steps, factor analysis followed by a euclidean-distance-classification algorithm. The results show that numerical taxonomy can greatly facilitate the analysis of large environmental data sets and can help to identify the ecological relationships in quantitative terms. However, the complexity of the statistical methods involved greatly limits the wide application of these techniques, and the use of numerical taxonomic results in land-capability evaluation cannot release the researcher from making many judgmental decisions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results are presented of the first phase of a research project on the application of spatial modeling techniques to the process of planning and executing the construction of a nuclear power plant. A computer modeling technique, based on sets of polyhedra and spatial operations, was developed and applied to modeling the components of a nuclear power plant. The objectives of the modeling are: to store and retrieve information about the various systems in the facility; to produce drawings of those systems from any angle in differing amounts of detail; to aid in the search for interference among the parts of the plant by identifying those elements that occupy the same space or are too close to each other; to calculate information such as surface area, length, and volume of selected elements of the plant; and to aid in finding the optimum construction sequence by simulated construction of selected areas of the plant. Computer techniques are described for inputting information by digitizing directly from engineering drawings, for editing the spatial model, for management of the spatial and non-spatial data, and for graphic output from the model. The software is implemented on the University's central time-sharing computer system and on a mini-computer system in the Architectural Research Laboratory.</jats:p>",
