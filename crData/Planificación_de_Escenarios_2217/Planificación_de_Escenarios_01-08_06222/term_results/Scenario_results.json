      "abstract": "<jats:p>Widespread orogenic gold deposits are hosted by practically all rock types over the range of metamorphic grades in the Archaean Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. They are normally located in second- or third-order structures, most commonly near crustal- to regional-scale deformation zones, in brittle, brittle–ductile and ductile deformational environments. Despite this extreme variability, the alteration and geochemical features of these deposits are strikingly consistent.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Each gold deposit is enveloped by an alteration-zoning sequence. In greenschist facies, the alteration zones are, from distal to proximal and according to the diagnostic minerals: calcite–chlorite, calcite–ankerite and sericite. In amphibolite facies, two zones are normally detected, a distal biotite and a proximal calc-silicate zone with no intermediate zone.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            The ores are enriched in Ag, As, Au, Ba, CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            , K, Rb, S, Sb, Si, Te and W, and depleted in Na and Y relative to host-rocks. Base metals, Fe, Mg and Mn are rarely mobile in these settings. From the available, albeit limited, database there is little correlation between rock type or metamorphic grade and the elements enriched in the gold deposit. All enriched components may form primary dispersion haloes around the deposits. Parameters that most consistently define dispersion haloes for those deposits studied in the Yilgarn Craton are As, Au, Sb, Te, W, and the carbonation and sericitization indices. In nearly all cases, at least one of the parameters defines an anomaly significantly more extensive than that defined by Au alone. In some cases, Se or Y anomalies also extend beyond the Au anomaly. Importantly, there is also at least one pathfinder element whose primary dispersion extends beyond the alteration halo based on mineral assemblages, whereas the alteration–index anomalies normally do not extend beyond these limits. The primary geochemical dispersion halo may extend laterally for &gt;200 m, and along strike for a few kilometres, from the gold orebody.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>A single geochemical parameter rarely defines an extensive and consistent vector towards gold ore. However, useful directional information can be achieved when trends defined by several geochemical parameters are combined.</jats:p>",

The findings indicated that concerns for family or family members evoked a purely collectivist behaviour. Compelling and urgent personal needs and goals in conflict with the interests of family or friends led to a mix of individualist and collectivist behaviour and intentions. Individualist behaviour intended to serve collectivist interests was the third most frequently opted choice. Respondents' education had a significant effect and other background variables had indeterminate effects on the choice of either purely collectivist or a mix of collectivist and individualist behaviour and intentions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental control measures (ventilation, high‐efficiency particulate air filtration, and upper room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation [UVGI]) are recommended to effectively control tuberculosis (TB) transmission from unsuspected TB patients in high‐risk settings, but the effectiveness of their use is not often clear. This study presents a simulation model for a hypothetical hospital waiting room, in which the number of susceptible immunocompetent people in the waiting room follows a Poisson distribution (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>= 5) in either low (annual number of TB patients = 5) or high TB risk settings (annual number of TB patients = 50), and used the model to evaluate the reduction of TB transmission risk by upper room UVGI. An exponential dose‐response model was used for TB transmission and a two‐zone model was used for evaluating the effect of upper room UVGI. Upper room UVGI reduced TB risk by 1.6‐fold at 3 μW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> UV irradiance in the upper room in the low TB risk setting and by 4.1‐fold at 15 μW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> UV irradiance in the upper room in the high TB risk setting. Use of upper room UVGI also reduced the mean annual new infection rate from 2.2 to 1.3 infections per year at 3 μW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and to 0.6 infections per year at 15 μW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in our hypothetical high‐risk settings. The effect of upper room UVGI was sensitive to both vertical air velocity (air mixing) and UV irradiance level. Results from partitioning variability indicate that most variability of TB transmission risk came from waiting time in our hypothetical hospital.</jats:p>",
