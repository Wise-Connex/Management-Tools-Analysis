      "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence and development of any profession are closely tied to concerns about the education and training of those who are to be identifiable as professionals. The planning profession is no exception. Thus, greater importance has been attached throughout its history in the United Kingdom to the need for planning education to adapt to the changing demands of the profession which it is seen to serve and, at intervals, there have been calls for quite a different education agenda to be developed to reflect the changing nature of planning in practice. In the late 1990s, there were calls once more for such changes to be made as the role of the planning profession in the 21st century was perceived as being quite different from that of the preceding decades. Within this context, in this paper I draw on the findings of focus groups held with recent graduates of planning education and senior practitioners in the planning field from both the public and the private sector. These findings suggest that, although the calls for planning education to change in line with the changing role of the planning professional are strong, there is in fact a great deal of uncertainty over what this role is at the present time and what it is likely to be in the future. I therefore call for those responsible for the delivery of planning education not simply to take at face value the current demands for change, but to explore the source of these demands in more depth and to uncover the confusion which currently exists over the future of the planning profession. I conclude that, although the perceived role of the planner remains in a state of flux, it is the role of the providers of planning education not simply to fit the planners to the task but to play a part in shaping that task itself. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents GRT, a domain-independent heuristic    planning system for STRIPS worlds. GRT solves problems in two    phases. In the pre-processing phase, it estimates the distance between    each fact and the goals of the problem, in a backward direction. Then,    in the search phase, these estimates are used in order to further    estimate the distance between each intermediate state and the goals,    guiding so the search process in a forward direction and on a    best-first basis. The paper presents the benefits from the adoption of    opposite directions between the preprocessing and the search phases,    discusses some difficulties that arise in the pre-processing phase and    introduces techniques to cope with them. Moreover, it presents several    methods of improving the efficiency of the heuristic, by enriching the    representation and by reducing the size of the problem. Finally, a    method of overcoming local optimal states, based on domain axioms, is    proposed. According to it, difficult problems are decomposed into    easier sub-problems that have to be solved sequentially. The    performance results from various domains, including those of the    recent planning competitions, show that GRT is among the fastest    planners.</jats:p>"

As a consequence, most research interest in public environments focuses on behavior in relation to those characteristics. For example, there is a substantial body of descriptive and typological studies of pedestrian environments. Metric, geometric, and topological models have proved useful in characterizing density and direction of movement. The need to understand the mechanism of choice has prompted microscale and laboratory-based research on exploratory spatial behavior within walking districts. Studies of behavior in relation to comfort, the way in which images of places impinge on choices, and how dynamic and serial experience of the city affects individual itineraries have all developed as specialized fields of understanding. In general, studies of pedestrian environment dynamics have both diversified and multiplied as its systems and methodologies are adapted for planning other environments. </jats:p>",

Changes are deduced from a set of polygon distributions of different times, and represented by a directed graph. Three viewpoints for representing individual changes are proposed: topology, size, and direction. They are described qualitatively, and used for exploratory analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of changes. In addition to individual changes, their sequences are analyzed through classification, visualization, and calculation of summary statistics. The method proposed is applied to the analysis of changes in market areas of a convenience-store chain in Tokyo, Japan. The empirical study reveals the spatial structure of changes in a global scale. </jats:p>",

This article examines the substantial recent literature of takings, emphasizing the role played by the United States Supreme Court, which has developed a fairly complex view on takings. In addition to Supreme Court matters, the bibliography also reviews state takings issues, questions of policy, and legislative action. </jats:p>",

I contend that many empirical studies that have examined the relationships between land use and travel patterns have omitted to consider the socioeconomic dimension, leading to simplistic views about land use and travel. I report the results of a study into the relationships between land use, socioeconomic characteristics, and travel patterns by using data from national and local travel surveys in Britain. The results of the study show that the variation in travel patterns often owes more to socioeconomic reasons that to land-use characteristics. However, land-use planning may still have a significant effect on influencing travel patterns. </jats:p>",

The aim is to identify the spatial and visual properties of buildings that have implications, either directly or through their effect on patterns of space use, relevant to the aims of normalizing behaviors while still maintaining control. Spatial configuration, and more conclusively the views from spaces, are critical factors influencing the probabilistic spatial patterning of movement and, through this, of interaction.

It is based on fuzzy logic theory using three different scenarios for temporal simulation, and two techniques for spatial simulation of urban change patterns. The notion of stages in the urban growth is taken into consideration as well as variables describing the speed and the mechanism of change. The simulation results are presented for three study sites from the north shore of the Montreal metropolitan area in Quebec, Canada, covering the period from 1956 to 1986. By comparing the simulation results with aerial photographs of the study area taken in 1958, 1971, 1975, and 1982, the proposed modeling approach is validated. The potential of this approach as a visualization technique is also discussed. </jats:p>",

Although the research suggests that in a number of the cases studied there was a good outcome in the first three areas, there did not appear to be an obvious link between good participation and improvements in environmental quality through implementation of cleanup and restoration activities. </jats:p>",

Four refutable hypotheses relating to the scale of the development, exogenous policies, and internal planning guidelines confronting the planning permission mechanism are tested by using a probit model adapted for the purpose. The data set with 826 individual observations over a period of 24 years from 1975 is part of the first systematically collected and unpublished planning statistics data set for Hong Kong. Although the hypotheses are specific to Hong Kong, they can be easily adapted, where nonaggregate planning statistics are available, to evaluate three general issues: rent seeking, the dependence of planning decisions on announced policies, and the spatial variation in success rates of planning applications. </jats:p>",

The immediate determinants of this growth are well known. Annual rates of natural increase accelerated in the post-independence era, from 2 per cent in 1947 to 3 per cent in the 1960s. The growing rate of natural increase was the direct outcome of reductions in child mortality in the 1950s and 1960s, and of sustained high fertility throughout the post-independence era (Sathar and Casterline 1998).</jats:p>",

Organizational factors that influence development of both learning and community include: the development of leadership within and among faculty; ongoing focus on data‐driven decision making and the creation of venues for dense interpersonal dialogue related to issues of curriculum and instruction. The findings further suggest that the context of instruction and the work of instruction are important factors in sustaining learning and community.</jats:p>",

Female relatives were neither developed nor encouraged as managers, despite frequently acting as mentors and trainers for the selected male successor.

The two territories inherited an adminis trative and governance structure from the colonial period, but they quickly devel oped their own political and economic systems and began to shape their own development plans and programmes. The two wings were bound together by their common religion-Islam-but from the very outset, language and other cultural differences created internal tensions. Nonetheless, East and West Pakistan shared a common social and economic development until 1971, when a political dispute erupted into civil war, leading to the intervention of India and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh in what had been East Pakistan.</jats:p>",

EU language policy does not represent a counterweight to an expansion of English, which constitutes a threat to other languages. Implications are drawn for Danish, the dominant language hitherto, and for foreign and immigrant languages, in Denmark, a country that traditionally has a laissez-faire attitude to language policy. Building on a wealth of research evidence and experience in other countries, an ABC of language policy for Denmark is articulated. It covers an Action plan, links with Business, Consultation, Diversification of languages and ways of learning them, Europeanisation, proper Funding through co-ordination between relevant government departments, Goals that reflect local and global needs, policies that respect the linguistic Human rights of speakers of all languages in Denmark, and resistance to linguistic Imperialism.</jats:p>",

Special considerations, unique to the planning and conduct of clinic-based research, need to be addressed to increase the likelihood that these studies will be completed successfully. The purposes of this perspective are to discuss factors affecting clinic-based research and to offer suggestions for addressing these problems when designing and conducting research studies in a clinical setting. This perspective discusses issues such as patient management, determining the availability of target patient populations, acquiring support from physical therapists and physicians, reporting and managing research-related injury or illness, and modifying or terminating projects. Some of the points made in this perspective are illustrated using examples from the authors' experiences in conducting clinical research.</jats:p>",

The interpretation of apparent changes in policy often becomes more difficult because of the existence of divergent, even conflicting, linguistic practices within the same polity. The introduction of legislation aiming to protect the Greek language in Cyprus in the mid 80s can be interpreted as an activation of the Cypriot state de facto policy in favor of the Greek language, a policy that marks the history of the Greek Cypriot community even before the creation of the Cypriot state. The shift from a laissez faire attitude that prevailed in the years after Independence (1960) toward legal intervention in favor of the Greek language in the mid 1980s cannot be understood without reference to a set of interrelated factors that distinguish this period from previous periods of the history of the Cypriot state.</jats:p>",

Our development strategy included close interaction with CTI's decision makers, a well-structured training program and follow-up, and short response times for releasing new versions of the software. We estimate use of our system increased profits by 13 to 24 percent, depending on the model version applied, an increase of between $3 to $6 million per year. </jats:p>",

Four questions are addressed: (1) What are the current limits of off-the-shelf optimization software implementing the BBA in terms of types and sizes of problems that can be solved within a reasonable time? (2) To what degree can larger problems be solved if the solution tolerance gap is increased from the default 0.01%? (3) How much can solution times be reduced by increasing the tolerance gap? and (4) If the algorithm is stopped at a larger tolerance gap, how large is the true gap likely to be? To address these questions, 2,676 hypothetical, spatially explicit forest management problems with three planning periods and between 50 and 2,500 management units were created and then solved with CPLEX® Version 6.5 to tolerance gaps of 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, or 2%. For forests with immature or regulated age–class distributions, the predicted average solution time to a tolerance gap of 0.01% was 7.6 and 17.4 min, respectively, for problems with 2,500 management units—the largest problems solved in this study. For overmature and old-growth forest problems, predicted average solution times to a 0.01% tolerance gap reached 4 hr at about 640 and 213 management units, respectively. Increasing the tolerance gap to 1% increased these limits to 1,420 and 235 units, respectively. Increasing the tolerance gap to 1% reduced solution times by at least 90% in 49% of the overmature forest cases and in 53% of the old-growth forest cases. In overmature and old-growth forest problems, the true gap averaged 0.28% and 0.41%, respectively, when the reported gap was 1%. For. Sci. 47(3):403–418.</jats:p>",

Experiments in deliberative democracy often rely for their representative legitimacy on appeals to the presence of members of different groups. However, they often do so without clear sources of authorisation and accountability from those represented. The representation of nonhumans and future generations in deliberative institutions is still more problematic. In the necessary absence of their authorisation, accountability, and presence, claims to speak on their behalf relies on epistemic claims, coupled with care. To highlight these problems is not to claim that small deliberative institutions are illegitimate but rather to point out the need for a clearer account of their role in democratic institutions and the proper sources of contestability of their outcomes. </jats:p>",

South Africa is fascinating for those interested in matters of language because it is characterized by elements of both the ‘developed’ and the ‘developing’ worlds, and thus, to some extent, provides us with a microcosm of the broader international issues related to language. In the years since the 1994 election, South Africa has begun seriously and thoughtfully to address many of the challenges related to language and language policy that will face virtually all societies in the next century. Its experiences in this regard are both telling and significant, and have far broader implications for other societies. This article provides a brief discussion of the historical use of language policy and language planning in the South African context, and explores recent developments in South Africa with respect to language policy. Finally, it identifies and discusses possible lessons for efforts to promote linguistic diversity in multilingual settings.</jats:p>",

The collision-free path-planning is based on a new representation of the obstacles in the velocity space. The obstacles in the influence \nzone are mapped as linear constraints into the velocity space of the robot, forming a convex subset that represents the velocities that the robot can use without collision with the \nobjects. The planner is composed by two modules, termed “<jats:italic>reaching \nthe goal</jats:italic>” and “<jats:italic>boundary following</jats:italic>”. The major advantages of this method are the very short calculation time and a continuous stable behavior of the velocities.

I risultati dei test mostrano chiaramente che all’inizio dell’anno scolastico entrambi i gruppi erano allo stesso livello sia per quanto riguarda le risposte “linguistiche” sia per quanto riguarda quelle “metalinguistiche” del test. Il test, infatti, richiede sia risposte linguistiche che metalinguistiche, in altre parole si devono dare le giustificazioni per le risposte linguistiche indicate. Questi risultati sono in linea con i risultati di ricerche precedenti sugli effetti propedeutici dell’esperanto e sottolineano i potenziali vantaggi dell’educazione bilingue per tutti i bambini.

The author uses some singular instances of mobile phone conversations to provide an answer as to why this geolinguistic feature has emerged. In an examination of two real cases and a vignette, some light is shed on a more classical spatial topic, that of mobility. During the opening and closing statements of the paper a short critique is put forward of the ‘professionalisation’ of cultural studies and cultural geography and their ways of theorising ordinary activities. It is argued that a concern with theory construction effectively distances such workers from everyday affairs where ordinary actors understand in practical terms and account competently for what is going on in their worlds. This practical understanding is inherent in the intricacies of a conversational ‘ordering’, which is at one and the same time also an ordering of the times and spaces of these worlds. By means of an indifferent approach to the ‘grand theories’ of culture, some detailed understandings of social practices are offered via the alternatives of ethnomethodological and conversational investigations. </jats:p>",

After determination of initial radiosurgery treatment parameters, a guided evolutionary simulated annealing (GESA) algorithm is used to find the optimal size, position, and weight for each shot. The three‐dimensional GESA algorithm searches the shot parameter space more thoroughly than is possible during manual shot packing and provides one plan that is suitable to the treatment criteria of the attending neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist.

This work presents the results of our research in the last 4 years at the Institute for Process Control and Robotics at the University of Karlsruhe. The path planning approach we present works in an implicit and discretized C‐space. Collisions are detected in the Cartesian workspace by a hierarchical distance computation. The method is based on the A* search algorithm and needs no essential off‐line computation. A new optimal discretization method leads to smaller search spaces, thus speeding up the planning. For a further acceleration, the search was parallelized. With a static load distribution good speedups can be achieved. By extending the algorithm to a bidirectional search, the planner is able to automatically select the easier search direction. The new dynamic switching of start and goal leads finally to the multi‐goal path planning, which is able to compute a collision‐free path between a set of goal poses (e.g., spot welding points) while minimizing the total path length. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The origins of that paper are traced through the life stories—the ‘lives told‘—of the two authors. In particular, I try to connect the specific life trajectories of Berry and Garrison up until 1958 with the wider social and cultural contexts in which they lived. The theoretical impetus for the study are three literatures: the first is science studies, and especially the work of Bruno Latour and his ideas of ‘black boxing’ and ‘translation’; the second is on the history and sociology of quantification; and the third is on biography, particularly scientific biography. The broader argument of the paper is that the seemingly disembodied numbers, calculations, and precisely drawn figures and graphs that increasingly inflect human geography from the late 1950s, and found in such papers as Berry and Garrison's, are socially embedded, a consequence not of a universal rationality but of specific lives and times that infuse the very substance of the works produced. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In an attempt to solve some serious economic and environmental problems, the Netherlands has embarked on an unique experiment over the past few decades. Based on a tradition of cooperation, consensus building, and democratic self-rule, the Dutch have revitalized a corporatist approach to economic and environmental planning. They refer to the polder model to describe the particular characteristics of this approach. Although the polder model is rooted in the past (i.e., the Golden Age of the 17th-century Dutch Republic), its more recent application in planning efforts finds its start with the Wassenaar Accord in economic planning in 1982. A similar approach was used in environmental planning with the introduction of the first National Environmental Policy Plan in 1989. The key feature of the environmental plan is a covenant between business and government. In this article, the author compares the application of the polder model in both areas and concludes that there are serious challenges ahead for its survival. The article attempts to assess whether the model would work in the United States and why the approach used by the Dutch is the favored approach of Environmental Protection Agency chief Christie Whitman. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Survey techniques such as contingent valuation have been used extensively by environmental economists to develop an understanding of consumer preferences for environmental goods. On the basis of such techniques, recommendations have been formulated in relation to environmental policy. However, the exposure of weaknesses in this method has led economists to look to other information-gathering approaches which might enhance, and/or complement, environmental valuation. One such approach is that of ‘citizens’ juries' (CJs). A CJ consists of a small group of people, selected to represent the general public rather than any interest group or sector, which meets to deliberate upon a policy question. This approach may complement traditional approaches to data gathering on public preferences for environmental goods and services by addressing some of the concerns that have been voiced regarding existing methods. First, CJs may be useful in tackling the problem of information provision, and concerns relating to the level of understanding of the respondent. Second, CJs may be a means of addressing the ‘citizen value versus consumer value’ argument in environmental valuation. Third, CJs may help researchers understand how participants construct their values. Fourth, this approach allows sustainability issues to be addressed explicitly. The authors also discuss a number of problems associated with CJs and conclude with examples from two recent juries on environmental issues which were held in Scotland, and make recommendations on how environmental economists might utilise this tool. </jats:p>",

In this paper we draw on these theoretical discussions in an attempt to interrogate the dynamics of competitiveness. We report on research to develop indicators to explore the relationship between sources (the initial stock of assets in a city) and outcomes of competitiveness (the result of attempts to exploit these assets by firms) across a sample of urban areas. We argue that urban asset bases provide a strong predictor of competitive performance in English cities, but that this general pattern is interrupted by some cities for which competitive outcomes are stronger or weaker than might be expected in light of underlying asset bases. The study findings provide some tentative methodological suggestions, augmenting the limited volume of empirically focused work regarding the means by which different aspects of the contested concept of competitiveness might best be measured. The findings also illustrate the differing competitive fortunes of major English cities and provide pointers with regard to priorities for policymakers in moulding and managing urban asset bases. </jats:p>",

The current phase of branch-network rationalisation in the financial sector in Europe and North America is argued in the academic literature to be the inevitable consequence of the growth of electronic and telemediated forms of delivery of financial services. In the British building society sector, despite some evidence of branch closure as the use of the Internet and telephone call centres in the delivery of financial services has grown, the picture that emerges is of a dynamic branch network that is responding to changing customer demands and new technological possibilities. Face-to-face advice and discussions between customers and trained ‘experts’ remain an important part of the mortgage transaction. In the savings market, where products have become more commodified, telephone call centres and, more recently, the Internet have become more prominent, but institutions still rely heavily on the branch network to deliver services. The authors suggest that, although there have been changes in the relative importance of different distribution channels as sources of business in the financial sector, it is wrong to view these changes in terms of a simple branch-versus-direct dichotomy. A more complex picture is presented, with most institutions adopting a multichannel approach to the delivery of financial services, and electronic forms of delivery of financial services being developed as an additional delivery channel alongside the branch. </jats:p>",

Some of these methodological challenges include the complex nature of human subjects and interventions, including many factors that interfere with the study variables.

Today, with the majority of Koreans now living in cities—a dramatic shift in the last two generations—many still travel to patrilineal ancestral villages to carry out the necessary annual rites in family graveyards established long ago. However, an official campaign to encourage cremation in Seoul was initiated in 1998. A small, space-saving family tomb has been designed to hold the ashes of up to twenty-four family members, and is being promoted at public cemeteries. Fieldwork was carried out into deathscapes in the vicinity of Seoul in late 1999. The paper describes small family graveyards, including one established generations ago and two that have been newly established. It also describes different types of columbaria, two of which employ the traditional dome shape of Korean graves. Discussion focuses on the persistent cultural significance of maintaining ties with patrilineal places of origin. We suggest that this is a valued Confucian dimension of Korean heritage; many are seeking manageable ways to incorporate this dimension in their predominantly urban time – space commitments. From family graveyard to columbarium, there is a progressive divorce from ancestral territory (the family graveyard in the patrilineal village) and from social context (lineage). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper puts forward the idea that the religious practices of the members of the Caribbean diaspora in the United Kingdom provide a space where an alternative vision of social issues evolves in response to the pressures experienced in British society. Based on the views of Lefebvre and De Certeau, I propose that the religious experience be seen as the appropriation of a symbolic place where identity is freed from the weight of social conventions. Contrary to the dual construction of identity imposed by the reality of segregated British cities, religious space allows for the conception of an intercultural sociality, an ‘open identity’, unhindered by the weight of the specific characteristics of particularisms of the different groups. This approach to the religious experience allows me to intervene in current intellectual debates. Geographically speaking, it is a question of showing how the idea of space is necessary in the formulation of identities, as well as the role played by space in the relationship between ‘power and resistance’. More generally, it is an examination of the notion of diaspora, showing how, when coupled with the idea of hybridity, this intellectual discourse can be framed empirically. </jats:p>",

We demonstrate that women's dress producers adopted varying strategies to cope with competitive pressure at different time periods and in different places. In the 1960s, the dress industry was characterized by two main trends: technological change and domestic relocation of plants from the US northeast to the southeast and west. From the 1970s onwards, organizational changes became increasingly important as firms in core dress-production states such as California and New York externalized growing volumes of labor-intensive work. In part, the value added of this contribution to debates about industrial restructuring lies in our use of plant-level data that allow a richer understanding of the dynamics of industrial competition. </jats:p>",

In particular, the paper shows how microsimulation modelling can be employed to shed new light on the local impacts of major national policy changes such as taxes, regulations, government consumption, unemployment benefits, job seekers', and housing allowances, etc. Microsimulation modelling provides the possibility of defining the desired effects of economic and social policy, the instruments employed, and also the structural changes of those affected by socioeconomic policy measures. This paper builds on traditional economic microsimulation frameworks by adding a geographical dimension. More specifically, we seek to model national social policy impacts at a microspatial scale. First, spatial microsimulation modelling is used to synthesise a household micropopulation geographical database for an entire city. This micropopulation database has a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic attributes that are relevant to national social and economic policies and which play a major role in the determination of eligibility of households for various benefits and allowances. GIS software is used to identify the size and spatial location of particular groups such as the unskilled, low-waged, and undereducated. Finally, we explore potential social policies and demonstrate how microsimulation modelling can be used to perform what-if social policy analysis at the small-area level. </jats:p>",

Theoretically rigorous approaches may prove to be too narrowly defined and so unsuitable because they neglect the requirements of practical implementation. Yet pragmatism which flaunts theoretical understanding lacks analytical power and can mislead policy. How economic methods, such as contingent valuation, compare with those from political science, such as citizens' juries, is an open question which we attempt to address. In addition, the new hybrid approach of deliberative monetary valuation is critically reviewed. A comparison of these approaches is made which draws out the difficulties of developing practical policy tools which are theoretically grounded and avoid political manipulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores debates over the statistical picturing of the nation's finite forest resources in the Progressive-era United States. This picturing was made possible by a variety of new quantitative and graphical practices that made maps and statistics appear as objective evidence of the natural limits those objects appeared to exhibit. Drawing on the work of Timothy Mitchell, I argue that this appearance was generated through more generalized practices of enframing. Enframing involved the systematic ordering of objects to create the appearance of a world metaphysically divided in two and graspable in terms of the distinction between reality and the objective representations through which reality as such was made to appear. This binary ordering, or enframing, of appearance created the appearance of order itself as an apparently abstract framework within which the objects so enframed could be more closely regulated. Enframing the forest quantitatively transformed heterogeneous forests into an apparently calculable quantity available to new disciplinary forms of state power that Foucault argues are characteristic of modern governmentality. The timber-famine debate also highlights the question of trust and the dependence of expert authority on traditional gender and class differences, which were themselves reworked through the quantifying practices of scientific forest conservation. </jats:p>",

This paper challenges that view by examining in detail the work of George Udny Yule. Yule was a colleague of Karl Pearson in the 1890s, but was interested in social science and social policy applications, not eugenics. In the late 1890s he constructed both the theory and application of multiple regression analysis, using geographical data. The paper examines Yule's work and its context, relating it to debates on the history of statistics, and traces the subsequent early diffusion of regression and correlation into the social sciences. The paper concludes by arguing for greater recognition of Yule's pivotal role, and also for further studies on the history of quantitative social science. </jats:p>",

These arguments assume the declining ability of elected members to represent increasingly diverse constituencies in a period of rapid change, and a sense of powerlessness among citizens in the face of distant economic and political forces. There have been few attempts to review the available empirical evidence on whether deliberative and inclusionary processes lead to ‘better’ decisions. For the United Kingdom, evidence is limited, except in the land-use planning field, and we argue that in present circumstances their primary role should be to stimulate wider civil engagement as a means of restoring trust. ‘Better’ decisions will then follow. However, barriers to their acceptance remain, not least in the need to create sufficient incentive for citizens to participate and in the requirement that established economic and political interests devote sufficient resources for them to be effective. </jats:p>",

A critical issue for urban CA simulation is how to determine parameter values and define model structures. The simulation of real cities involves the use of many variables and parameters. The calibration of CA models is very difficult when there is a large set of parameters. In the proposed model, most of the parameter values for CA simulation are automatically determined by the training of artificial neural networks. The parameter values from the training are then imported into the CA model which is also based on the algorithm of neural networks. With the use of neural networks, users do not need to provide detailed transition rules which are difficult to define. The study shows that the model has better accuracy than traditional CA models in the simulation of nonlinear complex urban systems. </jats:p>",

A decoupled planning approach has been used; that is, the problem has been decomposed into two subproblems: path planning, where a collision‐free path is found for each robot independently only considering fixed obstacles, and trajectory planning, where the paths are timed and synchronized to avoid collisions with other robots. This article focuses on the second problem. The proposed plan can easily be implemented by programs written in most industrial robot programming languages. The generated programs minimize the total motion time of the robots along their paths. The method does not require accurate dynamic models of the robots and uses an evolutionary algorithm followed by a local search which produces near optimal solutions with a relatively small computational cost. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

Data was collected through semi‐structured interviews with 57 hospitalized patients, 39 nurses and 11 occupational therapists. On the basis of the data patients were categorized as (a) ‘relinquishers’, (b) ‘participants’ and (c) ‘occasional participants’. Professionals were categorized as ‘information providers’ and ‘rehabilitation practitioners’. The strategies used by the professionals to encourage patient participation were approximately the same irrespective of patient category. It is suggested that professionals need to be sensitive to the patient's desire to participate in the planning of a rehabilitation programme. Further research is recommended to investigate circumstances affecting patients' participation and which strategies professionals can use to encourage their participation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent controversy over genetically modified (GM) foods amply demonstrates the general difficulties encountered in the social appraisal of technological risk. Existing procedures for regulatory appraisal neglect many possible forms of impact and routinely exclude important cultural and social dimensions of risk. A narrow, expert, ‘science-based’ approach is now widely acknowledged to be insufficient. There is a need for new approaches that are more broadly based, transparent, pluralistic and ready to acknowledge uncertainty as well as being practically feasible and robust. The authors investigate the potential for a novel ‘multicriteria mapping’ (MCM) method as one such possible tool. Drawing on a variety of perspectives in the current UK debate, a range of agricultural strategies for the production of oilseed rape, including both GM and non-GM options were explored in this MCM pilot exercise. The results demonstrate the general feasibility and positive potential of this type of approach, with specific findings providing modest insights for policymaking in this difficult area. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the role of geographic location in the financial and innovation performance of publicly traded companies in the US pharmaceutical industry. Regional production clusters are identified and mapped. Particular attention is given to Porter's work on competitive advantage (the diamond paradigm) (Porter, 1990 The Competitive Advantage of Nations). Several metrics of business performance at the company level are collated with local factor conditions, the relative presence of related or supporting industries, and the degree of interfirm rivalry within production clusters (among other things). Our main hypothesis is that company performance responds positively to the location-specific assets identified by Porter. We explore this hypothesis using a series of t-tests and regression models based on secondary data. The empirical results lend partial support to Porter's model. Specifically, the data show that companies located within major clusters exhibit stronger financial performance than their counterparts located elsewhere. Cluster membership is also found to play a positive role in product innovation (as measured by patent counts). Overall, the data show that different metrics of company performance are influenced by different combinations of strategic and locational variables. </jats:p>",

Brood size was significantly correlated with host size; larger hosts were allocated larger broods. Brood sex ratios were fixed precisely at 1 male per 4 females, and eggs were likely to be deposited in that order; differential mortality did not contribute to this precise sex ratio. The sex allocation strategy of <jats:italic>P. pyralophagus</jats:italic> is likely to conform to strict, i.e. single foundress, local mate competition. Adoption of this strategy is probably influenced by a limited insemination capacity of males; a smaller proportion of females (0.09 vs. 0.21) remained virgin in broods with precise or higher sex ratios (≥0.20 males) relative to broods with lower than precise sex ratios (&lt; 0.20 males). Moreover, all females were inseminated in most broods (60%) with precise or higher sex ratios, whereas this did not occur in broods with lower than precise sex ratios. The hypothesized occurrence of strict local mate competition in <jats:italic>P. pyralophagus</jats:italic> was supported also by observations that: (i) offspring brood sex ratios were independent of maternal brood sex ratios and number of parental females concurrently allocating offspring to a group of hosts, and; (ii) the rate of superparasitism under no-choice conditions was low (~20%), suggesting that rates of outbreeding in the field are low. Other results suggested that fitness in <jats:italic>P. pyralophagus</jats:italic>was correlated with adult size; longevity and reproductive capacity both increased with adult size in males and females. However, adult size may be more important for females than for males because the differences in reproductive capacity between the largest and smallest individuals was up to 7.3 times greater in females versus &lt;2 times in males.</jats:p>",

Benefits from using path modelling include the ability to model direct and indirect relationships between process variables and to convert the calculated coefficients into a process state matrix that can be used in process simulation. By identifying critical process variables, a correlation matrix can be constructed and used as input for library procedures incorporated in off-the-shelf statistical analysis software. The system equations may be inverted and solved for the unknown inputs as a function of desired outputs on the basis of the inverted state matrix. The results are indicative of the degree of control and improvement required to avoid intractable process problems and can be used to specify and select new process technology. </jats:p>",
