      "abstract": "<jats:p> Portland, Oregon, has attracted continuing attention for its achievements in planning, urban design, and growth management, and for its participatory approach to this work. It has stopped freeways, rebuilt its downtown, resurrected neighborhoods, built public transit, designed urban villages, and drawn urban growth boundaries. More than that, over the course of more than three decades, it has built an extensive and powerful structure of planning for neighborhoods, downtown, the city, and the metropolitan region. This article examines in detail two episodes in this process—the Northwest District Plan (1969-77) and the Southwest Community Plan (1994-2001)—as a means of demonstrating how this structure is actually the cultural product of the concerted mobilization of meaning through the use of language in planning, organizing, democratizing, and institutionalizing these practices. To suggest that language has structural power is to recast the arguments about the character and status of ostensible structural determinants of action. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A conflict between the preservation of the character of existing historic towns and “change” has formed the central argument for conservation. More recently, heritage has superseded conservation, where marketing of heritage as a product according to the demands of the consumer, mainly tourists, has resulted in the commercialisation of heritage over conservation values. Today, the symbiosis of both tourism and heritage places has become a major objective in the management and planning of historic areas. This article examines the current conflicts among the ideas of conservation, heritage, and tourism and argues for a sustainable approach to the management and planning of heritage places based on a community and culture-led agenda. </jats:p>",

He condemned usury, finance capital, large corporations, metropolitan growth, and modernist architecture, and he advocated family-owned businesses, state enterprises, small cities, and “traditional” styles. After Hitler came to power, Feder worked in government, but he was marginalized in 1934 and appointed professor of planning at the Berlin Institute of Technology. There, he wrote Die neue Stadt ( The New City), a major book published in 1939 but largely ignored in Germany—in wartime because it criticized big business and afterward because Feder was a leading Nazi. The book blends fascist, modernist, antiurban, and geopolitical visions to propose the construction of many new traditional cities of twenty thousand in supposedly sparsely populated eastern lands. It shows how innocuous planning ideas may be appropriated for sinister purposes of conquest and social engineering. </jats:p>",

Enhancing the quality of life, by restraining urban sprawl, is seen as essential to urban competitiveness in the information age. However, the literature that examines the synergies between information technologies and urban form does not only point to potential reconcentration of certain economic activities but also to the furtherance of exurban development, sociospatial segregation, and traffic gridlock. This bibliography presents a panoramic shot of this vast and growing literature, as seen through the lenses of two theorizing traditions. It also the-matically classifies it according to four areas associated with (1) new forms of urban development; (2) economic, spatial, and travel synergies; (3) accessibility issues in spatial science; and (4) planning policy.</jats:p>",

In the book, urban practitioners and scholars from fields as diverse as American studies, English, geography, history, planning, and criminal justice reflect critically on the traditional exclusionary power of storytelling and on its potential to facilitate the transformations of imagination, theory, and practice necessary to create sustainable, democratic American cities. The book begins with an editors' introduction identifying story, sustainable U.S. cities, and democracy as the three key themes. Part I advances and refines these concepts, connects them to contemporary U.S. urban planning, and provides tools that can be used when reading and interpreting the texts in part II. Part II exemplifies, amplifies, and modifies the key themes and arguments through the presentation of eight texts: theoretical and experiential, academic and nonacademic, expository and narrative, and familiar and unfamiliar. The combined focus on story and urban sustainability makes this book a unique contribution to planning literature.</jats:p>",

The methodology includes a literature review and five in‐depth interviews with individuals who played an active role in the planning process. The results indicate that as far as the overall planning process is concerned, there has been: a lack of communication between the three levels of hierarchy within SOCOG 2000 (senior management, contingency planning project team and venue teams); a limited involvement of the venue management in the process in all levels; a poor follow up regarding the evaluation and the documentation of the contingency plans made; and a considerable inadequacy in terms of “real life” exercises that would enable the venue teams’ personnel to practice what has been planned.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Beta‐ray emitting Ru‐106/Rh‐106 ophthalmic applicators have been used for close to 4 decades in the treatment of choroidal melanoma. The form factor of these applicators is a spherically concave silver bowl with an inner radius of curvature between 12 and 14 mm, and a total shell thickness of 1 mm. The radioactive nuclide is deposited in a layer 0.1 mm below the concave surface of the applicator. Calculation of dose distributions for clinical treatment planning purposes is complicated by the concave nature of the distributed source, the asymmetric shape of the active region of some applicators, imperfections in the manufacturing process which can result in an inhomogeneous distribution of activity across the active surface, and absorption and scatter in the 0.1 mm layer of silver which seals and protects the radioactive layer. A semi‐empirical method of calculating dose distributions for these applicators is described which is fundamentally compatible with treatment planning systems that use the AAPM TG43 brachytherapy formalism. Dose to water is estimated by summing a “patch source” dose function over a discrete number of overlapping patches uniformly distributed over the active surface of the applicator. The patch source dose function differs conceptually from a point source dose function in that it is intended to represent the macroscopic behavior of a small, disk‐like region of the applicator. The patch source dose function includes an anisotropy term to account for angular variation in absorption and scatter as particles traverse the 0.1 mm silver window. It geometrically models the nearfield of a patch with properties akin to both a small disk and infinite plane, and models the farfield as if the patch were a point. This allows a manageable number of discrete patches (300 to 1000) to provide accuracy appropriate for clinical treatment planning. This approach has the advantages of using familiar concepts and data structures, it is computationally quick, and it readily adapts to asymmetric applicator shapes and inhomogeneities in the radionuclide distribution. A method for optimizing the patch source dose function parameters is presented, and the dosimetric calculations are compared with published Monte Carlo calculations and measurements.</jats:p>",

The background discussion aims to give beginning teachers a sense of the recent history of the teaching of foreign languages in North America and the theoretical foundation of the communicative approach to foreign language teaching. The article also provides practical guidelines for the design of daily lesson plans that integrate culturally contextualized accuracy and fluency activities (for a broad range of skills and in a range of modes) with strategy‐based instruction for the communicative curriculum.</jats:p>",

In this paper I explore some of those meanings and goals through the use of interviews with women who work in nonprofit, community-based organizations that support human and social services. The focus is on the ways in which the women frame the concept of community and the ways in which these may be part of a strategy to create political and material spaces for caring, empowerment, and justice. </jats:p>",

The method proposes a two step algorithm for estimating object position on the image plane and then mapping into space to find required angular values of the manipulator joints. Tests were carried with a computational routine to estimate position on the image plane of a set of different fruits under natural light conditions. Finally the method was tested using a robotic arm and similarly structured objects. Hardware and software implementation of the present method is of low cost when compared to current commercial technology, and operational results are promising but dependent on environmental illumination control and camera calibration accuracy. The methodology is intended to be applied in the automatic classification of fruits.</jats:p>",

Informed by critical political theories of care, and recent work on the geographies of public and private spheres, I explore one set of consequences of the spatial shift towards home death in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Terminal hospice care done in the home creates an especially paradoxical home space. By blurring public–private boundaries, hospice care produces a political geography of home interpretable through four spatial paradoxes: a normative paradox of home being a good and bad place to die, a territorial paradox of control itself changing the home, a constitutive paradox between heart and welfare politics, and a relational paradox between autonomy and dependency. The implications for political and health geography, as well as political theory and hospice work itself are discussed as a consequence of recognizing these spatial paradoxes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1990s the UK temporary staffing industry experienced almost unbroken year-on-year growth. Alongside this quantitative expansion the type of business performed by some UK temporary staffing agencies has begun to change, as some larger agencies have attempted to move out of the clerical and light industrial segments and into higher value-added markets. Other agencies have sought to add human resource services to their more-traditional recruitment and placement functions. All in all, the UK industry—the second largest in the world after the United States—has undergone widespread restructuring in the last decade. I argue that the recent growth in the UK industry constitutes a regularisation of flexible employment, as casual and fixed-term contracts are replaced by more formal arrangements involving a third party—the temporary staffing agency. Drawing upon global and national data and forty semi-structured interviews with agency owners and managers in the United Kingdom, I analyse the multidimensional growth and restructuring of the UK temporary staffing industry. I argue that as the UK industry ‘matures’ we are witnessing a degree of deepening in relations between temporary staffing agencies and client firms. More broadly, I argue that the growth of the temporary staffing industry has conceptual implications for how economic geographers theorise ‘the firm’ and explore the globalisation of service activities. </jats:p>",

Predictive models are derived to describe the influence of fabric construction. Empirical models, based on a statistical technique (a three-factor analysis) that shows much better agreement with real values according to ideal mathematical models that include some simplifying assumptions, were first developed. While woven fabrics made from staple yarns are much more heterogeneous in terms of the size, shape and orientation of its macropores compared to fabrics made from mono- or multifilament yarns, the results were not good enough. The next stage of our research was to use another modelling tool (genetic programming) to more precisely predict the macropore area of woven fabrics. This work is focused on the engineering of staple cotton fabrics in a grey state in terms of the area of the macropore.</jats:p>",

This paper suggests that this is not a good rehabilitation procedure. The main purposes of rehabilitation are to achieve the maximum physical, psychological, social and vocational wellbeing of each individual and to enable people to return to their own, most appropriate environment. We do not engage in rehabilitation in order to help people achieve better scores on tests. This might be acceptable if there were a direct relationship between test scores and real life problems but there is not such a relationship. Although tests are useful in providing a picture of strengths and weaknesses, they are extremely limited in identifying everyday disabilities and handicaps. People can lead improved lives by compensating for or by-passing some of their cognitive problems yet remain unchanged on test scores. Conversely, they can improve on test scores yet remain severely handicapped in everyday life. One approach that is gaining ground in rehabilitation is goal planning. This allows patients/clients, their relatives and rehabilitation staff to negotiate appropriate and meaningful goals, determine how these should be achieved and measure success, or failure in real life situations. Goal planning both reduces the artificial distinction between rehabilitation practice and outcome measures, and allows the integration of theory and practice. The processes and procedures involved in goal planning are described and followed by an evaluative discussion.</jats:p>",

With reference to welfare-to-work reform in Britain and, the United States, I examine liberal feminist and neoliberal policy discourses on women, work, and welfare. The rationale underlying these discourses is argued to effect an erasure of meaning and feeling from conceptions of care, with serious consequences for the caring choices of poor working-class mothers. The potential of a nonreductive feminist ethics of care, to oppose the work-centric notion of welfare promoted in prevailing approaches to reform, is considered. Ethical thinking is shown to promote an expanded concept of welfare based on caring interrelations and interdependencies, and a way of seeing the emotional geographies of welfare reform. I conclude by arguing the need for labour politics to engage with the emotional geographies of welfare reform. </jats:p>",

Chronic disease is the major health care cost of the 21st century with the need for long-term care growing rapidly. Medicare was never designed to pay for long-term care and custodial services. The limited scope of Medicare coverage is a problem now and will be a greater problem in the future. Long-term care is a personal responsibility and requires planning ahead.

We consider the recent history of the environmental justice debate in Britain, Europe, and the USA and, in the light of this, estimate how one aspect of air pollution, nitrogen dioxide (NO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) levels, affects different population groups differentially across Britain. We also estimate the extent to which people living in each community in Britain contribute towards this pollution, with the aid of information on the characteristics of the vehicles they own. We find that, although community NO <jats:sub>x</jats:sub> emission and ambient NO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration are strongly related, the communities that have access to fewest cars tend to suffer from the highest levels of air pollution, whereas those in which car ownership is greatest enjoy the cleanest air. Pollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate. Those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain. There is therefore evidence of environmental injustice in the distribution and production of poor air quality in Britain. However, the spatial distribution of those who produce and receive most of that pollution have to be considered simultaneously to see this injustice clearly. </jats:p>",

In both countries, demographic change coupled with economic growth has increased demand for housing units and in the UK, over 4 million new units are estimated to be needed by 2016. Given these pressures, the interaction of the planning system and the housing market is critical. The articles reviewed below mainly adopt a mainstream economics approach to modelling the impact of planning on housing markets. They are concerned with outcomes. An additional or alternative approach is provided by behavioural analyses of the relationship between planning and housing development. These enable the more complex interactions to come to light. This paper indicates the differences that exist between the UK and US planning approaches; however, in both countries, planning constraints are seen to raise price, reduce supply, increase density and, in the UK at least, reduce choice. However, planning is also seen to provide certainty and reduce risk. Of key interest is the price elasticity of supply of housing. Post-war estimates suggest a value for the long-run elasticity to be between 0 and 1 for the UK, and 6 to 13 for the US. </jats:p>",

Two phantoms containing objects were imaged using CT under a variety of motion conditions. The effects of object motion on axial CT acquisition with and without gating were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Measurements of effective slice width and position for the CT scans were made. Mutual information image fusion was adapted for use as a quantitative measure of object deformation in CT images. IMRT plans were generated on the CT scans of the moving and gated object images. These plans were delivered with motion, with and without gating, and the delivery error between the moving deliveries and a nonmoving delivery was assessed using a scalable vector‐based index. Motion during CT acquisition produces motion artifact, object deformation, and object mispositioning, which can be substantially reduced with gating. Objects that vary in cross section in the direction of motion exhibit the most deformation in CT images. Mutual information provides a useful quantitative estimate of object deformation. The delivery of IMRT in the presence of target motion significantly alters the delivered dose distribution in relation to the planned distribution. The utilization of gating for IMRT treatment, including imaging, planning, and delivery, significantly reduces the errors introduced by object motion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present an approach to decoupled force/position control of the end-effector along the same direction for redundant robots, and an approach to nonholonomic cart pushing with mobile manipulators. The mobile manipulator is considered as a redundant robot, and a unified dynamic model for an integrated mobile platform and on-board manipulator is developed. The dynamic model is decoupled and linearized using the nonlinear feedback technique in a unified frame. Combining the event-based planning and control method with singularity analysis of the robot arm, a task level action controller is designed and an online kinematic redundancy resolution scheme is developed. The system is stable during normal operation as well as at the occurrence of unexpected obstacles. In addition, explicit force/position control along the same task direction for redundant robots is proposed. The kinematic redundancy of mobile manipulators enables independent control of force and position along the same task directions. To verify the decoupled force/postion scheme, an integrated task planning and control approach is further proposed for the mobile manipulator to complete complicated tasks by regulating its output force. A cart pushing task, which requires both force and position control along the same task direction, is discussed. The cart manipulation task fully integrates trajectory and force planning of the cart, and planning and control of the mobile manipulators. The approaches have been tested on a mobile manipulator consisting of a Nomadic XR4000 and a Puma 560 robot arm. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for the mobile manipulation of a nonholonomic cart. </jats:p>",

In a number of influential studies, these psychological therapies have been described as self-oriented, narcissistic, and intensely individualistic. However, these commentaries fail to consider the specificity of particular practices. Counselling, for example, is a situated practice, shaped by particular contexts and values. The views of people just beginning a counselling training programme can be read as describing the practice as a relational means to individualistic ends. However, analysis of their stories about themselves suggests more complex understandings of self as shaped and reshaped in relation to others and as illustrating the feminist concept of relational autonomy. Their accounts suggest that counselling offers the promise of a practice through which both practitioners' selves and clients' selves may be reshaped and resituated. </jats:p>",

Although tests of the concept have produced varied results, sites selected to address indicator groups can include a high proportion of other species. We tested the hypothesis that species at risk of extinction are not likely to be included in sites selected to protect indicator groups. Using a reserve‐selection approach, we compared the ability of seven indicator groups—freshwater fish, birds, mammals, freshwater mussels, reptiles, amphibians, and at‐risk species of those six taxa—to provide protection for other species in general and at‐risk species in particular in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States. Although sites selected with single taxonomic indicator groups provided protection for between 61% and 82% of all other species, no taxonomic group provided protection for more than 58% of all other at‐risk species. The failure to cover at‐risk species is likely linked to their rarity. By examining the relationship between a species' probability of coverage by each indicator group and the extent of its geographic range within the study area, we found that species with more restricted ranges were less likely to be protected than more widespread species. Furthermore, we found that although sites selected with indicator groups composed primarily of terrestrial species ( birds and mammals ) included relatively high percentages of those species ( 82–85% ) they included smaller percentages of strictly aquatic species (27–55%). Finally, of both importance and possible utility, we found that at‐risk species themselves performed well as an indicator group, covering an average of 84% of all other species.</jats:p>",

Further user‐specified information is used to determine how the end‐effector orientation angle should vary along the specified curve. The proposed trajectory‐planning methodology is embodied in a computer‐algorithm (OCAS), which outputs <jats:italic>continuous</jats:italic> graphs for positions, velocities and accelerations in the time‐domain. If a varying end‐effector orientation angle is specified, the OCAS‐algorithm also generates <jats:italic>continuous</jats:italic> orientation angle, orientation angular velocity and orientation angular acceleration curves in the time‐domain. The trajectory‐planning capabilities of the OCAS‐algorithm are tested for cases where the prescribed nodal points lie along curves defined by analytically known non‐linear functions, as well as for nodal points specified along a non‐analytical (free‐form) test‐curve. The proposed trajectory‐planner may be implemented as part of kinematic and kinetic simulation software, and it also has the potential application for controlling machine tools in cutting along free‐form curves.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent US welfare-form initiatives affecting employment and housing assistance have promoted more flexible applications of assistance as well as devolving the responsibility of care for the poor from federal levels to the individual. Implicit in these policy changes is the assumption that individuals enter labor and housing markets where open access is the norm and a ‘level playing field’ exists. In this paper, we use the analogy of seeing labor and housing markets as public spaces to analyze how the ideals of democratic capitalism in labor and housing markets exist normatively, but are always violated in practice. We argue that the influence of neoliberalism, and the devolution of welfare responsibility to the individual in particular, have led to policy changes that neglect issues of unequal access connected to hierarchies of race and gender and their spatial manifestations. Welfare reform in the specific areas of employment and housing assistance has promoted the primacy of private markets as essential components to ensuring social welfare. These reforms have super-ficially opened more options to recipients of public assistance while simultaneously allowing to continue the instruments, institutions, and structural forces that constrain practical access to the full range of jobs and housing. We argue that efforts to maintain these markets have not been distributed to measures ensuring fair play of participants. As a consequence, some problematic contradictions between policy and practice call into question the suitability of the private market as a strategy of providing welfare for the poor. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1980s was a significant decade in the demography of Inner London. Population increase replaced decades of decline, and household numbers grew even faster. One-person households accounted for most of the growth in household numbers, and the greatest increase was among younger and middle-aged adults. The authors examine the characteristics and changing geography of one-person households in Inner London, particularly between 1981 and 1991, within the context of broader demographic and socioeconomic changes during the decade. In particular, the characteristics of those people who migrated to live alone in Inner london are examined, and questions raised about the relationship between household changes, residential mobility, occupational structures, and housing markets. Reference is also made to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets to explain some of the processes underlying household change. One-person households are an integral part of wider economic and social processes underway in large urban areas and form a leading edge of new ways of urban living. </jats:p>",

The authors address this type of problem in relation to the dispersion of aircraft noise near airports. The approach involved brings together two basic components. First, two spatial models are presented. These are developed from existing concepts in location theory and modelling, but the authors attempt to overcome some of the limitations of previous models. Second, a geographical information system is used to obtain a better representation of the spatiotemporal processes involved in the dispersion of aircraft noise and to evaluate the functions of the two models. A case study is used to illustrate the methodology and helps to indicate how this approach could facilitate improved spatial decisionmaking. </jats:p>",

Minimal differences or “gaps” between customers perceptions of quality and the abilities of service providers to meet these expectations lead to increased profits. Tourists' perceptions are gleaned from surveys of international Japanese and German travelers conducted by national tourism associations. The host region's perceptions of these markets are drawn from survey responses of tourism and planning professionals working in the Cowichan Region in British Columbia, Canada. While there are some notable gaps between the two study groups, overall, the differences in tourism expectations and perceptions between these groups are minor. Based on this research, the potential for using a modified gap analysis in tourism planning is recommended for attention. </jats:p>",
