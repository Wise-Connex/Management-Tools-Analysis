This linkage is shown to provide access to an articulated definition of market demand for labor and provides a basis for analyzing the dynamics of demographic mobility and growth as it applies to phased development planning. Possible conflicts between multiple, economic, and demographic goals are accommodated via a ‘goal-programming’ formulation so that the corresponding dual variables are readily available as opportunity-cost evaluators for deviations from these planning goals. </jats:p>",

The epidemiological situation is constantly changing, and vaccines should be chosen for their suitability for prevailing conditions. When viral antigens undergo appreciable change, and immunity in the population is low, people are especially susceptible to infection with live vaccines made from the new variants. Because of their potential high yield, it is therefore possible at this time to consider the use of these vaccines on a large scale. In interpandemic years, killed vaccines should be used selectively for the protection of individuals, but may also be considered for more general use in closed communities. Vaccines should as far as possible contain the same antigens as the epidemic virus. Reassessment of the influenza situation should be made annually, taking into account the types of viruses in circulation, the immune state of the population and any other factors likely to affect influenza outbreaks. Regular attempts to do this would ultimately improve the standard of forecasting.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Random immunization, as is practised for other virus diseases, is unprofitable in influenza.</jats:p>",

The idea was well received in architectural circles and has passed without serious challenge. In this paper, the value of such analysis is once again emphasized, although some of Alexander's arguments and his conclusions are refuted. Beginning with an exposition of the relationship between the graph theoretical concept of a tree, and the representation of a tree by a family of sets, we present a mathematical definition of a semilattice and discuss the ‘points’ and ‘lines’ of a graph in terms of a city, concluding that it is neither a tree nor a semilattice. This clears the ground for future graphical analysis. It seems that even general structural configurations, such as graphs or digraphs with certain specified properties, will fail to characterize a city, whose complexity, at this stage, may well continue to be understood more readily through negative rather than positive descriptions. </jats:p>",

A national town planning movement developed because many in the housing reform movement became convinced that the servicing of suburban lots could become so much more efficient through preventive planning, that large numbers of families currently doomed to slum conditions would become able to afford sanitary suburban dwellings. The movement manifested itself in such national conferences as the \"First Canadian Housing and Town Planning Conference\" held in Winnipeg in 1912, and the separate meeting of Canadian delegates to the National Conference 2 on City Planning convention held at the University of Toronto in 1914. Soon two national organizations devoted to town planning were formed: the Civic Improvement League of Canada (founded in late 1915) and the Town Planning Institute of Canada (T.P.I.C), begun in 1919. By the 1920fs, town planning consultants such as Horace Seymour, Norman Wilson, A.G. Dalzell, and A.E.K. Bunnell were doing work for cities and towns throughout the country. Moreover, Canadian planners were advocating planning principles which, they believed, might be applied throughout urban Canada. </jats:p>",

The argument is advanced that the relationship is an unfortunate one of dependence; that behavioural research in geography has accepted too easily a philosophy of science and an approach to problem formulation and hypothesis testing which is ‘handed down’ indirectly from the natural sciences; and that this limitation has effectively precluded a whole range of approaches to the study of human spatial behaviour, approaches which could be very fruitful indeed. </jats:p>",

The Act combines several, previously uncoordinated, health planning and health resources development agencies into one coordinated program. The program is to consist of a statutorily restricted federal agency which will generally oversee the operation of the program, a state program directed by a consumer-dominated board and a series of locally based, generally private, nonprofit, consumerdominated corporations (“Health Systems Agencies”) which will carry the bulk of the planning functions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The resource development portion of the act grants funds for a variety of programs. These include both grants and loans (at very favorable interest rates) for medical facilities. In addition there are funds available for innovative projects which hold the prospect of improving health services and environmental conditions within the community.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The act also provides the states and local organizations with substantial power over a large portion of the allocations made under the Public Health Act and specifies the process by which health planning must be carried out. Each local planning agency must design a long range health plan for its community and prepare a one-year plan for carrying out portions of the health system plan. These two documents then are used to create State Health plans, plans for construction, modernization or conversion of health facilities and criteria for judging the appropriateness of health services offered in the local areas and in each state.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The act seems to create a mechanism whereby the health industry could be quickly converted into a heavily regulated industry. This regulatory process could be implemented in conjunction with national health insurance or by itself.</jats:p>",

Both groups received a pretest and a posttest, and the students evaluated the teaching material.
