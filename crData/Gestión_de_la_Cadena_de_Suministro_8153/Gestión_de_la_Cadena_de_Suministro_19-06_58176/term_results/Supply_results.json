      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Many organisations feel uncomfortable with the idea of visibility as a transformative element that will drive supply chain improvements. While the concept of velocity seems to be widely adopted, there are a great number of excuses around why visibility is not possible within their industry, organisation or business function. Part of this hesitancy may have to do with the massive hype cycle that exists today around ‘big data’, ‘digitisation’, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). These terms have proliferated to the point where executives are effectively paralysed, not knowing how to proceed and unsure of how to justify investments due to the lack of any return on investment (ROI). Further, the challenges of data governance and integration are causing many executives to halt in their tracks, as the idea of ‘pumping our bad data through the Internet’ is cause for consternation. For instance, a group of pharma executives had a major discussion and were unsure if good manufacturing practices (GMP) data could be shared, if it had not yet been validated. The challenge for many of these organisations is that there is no clear roadmap for adoption of real-time data transformation. The technology is not the challenge — the real issue has to do with the shift in mindset, change management and governance that exists as data becomes more transparent across multiple tiers of suppliers and customers. The legal implications are also causing uncertainty, as are the ramifications of exposing one’s data in the face of recent cyber security breaches. The issue of exposing one’s data to potential legal issues is also a consideration. Most importantly, executives do not have a clear picture of the shift in skill sets, talent, capabilities and new job roles that will be affected by a broader set of technological shifts towards digitisation and real-time living supply chains. This paper proposes that several key cultural components of an organisation are required to adopt to a digital ecosystem.</jats:p>"

The vision was wide in scope and ranged from our customers to our external supply chains. The key benefits that AGCO planned to achieve with this strategic vision was very clear: to develop a globally integrated supply network that would deliver agility, flexibility, scalability, standardisation, innovation, increasing performance and cost efficiency. The actual results that were realised exceeded AGCO’s expectations in terms of productivity, financial results, performance levels, agility, scalability and global integration. The paper will provide readers with two insights into how AGCO’s internal culture focuses on innovation, from the initial concept through implementation. One element of the paper will provide insight into AGCO’s internal digitalisation with a deep dive into AGCO’s Google Glass utilisation. The second element of the paper will provide insight into AGCO’s connectivity across its global supply network of 3,000+ direct material suppliers, transportation service providers and 54 internal manufacturing sites. The paper will also provide readers with insight into how AGCO was able to generate a ‘pull approach’ to the implementation and roll-out of the new tools, processes, organisational approach and the new way to work. The initiative’s approach essentially created a culture of the manufacturing sites wanting to have the different digitalisation work streams implemented at their respective sites.</jats:p>"

Embracing and implementing a successful stakeholder engagement model requires intentional efforts to share information, remove long-standing silos, align on priorities and align on an execution strategy. Furthermore, planning for future demand through a shared execution strategy poses additional challenges given the complexities of projecting demand and aligning supply plans to marketing strategy and sales goals. This paper presents an overview of the common pain points experienced by supply chain professionals today, along with strategies for transforming supply chains through integrated business planning and the use of advanced technologies. By combining adequate organisational alignment with the power of advanced technologies, the full benefits of integrated business planning can be realised.</jats:p>"

The economic growth and the increasing number of companies annually will bring some impacts on the competitions for many companies in Indonesia, so they have find their competitive advantage. The biggest competitive advantage of Indonesia is in the primary sector companies which is producing consumer goods from natural raw materials and semi-finished goods.  To win the competition, the primary sectors require product standards as the company output by implementing TQM, which usually adopts ISO as the main requirement for exporting their products. This is also the criteria for the research samples. The questionnaires are distributed to 100 companies that have over 100 employees, and the returned questionnaires are 64, with four incomplete questionnaires, making the response rate of 60%. The data analysis is using PLS and proves that all hypotheses are accepted. First, TQM implementation has a positive and significant impact on supply chain integration. Second, TQM implementations in companies are able to create a proper documentation system for each department to facilitate good communication among departments. Third, TQM implementation has a positive impact on supply chain performance and employee satisfaction. Fourth, supply chain integration has a positive impact on employee satisfaction and supply chain performance. Employee satisfaction has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The overall impact of TQM implementation on supply chain performance is 0.4680. TQM implementation brings a positive impact on supply chain integration and supply chain performance, thus increases the total impact of supply chain performance</jats:p>"

Сроки нагула скота в целом определяются не только увеличением живой массы, убойным выходом повышается пищевая ценность мяса, возрастает эффективность производства говядины, что положительно сказывается на рентабельности хозяйства. Поэтому с учетом дефицита отдельных макро и микроэлементов в пастбищной траве в условиях горной местности Дагестана разработана минеральная смесь, состоящую из 21 г мононатрийфосфата, 7 г жженой магнезии, 72 мг сернокислой меди и 2,3 мг йодистого калия, которую задавали бычкам ежедневно в расчете на 1 голову, смешивая её с ячменной дертью. Установлено, что использование этой минеральной смеси в рационе горского скота в горной зоне республики Дагестан позволяет увеличивать среднесуточные приросты за период нагула животных на 16,4. Бычки получавшие минеральную подкормку на горных пастбищах достигали живой массы в 18ти месячном возрасте 306,6 кг, т.е. выше на 11,8 по сравнению с контролем при достоверной разнице (Р0,05).

Terms of feeding livestock as a whole are determined not only by an increase in live weight, the nutritional value of meat increases by its slaughter output, and the efficiency of beef production increases, which has a positive effect on the profitability of the farm. Therefore, taking into account the deficit of individual macro and microelements in pasture grass in the conditions of the mountainous area of Dagestan, a mineral mixture was developed consisting of 21 g of monosodium phosphate, 7 g of burnt magnesia, 72 mg of copper sulphate and 2.3 mg of potassium iodide, which was given daily to calves on 1 head, mixing it with barley dertyu. It has been established that the use of this mineral mixture in the diet of highland cattle in the mountainous zone of the republic of Dagestan allows for an increase in daily average increments over the feeding period by 16.4. Minets fed mineral dressing on mountain pastures reached a body weight at 18 months of age 306.6 kg, i.e. higher by 11.8 compared with the control with a significant difference (P0.05). They also had an advantage in the index of shedness, extension and costiness.</jats:p>",

Basically, this technique is based on splitting the single inline or branched plastic short-section, used in the conventional technique, into a couple of two sub-short-sections made of two distinct plastic material types. Investigations addressed positive and negative surge initiated water hammer events. Additionally, high and low density polyethylene materials were utilized for sub-short-section material. Results illustrated the reliability of the dual technique in protecting hydraulic systems from excessive pressure rise and drop, and evidenced that the (HDPE/LDPE) sub-short-sections' combination (where the former sub-short-section is attached to the sensitive region of the steel piping system parts, while the latter is attached to the second extremity of the steel piping system) is the most prominent configuration providing the best trade-off between pressure surge attenuation, and pressure wave oscillation period spreading. Lastly, it was found that the pressure head peak (or crest) and the pressure wave oscillation period values were markedly sensitive to the (HDPE) sub-short-section length and diameter.</jats:p>",

Trade credit creates a strict relation between suppliers and customers that cannot be easily substituted over time. The linkages established between firms in a supply chain are a key value added for all members that could represent a competitive advantage over independent market players. In the event of a supply chain disruption, all members could suffer from a decrease in profitability and an increase in risk.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper analyses the challenges of understanding supply chain dynamics in a modern context, including rapidly increasing amounts of data and technology and the massively interconnected nature of modern enterprises. The problems and challenges addressed include traditional areas of focus for supply chain practitioners, such as understanding changes in quality, introduction of new sources, and the impact of external events, but in the context of far more rapidly changing and continuously disrupted environments. Additionally, new challenges brought about by the availability of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and other technologies are also considered. Using a basic scientific approach (observing the environment, asking important questions, selecting methodologies, performing empirical analysis including understanding of bias and other factors, and considering recommendations for future research), the approach presents four frames: technology, process, mindset, and people. The interconnectedness of entities, moving from the concept of supply chain to a more inclusive concept of integrated value chain (customers and vendors interacting in complex ways in an ecosystem) are considered. Recommendations are put forth regarding leadership mindset and how to think differently about the convergence of change discussed. Conclusions focus on new ways to think about integrated value chains, where complex relationships are driven as much by need and planning as by disruptive events and the introduction of new disruptive capabilities. The wider implications for leadership in such rapidly changing environments can inform not only how organizations prosper, but also a perspective on the imperative to embrace new methods and mindsets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">There is a lot of excitement around Blockchain in the supply chain but, according to Gartner, we are moving beyond the peak of expectations into the trough of disillusionment. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research to support managers navigating this stage. There is research on use case considerations1 and research that confirms that use cases can contribute to high-level supply chain objectives,2 but what is missing is research on pilot design and implementation considerations. We have been at this crossroad before, however, with other technologies in the supply chain, and lessons learned from earlier efforts to digitise the supply chain might inform decision making. This paper considers the lessons learned in three case studies of Blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Findings reveal that some lessons learned with older technologies apply to Blockchain, including the need to clean up master data and fix processes. There are also clear differences that make Blockchain different. For example, it is actually fairly inexpensive to get started with Blockchain and, provided a targeted scope, the process can move fairly quickly. Additionally, Blockchain can leverage data from existing technologies, rather than replace those technologies. This paper aims to support managerial consideration of Blockchain adoption and to extend research beyond the exploration of use cases with lessons learned about piloting and implementing Blockchain in the supply chain. We do so by extending the Verhoeven et al. framework3 for use case considerations with pilot design considerations and factors to consider when scaling from pilot to larger-scale adoption.</jats:p>"

The regression analysis with interaction effects is used to indicate the network rent, while the PLS path model is applied to investigate the link between manufacturer relational embeddedness, manufacturer influence and supplier-customer relational embeddedness and their subsequent impact on the network rent.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The authors empirically establish that manufacturer relational embeddedness, as a higher-order factor, can comprise both upstream and downstream relational embeddedness. The research also demonstrates that manufacturer relational embeddedness significantly contributes to the manufacturer’s eagerness to form a direct link between the supplier and the customer, and the manufacturers report a significant ability to affect this relationship. Likewise, the study shows that supplier-customer relational embeddedness significantly and positively affects the network rent. In addition, the study implies that supplier-customer relational embeddedness is a mediator between manufacturer influence and the network rent, while manufacturer influence is a suppressor variable, which increases the negative relationship between manufacturer relational embeddedness and supplier-customer relational embeddedness.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research makes three key contributions. First, this study, as one of very few, simultaneously embraces context, intervention, mechanism and outcome, while investigating the role of manufacturer (its relational embeddedness and influence) in promoting supplier-customer relational embeddedness, and its resulting effect on the network rent. Further on, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirically based study that demonstrates to what extent the manufacturer is capable of fostering supplier-customer relational embeddedness, thus favoring the transposition from the intransitive into the transitive triadic supply chains. Finally, to date, the concept of network rent has been mostly conceptualized as the theoretical construct with no empirical evidence. This research offers guidance for manufacturers in managing the relationships between the supplier and the customer to yield the highest network rent.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This study provides a novel approach to investigating the role of manufacturer and relational embeddedness in yielding the network rent in the transitional triadic supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, the sequential closing of all valves may cause a tremendous superposed pressure rise, even larger than the pressure rise under simultaneous valve closure. In this paper, the effects of sequential valve closure on the superposed maximum water hammer pressure rise in a pipeline were investigated. By using the wave superposition principle, a sequential valve closure formula leading to maximum water hammer was proposed and verified using numerical simulation based on a practical project. In addition, the superposed maximum pressure rises in the pipeline were compared under single, simultaneous and sequential valve closure, respectively. The results show that the sequential valve closure formula agrees well with the numerical results and the pressure rise in the pipeline under the sequential closing was the largest. Moreover, compared with the superposed maximum pressure rises at the main pipeline, the effect of sequential valve closure on superposed maximum pressure rise at the branch pipeline is more sensitive.</jats:p>",

These aircraft often make use of secondary airports in outlying areas thus encouraging economic development. Business aviation is, in general, growing throughout the world and also in some African countries, but appears to be subdued in South Africa. The purpose of this research project was to determine the demand characteristics for business aviation aircraft in South Africa.Objectives: The primary research objective was to determine the demand for business aircraft in South Africa, as well as the nature and characteristics of the users and non-users of business aircraft among the top 100 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).Method: A pragmatic research philosophy guided an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design. Findings from face-to-face interviews with aviation experts were utilised to develop the research questionnaire distributed to the top 100 JSE-listed companies.Results: The potential future growth for the business aircraft market is most likely to come from existing users, with marginal growth from new entrants in the market. Perceived costs are major deterrents to the utilisation of business aircraft.Conclusion: The research provides market intelligence necessary to guide business aviation companies to efficiently service or expand the market for business aircraft in South Africa, contributing to the existing knowledge in air transport.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the large number of distributed generation (DG) access to the distribution network, the traditional distribution network with a single-supply radial structure has been transformed into an active distribution system (ADS) with source and bidirectional currents. This transformation makes the calculation of the power supply capacity (PSC) of the ADS face new challenges, and the uncertainty of the DG output increases the difficulty in calculating the PSC. At the same time, the power market transaction check needs to meet the safety constraints of the distribution network operation, and is required to know the PSC information of the ADS more quickly and accurately. Therefore, in order to quickly evaluate the PSC of the ADS, this paper proposes a fast evaluation method of the PSC based on the DG output rolling prediction and the information gap decision theory (IGDT). The method first establishes a rolling prediction model of the DG output, and calculates the PSC of the ADS at the corresponding time. Next, it establishes a risk avoidance model (RAM) and a risk speculation model (RSM) for the PSC of the ADS based on the IGDT. These models further calculate the probability of the range of the PSC at the corresponding time, so as to better evaluate the PSC of the ADS. Finally, the improved IEEE-14 node is used to verify that the model can consider the influence of the DG output uncertainty and quickly calculate the information of PSC.</jats:p>"

The empirical results in the short term show bidirectional causality between deposits and monetary base, as well as between deposits and loans.\r\nHowever, in the end, the central bank in the Republic of Macedonia has an influence on the money supply. The exogenous monetary policies based on money supply control, can positively influence the amount of liquidity held by commercial banks and, hence, increase the supply of loans, but the demand for loans is still important when stimulating the entry of liquidity in the real economy.</jats:p>",

The thermal analysis takes into account the heat conduction and convection of a copper busbar system used to supply a test bench with high currents in order to check the electro-thermal behaviour of power circuit breakers during overload and short circuit conditions. This paper proposes a mathematical model for busbars used within a high current power supply. The obtained thermal model can be used to analyse the thermal behaviour of busbars in steady-state conditions at different values of the electric current, cross-section and length of the busbar. Also, the mathematical model allows to calculate the temperature distribution along the busbar at different values of the contact resistances at junction points with other conductors. There is a good correlation between calculated, simulated and experimental results.</jats:p>"

In the livestock sub-sector, many partnership models have been developed including partnerships in broiler business. In order to improve the welfare of farmers, especially broiler breeders in Bogor regency, good structuring is needed in an effective and efficient supply chain partnership institution. Thus, it can increase farmers' income, and ensure the sustainability of people's livestock business, especially broiler business. This study aims to: 1) Identify institutional supply chain management of broiler businesses; 2) Analyze the performance of supply chain partnership institutional broiler businesses in Bogor regency, West Java province. Primary data is obtained through observation and in-depth interviews (in-depth interviews, while secondary data is obtained from related institutions and literature. Collected data is processed quantitatively and qualitatively descriptive. The results of the study conclude: (1) Broiler breeders, namely: Farmers Mandiri, and partnership breeders, which are divided into partnerships on the basis of verbal agreements and officially partnered farmers in partnership. Independent breeders are those who manage and finance all production input needs needed during the production process and are free to market their products. Partner farmers are farmers who have been bound by cooperation both verbally and in writing with companies supplying DOC, feed, vaccines and medicines, so that these farmers only prepare pens, labor and livestock equipment, because all the needs of DOC, feed and medicine and vaccines have been provided by companies that partner with a. (2) Forms of cooperation in marketing live chicken and meat, namely breeders selling live chickens to traders / brokers who then market to retailers in conventional markets. Marketing in the form of broiler is aimed at consumers (restaurants / restaurants. Independent farmers generally market products through traders), independent farmers are free to market to any collector, while farmers in partnership are obliged to market their products to the core. get higher profits compared to breeders partnering verbally and independently.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper is concerned with the study aimed at the development of methods for emergency control in power systems with distributed generation plants. The control actions enabling the state parameters to meet stability constraints were generated by changing the vector of controlled parameters along a preset path corresponding to the shortest distance from a point of the initial state to a limiting hypersurface. In this case, limit loads equations of the power system were used. The quality of dynamic processes during control actions was ensured by harmonized tuning of the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) and automatic speed regulator (ASR) of distributed synchronous generators. Computeraided modeling was used to demonstrate that the postemergency operating conditions meeting stability constraints can be calculated using limit load equations while using the starting algorithm that enables the values of operating parameters to reach the nearest boundary of the feasibility (stability) region. Modeling of the power system in MATLAB environment demonstrates that the fuzzy algorithms used to control AVR and ASR settings considerably enhance the quality of transient processes of voltage, frequency, and power when the power of distributed generators in postemergency conditions is reduced.</jats:p>",

Although the technical literature has long focused on the correct sizing of air valves to reduce the overpressure generated by the filling of a pipe, the phenomenon is complex and does not seem to be representable by physically based equations in an easy way, to be of practical use for technicians and designers. In this paper, air valve design is approached through an alternative data-modelling approach, based on evolutionary polynomial regression, with the aim to provide symbolic formulas of variable complexity and accuracy, suitable for physical interpretation, and at the same time easy to be used and applied for design purposes. The present investigation suggests a design formula that, given the geometric parameters of the pipeline system where the air valve is installed, provides the maximum tolerable overpressure, thus allowing the optimal air valve orifice size to be identified.</jats:p>",

This district representative study is conducted in a fragile, remote, rural district of Jammu and Kashmir in India with unprecedented geographical barriers and heavy military deployment. Hilly geographical terrain, military skirmishes and sporadic militant attacks, rudimentary/absence of road network and absolute poverty are quintessential to this area.\nMethods: Mixed method approach was employed to triangulate quantitative and qualitative findings. Facility survey at various levels of facilities was conducted to gauge general service availability and service specific availability (depth of coverage). Compendium of checklist was designed using national standards in form of standard core questionnaire and parsimonious indices were computed by coalescing an array of tracer indicators across various domains as proposed in WHO’s Service Availability and Readiness Assesment (SARA) module. Polychoric principal component analysis was used to identify significant variables causing variation in health service delivery and generalized ordinal logistic model was employed to determine factors impacting facility readiness score. Multifarious techniques like observations, key informant interviews and focus group discussions using semi structured questionnaires on both leaders and laggards were administered for critical stakeholder’s analysis to discern qualitative information.\nResults: Results indicated poorest readiness for peripheral rural facilities with a composite score of 41% and 24% for subcenters and new type primary health centers respectively. Availability of basic amenities, diagnostic capacity and preparedness for emergencies and Non Communicable diseases was particularly subjacent having lowest scores. For primary care facilities; principal component was mainly characterized by basic newborn care as well as preparedness for delivery. Degree of environmental vulnerability of facilities, facility type and frequency of monitoring/supervision significantly impacted facility’s readiness. Lack of incentives for health workers in remote and shelling prone areas, unavailability of residential accommodation, absence of motorable roads, political interferences aiding internal adjustments in form of transfer/attachment of health workers, leakages in supply chain of drugs and consumables, reticence of skilled staff in serving militancy impacted areas, nonchalant attitude of policymakers were identified as major barriers for service provisioning.</jats:p>"

Transition effectiveness is used to estimate the ratio of demand and supply of graduates’ labor. Research methods include descriptive and regression analysis.&#x0D;\nStatistical analysis of macro data shows that the number of skilled engineers who obtained degrees in 1990–2000 exceeded the number of engineers exiting the labor force upon reaching the age of retirement during that period. While aggregate supply of engineering workforce was growing during the post-reform era, demand for their labor was shrinking―mostly due to a considerable decline in industrial jobs.&#x0D;\nIt has been established that chances of getting a job, average time that it takes to find one, and the degree of first-job educational and skill match are pretty much the same for young qualified engineers and economists. No statistically significant difference has been observed between their starting salaries, either. Therefore, no evidence has been found to support the hypothesis about a high unmet demand for qualified engineers and surplus of workforce in economics and management. The study demonstrates that the reported shortage of engineers has nothing to do with low aggregate supply. Research findings could be used in the design of academic programs for higher education at national and regional scales.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Renewable energy sources (RES) will play a crucial role in future sustainable energy systems. In scenarios analyzing future energy system designs, a detailed spatial and temporal representation of renewable-based electricity generation is essential. For this, sufficiently representative weather data are required. Most analyses performed in this context use the historical data of either one specific reference year or an aggregation of multiple years. In contrast, this study analyzes the impact of different weather years based on historical weather data from 1980 through 2015 in accordance with the design of an exemplary future energy system. This exemplary energy system consists of on- and offshore wind energy for power-to-hydrogen via electrolysis, including hydrogen pipeline transport for most southwestern European countries. The assumed hydrogen demand for transportation needs represents a hypothetical future market penetration for fuel cell-electric vehicles of 75%. An optimization framework is used in order to evaluate the resulting system design with the objective function of minimizing the total annual cost (TAC) of the system. For each historical weather year, the applied optimization model determines the required capacities and operation of wind power plants, electrolyzers, storage technologies and hydrogen pipelines to meet the assumed future hydrogen demand in a highly spatially- and temporally-detailed manner, as well as the TAC of the system. Following that, the results of every individual year are compared in terms of installed capacities, overall electricity generation and connection to the transmission network, as well as the cost of these components within each region. The results reveal how sensitive the final design of the exemplary system is to the choice of the weather year. For example, the TAC of the system changes by up to 20% across two consecutive weather years. Furthermore, significant variation in the optimization results regarding installed capacities per region with respect to the choice of weather years can be observed.</jats:p>"

It considers fiscal variables such as government expenditure and net tax revenue and evaluates their impact on private consumption and average hours worked per week. Three sample periods were selected and two approaches were used to identify impulse responses, first taking the average of stochastic volatility over the sample period, and then allowing for sign restrictions based on contemporaneous relationships among the selected variables. The study found a negative wealth effect of public spending on private consumption and a positive effect on hours worked, as people tend to work more hours to maintain the same standard of living. Similarly, a tax shock generates negative effects on consumption but the impact on worked hours remains unclear over a three-year time horizon. These findings are almost consistent across sample periods and alternative specifications of impulse responses. This is one of only a few studies to determine the linkages between fiscal policy and the labor market using a macroeconomic framework.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">U.S. Cellular Reverse Logistics has successfully shifted the paradigm of product returns being viewed as the cost of doing business to one that recognises and maximises the value that lies within returned assets. By launching an integrated reverse business planning process, capitalising on the concept of the circular supply chain and building dimensional intelligence to ascertain total cost of return asset acquisition, U.S. Cellular has proven that through building internal intelligence, establishing visibility into its returns ecosystem and optimising its reselling processes and disintermediating its resale supply base, it can improve the velocity of returned assets, maintain optimal in-stock levels of returns for after-sales service demand and maximise asset revenue recovery. The results from executing this dimensional strategy were so significant that the U.S. Cellular C-suite better understands how a sharp focus on the reverse logistics function, within a circular supply chain, generates value by positively impacting the bottom line. This paper is a case study as to how U.S. Cellular’s reverse logistics function evolved far beyond deflection strategies to lessen losses inherent to product returns. The reverse logistics function developed a multi-faceted, cross-functionally supported strategy that delivered end-to-end visibility of returned assets, the ability to plan and, thus, predict returned asset timeliness and volume and a data-driven competency incorporating these factors to accurately calculate cost and value for dispositioning returns. The resulting paradigm changed from returns being a cost of doing business to one that seeks to maximise value in all aspects of the reverse ecosystem.</jats:p>"

The paper critically reviews the results of a previous, survey-based study, with a sample of 198 employees from Slovenian organizations, who assessed utilization of management tools in their organizations. With hierarchical regression analysis authors test the associations between management tools’ usage and enterprises operating in supply chain; the impact was controlled with the most significant personal and organizational drivers of management-tools usage. Results show that loyalty management, core competences, and scenario and contingency planning are most strongly associated with the supply chain management’s activities in organizations. The traditional supply chain management’ tools, like outsourcing, lean production and total quality management, are currently not considered to be important vehicles for supporting enterprises’ participation in supply chains. The results from this study suggest rethinking of the current focus of management tools utilization, when organizations try to improve their participation in supply chains. More management tools were measured than in earlier studies regarding management tools, supporting enterprises’ participation in supply chain; relations between management-tools utilization and enterprise participation in supply chain were empirically examined. In addition, the most commonly used management tools were considered simultaneously, which had not been done in prior studies.</jats:p>",

At present, the terms ?Digital Supply Chain?, ?Supply Chain 4.0?, ?Digital logistics?, and ?Smart logistics? are widely used in business, and in particular, in the theory and practice of supply chain management (SCM). This demonstrates the relevance of the implementation of Industry 4.0 innovations into the practical activities of manufacturing, trading, and logistics companies, interconnected by networking in the process of delivering products or services to final consumers. In turn, this causes fundamental changes in the structure of supply chains, their business processes and behaviours, making existing approaches to management obsolete.\r\nPurpose of the article: The article aims at identifying supply chain development drivers under the conditions of ?Industry 4.0?; determining the effect of DT in the cross-section of strategic and operational changes of supply chain; clarifying the readiness and capacity for DT implementation in the enterprises activity as exemplified by the enterprises operating in Ukraine in various fields of activity.\r\nMethods: Stratified proportional sampling was applied as the research method. Ukrainian enterprises of different size, involved in different supply chains, were considered as an object of research. The attitude of the Ukrainian enterprises to the DT implementation is presented, and the results are compared to the relevant research data in other countries.\r\nFindings &amp; Value: This study will be valuable to both scientists and practitioners. Scientists will be able to understand the conceptual transformation of SC under the influence of DT. Practitioners will become aware of the following issues: current SCM trends and requirements; DT effects on the strategic and operational levels of the classical model of management; the level of readiness and ability of the Ukrainian enterprises to implement DT in their activities as compared to the enterprises in other countries.</jats:p>"

Ainsi, les TI ont gagné plus d’attention de la part des universitaires, praticiens et décideurs. Cependant, une vision holistique des TI dans la littérature sur la supply chain du commerce de détail reste limitée. Ainsi, cet article développe les recherches sur ce thème et discute le rôle des TI dans les supply chains du commerce de détail. Les avantages perçus et les défis rencontrées par les détaillants sont évalués en se fondant sur une analyse documentaire structurée. Les résultats révèlent que les technologies les plus répandues sont l’identification par radiofréquence, les points de vente et d’autres systèmes inter-organisationnels offrant une visibilité dans la chaîne de valeur, réduisant la main-d’œuvre, baissant le temps des opérations et minimisant les coûts opérationnels.

Logisticsinvolve not only transportation but also warehousing, packaging, inventory management and material handling. All these activities in logistic make a substantial adverse impact on the environment. Green logistic practices are the need of the hour to reduce the impact on the environment and gain competitive advantage. The major objective of this paper is to empirically analyze the major barriers to implementation of green logistics and to statistically rank the best green logistics practices with respect to Manufacturing Sector in Tamil Nadu.Quantitative approach was carried out to find out the barriers to green logistics and filter out the best green practices with the help of survey conducted among the middle level managers in the operations department of different organizations in Manufacturing Sector in Tamil Nadu. The major barriers emerged from the study are cost of implementation of green logistics, lack of training in green logistics practices, lack of top level management commitment, lack of acceptance in advancement of new technology and practices and lack of skilled human resource. This research study will help the policy makers in understanding the significance of the green supply chain management and the overall sustainability by focusing on green supply chain logistics resulting in positive mindset towards enforcement of environment protection rules and regulations.</jats:p>"

In addition, the level of visibility, such as the container, pallet, carton, and box, should be determined for each participant to optimize its own profit function. By using a collaborative game scheme, the present study illustrates the relationships among participants who invest to a certain level of visibility, and then how much value each participant gets. To find feasible solutions, a genetic algorithm-based mechanism is devised for modeling various fitness functions considering the total profit and benefit to cost (B/C) ratio. The proposed framework considers the relationship among participants, as well as the impact from the enhanced visibility, and it may be possible to make fair and rational decisions for all participants based on the quantitative metrics such as the B/C ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the game-theoretic approach where the enhanced visibility prevents a certain participant from taking most of the benefit. It seems possible to establish a long-term sustainable supply chain visibility by distributing profit fairly to all participants in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

To establish causality, we explore plausibly exogenous variation in proximity caused by customer relocations. The positive effect of supplier–customer proximity on supplier innovation is stronger when customers are more innovative themselves, when suppliers and customers are closer in technological space, and when customers’ demand accounts for a larger fraction of suppliers’ total sales. These findings suggest that the feedback channel and the demand channel are likely underlying mechanisms through which supplier–customer proximity affects supplier innovation. Overall, our paper sheds new light on the real effect of supplier–customer relationship on corporate innovation.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.</jats:p>",

These models are very useful for availability estimations of natural resources when social and environmental uncertainties need to be addressed, as it is the case for forest wood supply chains. This work presents an analysis of a forest wood supply chain focusing on forest operations to estimate the availability of round-wood volume restricted by technical constraints using a local case study in Mexico. The theoretical and technical potentials of woody biomass availability were reviewed considering an assessment of forest operations for round-wood production.Area of the study: municipality of Santa Maria del Rio S.L.P. inside the forested land of San Antonio in Mexico.Material and methods: Geographical, historical and socioeconomic data and field work were used to develop technical constraints as extraction limits. Felling and extraction operations were analyzed resulting in a production rate of 2.48 m3 per productive machine hour.Main results: The theoretically produced standing timber accounted to 21,132 m3. After simulating technical constraints, the technically feasible supply of round-wood accounted to 2, 113 m3. Furthermore, a biomass flow chart for tracing biomass along the system boundaries was developed.Research highlights: With the given results, it is possible to give recommendations and conclusions for the improvement of wood supply chains supported by time studies values, technical constraints on terrain slope, harvesting intensity and mechanization level.Keywords: Mexico; modeling; forest operations; sustainable forest management.</jats:p>"

We investigate how to facilitate the CM’s investment in the environmental quality of a product so as to properly respond to climate change. We introduce a quantity incentive contract, and obtain the optimal solution based on a Stackelberg game. The OEM, as the focal company, determines the level of the incentive, and the CM, responsible for product design and production, determines its level of environmental quality given the OEM’s incentive offer. To investigate the effectiveness of the quantity incentive contract and provide important implications, we analytically compare the quantity incentive contract with the basic wholesale price contract without any incentives and conduct numerical experiments. Our results reveal that the quantity incentive contract facilitates the CM’s investment in environmental quality, and enhances the environmental, market, and profit performance of not only the CM but also the OEM which pays the incentive. We also show that the quantity incentive contract is suitable to develop a long-term relationship between the OEM and the CM.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Higher efficiency in raw material recycling is discussed as a key strategy to decrease the environmental impact of resource consumption and to improve materials’ availability in order to mitigate supply risks. However, particularly in the case of technology metals, demand is driven by specific emerging technologies from which recycling will not be possible before the end of their useful lifetimes. Hence, the availability of secondary materials is limited by the amount of obsolete products as well as their collection, separation and treatment during waste management and recycling. In this paper, we present the results of a dynamic material flow model for cobalt as a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries at an European level (EU28). This model aims at quantifying the current state of recycling and future recycling potentials from end-of-life (EoL) product flows. While it is expectable that obsolete large battery packs from (hybrid) electric vehicles will be efficiently collected in future, EoL Li-ion battery flows will remain dominated by smaller electronic equipment (smartphones, laptops etc.) in the coming years and the model results show a significant potential for improvements in collection and material recovery from EoL batteries in Europe. A major challenge will be the collection of smaller batteries and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in general from which a significant share of total European cobalt demand could be recovered in the coming years.</jats:p>"

In parallel, the authors analyze the state policy in the sphere of water supply and wastewater of Ukraine, the principles of its formation and features, the current state of the sphere of water supply and wastewater, organizational and legal forms of water supply and wastewater enterprises. The article analyzes the current state of realization of public- private partnership in the field of water supply and wastewater with indication of existing contracts and contracts that have become invalid. It is proved that the difference between the water supply and wastewater companies of different management models in Ukraine is not marked, as the general state of the water supply and wastewater sector shows the existence of common problems characteristic of all enterprises. In particular, the ineffectiveness of tariff policies, depreciation of fixed assets, low quality of services, difficult financial condition, inadequate investment, etc. The authors discuss the possibilities of adaptation of classical management models in Ukraine and possible consequences. The article defines the institutional problems of the state policy of Ukraine in the sphere of water supply and wastewater, which influence the efficiency of the implementation and functioning of any model of management and regulation.</jats:p>"

Primary data were gathered using questionnaires from all the 14 procurement personnel in the County Government and a sample of 81 supplies from their supply base. Regression results indicated that adoption and use of electronic procurement systems greatly improves performance of the supply chain partners (R2 = .835, p &lt; .05) while resulting into procurement cost reduction, increased effectiveness among other benefits.

This paper characterizes the landscape of PPWSPs in Nigerian rural communities using information collected from field observations, in-depth interviews, questionnaire surveys, and from published water resources literature. The data collected were analysed through the use of descriptive statistical tools. The results revealed the characteristics, categories, contributions and concerns of water users regarding water supplies by PPWSPs. Responses show that PPWSPs are helping to engender development, guarantee end-users with access to sufficient and reliable supplies and reduce water shortages in the study communities. Sixty four percent of sampled households depend on PPWSPs for their water requirements. Many PPWSPs operate outside the purview of government regulations and have differentiated service modes and prizes to gain wider acceptability. Despite the progress made by PPWSPs, however, the strategy can neither guarantee universal access nor the supply of safe drinking water. Significant barriers to the operations of PPWSPs, how to close the policy-gaps that constrain services delivery by PPWSPs and improve performances through setting of standards and regulatory reforms are discussed.</jats:p>",

Here we demonstrate the importance of sediment supply in enhancing the growth of point bars that influence the rate of sinuosity increase through flow deflections in meander bends. We use an archive of Landsat images of 16 meandering reaches from across the Amazon Basin to show that rivers transporting larger sediment loads increase their sinuosity more rapidly than those carrying smaller loads. Sediment-rich rivers are dominated by downstream-rotating meanders that increase their sinuosity more rapidly than both extensional and upstream-rotating meanders. Downstream-rotating meanders appear to establish larger point bars that expand throughout the meander, in contrast to extensional meanders, which have smaller bars, and upstream rotating meanders, which are characterized by deposition over the bar head. These observations demonstrate that the size and position of point bars within meander bends influences flow routing and thus controls the dominant direction of meander growth. Rivers with low sediment supplies build smaller point bars, which reduces their capacity to increase meander curvature and the resulting sinuosity.</jats:p>",

Now, competition has shifted from organization to industry level; any disruption can not only disturb organization but also affect the whole industry. Although Pakistan is agriculture land still industry sector is supporting more than half population, especially the automotive sector is the highest growing sector. Due to regional and economic shift toward China and India, this sector is facing numerous problems. Only thirteen large-scale automotive organizations are operational by creating collaboration among them many issues can be resolved. Supply chain collaboration has dogged the performance in various industries and in various regions. The aim of this study is to explore the potential benefits of supply chain collaboration toward achieving operational performance.Design/methodology/approach: This is an empirical investigation conducting among supply chain department of automotive industries in Pakistan. Data were collected from 232 members of the supply chain that include suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. Factor analysis and multiple regressions through SPSS have been used for data analysis.Findings: The finding of this study reveals that two supply chain management approaches information sharing (IS), joint decision making (JDM) significantly effect, while Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) does not have a significant effect on operational performance.Research limitations: This study consists only three approaches, next study should include more approaches. Secondly, this study is limited to the automotive sector.  Practical implications: [This study will help the managers of the automotive industry in making their operation smooth by applying information sharing, joint decision making, and electronic data interchange.Originality/value: First novelty of this study is the implementation of supply chain collaboration for developing country especially for Pakistan. Secondly, this study seed collaboration as communication and include all aspects of communication like formal communication, informal communication. </jats:p>"

As elements, which are responsible, among others, for the transport process safety, they should maintain their usability. One of the key problems is to ensure the power supply continuity in the transport telematics systems. In order to provide it, relevant power supply systems are used. The state of unfitness of power supply constitutes a failure in the system operation, the result of which can be downtime in operation of the entire transport telematics system or its part. The article carried out a reliability and operation analysis of the power supply system, which consists of three independent energy sources. The relationships, which allow to specify the probabilities of the system’s staying in the distinguished states, were determined.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Western Europe, ecosystems have been shaped to maximise the supply of one specific biomass provisioning ecosystem service (ES), such as food or timber, with detrimental impacts on other ES. The ES approach has therefore been established to better understand the multiple interactions between human society and ecosystems. A variety of methods have been developed to assess ES and their relationships, for instance the ES matrix model based on land cover classes. This popular, flexible and simple method allows combining different data sources and easily comparing ES. However, in general, this method poorly takes into account landscape heterogeneity while abiotic factors and human activities seem to play an important role in ES supply. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to extent the methodology based on the ES matrix model by including abiotic factors and human activities and (2) to test the impacts of these two types of factors on ES supply and their relationships.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The assessment focused on the capacity of the forest to supply six ES depending on six types of soil ranging from productive soils to more constraining or less productive soils (i.e. abiotic factors) and two contrasting forest management strategies (i.e. human activities). This amended ES matrix was applied on one hand, to map the supply of ES and their relationships in four municipalities in the Ardenne ecoregion (Southern Belgium) and on the other hand, to investigate the impacts of three scenarios (i.e. three different management strategies) on ES supply and their relationships.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The amended ES matrix shows large differences in ES supply between the two forest management strategies on the more constraining and less productive soils, creating differences in the spatial pattern of ES. The changes in ES supply amongst the three scenarios and the current supply were quantified to identify the best management options.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In conclusion, one particular forest is not like another in terms of ES supply and their relationships. To capture this heterogeneity, we propose an amended ES matrix including abiotic factors and human activities. The maps, based on this matrix, allow identifying the hotspots (i.e. high capacity to supply different ES) and coldspots (i.e. low capacity to supply different ES or strong trade-offs between provisioning ES and regulating/cultural ES). Forest management should be adapted to the abiotic conditions, in particular in the coldspots, to ensure a more balanced supply of ES.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the principal-agent model is constructed by considering the bank's effort and no effort, and then give the optimal incentive coefficient and fixed return. The results show that banks’ effort will increase the level of efforts of B2B platform, but also increase their own variable payment; under the given conditions, the bank’s effort will increase its income, and at a certain level of effort, the largest increase in revenue, In addition, improving the application level of B2B data processing technology and the degree of data pledge development will contribute to the increase of incentive coefficient and revenue.</jats:p>"

For the present study natural recharge was computed from a water balance model and daily water level fluctuations were measured to study the increase in water level due to artificial recharge. Numerical models were developed using MODFLOW to analyze the feasibility of different artificial recharge arrangements such as check dam and percolation pond with percolation wells individually and in combination and evaluate the effectiveness of the structures in recharging the aquifer. The maximum increase in water level was found to be 3.46 m, 2.54 m and 4.7 m respectively for the check dam, percolation pond with three percolation wells and combined structure arrangement after 2 years of artificial recharge. The zone of influence was obtained as 400 m, 600 m and 500 m respectively for the check dam, percolation pond and combined structure system. Water level fluctuations also proved the same. Water level increase obtained from the natural recharge study was only of the order of 0.2 m. Artificial recharge is found to be very effective for sustainable development of water resources and the percolation pond was found to be the most appropriate structure for groundwater recharge for the study area.</jats:p>",

Techniques that transfer energy directly to sensor nodes using wireless power transfer (WPT) have been studied in recent years to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a technique that uses a drone (quadcopter), which is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as a mobile sink. The drone selects and manages anchor nodes that aggregate data temporarily, collects data by visiting the anchor nodes to mitigate the hotspot issue, and then prevents blackouts by supplying energy to low-energy nodes, thereby improving network connectivity. The anchor nodes are carefully selected after considering the energy capacity of the drone, the size of the network, the amount of collected data, and the energy consumed by the nodes to increase the network’s energy efficiency. Furthermore, energy is transferred from the drone to the anchor nodes to support their energy consumption. In our study, this method reduced the blackouts of sensor nodes, including anchor nodes, in hotspot regions, and increased network connectivity, thereby improving the amount of data gathered by the mobile sink.</jats:p>"

The exploitation data provided by the water supply company from 2012 - 2016 was used for the analysis. The study uses the recommendations of the IWA (International Water Association) for the water balance making and determination of water loss indicators. The values of water loss indicators were compared to international standards and the technical condition of the network was determined. In addition, failure rate analysis of the water supply network was performed based on the failure rate index λ. Based on the performed analysis, it was found that the water supply company should consider renovation or replacement of the main network pipelines to increase the safety level of water supply, reduce the amount of water losses and the company exploitation costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The facility location problem is a popular issue in the literature. The current development of world economies and globalization of the market requires continuous improvement of methods and research in this field. The location of the object determines the time of transport, affects the operational costs of the supply chain, and determines the possible amount of inventory or minimum inventory levels. These are critical issues from the point of view of designing an effective logistics system. The degree of complexity of current decision-making problems requires the construction of mathematical models and support for the decision-maker by optimization and simulation methods. A comprehensive and systemic approach to the problem allows the effective planning of supply chains.\nThe purpose of this article was to study the sensitivity of the warehouse location problem in the supply chain. The solution was obtained based on the methodology developed under the SIMMAG3D project. The article presents the characteristics of the issue of the location of warehouse objects, the mathematical formulation of the solved problem of location and the method of its solution based on the heuristic algorithm using the modification of the Busacker-Gowen method. Then, a supply chain simulation model was developed in the FLEXSIM environment and scenario studies were performed for various input data and model parameters. The analysis and assessment of the solution based on parameters such as utilization of the potential of warehouse objects object were presented. Random change in demand described by Erlang distribution and normal distribution was considered. The analysis showed how the selection of a statistical distribution to describe the input data can affect the shape of the logistics system. The article ends with a summary of considerations and a plan for further research in the use of the simulation environment to support the decision-making process of the location of storage facilities and the functioning of supply chains.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Poor access to municipal water in Ahmedabad’s Muslim areas has been tied to the difficulties of implementing a planning mechanism called the town planning scheme, which, in turn, have been premised on widespread illegal constructions that have developed across these sites. Residents, local politicians, and activists associate this causal explanation offered by engineers and planners for poor water access with a deliberate state-led intent to discriminate against them on the basis of religion. Using this causal association as a methodological entry-point, I examine through this paper how religious difference mediates decision-making and outcomes embodied by technical plans. Demonstrating how the uneven implementation of plans is not always a state-driven exercise as is often imagined, but instead a culmination of intense mediations between influential state and non-state actors with varying interests, I offer the following insights on water governance for sites divided by religion: (a) Negotiations driven by discourses on religious difference are a powerful force influencing the formulation of plans facilitating water access. However, these negotiations and plans are, simultaneously, also vulnerable to other political, legal, and economic pressures. Water governance across such sites thus often unfolds in an unstable landscape of unmapping and mapping; (b) influential legal actors from both majority and minority communities exert pressures obstructing the formulation and implementation of technical plans. The production of observable unmapped water access in minority areas thus, in reality, might not be contained within neat divides such as religion or illegality, but instead be a culmination of shifting interests, contestations, and negotiations confounding such categories; (c) institutionalized planning practices implicated in the intentional production of unmapping in such contexts might instead simply be discursive categories around which uneven water access coalesces.</jats:p>"

Since one of the most realistic problems that supply chains are dealt with is routing of vehicles, routing constraints with a split delivery condition are considered in our proposed model. Also, the possibility of outsourcing is considered in order to satisfy demands that exceed the production capacity. Furthermore, in order to deal with the presence of uncertainty in the problem, a light robust approach is developed. The performance of the proposed model is illustrated using a simulation procedure. Sensitivity analysis on the proposed model is also presented in the paper. The results show that the proposed method has a better performance than Light Robust approach and can be used as a useful managerial tool in redesign problems.</jats:p>"

It is carried out numerical analysis of electric energy flows for three phase power supply system with sinusoidal electromotive force source, linear active load and non-linear elements (diodes). Power transfer is considered as distribution of the primary power flow from source. The part of this flow is converted by non-linear elements and return into the network like secondary power stream of zero sequence and high harmonics which is consumed by resistance elements and causes additional power losses. As a result transporting efficiency and power factor are reduced and energy quality becomes worse. In order to improve the quality of electricity, it is proposed to normalize the relative value of the reactive power of distortion for non-linear electric collectors and to oblige manufacturers of electrical products to complete them with filters of higher harmonics. With the purpose of correct selection of the type and power of compensating devices and monitoring the parameters of the electric network mode, it is proposed to expand the functionality of electronic meters by dividing the reactive power into two components - shear power and distortion power, and for the objective analysis of energy flows, it is proposed to standardize the reactive power of distortion. It is shown that in such system current in neutral line increases due to overlaying of zero sequence harmonics currents. This should be taking into account during neutral line cross-section choice and power losses calculation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Manufacturing, storage, and transportation processes are typically facilitated by pallets, containers, and other reusable transport items (RTIs) designed to guarantee many cycles along a lifespan of several years. As a consequence, both supply and reverse transportation of RTIs need to be managed to avoid stockout along the supply chain and the unsustainable production of new tools from virgin materials. This paper focuses on the business of pallet management by analyzing the transport operations of a pallet pooling network serving a large-scale nationwide retailer. The pooler is responsible for supplying, collecting, and refurbishing pallets. The combination of the pooler’s management strategies with different retailer network configurations results in different pooling scenarios, which are assessed and compared in this paper through a what-if analysis. The logistical and environmental impacts generated by the pallet distribution activities are quantified per each scenario through a tailored software incorporating Geographic Information System (GIS) and routing functionalities. Findings from this analysis suggest how to reduce vehicle distance traveled (vehicles-km) by 65% and pollutant emissions by 60% by combining network infrastructures and pooling management strategies—identifying an empirical best practice for managers of pallet businesses.</jats:p>"

Most of the previous studies in southern timber markets primarily focused on pulpwood and sawtimber markets, and often overlooked CNS as a standalone timber product. Using the Subregional Timber Supply model, this study examines the dynamics of sawtimber- and pulpwood-dominated softwood stumpage markets with growing CNS markets in the US South. Results suggest that South-wide CNS inventory increases over the short run but begins to decrease by 2024, which leads to CNS prices rising over the years. The projected trends vary widely from one wood basket to another. This study provides additional nuance to future prospects of southern timber markets.</jats:p>",

DfRem activities occur at the stage of new product design but have a significant impact on subsequent remanufacturing operations. Based on the closed-loop supply chain operation systems with DfRem, we systematically explored the impact of DfRem on supply chain operation decisions through a case study and modeling analysis and built up a modeling research framework of DfRem-driven closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) operation decision-making. Our research identified DfRem-driven model design elements and discussed the modeling of DfRem-driven investment decision problems, involving different approaches to obtain DfRem investment (i.e., DfRem-driven horizontal or vertical supply chain cooperation) and the ownership of DfRem-level decision-making rights. Moreover, the DfRem-driven two-stage and multi-period modeling processes are elaborated in detail. The aim of this paper is to provide other scholars with a more comprehensive understanding of DfRem research issues, and to establish an integrated DfRem-driven research framework for subsequent scholars to better conduct modeling research on DfRem.</jats:p>"

Based on literature review, the supply chain integration capability is considered as effective risk management tools for mitigating the supply chain uncertainty and risk. The authors identified main types of pharmaceutical supply chain uncertainty and risk. The conceptual framework focuses on the relationships among the supply chain integration capability and pharmaceutical supply chain uncertainty and risk. This provides insights into the pharmaceutical supply chain risk management. The study focuses on the pharmaceutical industry.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pressure Reducing Valves (PRV) have been widely used as a device to control pressure at nodes in water distribution networks and thus reduce leakages. However, an energy dissipation takes place during PRV operation. Thus, micro-hydropower turbines and, more precisely, Pump As Turbines (PAT) could be used as both leakage control and energy generating devices, thus contributing to a more sustainable water supply network. Studies providing clear guidelines for the determination of the most cost-effective device (PRV or PAT) analysing a wide database and considering all the costs involved, the water saving and the eventual power generation, have not been carried out to date. A model to determine the most cost-effective device has been developed, taking into account the Net Present Value (NPV). The model has been applied to two case studies: A database with 156 PRVs sites located in the UK; and a rural water supply network in Ireland with three PRVs. The application of the model showed that although the investment cost associated to the PRV installation is lower in the majority of cases, the NPV over the lifespan of the PAT is higher than the NPV associated with the PRV operation. Furthermore, the ratio between the NPV and the water saved over the lifespan of the PAT/PRV also offered higher values (from 6% to 29%) for the PAT installation, making PATs a more cost-effective and more sustainable means of pressure control in water distribution networks. Finally, the development of less expensive turbines and/or PATs adapted to work under different flow-head conditions will tip the balance toward the installation of these devices even further.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a scenario-based robust optimisation approach which was developed to obtain booster chlorination designs that withstand uncertain network operations and water demand conditions in the WDSs. An optimisation problem was formulated to minimise mass injection rates and the risk of chlorine disinfection. This problem was solved by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The proposed approach was demonstrated using the Phakalane network in Botswana. The results present robust booster chlorination (RBC) designs, which indicate the number of boosters, locations and injection rates in the network. The performance of RBC designs evaluated under uncertainty reveals lower risks of chlorine disinfection compared to deterministic-based designs. The proposed approach obtains booster chlorination designs that respond better to uncertainty in the operations of WDSs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the biggest challenges facing the food industry is assuring food integrity. Dealing with complex food integrity issues requires a multi-dimensional approach. Preventive actions and early reactive responses are key for the food supply chain. Information sharing could facilitate the detection and prevention of food integrity issues. This study investigates attitudes towards a food integrity information sharing system (FI-ISS) among stakeholders in the European food supply chain. Insights into stakeholders’ interest in participating and their conditions for joining an FI-ISS are assessed. The stakeholder consultation consisted of three rounds. During the first round, a total of 143 food industry stakeholders—covering all major food sectors susceptible to food integrity issues—participated in an online quantitative survey between November 2017 and February 2018. The second round, an online qualitative feedback survey in which the findings were presented, received feedback from 61 stakeholders from the food industry, food safety authorities and the science community. Finally, 37 stakeholders discussed the results in further detail during an interactive workshop in May 2018. Three distinct groups of industry stakeholders were identified based on reported frequency of occurrence and likelihood of detecting food integrity issues. Food industry stakeholders strongly support the concept of an FI-ISS, with an attitude score of 4.49 (standard deviation (S.D.) = 0.57) on a 5-point scale, and their willingness to participate is accordingly high (81%). Consensus exists regarding the advantages an FI-ISS can yield towards detection and prevention. A stakeholder’s perception of the advantages was identified as a predictor of their intention to join an FI-ISS, while their perception of the disadvantages and the perceived risk of food integrity issues were not. Medium-sized companies perceive the current detection of food integrity issues as less likely compared to smaller and large companies. Interestingly, medium-sized companies also have lower intentions to join an FI-ISS. Four key success factors for an FI-ISS are defined, more specifically with regards to (1) the actors to be involved in a system, (2) the information to be shared, (3) the third party to manage the FI-ISS and (4) the role of food safety authorities. Reactions diverged concerning the required level of transparency, the type of data that stakeholders might be willing to share in an FI-ISS and the role authorities can have within an FI-ISS.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the crucial implication of oil risks for economic growth and policy making, the aim of this paper is to explore the heterogeneous interconnections of supply or demand in oil risks over time horizons and different countries. Specifically, we first examine the correlation of supply or demand in oil return risks and show the relationships in different countries based on wavelet coherence. Furthermore, we explore the time-varying interconnections between supply- or demand-side and oil return risks, as well as oil producers and demand countries. The empirical results show that the correlation between supply and oil return risks is relatively stable, whereas the linkage between demand and oil return risks shows greater volatility due to the impact of specific events. Further study indicates that there are heterogeneous interconnections between supply- or demand-side and oil return risks over sample periods. Specifically, the sign of response could be divided into four phases, i.e., 1997–2002, 2002–2010, 2010–2013 and 2014–2018. In addition, the interconnections of the demand side could be divided into three phases due to the sign of it. What is more, the dynamic interconnections of oil producers’ or countries’ demands behave quite heterogeneously in different countries. Thus policymakers should focus on the coordination level and space capacity in the global crude oil market.</jats:p>"

South Africa should investigate means to diversify its generating capacity. With the growing demand, South Africa has reached a point where other methods of power generation need to be considered and implemented. This study gives a detailed description of the South African energy supply mix, its evolvement in the past 25 years, and assesses how South Africa fares in comparison with other countries such as its BRICS companions (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in terms of its current and future energy mix. It was found that the total primary energy supply (TPES) share of non-OECD countries is becoming more prominent, with China, India, and Russia being significant contributors. The OECD’s ratio of universal TPES decreased from 1990 to 2015. There is a heavy reliance on fossil fuels in the BRICS countries, which appeals to appropriate policies to influence and guide the transition from the current fossil fuel-dominated energy supply mix to one that follows international trends but, most of all, appreciates its specific geographic position and natural resources.</jats:p>"

It is estimated that the private rate of return to education is 4.5%. Moreover, the rate of return to the number of years of experience is 2.6%, i.e. each additional year of experience will increase the earnings of an individual by 2.6% on average. It is concluded that individuals from poor families have an increased likelihood of receiving financial aid, which decreases their discounting rate of interest.</jats:p>"

However, there is a dearth of research on their essential competencies. This paper proposes, therefore, a humanitarian logistics competency framework (HlCF) to assist with the professional development of humanitarian logisticians. In creating the HlCF, nine competency domains containing 29 specific competencies across four levels (entry to senior management) were identified. This study makes two key contributions to the literature: (i) it extends the discussion of competency frameworks in humanitarian logistics; and (ii) it presents a framework designed to support the human resource plans and practices of aid agencies. The HlCF allows not only individual humanitarian logisticians to develop the competencies necessary for career success, but also humanitarian organisations to map their own competency frameworks to a common standard. This will, in turn, facilitate workforce mobility and support the overall concept of a certified humanitarian logistics professional.</jats:p>",

This study adopts a more holistic approach toward investigating the influential power of GrSCM on firm performance measures with a mediating role of investment recovery and competitiveness. The current study serves as an initiative to identify if the association between investment recovery and firm performance measures is mediated by competitiveness. Data were collected from 272, ISO (14001) certified textile firms based in Pakistan, and the theoretical model was assessed using partial least square structural equation modeling. Underpinning the resource dependence theory, the statistical results reveal that GrSCM practices positively impact firm performances whereas investment recovery acts as a strong mediator between intraorganizational green activities and company's performance.</jats:p>",

However, current service of pick-up facilities has seldom been geographically evaluated despite its general uneven distribution and diverse needs. In this paper, in order to interpret the differentiation in customers’ service demands toward reception alternatives and in facilities’ service excludability in different built environments, a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is improved to measure customers’ spatial accessibility to pick-up facilities, providing a methodology to evaluate the match relation between the differentiated supply and demand of pick-up service. A case study of widespread automated parcel stations (APSs) is conducted in Hangzhou, China and correlative factors to residents’ accessibility are discussed. From the results, residents’ accessibility to pick-up service shows significant spatial unevenness and social inequity in the study area, which is found to correlate most to residences’ maintenance management. As well-managed, gated communities generally hold effective access to exclusive services, most open communities and self-built, single houses are in need of improvement due to inadequate service stemming from a high aging rate, lack of property management, and low service availability of nonexclusive facilities in open areas.</jats:p>"

The recorded recovery of mining wastes is on the level of ca. 19%. The exemplary company that deals with the recovery of carbon wastes recovers ca. 80% of material, which is handed over for utilization (4) Conclusions: It has been found that the structure of the level of mining wastes and the level of their recovery rates demonstrate a large potential of closing the loop of chains in this industry and, at the same time, a potential to extend the chains through directing the material from recovery to various sectors. This constitutes an example of the direction of activities that are in line with the EU strategies for the economies of other states which possess this type wastes.</jats:p>"

The distribution system situated between the Cabeza del Pasto reservoir in the Andévalo area (Huelva, Spain) and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the municipality of Puebla de Guzmán (Huelva, Spain) was examined. To obtain the exact amount of energy which reaches the microturbine, the energy conservation equation considering the loss of energy from friction was used. The results show different locations where it is possible to carry out the installation of a Francis turbine, which can generate an annual energy of approximately 280 MWh per year at the selected point, with an approximate investment cost of €20,000 per year, which means a recovery period of this investment of 2 years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In the early 2000s, Germany's Red-Green government introduced a new type of marginal employment in the form of 'Minijob' legislation. In the context of the dualisation strategy of the German welfare state, Minijob legislation has supported firms in extending the secondary segment of marginal jobs. However, Minijobs are associated with particularly low social security and high poverty risks, and these positions are primarily staffed by women. Therefore, the extension of the Minijob system has contributed to the persistence of traditional structures of gender inequality. This empirical study examines how demand and supply side factors interact with welfare state institutions and politics in the production of marginal employment of women in part-time jobs. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we used logistic regression to analyse women's risk of working in Minijobs based on family, educational, biographical and workplace characteristics. The research results identify both supply side and demand side factors as being significant in shaping a situation whereby married women with small children and lower levels of education who work in small, non-public firms are particularly exposed to the risks of marginal employment in Minijobs.</p>",

Its most popular application thus far is in payment system applications, e.g., bitcoin. This disruptive technology is expected to contribute significant business value to multiple industry sectors, including supply chain management (SCM), where it can provide greater visibility, accountability and trust in interorganizational business collaboration. In this article, we review some fundamental concepts of Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain implementations. Further, we use the context of a food supply chain to highlight key design and implementation challenges for blockchain, and provide a strategic assessment of its prospects. Our aim is to dispel misguided notions and myths about blockchain as a silver bullet for all businesses. We believe it is important to penetrate the hype to allow a more realistic understanding of this technology. Blockchain is a high‐cost, high‐overhead storage medium. It is viable only when its higher cost is counterbalanced by the set of benefits that are identified by a careful and thorough analysis of the business. Thus, it will be used mainly for storing important data related to interorganizational transactions among partners where trust is lacking and provenance and visibility are critical. Our paper offers enterprises a systematic way to understand the real costs and risks of blockchain adoption. The insights gained in the SCM context also apply to other areas such as financial services and healthcare that could leverage the full potential of blockchain technology.</jats:p>",

In this study, we reassess the contextual gender-role attitude effect on female labour supply because earlier studies are hampered by two shortcomings: (a) they are cross-nationally comparative, which makes it difficult to distinguish contextual attitude from institutional effects; (b) they are cross-sectional, which may bias the contextual attitude effect. We aim to overcome these shortcomings by performing longitudinal panel analyses on data from the British Household Panel Survey 1991–2007, comparing 138 counties within the United Kingdom. Our fixed-effects regressions report no significant and substantial association of regional, egalitarian gender-role attitudes with individual women’s labour supply, a finding which both holds for women’s probability to be active in the labour market and employed women’s working hours, and for women with and without (young) children. Female labour supply appears to be much stronger associated with women’s own and partners’ gender-role attitudes, in particular for women with (young) children.</jats:p>",

Risk management research suggests that BCPs are important in response and recovery from disruptions. However, critics suggest that BCPs rely too much on known risks and are overly complicated. This creates a decision dilemma regarding whether to invest in BCPs or not. Using two empirical studies, this manuscript offers theoretical and empirical evidence as to whether BCPs help limit the damage caused by supply chain disruptions and improve company financial performance. Using structural contingency and organizational information processing theories, the study develops hypotheses on how BCPs channel resources to recover from supply chain disruptions, contingent on a company's flexible or procedural response orientation. In Study‐1, the hypotheses are tested based on a combination of subjective (Likert‐based responses) and objective (historical financial performance) data gathered and matched from a cross‐section of Italian companies. Results suggest that BCPs are beneficial to companies with a procedural or flexible orientation in limiting the damage caused by supply chain disruptions. Companies with strong BCPs show better financial performance in comparison to their competition. In Study‐2, a vignette‐based factorial experiment is used to offer insight on how managers perceive the effect of flexible or procedural response orientation on limiting the operational damage of disruptions. Finally, post‐hoc analyses using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) offers further evidence of a strong link between BCPs and financial performance (return on assets).</jats:p>",

To achieve this, we demonstrated that a number of important indicators beyond hardness reduction and costs have to be included. All the evaluated centralised softening technologies could reduce water hardness to the target of 1.3 mmol/L at the Dutch drinking water treatment plant Beilen. CARIX® treatment and pellet softening with Ca(OH)2 resulted in a lower CCPP90 (0.25–0.30 mmol/L) than nanofiltration (0.30–0.35 mmol/L). Decentralised reverse osmosis had a water consumption of &amp;gt;100%, whereas decentralised cation exchange had a water consumption of 2.5–4.5% which was comparable to centralised pellet softening (3.6%). Except for the electronic water conditioner that does not remove water hardness, the decentralised technologies were 7–10 times more expensive than the centralised technologies per m3 of softened water. The centralised softening technologies furthermore ensured supply of softened water to all customers in a water supply zone. Thus, in areas with hard water and limescale problems, investment in centralised softening at the local water utility is more optimal than widespread implementation of decentralised systems.</jats:p>",

This research investigates the significance of supply phase shift on the performance of a three-phase induction motor by applying a novel phase shift unbalance definition to the zero, negative and positive sequence components model of the motor. The test results reveal that when both phase angle shift and voltage magnitude unbalance occur simultaneously during motor operation the effect of the phase shift dominates over the effects of the voltage magnitude unbalance. This study shows that phase angle unbalance has a severe consequence on three phase motor performance.</jats:p>",

The simulation of Closed-loop Proportional-Integral (PI) and FOP-I-D controlled CFSMPS system has been done and the results of the systems are related. The outcomes signify that the FOP-I-D based system has presented an enhanced response to represent as similar to the PI controlled CFSMPS system. The FOP-I-D controlled CFSMPS system has benefits like decreased steady-state error and enhanced time-domain response.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This study aims to evaluate water quality of produced water from oilfields in the Heglig area using various water quality evaluation indices and study the significance of evaporation for cumulative pollutants after bioremediation in Heglig oilfield. Produced water samples were collected and analyzed for three locations in Heglig and Neem oilfields in order to determine the physicochemical, radioactivity, and heavy metal variables. The data obtained were used to determine the heavy metal pollution index, heavy metal evaluation index, weighted arithmetic water quality index, and Canadian water quality index (CCME WQI). The study revealed very poor water quality and high heavy metals at Neem oilfield. In addition, produced water quality at Heglig oilfield before the bioremediation was very poor and after the bioremediation was found to be poor, also the heavy metals were low before the bioremediation and medium after the bioremediation. Low levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) oil in water, and total suspended solids (TSS) are mainly responsible for improvement of water quality after the bioremediation. Variation in the heavy metals before and after the bioremediation was a result of cumulative effect in the evaporation ponds.</jats:p>",

This research study aims to analyze the healthcare sustainable supply chain 4.0 by proposing the circular economy transition conceptual framework with the corporate social responsibility mirror. The authors developed an observation guideline to collect empirical data from a private healthcare institution located in Rio de Janeiro, which has been promoting investment in new technologies within its operations. The research observation is between January and April 2017. The results show the glass structure can be a channel that provides the lightning resources, the solar energy with the photovoltaic panels, and the water management. The corporate social responsibility links the social role in healthcare institutions with sustainable practices and it improves smart technologies. The applicability of the internet of things and the internet of services adds value to sustainable practices. The circular economy transition conceptual framework integrates the result analyses. The research concludes that the union among the triple bottom line, Industry 4.0, and the corporate social responsibility allows the transition from the linear model to the circular model and can improve the sustainable healthcare supply chain 4.0.</jats:p>"

Changes in land uses modify the WQ and it can be predicted using WQ models based on environmental variables through the evaluation of different scenarios. It was found through modeling that pasture or chaparral land use has no negative impact on WQ; all the contrary happens with increments in crop cultivation or human population. At the present, the coastal area, adjacent to the reserve, has low agricultural activity but that could increase over time, affecting the WQ. Therefore, SINAC should continue with its acquisition land activity to counteract the negative environmental effect of agricultural activity to preserve the actual good quality of the rivers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces a control problem of regulation of energy flows in a two-site electricity and heat supply system, where two combined heat and power (CHP) plants are interconnected via electricity and heat flows. The control problem is motivated by recent development of fast operation of CHP plants to provide ancillary services of power system on the order of tens of seconds to minutes. Due to the physical constraint that the responses of the heat subsystem are not necessary as fast as those of the electric subsystem, the target controlled state is not represented by any isolated equilibrium point, implying that stability of the system is lost in the long-term sense on the order of hours. In this paper, we first prove in the context of nonlinear control theory that the state-space model of the two-site system is nonminimum phase due to nonexistence of isolated equilibrium points of the associated zero dynamics. Instead, we locate a one-dimensional (1D) invariant manifold that represents the target controlled flows completely. Then, by utilizing a virtual output under which the state-space model becomes minimum phase, we synthesize a controller that achieves not only the regulation of energy flows in the short-term regime but also stabilization of an equilibrium point in the long-term regime. Effectiveness of the synthesized controller is established with numerical simulations with a practical set of model parameters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water utilities should monitor their nonrevenue water (NRW) levels properly to manage water losses and sustain water services. However, monitoring NRW is problematic in an intermittent water supply regime. This is because more supplied water to users imposes higher volumes of NRW, and supplying significantly less water results in an unmet water demand but interestingly less NRW. This study investigates the influence of the amount of water supplied to a distribution system on the reported level of NRW. The volume and indicators of NRW all vary with variations in the system input volume (SIV). This is even more critical for monitoring NRW for systems shifting from intermittent to continuous supply. To enable meaningful monitoring, the NRW volume should be normalised. Addressing that, this research proposes two normalisation approaches: regression analysis and average supply time adjustment. Analysis of the NRW performance indicators showed that regression analysis enables the monitoring of NRW and tracking its progression in an individual system only, but not for a comparison with other systems. For comparing (or benchmarking) a water system to other systems with different supply patterns, the average supply time adjustment should be used. However, this approach presents significant uncertainties when the average supply time is less than eight hours per day.</jats:p>"

Individual labor supply is highly elastic at low hours and more inelastic at higher hours. For unemployed applicants, our preferred estimate of the average opportunity cost of a full-time job due to lost leisure and household production is 60 percent of after-tax marginal product, and 72 percent when including fixed costs of employment and child-care costs.

In this paper, the data such as reserves, production and consumption of raw ore, as well as trade volume (including trade amount), of 16 kinds of metal mineral resources in the world and China from 2006 to 2017 that have an important impact on the economic development of China were collected. The 16 kinds of resources include bulk minerals in short supply (iron Fe, manganese Mn, copper Cu, aluminium Al, gold Au, lead Pb, zinc Zn, nickel Ni, and chromium Cr), dominant minerals (tungsten W, molybdenum Mo, tin Sn, and antimony Sb), and strategic emerging minerals (lithium Li, cobalt Co, and titanium Ti). The dataset consisting of the data collected is in Excel format and comprises six sheets (including Resources in the World, Identified Resource Reserves in China, Reserves Base in China, Raw Ore Production in China, Raw Ore Consumption in China, and Import-Export Volume of China), aiming to analyze the present status as well as the supply and demand trends of the important metal minerals required in the middle and late stages of the industrialization process of China. The following information is shown from the dataset. In terms of bulk minerals in short supply such as Fe, Mn, Cu, and Au, although identified resource reserves have increased steadily, the basic reserves have grown slowly due to the large volume of exploitation and consumption. With the total demand for bulk minerals in short supply still remaining high in the future, the import volume will continue to climb as a result of low resource guarantee degree in China. In terms of dominant minerals such as W and thorium (Th), they are no longer as dominant as before owing to low reserves-to-production ratio and insufficient backup resources. In terms of strategic emerging minerals including Li, Co and Ti, the resources and basic reserves have grown slowly or declined. The quality of these minerals in China is poor, making it difficult to utilize many of them. Moreover, the production and consumption of these minerals have grown rapidly in the past ten years and will continue to grow at a high rate in the future, whereas domestic reserves grow slowly, resulting in a prominent contradiction between supply and demand. The supply and demand data of the existing metal minerals are examined and summarized in this dataset, in order to provide references for exploration and strategic deployment of metal mineral resources in the future.call in</jats:p>",

To cope with the negative environmental impacts of corporate activities, researchers introduced the concept of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management and remanufacturing. This paper studies joint inventory and pricing decisions in a multi-echelon CLSC model that considers online to offline (O2O) business strategy. An imperfect production process is examined with a random defective rate that follows a probability distribution. The results show that the O2O channel increases the profit of the system. For the defective rate, three different distributions are considered and three examples are solved. The results of the three examples conclude that the highest profit is generated when the defective rate follows a uniform distribution. Furthermore, based on the salvage value of defective items, two cases were studied. Results and sensitivity analysis show that the increase in defective rate does not reduce total profit in every situation, as perceived by the existing literature. Sensitivity analysis and numerical examples are given to show robustness of the model and draw important managerial insights.</jats:p>"

This global economic trend arouses significant attention to distinct preference of individual entities in supply chain. The primary goal of the study is to establish statistical understanding on factors of logistics service preferences of each supply chain of each supply chain entity in China, especially Shandong Province. Ultimately, the study aims i) to establish the solid framework for proper evaluation of logistics services in supply chains, ii) to enhance the preferences of logistics services as a differentiating feature on behalf of entities. The study utilizes a holistic approach in analyzing logistics service attributes which affect overall logistics entities in an effort to overcome the limitations of previous studies which failed to provide integrating viewpoint of supply chain entities. In this study, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method is used as an analysis tool which allows an in-depth examination of the differences between factors and evaluations of customers regarding the logistics service attributes. The results clearly show distinctive service preferences for each four supply chain entities in Shandong Province of China such as 3PLs (forwarder, carrier, and warehouse), Customs (airport, seaport, and bonded area), Market channels (wholesaler, retailer, and e-retailer), and Manufacturers regarding the logistics service attributes.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, population growth and unsafe industrial practices, as well as climate change, have put strain on ‘clean' water supply in many parts of the world, including the Americas. Current supply of fresh water needs to be supplemented to meet future needs. Living nature provides many lessons for water source. It has evolved species, which can survive in the most arid regions of the world by water collection from fog and condensation in the night. Before the collected water evaporates, species have mechanisms to transport water for storage or consumption. These species possess unique chemistry and structures on or within the body for collection and transport of water. In this paper, an overview of arid desert conditions and water collection from fog, and lessons from living nature for water collection are provided.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An excessive increase in algae often has various undesirable effects on drinking water supply systems, thus proper management is necessary. Algal monitoring and classification is one of the fundamental steps in the management of algal blooms. Conventional microscopic methods have been most widely used for algal classification, but such approaches are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, the development of alternative methods for rapid, but reliable algal classification is essential where an advanced machine learning technique, known as deep learning, is considered to provide a possible approach for rapid algal classification. In recent years, one of the deep learning techniques, namely the convolutional neural network (CNN), has been increasingly used for image classification in various fields, including algal classification. However, previous studies on algal classification have used CNNs that were arbitrarily chosen, and did not explore possible CNNs fitting algal image data. In this paper, neural architecture search (NAS), an automatic approach for the design of artificial neural networks (ANN), is used to find a best CNN model for the classification of eight algal genera in watersheds experiencing algal blooms, including three cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp., Oscillatoria sp., and Anabaena sp.), three diatoms (Fragilaria sp., Synedra sp., and two green algae (Staurastrum sp. and Pediastrum sp.). The developed CNN model effectively classified the algal genus with an F1-score of 0.95 for the eight genera. The results indicate that the CNN models developed from NAS can outperform conventional CNN development approaches, and would be an effective tool for rapid operational responses to algal bloom events. In addition, we introduce a generic framework that provides a guideline for the development of the machine learning models for algal image analysis. Finally, we present the experimental results from the real-world environments using the framework and NAS.</jats:p>"

By means of both hardware and analytical redundancy, the proposed algorithm compares data and isolates faults on sensors through analysis of residuals. Moreover, the algorithm performs a real-time selection of the most reliable measurements for the automated control of the WSS operations. A coupled model of the hydraulic and remote-control system is developed to test the performance of the WSS when the proposed algorithm is applied or not. Simulations show that the occurrence of errors in the sensors causes significant worsening in the economic, energy and mechanical performance of the infrastructure. In many cases, the operations of the WSS are seriously compromised. The error detection and measurement assessment performed by the proposed algorithm proves to be crucial for the safe control of the WSS.</jats:p>",

The main component of the LNG fuel gas supply system (FGSS) is the heat exchanger that provides adequate gas temperatures and pressures required by the engine, which also has a large machinery volume compared with other equipment. Due to the volume limitation, most FGSS have been applied to new shipbuilding only. To reduce the volume of the FGSS, CO2 was considered to serve as the replacement heat medium for conventionally used glycol water during LNG gasification. The specific power consumption (SPC) in the CO2 and glycol water system was optimized using the Aspen HYSYS thermodynamic modeler toward adjusting the temperature and pressure, and the resulting sizes were compared. This study demonstrated that the CO2 heat medium resulted in a 14% improvement in efficiency and a 7% reduction in heat exchanger size concluding that it was the most advantageous heat medium for the LNG regasification.</jats:p>"

Current water treatment plant performance models may not accurately capture how source water quality variations, such as organic matter variability, can impact treatment unit processes. To investigate these impacts, a field study was conducted wherein water samples were collected along the treatment train for 72 hours during a storm event. Systematic sampling and detailed analyses of water quality parameters, including non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), UV absorbance, and THM concentrations, as well as chlorine spiking experiments, reveal how the THM formation potential changes in response to treatment unit processes. Results show that the NPOC remaining after treatment has an increased reactivity towards forming THMs, and that brominated THMs form more readily than chlorinated counterparts in a competitive reaction. Thus both the reactivity and quantity of THM precursors must be considered to maintain compliance with drinking water standards, a finding that should be incorporated into the development of model-assisted treatment operation and optimization. Advanced granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment beyond conventional coagulation–flocculation–sedimentation processes may also be necessary to remove the surge loading of THM-formation precursors during a storm event.</jats:p>",

Disruptions can be in the form of government policies, external conflicts, and natural calamities. Several indicators quantifying the probability of supply disruption were proposed in past studies based on a defined set of criteria. However, factors influencing the behavior of energy exports vary per country. In this study, 12 political risk components were investigated and correlated with historical oil-export data to assess the main drivers dictating export behavior. A case study was conducted on Philippine crude oil suppliers from 2001 to 2015, and three countries were elaborated for further discussion. Results showed that oil exports are strongly correlated with internal and external conflicts in Saudi Arabia; internal conflicts in Venezuela; and socioeconomic conditions in Russian Federation. The study recommends utilizing the developed methodology to aid estimation of energy security costs based on various political risk scenarios.</jats:p>",

Reduction of uncertainty-induced risk is therefore essential for predicting market prospects and for achieving sustainable growth for sector participants. This can be achieved by conceiving the formation of freight rates as well as the macro variables that have the greatest impact on rates. This study aims to contribute to the existing freight rate formation literature by empirically testing the supply–demand balance of China, one of the world’s largest economies. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) has been selected as a measure of freight rates, trade volume of China has been selected as a demand-side indicator and the dry bulk fleet has been selected as a supply-side indicator in the model. It has been hypothesized that a larger trade volume has the effect of increasing freight rates, while an increasing fleet capacity has the effect of reducing freight rates. Correlation and regression analyses have been applied to test the econometric relationships between variables. The results of the study have confirmed the hypotheses, and it has been found that freight rates reacted more vigorously to changes in the dry bulk fleet, which forms the supply side.</jats:p>",

The morphology and electrochemical characteristics of the modified electrode were discussed, and the results showed that after modification, the specific surface area of AC* reached 672.48 m2/g, increased by 29.43%; while the specific surface area of CNT* was 117.39 m2/g, reduced by 9.94% due to the strong oxidation of the mixed acid, the pore volume of CNT* increased by 48.28%. The electrode regeneration test proved that the electrode had good cycling stability. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model could better describe the adsorption rate of the electrodes for ions and the desalination ratio of the AC*/CNT* electrode reached 7.11 mg/g; the Langmuir model could well describe the adsorption mechanism of capacitive deionization, and indicated that the adsorption process of CDI was near to single ion layer adsorption; the change trend of electric mobility with migration time could be well fitted by exponential equations. This study explored a novel composite electrode coating, and initially explored the behavioral characteristics and trends of CDI technology.</jats:p>",

Existing performance measurement studies lack critical analysis for prioritization of performance indicators. Since the process of KPIs selection and categorization is a complex, domain based and subjective process, a systematic guideline is needed.

The paper assesses the current state of centralized drinking water supply and sanitation in the towns Anna, Liski, Boguchar, Rossosh, which are the administrative centers of four municipal districts of the Voronezh region. The problems of providing the population of the region with high-quality drinking water and the ways of solving rational water supply were considered. In addition, based on the results of chemical analysis of samples taken from the distribution network, the quality of drinking water supplied to the population of the studied towns was established. The results of the analysis showed that the population of small towns in the Voronezh region consumes drinking water that does not meet hygienic requirements. Therefore, today it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and control over the quality of drinking water supply, and the population of small towns in the region should use household water aftertreatment filters.</jats:p>",

A research project in Western Australia is integrating smart metering technology, household participation and data analytics. An improved understanding of hybrid water systems at residential scale, as socially accepted solutions to promote water efficiency and economic savings, within the traditional centralized urban water network is achieved. An integrated water model and a system of water credits and debits are developed and tested on a case study for which 10-minute logged water consumption data of its hybrid water system are available for 1 year. The model is shown to provide a full characterization of the relationship between the household and the water resources, thus assisting with improved urban water management which promotes the rollout of decentralized hybrid water systems whilst accounting for the impacts on the aquifer as an ecosystem service provider.</jats:p>",

There are several potential LNG plants in Indonesia and abroad that can be the source of gas for Gresik LNG Terminal. Each of these LNG plants has varying gas price and distance to Gresik. The modelling of the LNG logistics system for Gresik LNG Terminal was built to illustrate the LNG supply chain from the LNG plants to Gresik LNG Terminal and several supply scenarios will be proposed. The built model is linear and optimized by using linear programming. Linear programming involves the determination of objective functions, decision variables and constraints. The optimization of the logistics system aims to obtain the cheapest gas supply cost for Gresik LNG receiving terminal. The result shows that the cheapest gas supply cost is obtained through direct supply scenario with gas source from domestic and abroad with combination of delivery from Bontang equal to 0.34 MTPA (40 %) with 12 shipments, Tangguh equal to 0.26 MTPA (30 %) with 9 shipments, and Bintulu Malaysia equal to 0.26 MTPA (30 %) with 9 shipments.</jats:p>",

But the industry is facing stiff competition from other RMG producing countries including China, India, and Sri Lanka of the world. Hence, competitiveness especially at the manufacturing level became important for this industry. An efficient Supply Chain Management can increase the competitiveness and the satisfaction of the customers. Nowadays, SCM plays an integral part of a firm’s success as it allows firms to quickly deliver products to the end-user for a low cost. Hence, RMG companies have very limited options other than implementing SCM as a strategy in order to remain competitive. This study intends to identify the impediments in applying sound SCM in the RMG industry. A mixed research method with a questionnaire survey has been employed for determining the impediments objectively. Use of descriptive analysis and Kendall Coefficient of Concordance have been made for ranking the challenges. This study found workplace safety, unavailability of raw materials and political instability are the major impediments for SCM applications in the RMG industry of Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

According to the topology of the EMU real auxiliary power supply system, the whole simulation system including the auxiliary converter, charger, single-phase inverter and other single models is built, and the internal working principle and working process of the system are studied. The auxiliary converter adopts the droop control method introducing virtual impedance to reduce the circulation effect of the parallel system. Combined with the battery pack charging characteristic curve, the constant current and constant voltage step-by-step charging management strategy is studied. The actual operating conditions of the system are simulated according to the auxiliary power supply system control logic. The system-level simulation on the MATLAB/Simulink platform shows that the output performance of each component is good, working in the rated parameters and meeting the working requirements of the auxiliary power supply system. Finally, the rationality, stability and robustness of the auxiliary power supply system model are proved by simulation and experimental comparison.

Well rehabilitation and replacement are thus an area where water utilities could benefit from rational decision support frameworks and quantitative tools that enable them to better navigate the complex trade-off relationship(s) that exist among a variety of environmental quality, public health, financial, regulatory, organizational, and technological dimensions. Consistent with these considerations, a business risk-based prioritization tool was developed for this study that augments/extends California Water Service (Cal Water)'s well rehabilitation and the replacement decision-making process. For this derivation, a business risk exposure methodology is combined with an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), with the AHP being utilized to determine the weights of the factors involved in the likelihood of failure and the consequence of failure calculation. It is expected that the new tool will assist in optimizing inspection and action plans and identify the wells requiring attention and/or additional work for water utilities.</jats:p>",

Until 15 days of age, nine litters/group were housed in the maternal cage and milked once per day. From 15 to 30 days, the young rabbits could consume both milk and solid feed (pelleted for C or supplemental feed for A and G). At 30 days of age, the rabbits were weaned and, until 45 days, were kept in single cages following the same dietary protocol. No significant changes were found in the milk intake or the individual weight of young rabbits at 30 and 45 days. The caecal Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (bacterial phyla ratio) increased with age (from 2.43 to 6.05 on average, at 30 and 45 days). The Ruminococcaceae/Lachinospiraceae (bacterial family ratio) was highest in the A group at both ages, followed by G then C.

A common SMPS chip LTM8025 was taken as an example to explain the modeling process. According to the integrated circuit (IC) electromagnetic modeling (ICEM) standard, the parametric conducted emission model is divided into two parts: IC internal activity (ICIA) and IC passive distribution network (ICPDN). The parameters of ICIA are identified by measured data and correlated with key components; an improved vector-fitting algorithm is proposed to solve the fitting problem of ICPDN without phase information. This parametric model can be used with commercial simulation software together to achieve predictions of conducted emissions from power modules. The experiment results show that the maximum and 90% confidence interval of the forecast errors are 9.677 dB and (−4.56 dB, 6.52 dB) respectively, which achieve the international standard requirements and have sufficient accuracy and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

Pleiku city, which is located in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, has built two treatment plants and a network of water supply pipelines in the core area. An analysis of the current state of the water supply system including water supply, treatment plant and pipeline system helps identify existing problems in the system. Through mixed methods, hazards or hazardous events are identified as a basis for risk assessment by using semi – quantitative method to assess raw risk and residual risk for each hazard. Priority risks are identified to focus on proposing the possible solutions that will improve the performance and management of domestic water supply systems.</jats:p>"

In the basis of a sample of 75 Moroccan manufacturing companies, we used PLS – Structural Equation Modeling to study the direct effect of customer integration, internal integration and supplier integration on operational performance of manufacturers and to analyze the mediating effect of internal integration. Findings: The results show that customer integration, internal integration and supplier integration are all positively and significantly related to operational performance of the manufacturer and internal integration mediates relationship between costumer integration and operational performance but not relationship between supplier integration and operational performance.     Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on a set of best practices for integrating flows and business processes that industrial companies need to implement in order to create value for final consumer and show how to use internal integration practices to benefit more from external integration.Originality/value: The result of this study extends the developing body of literature on supply chain integration by analyzing the effect of interaction between internal and external integration on the operational performance towards an organizational capabilities perspective in a specific Moroccan industrial context.</jats:p>"

FDSOI MOSFETs are symmetry devices with a superior control of the short channel effects (SCEs) and single-event effects (SEEs). Previous studies have suggested that the SET width is invariant when the temperature changes in FDSOI devices. Simulation results show that the SET pulse width increases as the supply voltage decreases. When the supply voltage is below 0.6 V, the SET pulse width increases sharply with the decrease of the supply voltage. The SET pulse width is not sensitive to temperature when the supply voltage is 1 V. However, when the supply voltage is 0.6 V or less, the SET pulse width exhibits an anti-temperature effect, and the anti-temperature effect is significantly enhanced as the supply voltage drops. Besides, the mechanism is analyzed from the aspects of saturation current and charge collection.</jats:p>"

While existing research has examined the operational importance of LSPs in decarbonizing supply chains, the strategic perspective of LSPs on low carbon supply chains has not received enough attention. Motivated by the evolving role of LSPs from a service provider to a resource integrator in the supply chain, drawing on the relational view of inter-organizational competitive advantage, this paper focuses on LSPs’ low-carbon supply chain integration (SCI) and empirically investigates its drivers and outcomes. Data from 124 Chinese LSPs shows that LSPs’ corporate environmental responsibility and customer environmental requirement have positive relationships with LSPs’ low-carbon SCI, and that LSPs’ low-carbon SCI is positively related to LSPs’ environmental and financial performance. In addition, LSPs’ environmental performance is found to have a positive relationship with LSPs’ financial performance. These findings not only provide new insights for LSPs’ low-carbon supply chain initiatives, but also highlight the importance of SCI as a strategic approach in low-carbon supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Cangkringan district was the most affected area with highest level of damage. Learned from the 2010 eruption, mitigation action was developed by preparing more and adequate evacuation shelters. During period of staying in evacuation shelter, primary necessity of clean water for the refugees needed to be fulfilled. Groundwater was considerated to be the alternative source to fulfill the needs of clean water for the refugeess in evacuation shelters. However, the amount of groundwater sources on the area of evacuation shelter had to be able to meet the domestic water necessity of all refugeess. This research aimed to measure the potential’s amount of groundwater on the surrounding area of evacuation shelter, particularly in Cangkringan district, and to identify the capability of groundwater to fulfill the refugees’s domestic water necessity in the evacuation shelter in Cangkringan district. Dynamic groundwater discharge method by Darcy model was used to measure the prediction of potential groundwater. The result showed potential of groundwater in Cangkringan were as much 88,417.2 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day or 88,417.200 liter/day.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rice is a vital food commodity in Indonesia due to its role as a staple food for most Indonesian people. The rice supply chain in Indonesia varies from one region to another and it is difficult to trace movement along the chain from land to customers. This introduces non-transparency and uncertainty in the quantity and quality of rice at every node along the supply chain. The crucial issues of food safety and security, as well as consumer concern and curiosity in buying and consuming foods, increases the need for a traceability system for the rice value chain which can be easily and widely accessed. This paper describes the design framework of an IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system for the rice supply chain on web platforms. The system approach has been followed (where the system requirements are identified based on supply chain characteristics) and then the logical framework for implementing internal and external traceability was modeled using IDEF-0 (Integrated Definition Modeling). This paper further presents an explanation of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as an initial step to modeling the data requirements and a model of information exchange between stakeholders that explains the data that must be recorded and forwarded to the next stakeholder. Finally, we propose the CBIS (Computer Based Information System) concept to develop a traceability system in the rice supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every organization is a complex supply chain system. If any fragment of this supply chain is disturbed, it will directly affect the entire structure. Numerous studies have been conducted to categorize the supply chain risk sources, but very few available cover all types of risks. This study did an extensive literature review and content analysis on the subject. A supply chain is the flow of information, material, and money starting from suppliers and ending to end-users. To cover all types of risks, risk sources must be based on three perspectives: (i) internal to the firm, (ii) external to the firm but internal to the supply chain, and (iii) external to the supply chain. Risks can be categorized into seven types under these three perspectives. Regarding internal risks, three types of risks come from the supply side, process side, and demand side, while these members of the supply chain are connected with the supply affected by logistic side risks, finance side risks, and collaboration side risks. The external environment also affects the supply chain so the seventh type of risks comes from environmental side risks. This study extends the literature of supply chain risk management by identifying new risk sources. This study will help the managers to understand what kind of risks can affect their supply chain. Future study can be conducted to empirically verify these risks sources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the standard for contact wires made from copper and its alloys, the values of long-term permissible temperatures have significantly decreased. This requires recalculation of previously valid values of long-term permissible currents. Authors considered revised method for calculating the long-term permissible currents, based on a more rigorous consideration of the laws of heat transfer and experimental studies of the conditions of heating and cooling of shaped (contact) and stranded wires. Technique is based on heat balance conditions, using which the sources of greatest inaccuracies become such quantities as cooled surface area, influence of wind direction, meteorological conditions, laws of change in heat transfer coefficient, effect on additional heating of solar radiation. Deviations when these indicators are taken into account by existing methods can cause errors of 40 % or more. Formulas for calculating the actual outer surface of stranded and shaped wires are given. The inadmissibility of calculating the surface area of the wires by their reference diameter is noted. Updated law of the change in heat transfer coefficient for stranded and shaped wires, as well as the degree of its dependence on wind speed and cooled surface, is given based on a summary of extensive domestic and foreign research. It is shown that with the longitudinal direction of the wind, the reduction of this coefficient occurs to a lesser extent than has been assumed so far. Authors propose method for taking into account an increase in the heat transfer coefficient under meteorological conditions characteristic of ice formation. The heat transfer coefficient of shaped and stranded wires in no case can not be taken as for round pipes with smooth surface. Existing method of accounting for solar radiation, which influences the additional heating of wires, leads to an unjustified and repeated exaggeration of this effect, since previously only the radiation incident on the wire was taken into account in the calculations. According to the laws of heat transfer, the temperature of the irradiated body does not depend on the incident, but on the resulting radiation, defined as the difference between the radiations incident on the body and emitted by it in accordance with its temperature. A formula for accounting for such heat transfer is proposed. The above methodology and calculation formulas allow performing reasonable calculations to determine the long-term permissible currents of individual stranded and shaped wires, as well as the contact network as a whole.</jats:p>"

In this study, we aim to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater availability and pumping under five scenarios for before and after the implementation of the MWSP using a numerical groundwater flow model. The data on water demand, supply infrastructure, changes in hydraulic head, groundwater pumping rates, and aquifer characteristics were analyzed. Results showed that groundwater pumping from individual wells ranges from 0.0018 to 2.8 mld and the average hydraulic head declined from 2.57 m below ground level (bgl) (0.23 m/year) to 21.58 m bgl (1.96 m/year). Model simulations showed that changes in average hydraulic head ranged from +2.83 m to +5.48 m at various stages of the MWSP implementation, and −2.97 m for increased pumping rates with no implementation of the MWSP. Regulation in pumping such as monetary instruments (groundwater pricing) on the use of groundwater along with appropriate metering and monitoring of pumping amounts depending on the availability of new and existing public water supply could be interventions in the near future.</jats:p>",

We show that the two auctions are equivalent and not efficient. Then we propose two easily implementable reverse auctions, namely the first-price and second-price format announced penalty reverse auction (APRA), and show that the “revenue equivalence principle” holds, i.e., the two auctions generate the same ex ante expected profit to the buyer. We further show that the two reverse auctions are efficient and “truth telling” is the suppliers’ dominant strategy in the second-price format APRA.

The values of variables such as high values of concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) are indicators of pollution. The objective of this work was to monitor the trophic status and water quality of the Cassaffousth reservoir (Córdoba, Argentina) through the development of statistical models based on field data and satellite information. During 2016 and 2017, samples were taken bimonthly. Seven sampling sites were selected and physico-chemical and biological parameters were assessed. By using regression techniques, Landsat 8 information was related with field data to construct and validate a statistical model to determine the distribution of Chl-a in the reservoir (R2 = 0.87). The generated algorithm was used to generate maps which contained information about the dynamics of Chl-a in the entire reservoir. Remote sensing techniques can be used to expand the knowledge of the dynamics of the Cassaffousth reservoir. Moreover, these techniques can be used as baselines for the development of an early warning system for this and other reservoirs in the region.</jats:p>",

Therefore, multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was applied in this study, which utilizes a series of quantifiable parameters to establish the mathematical method of a risk model. The risk matrix of a pipeline was defined as the multiple of the probability of pipeline failure and potential consequences of pipeline failure. By combining the GIS (geographic information system), each evaluation unit was assigned to different risk levels. The large-diameter (above 800 mm) pipeline length statistic for various risk evaluation units of Taiwan Water Corporation reveals the length of high risk is 171 km (7.7%), secondary high risk 574.6 km (25.8%), middle risk 714.3 km (32%), low risk 701.5 km (31.5%), and the unranked length is 67.8 km (3.0%). Finally, the detection frequencies were classified as high risk with a term check of every five years, sub-high risk with planned check every five to ten years, medium risk with checking/monitoring if needed, and low risk with quick repair and no need to take measurements and monitoring. Therefore, we can significantly lower the probability of bursting for large-diameter pipelines in the water distribution system.</jats:p>",

In this study, the two-dimensional distributions of ROSs after passing through an agarose tissue model by the plasma-jet exposures were visualized using a KI-starch gel reagent to evaluate the local ROS supply. Partial ROS supply on the tissue model surface induced the local ROS supply in a pointlike shape just under the plasma-exposed spot. The O3-containing gas exposure without direct plasma contact could not induce the local ROS supply. Therefore, the local ROS supply was assumed to be induced by plasma-specific effects. However, the results also indicated that the plasma jet coming in direct contact with the tissue model surface did not necessarily induce the local ROS supply. The effects of the tissue model thickness on the local ROS supply were also studied; the local ROS supply could penetrate to a depth of 2 mm in the tissue model under the given experimental conditions.</jats:p>",

Findings of this study showed that human resource managers perceived the competencies of fresh graduates supplied to the hotel industry in both positive and negative views were communication skill, technical skill, cognitive skill, and interpersonal skill. In contrast, the critical competencies demanded in the hotel industry for the entry-level job were interpersonal skill, communication skill, technical skill, leadership, information management, teamwork, and cognitive skill. Out of the four competencies supplied to the industry, the employers perceived only one positive competency was supplied to them, and the other three were regarded as insufficient.

One alternative method is based on membrane forwards osmosis (FO) technology. In this study, chitosan-based FO membranes have been developed into drinking water bags used as purification media for dirty water and seawater. The chitosan membrane used for the assembly of drinking water bags has a thickness of 0.043 mm, the porosity of 30.3%, the tensile strength of 28.83 kgf / mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, swelling degree of 43.5% and elongation of 7.16%. The drinking water bags are made from a combination of polypropylene plastic (PP) and aluminum foil plastic with the interface of the FO membrane inside. The drinking water bag can be applied to purify dirty water and seawater into energy drinking water, which can be used for drinking water supply in an emergency situation. Energy drinks water is produced from the FO process using a variety of draw solution, specifically glucose, fructose, and sucrose. The highest drinking water flux was obtained by using 3M sucrose concentration as a draw solution. The clean water fluxes for dirty water and seawater samples were 5.25 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>hour and 4.25 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>hour respectively. The parameters drinking water quality test are proved that pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, electrical conductivity, heavy metals and the content of Escherichia coli bacteria are agreed with drinking water quality standards based on PERMENKES regulations No. 492/MENKES/Per/IV/2010. The FO drinking water bag based chitosan membrane has the potential to be used as an alternative solution for energy drinking water supply in an emergency.</jats:p>",

We find that a manufacturer prefers offering a Money-Back Guarantee (MBG) as long as the net salvage value of the returned product is positive in a channel. However, the return strategy of the retailer is more affected by the return policy of another channel than the net salvage value. In order to reduce online returns, we propose the online product customization channel, and then, we examine the choice of return policy and the manufacturer’s channel selection. We show that the demand and profit of the manufacturer will increase to a certain extent when opening an online customization channel. However, compared to the case where both channels provide an MBG, the implementation of online customization may hurt the manufacturer’s profits with the increase in consumer satisfaction in indirect channels.</jats:p>"

The model was based on a typical Dutch maize chain, with maize grown in the Black Sea region, and transported by ship to the Netherlands for use as an ingredient in compound feed for dairy cattle. Six different scenarios, with different aflatoxin concentrations at harvest and possible aflatoxin production during transport, were used. By minimizing the costs and using parameters such as the concentration, the variance of the sampling plan, and the monitoring and replacement costs, the model optimized the control points (CPs; e.g., after harvest, before or after transport by sea ship), the number of batches sampled at the CP, and the number of samples per batch. This optimization approach led to an end‐of‐chain aflatoxin concentration below the predetermined limit. The model showed that, when postharvest aflatoxin production was not possible, it was most cost‐effective to collect samples from all batches and replace contaminated batches directly after the harvest, since the replacement costs were the lowest at the origin of the chain. When there was aflatoxin production during storage, it was most cost‐effective to collect samples and replace contaminated batches after storage and transport to avoid the duplicate before and after monitoring and replacement costs. Further along the chain a contaminated batch is detected, the more stakeholders are involved, the more expensive the replacement costs and possible recall costs become.</jats:p>",

Time series images from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for monitoring chlorophyll-a in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, which neighboring countries depend upon for desalination as their freshwater resource. Bi-daily MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites were used to detect both vertical migration and horizontal movement of algal blooms. The results will be useful for creating an early warning system for desalination plants to anticipate operating strategies and intake locations to minimize impacts.</jats:p>",

Green supply chain practices focus on assimilating environmental thinking into the conventional supply chain, including areas like product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing processes, delivery of the final product as well as end-of-life management of the product after its useful life. To put it simply, green supply chain practices deal in creating an environmentally friendly supply chain that will result in an organization that not only sustains itself, but also the environment around it. This research work was conducted in South Punjab, Pakistan to see whether or not people perceived green supply chain practices important and whether that would affect their decision to dine at a certain place. To serve the purpose of the research, the data was acquired from the general population of South Punjab. The respondents included students from intermediate, people who held jobs, housewives etc. with a sample of 260 chosen randomly. The overall findings state that consumer perception is significantly affected by green supply chain practices in the fast food industry. The research is limited due to the time constraints, financial constraints and limited availability of the data. The results of this research study may not generalize to other province of the Pakistan as the study is conducted only in the context of South Punjab.</jats:p>"

Analyzing of electrical distribution networks is considered of highest priority at the present time in Iraq. This paper presents efficient practical methods for calculating the main parameters of the distribution network based on scientific and practical fundamentals. In this work the analysis is based on the advanced RasterWin3 software as a tool for the calculation of a basic parameters for distribution network performing the required analysis. RasterWin3 software is practical and efficient analysis software used by many electrical companies worldwide. The distribution network calculation was implemented (11/33) kV. The calculation results showed that the voltage deviation exceeds the maximum permissible value and is 12% in normal mode and 40% in emergency mode. Power losses in the branches of the power system of Iraq reach 20% of the consumed electricity. This is justified by the low quality of electricity and overload of the power supply system.</jats:p>",

A total of 1391 articles were obtained. On this basis, a bibliometric analysis method was utilized to study the literature characteristics and research hotspots of green supply chain management research. Our results show the following: (1) The current amount of published literature on the field of green supply chain management is exponentially increasing. Research on green supply chain management tended to develop after 2013. (2) The current research on green supply chain management has not formed a core author group and among the literatures on green supply chain management, only a few authors reported some influential literatures. (3) It can be seen from the comprehensive average citation frequency and the number of publications that Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of Southern Denmark and others have a strong research capability and a large field influence in the field of green supply chain management research. (4) There are 13 core journals publishing the research of green supply chain management, covering 10 fields including engineering, mathematics and social issues. (5) At present, the research hotspots of green supply chain management mainly include the following: Green production and innovation, green supply chain management theory and method, and sustainable supply chain environment and performance. Finally, this paper analyses the shortcomings of previous research and proposes a future direction for research development.</jats:p>"

This work presents the development of a new technique to perform disinfection, based on pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment. Hoagland solution inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum was selected as the specimen to verify the effectiveness of PEF treatment. The results indicate that PEF deactivated most Fusarium oxysporum in nutrient solution within a few seconds with the maximum disinfection efficiency achieved being 99.84%. The disinfection efficiency became higher with the extending of treatment time or the increase of PEF strength, while the initial microbial density was proven to play no role. Temperature rise indicates that PEF treatment played the dominant role in the process of disinfection. The energy efficiency depends mainly on treatment time and electric field intensity. The optimal operating conditions were found to be: treatment time less than 10 seconds and electric field strength around 5 kV/cm. This investigation implies that, in the future, PEF treatment has the potential to be applied to disinfect nutrient solution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The unbalanced use of phosphorus fertilizers at the global scale has resulted in phosphorus fertilizer scarcity in less developed areas as well as eutrophication problems in developed and large emerging countries. Historically, the uneven distribution of phosphate rock has been regarded as the major reason for this unbalanced use. However, the international trade of commodities may also play an important role in the unbalanced use of phosphorus fertilizers. By tracing the trade flows of commodities, we found that nearly 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer was embodied in traded commodities, which were mainly exported from large emerging countries (with low phosphorus use efficiencies) to developed countries (e.g., the US, Western Europe and Japan, commonly with high phosphorus use efficiencies). Furthermore, among the 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer embodied in traded commodities, 2.5 Tg was embodied in the trade of commodities from industry, construction, and services. Our results indicate that this trade pattern could create substantial mutual benefits if improvements are made to the phosphorus supply chain. With technology transfer and financial support from developed countries, large emerging countries could use phosphorus fertilizers more efficiently, thereby reducing the risk of eutrophication and lowering the cost of agricultural production. The phosphorus fertilizers saved by large emerging countries could be partially used to enhance food production in Sub‐Saharan African countries. This optimized supply chain could reduce eutrophication, conserve phosphate rock resources, and enhance global agricultural production.</jats:p>",

In this paper, considering the randomness of electric vehicles, probabilistic multiple scenarios generation method is proposed based on Latin hypercube sampling method, Cholesky decomposition and synchronous back-off reduction, realizing the quick scenario generation with the balance of scenario number and precision. Based on probabilistic multi-scene, taking the power supply ability of distribution network as the main objective, a robust operation optimization model of distribution network containing electric vehicles is established in order to optimize the opening and closing status of the switches. Ant colony algorithm based on the Pareto optimal is adopted to solve the model. A modified IEEE 33 node system is used to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm, and simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively promote the power supply ability of distribution networks, and can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model in the case that lots of uncertain parameters exist due to large-scale integration of electric vehicles.</jats:p>",

It would be useful to determine the best forecasting method to predict the certain condition. The two methods are Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which would be applied in this study. The data was obtained from the instant noodle dataset where it was in random normal distribution. The forecasting demands signal have Mean Squared Error (MSE) where it is used to measure the bullwhip effect in the supply chain member. The magnification of order among the member of the supply chain would influence the inventory. It is quite important to understand forecasting techniques and the bullwhip effect for the warehouse manager to manage the inventory in the warehouse, especially in probabilistic demand of the customer. This process determines the appropriate inventory policy for the retailer. The result from this study shows that ANN and SVR have the variance of 0.00491 and 0.07703, the MSE was 1.55e-6 and 1.53e-2, and the total BWE was 95.61 and 1237.19 respectively. It concluded that the ANN has a smaller variance than SVR, therefore, the ANN has a better performance than SVR, and the ANN has smaller BWE than SVR. At last, the inventory policy was determined with the continuous review policy for the uncertainty demand in the supply chain member.</jats:p>"

We investigate this research question by looking at whether there is a systematic relationship between whether a household grows crops for a supermarket chain—participation in the supermarket channel—and how concentrated among fewer crops are that household's total landholdings and its output. Using longitudinal data from India, we find that there is no relationship between whether a household participates in the supermarket channel and that household's Herfindahl–Hirschman index for land, but there is a robust statistically significant and negative relationship between whether a household participates in the supermarket channel and that household's Herfindahl–Hirschman index for output. These findings hold true at both the extensive margin (i.e., when considering whether a household participates in the supermarket channel) and the intensive margin (i.e., when considering how much of a household's marketed output is sold through the supermarket chain). This suggests that instead of fostering a greater degree of specialization, participation in modern food supply chains might lead to greater diversification.</jats:p>",

While it was thought the SoS Regulation had pursued exhaustive harmonization standards in the definition of protected costumers, the ECJ's judgment in Eni and Others reopened the question. This article, instead, argues that the Court got it wrong.

It plays a significant role in the dynamic performance and safety. Commonly, the fuel supply system is always simplified as a linear system which means that the relationship between valve opening and fuel flow rate is linear. However, the servo actuator and metering valve have some nonlinear characteristics such as hysteresis, dead zone, relay, and saturation. These nonlinear characteristics can directly affect the dynamic performance of the hybrid system. In this paper, a 328kW SOFC-GT hybrid system was taken as a research object. Firstly, a fuel supply system model considering the nonlinear characteristic was combined with the hybrid system. Then, the effect of dead zone-relay characteristic of servo amplifier was analyzed. The results show that the dead zone width has a great effect on the dynamic performance of the hybrid system. When the dead zone width is too small, the fuel flow rate will be oscillating causing unstable of the electrical characteristics in SOFC. The hybrid system will be stable with the increase of dead zone width. However, the larger dead zone width causes the hysteresis and the increase of the dynamic response time. At an improvement method with a two-dimensional fuzzy compensation was proposed. The results show that the fuzzy compensation can solve the oscillation problem caused by the dead zone-delay effectively. Finally, a servo actuator experiment system is developed based on an electro-hydraulic servo actuator facility and a software component of fuzzy compensator. The test rig was conducted an experiment to validate the simulation result. The results show that the experiment results match well with the simulation results.</jats:p>",

One of such regions is the Republic of Crimea, where the situation with water supply is a serious problem after the water supply through the North Crimean canal has been stopped since 2014. The authors present the results of the spatial database’s development with the aggregated materials about the surface runoff and groundwater resources, the factors affecting their formation, collected in the research process. The database includes the information about the volumes of water consumption and the quality of the water used in the Crimean peninsula. The structure of the database created as a cartographic support for the assessment of water availability in the region is described. On the basis of the obtained data, a series of maps is created, which is an example of structuring the data and the possibility of their targeted use for the rapid display of such indicators, that will enable us to present the water availability of the Crimean regions in various aspects, as well as for solving other applied problems.\n</jats:p>",

Many of these rivers terminate at the great deltas of the world (home to 500 million people), which depend on fluvial sediments for their very existence. While fluvial sediment loads of large rivers have already been greatly modified by human activities, climate change is expected to further exacerbate the situation. But how does the effect of climate change on fluvial sediment loads compare with that of human impacts? Here, we address this question by combining historical observations and 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century projections for one of the world’s largest 25 rivers containing two mega dams; Pearl River, China. Our analysis shows that variations in fluvial sediment supply to the coast from the Pearl river over a ~150 year study period are dominated by human activities. Projected climate change driven 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century increases in riverflow will only compensate for about 1% of the human induced deficit in sediment load, leading to the coastal zone being starved of about 6000 Mt of sediment over the remainder of this century. A similar dominance of human impacts on fluvial sediment supply is likely at other heavily engineered rivers.</jats:p>"

These perceptions are based on a <jats:italic>spillover effect</jats:italic>. The research study is set up across three experiments. Study one tests for the spillover effect in supply chain TBL‐related news and demonstrates that negative supply chain news across all three TBL dimensions reduces quality perceptions. Study two examines the effect across three levels of negative news intensity and finds that the spillover effect is consistent, even with stronger levels of negativity. Study three investigates whether a firm can improve damaged quality perceptions and purchase intentions through a recovery effort. The results of study three suggest that consumers' perceptions and purchase intentions are generally reparable. Collectively, the findings should encourage firms to more rigorously consider how news about their supply chain operations may impact consumers' perceptions and intentions toward the firm's products.</jats:p>",

With an increasing inflow of American tourists, planning and forecasting the US tourists’ inflow to Slovenia have gained far more importance attention amongst scholars and practitioners. This study, therefore, was conducted to forecast the American tourists’ inflow to Slovenia using one of the predictive models based on the exponential smoothing approach, namely Holt-Winters damped additive (HWDA) exponential smoothing method. The model was modified by several improvements, while the obtained results were generalized to other supply chain components. The results show that the forecasting system can predict well the observed inflow, while the methodology used to derive the model might have enriched the plethora of existing practical forecasting approaches in the tourism domain. Benchmarking demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms a competitive ARIMA model and official forecasts. The practical implications are also discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",

Each change of the technological parameters of the operation mode at the input of the gas transmission system will necessarily cause the reaction of the system which will manifest itself in changing the corresponding parameters at its output. Obviously, the parameters of the input and output of the system are interconnected by a complex system of equations, the implementation of which requires certain time costs and gathering additional information about the technical and hydrogasdynamic states of the system at each moment. Under the conditions of incomplete loading of the gas transmission system, which involves frequent changes in its operation modes, the accomplishment of the task is not always possible. It is suggested to create a system of integral coefficients of influence which characterize the ratio of input and output information in different stationary modes, and formally submit it in a matrix form. The processes characterized by integral coefficients of influence implicitly contain the technological parameters of the gas pipeline (length, diameter, hydraulic resistance coefficient, heat transfer to the environment, etc.) which can not always be determined with sufficient accuracy by the deterministic methods. The suggested methodology involves the creation of simple and effective methods of predicting which allow estimating the state of the gas pipeline by the costs and pressures at the inputs and outputs of the system, that is, by the operational data that are being monitored. On the basis of the proposed methodology, it is suggested to create an operational system that will allow managing the modes of operation of the main gas pipeline in cases of frequent changes in pumping volumes. When changing the technological scheme of the gas transmission system, there is a need to adapt the integral coefficients of influence. The application of the proposed methods is illustrated by the example of the main gas pipeline Soyuz.</jats:p>"

The study analyzed 120 drinking water samples linked to 236 cholera patients. Nearly 82% of the samples met the national criteria for thermotolerant coliforms of 50 cfu/100 ml, while 50% met the more stringent World Health Organization criteria of 0 cfu/100 ml. In terms of the human dimensions, 68% of survey respondents reported that they treated their water, while knowledge of prevention, transmission and treatment of cholera was also generally high. However, of the 32 patients whose drinking water sources had thermotolerant coliforms of 200+ cfu/100 ml, seven reported they felt a low or no personal risk for contracting cholera in the future and their community was extremely well prepared for another outbreak. The cost of a reactive response to cholera outbreaks puts a burden on Malawi, providing an opportunity for investment in innovative and localized preventive strategies to control and eliminate the risk of cholera while acknowledging social and cultural norms.</jats:p>",

The spatial vector autoregressive model with calendars variation can accommodate these three things. The purpose of this study is to compare two types of spatial vector autoregressive models with calendar variations, namely restricted and non-restricted coefficient to model inflation and the money supply in Surabaya, Malang, Kediri, and Jember simultaneously.

The aim of our study was the biofortification of broccoli sprouts with selenium nanoparticles (NSePs) and evaluation of growth parameters, assimilator pigments content, total phenols, glucosinolates content along with antioxidant capacity, in order to boost value added output, such as improved nutrition and food functionality. NSePs were prepared by reduction of NaHSeO3 using glucose as reducing agent, and characterized from structural and morphological point of view. The growth of broccoli seedlings was dependent on NSePs concentration. The treatment with 10 and 50 ppm NSePs caused a slight increase in total biomass, by contrast with 100 ppm treatment. Chlorophyll content, total carotenoid and total phenols content was not affected by the treatment of broccoli sprouts with different concentrations of NSePs. Instead, the content of individual glucosinolates varied between the samples, depending on the levels of NSePs. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained for 100 ppm NSePs concentration. The effective uptake of NSePs was further demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy and Hyperspectral Microscopy. NSePs did not induce any toxicity on broccoli sprouts. Moreover, broccoli supply with NSePs may target higher nutritional impact and health benefits.\r\n \r\n*********\r\nIn press - Online First.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Tarkwa district is an important gold mining area in the Southwestern part of Ghana. The main source of potable water supply to the Tarkwa Nsuaem Municipality is from the Bonsa River treatment plant managed by the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). The River is under threat from serious contamination by illegal mining (\"galamsey\") activities within its catchment area. Consequently, the amount of water supplied to the Municipality has not kept pace with its growing population due to increasing treatment cost and supply difficulties. The need to find alternative and sustainable sources of potable water supply to augment that from GWCL to the Municipality has become imperative. A large void volume created as a result of the abandoned underground mine operated by Gold Fields Ghana Limited (GFGL), after its closure in 1999 has flooded. This potential water resource is being pumped out daily, and wasted, sometimes spilling-over to low lying areas around the mine when allowed to reach its decant level. This study estimated the quantity of water in the Abontiakoon Vertical Shaft (AVS) which is part of the large underground void using survey production figures and post-closure void filling parameters resulting in 2.8 x 106 m3 and 2.9 x 106 m3 respectively. The rate of recharge to the underground water was also estimated to ascertain the sustainability of the void water should it be considered for use by employing the model of predicting rebound on “void filling” basis and average dewatering rate before closure at 2 535 m3/day and 2 618 m3/day respectively; indicating that recharge to the AVS reservoir is about 6 x 106 gal/day or 30% of current daily water supply deficit in the TNM. The estimated potential volume of mine water in storage in the entire Tarkwa underground void is 32 x106 m3. Two samples of the mine water were taken in November 2011 and February 2015 for quality analysis, in order to have a fair knowledge of the water quality parameters. The quality of the underground water was found to be potentially good, and not likely to cause any health threats, or water quality problems. Depth sampling is recommended to determine the chemical profile of the reservoir. Keywords: Reservoir, Municipality, Bonsa River, Contamination, Tarkwa</jats:p>"

However, the possible link between long-term aeolian dust supply and primary productivity in the western North Pacific remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of major and trace elements and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations of sediments from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1430 in the southern Japan Sea, in order to reconstruct oceanic palaeoproductivity evolution and test its possible link to Asian dust input since 4 Ma. Palaeoproductivity proxies indicate remarkable increases in productivity at ∼3–2 Ma followed by high-frequency oscillations in productivity since 1.2 Ma. We suggest that higher dust-derived iron supply from Central Asia at 3–2 Ma, which was likely driven by the growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, could account for enhanced primary productivity and export production in the Japan Sea. Such increased oceanic palaeoproductivity could enhance organic carbon burial, which might contribute to the decrease in atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations, and provide a positive feedback to the global cooling. However, the Tsushima Warm Current (TSWC) intrusion via the southern Tsushima Strait, which was controlled by glacioeustatic sea level changes, has been the principal cause of the rapid changes in primary productivity and benthic redox condition since 1.2 Ma, regardless of continuously increased Asian dust input.</jats:p>",

The produced electron will be accelerated through a potential different by a DC High Voltage Power Supply (DCHVPS). Whereby this filament power supply is connected with the DCHVPS, therefore the isolation of high voltage is required. For such purpose, the specifications and the isolation mechanisms of the filament power supply have been identified.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A distinct suite of sand bedforms has been observed to occur in laboratory flows with limited sand supply. As sand supply to the bed progressively increases one observes sand ribbons, discrete barchans and, eventually, channel spanning dunes; but there are relatively few observations of this sequence from natural river channels. Furthermore, there are few observations of transitions from limited sand supply to abundant supply in the field. Bedforms developed under limited, but increasing, sand supply downstream of the abrupt gravel–sand transition in the Fraser River, British Columbia, are examined using multi‐beam swath‐bathymetry obtained at high flow. This is an ideal location to study supply‐limited bedforms because, due to a break in river slope, sand transitions from washload upstream of the gravel–sand transition to bed material load downstream. Immediately downstream, barchanoid and isolated dunes are observed. Most of the bedform field has gaps in the troughs, consistent with sand moving over a flat immobile or weakly mobile gravel bed. Linear, alongstream bedform fields (trains of transverse dunes formed on locally thick, linear deposits of sand) exhibit characteristics of sand ribbons with superimposed bedforms. Further downstream, channel spanning dunes develop where the bed is composed entirely of sand. Depth scaling of the dunes does not emerge in this data set. Only where the channel has accumulated abundant sand on the bed do the dunes exhibit scaling congruent with previous data compilations. The observations suggest that sediment supply plays an important, but often overlooked, role in bedform scaling in rivers.</jats:p>",

These models are, respectively, similar to the traditional static independent policy model and the traditional static synchronized cycle model, except that the deterministic demands of the buyers in the above two static models are now being replaced by the stochastic demands satisfying a Wiener process, which have more real‐life applications. Similar to the above static synchronized cycles model, the synchronization of the supply chain in our DSC model is also achieved by scheduling the delivery days of the buyers and coordinating them with the vendor's production cycle. Finding the optimal expected system costs of the DIO model and the DSC model involves solving optimal parameter selection problems governed by ordinary differential equations, whose final times are continuous decision variables and discrete decision variables, respectively. Computational methods have been developed for solving these problems. Numerical results show that the coordinated policy is better than the independent optimization policy, in terms of minimizing the expected system cost of the entire supply chain. Sensitivity analysis is performed to test the effect of changing the cost coefficients and the \n<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/oca2524-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:oca:media:oca2524:oca2524-math-0001\" /> value on the performances of these models, where \n<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/oca2524-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:oca:media:oca2524:oca2524-math-0002\" /> is the ratio of the total mean demand rate of all the buyers over the vendor's production rate.</jats:p>",

Utilising Integrated Environmental Solution Virtual Environment (IESVE) as the simulation tool, solar panel retrofitted to the existing terrace houses in urban centres across peninsular Malaysia is investigated in order to identify its potential to displace current grid electricity demand, consequently shaving peak demand and reduced household’s ‘s electricity bill.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy consumption of urban central heating in northern China is two to four times that in northern Europe and other countries. Beijing has adopted measures, such as ‘coal to gas’ and ‘coal to electricity’, to reduce environmental pollution caused by central heating. Given a peak-to-valley difference in the electricity supply of power plant, which is uneven day and night, this study proposes to store the night-time off-peak electricity in the form of heat energy and drive the ammonia absorption system in the form of steam or hot water during peak or flat electricity. Simulation results of ammonia absorption cooling and heating dual-supply system show that heat source temperature increases, evaporation temperature increases, and cooling water temperature decreases are all beneficial to improve the refrigeration coefficient in the summer cooling condition. In the meantime, heat source temperature increases, evaporation temperature increases, and cooling water temperature decreases are beneficial for increasing the heating coefficient in the winter heating condition. The heating and cooling coefficients of the system are 1.38 and 0.65 in the optimal working condition in winter and summer. Benefit analysis shows that, compared with central heating and cold storage air conditioning, the system can save 576,000 tons of standard coal and 1.417 million tons of carbon dioxide if used in 12% of the cooling and heat supply areas in Beijing. The potential for energy saving and emission reduction is large.</jats:p>"

Finally, a concept of myocardial ischemia that focusses on the reduction of coronary blood flow to below 8–10 µl/g per beat with consequences for myocardial electrical, metabolic, contractile and morphological features is advocated. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we analysed the combined use of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager data to monitor a eutrophic aquatic environment under adverse cloudy conditions, from July 2016 to July 2018. Data pre-selection was performed, and then the images were acquired for further investigation. After that, we created a key to the interpretation of cloud conditions for the study area and grouped each of 125 scenes in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA grouped months with similarities in cloud conditions, highlighting their patterns in terms of the rainy and dry seasons for the study area. Another interesting result was that, even under the inherent adverse cloud regime of the Amazon, the combined use of both free satellite imagery data could be useful for further analyses, such as measuring of chlorophyll a, coloured dissolved organic matters, total suspended solids and turbidity. However, we highlight that, firstly, studies must be made to validate the data in situ, so that monitoring programs can be built through remote sensing applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High spending, especially out-of-pocket (OOP) payment on insulin, could lead individuals with diabetes to skip or ration doses and worsen future health outcomes. We examined the trends in total and OPP payment on a yearly supply of insulin by type from 2003 to 2016. Using the 2003-2016 MarketScan claims database, we analyzed 1,703,343 adults with diabetes who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service health plans. Insulin was grouped into 6 types (human insulin, Glargine, Lispro, Aspart, Detemir and Glulisine) using National Drug Code. Total and OOP payment for each drug type were modelled at a 30-day supply level, and later multiplied by 12 to obtain yearly estimates. A joinpoint regression was used to identify inflection points and to estimate trends in each defined segment. Payments were standardized to 2016 USD. The total payment for insulin increased at annual rate of $162 per year from 2003 ($1982) to 2012 ($3686), followed by more than a 3-fold increase in the annual rate of increase to $708 per year between 2013 ($4392) and 2016 ($6250). By type, the annual rate of increases ranged from $64 (2%) for Glulisine to $133 (6%) for Glargine before the inflection point and raised to a range from $631 (16%) for Glargine to $1246 (26%) for Glulisine after the inflection point. OPP payment on a yearly supply of insulin decreased by $6 per year (-1.5%) between 2003 ($390) and 2009 ($384) followed by a 3% ($12) per year increase between 2010 ($405) and 2016 ($451). The annual rate of changes ranged from -$72 (14.8%) for Detemir to -$31 (-6%) for Glulisine before the inflection point and varied from $8 (2%) for Aspart to $41 (7.6%) for Glulisine after the inflection point. Total payment on a yearly supply of insulin had been increasing since 2003 but accelerated after 2011. The OPP payment reversed its trends from a decrease to an increase. But the much smaller increase in OPP payment than the total payment after 2011 suggests that payers bore most of the insulin spending increase.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>H.

Application of dual-fuel engines is considered as a potential solution to these problems. In the dual-fuel engine, a natural gas-air mixture is ignited by a small amount of the diesel fuel directly injected into a combustion chamber. Pilot fuel injection parameters can strongly effect the combustion process. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of such fuel-supply parameters as pilot fuel mass, pilot fuel injection pressure, pilot fuel injection timing and excess air ratio on the combustion process. Investigation is based on the data obtained during bench tests conducted with the use of measurement equipment. The dependences of engine characteristics from the fuel supply parameters under review were obtained based on the results of the experimental study. Optimal values for every investigated fuel-supply parameter were chosen based on the obtained results. Over the course of the investigation, the coefficient for heat release rate according to the Vibe equation was calculated for each operating point.</jats:p>"

It was conducted interviews with the responsible for the concessionaire of the water supply in Maringa (SANEPAR), and also document evaluations. The results attest to the development of a project elaborated by SANEPAR in partnership with Parana Meteorologic System (SIMEPAR), with the intention of a more intelligent water supply system, that allows the prediction of possible floods in the water catchment plant by heavy rainfall. Thus, it can be concluded that there is the intention of implementing smart technologies, beginning with the protection to the catchment of the water, that can be extended to the operation of the whole water supply system of the municipality of Maringa.</jats:p>"

Since increasing the level of safety requires resources, it is important to identify most relevant risks and efficient ways to reach health-based targets. Over the past decades, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) developed into a systematic, science-based approach to assess microbial risks through drinking water supply. In this study we present the QMRA approach and how it can be used to support decisions in both affluent and developing countries. This includes examples from the statutory QMRA in the Netherlands that led to efficient and effective improvements in water supply, not only in treatment, but also in monitoring and operation.

This advanced method is investigated using HOMER Pro simulation and compared with a widely accepted technique called overall peak load method for a chosen case study. The comparison simulation results showed that by using the power consumption model method, the energy-saving efficiency at the TT is improved by 24.19% and the size of the overall system is decreased by 33.33%.

The first method involves removing injected water from the well fitting under long well operation stoppage at negative ambient temperatures. Water is removed and air is supplied through the system of valves (a spring loaded valve and a float valve). When pumping water into the injection well, the float valve closes the access to the environment, and the spring-loaded valve is open for injected water. When the injection process stops, the spring-loaded valve supplies remaining water into the well fittings and the surface part of the water supply line and closes; the float valve opens. Air into the free space of the well fittings is supplied through the float valve thereby preventing the wellhead and the surface part of the water supply line from freezing. The second method is used to prevent the mouth of the injection well from freezing. A device is installed inside the casing, which allows heat to be accumulated in summer and winter. Accumulated heat is used to heat up the mouth when the water injection process stops.</jats:p>",

The use of battery energy storage systems in modern hybrid or entirely electric vessels is rapidly increasing globally in order to reduce emissions, save fuel and increase energy efficiency of ships. To fully utilise their benefits, certain technical issues need to be addressed. One of the most important aspects is to explore alternative ways of charging batteries with high power capacities for modern vessels. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of battery-charging configurations and discusses the technical challenges of each design from the perspective of their practical implementation, both onshore and onboard a vessel. It is found that the proposed models are suitable for vessels operating either entirely on battery storage or having it integrated into the onboard power system. Moreover, the proposed charging models in a harbour area can solve the problem of charging batteries for future hybrid and electric vessels and can open new business opportunities for ship owners and port administrators. The performance of the proposed models is validated by simulating two case studies in PSCAD: slow charging (based onshore) and fast charging (based onboard).</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a pricing model for transfers of water rights from agriculture to industry in water-deficient areas of China. Both the cost price and the earnings price are considered and incorporated into the model. The cost price includes construction costs, operation and maintenance costs, renewal and reconstruction costs, and economic compensation for ecological damage. The earnings price is calculated according to a reasonable return coefficient and the difference in economic value of the water resources to the buyer and seller. The value of water resources was estimated based on emergy theory in accordance with the principle of mutual benefits equilibrium. This pricing model is then applied to the transfer of surplus water rights arising from agricultural water conservation schemes to industrial uses in the Southbank Ordos Irrigation Zone of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The results indicate that this pricing model could provide technical support to the scientific and reasonable pricing of water rights transactions in water-deficient areas and that it could play an active role in promoting the healthy development of future water markets.</jats:p>",

Numerical models of these networks are generally governed by many parameters for which the exact value is not known. This may be due to a lack of precise knowledge like for consumer demand or due to a lack of accessibility as for the pipe roughness. For network managers, the effect of these uncertainties on the network state is important information that supports them in the decision-making process. This effect is generally evaluated by propagating the uncertainties using the mathematical model. In the past, perturbation, fuzzy and stochastic collocation methods have been used for uncertainty propagation. However, these methods are limited either in the accuracy of the results or the computational effort of the necessary calculations. This paper uses an alternative spectral approach that uses the polynomial chaos expansion and has the potential to give results of comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo sampling through the definition of a stochastic model. This approach is applied to the hydraulic model of two real networks in order to evaluate the influence of uncertain demands on the water age.</jats:p>",

The effects of additions on membrane morphology and performance were investigated. Synthesized membrane had the properties of ultrafiltration membrane. Although PEI is not widely used for water treatment, in this study, the ferrous iron removal rate was investigated and good results were obtained. Through the membrane production experiments, the PEI content was 22 wt%. PVP was added as a pore-forming agent with concentrations of 2, 4 and 8 wt%. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as solvent. Distilled water was used for the coagulation bath. After production, all membranes were characterized by using contact angle, permeability, porosity, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/IR) analyses. With the increasing doses of PVP addition, the permeability of the PEI membranes produced in this study increased, while porosity results were changeable. The permeability was 23 L/m2h bar for the membrane with 2 wt% PVP content, while the permeability for the membrane with 8 wt% PVP content was 32 L/m2h bar. Contact angles increased with PVP addition to PEI membranes. With the increasing PVP concentration, the finger-like pores and the pores located in the sub-layer expanded.</jats:p>",

Network traffic state estimation to observe NFD when congestion is heterogeneously distributed, as a result of a time-varying and asymmetric demand matrix, is a challenging problem. Recent studies have formulated the NFD estimation problem using both fixed measurements and probe trajectories. They are often based on a given ground-truth NFD for a single day demand. Stochastic variations in network demand and supply may significantly affect the approximation of an NFD. This study proposes a modified framework to estimate network traffic states to observe NFD while capturing the stochasticity in transportation networks. A mixed integer problem with non-linear constraints is formulated to address stochasticity in the NFD estimation problem. To solve this Nondeterministic Polynomial-hard (NP-hard) problem, a solution algorithm based on the simulated annealing method is applied. The problem is formulated and the solution algorithm is implemented to find an optimal configuration of loop detectors and probe vehicles to estimate the NFD of the Chicago downtown network and capture its day-to-day variations, considering a given available budget. Ground-truth NFDs and estimated NFDs based on a subset of loop detectors and probe vehicles are calculated using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model, which is the best surrogate available to replicate real-world conditions. The main contribution of this study is to capture stochasticity in the demand and supply sides to find a more robust subset of links and trajectories to be acquired for the NFD estimation. </jats:p>",

To achieve this purpose, we developed a conceptual framework based on the literature review, which raised some hypotheses. In order to verify the hypotheses and validate the framework, we designed a multicriteria model called the KTT-GSCM Multicriteria Model, composed of two stages. The first stage describes factors that are relevant to GSCM, KTT, and Innovation, ascertaining which ones have influence over the others and which ones are influenced by the others, through the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The second stage of the model analyzes the level of each perspective in each company and in the supply chain as a whole, thus verifying the hypotheses. This model was applied in 13 firms of a supply chain that has a rotomolding firm as a focal company. Through the development and application of the model, it was possible to verify the hypotheses raised and conclude that the perspectives of GSCM, KTT, and Innovation are, in fact, influenced by one another and that both Innovation and KTT promote greater development in GSCM.</jats:p>"

At present, in the area of regional water supply, models are mainly used to study the problem of overall water guarantee rate, and do not take into account the impact of the uncertainty of multi-source water supplies on water supply risk. There is also a lack of research on how changes in multi-source water supplies affect sub-region and sub-user water guarantee rates. To address this knowledge gap, the encounter probability of different frequencies and a refined water resources allocation model of multi-source supplies were used. Using Tianjin as an example, this paper studies the quantitative relationship between the uncertainty of multi-source water inflows and the regional guarantee rate of water use. The objectives of the study are to analyze the changing trend of the water shortage rate and the main body of water supply in each region, and to quantitatively describe the influence of the variation of multi-source water supply on the main body of water supply for users. The results show that under the same requirement of guarantee rate for water use, as the number of water diversion sources increase, the probability of water supply meeting the water use rate increases significantly, and the risk to water supplies decreases. At the same time, suburban areas have a low dependence on external water supplies, while the change in the quantity of external water sources has a great impact on the water supply of the Zhongxinchengqu and Binhaixiqnu areas. The distribution and main body of water supply will change for different water users. Therefore, it is important to ensure a stable supply of external water for maintaining the guarantee rate of regional water use.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increases in the number of new oral antidiabetic medications in the last decade have resulted in a change in payments. We examined the trends in total payment and patients’ out-of-pocket (OOP) payments on a yearly supply of various oral antidiabetic drug types from 2003 to 2016. We analyzed 1,803,427 adults with diabetes under fee for service plans from the 2003-2016 MarketScan commercial claims database. Antidiabetic drugs were grouped using National Drug Codes. Total and OOP payment for each drug type were modelled at a 30-day supply level, and later multiplied by 12 to obtain yearly estimates. Joinpoint regression was applied to identify the inflection point for trend changes and to estimate the magnitude of change in each defined segment. Payments were standardized to 2016 USD. Total payment for a yearly supply of newer drug types grew sharply after 2012, with an increasing rate of $334 (11%), $598 (10%), and $414 (11%) per year for DPP-4, GLP-1 and SGLT2, respectively (all p&amp;lt; 0.01). For older drugs, a decrease in total payment for a yearly supply was observed among Sulfonylurea (-$9,-6%), Meglitinide (-$595,-34%), AGI (-$71.41, -10%) and TZD (-$721,-48%) per year after 2012 (all p &amp;lt;0.01). Metformin is the only exception, which was found to have sharply increased at annual rate of $75 (32%, p&amp;lt;0.01) for a yearly supply. Although total payment escalated over time, OOP payment on most drug types remained during the study periods (all p-values &amp;gt;0.05). Only OOP payments on DPP-4, GLP-1, SGLT2 increased after 2010, but all below 5% per year and with p-values &amp;gt;0.05. Patterns of changes in payment on a yearly supply of drugs varied by drug type. Payment on older drugs tended to decline with exception of an increase for Metfomin. Payment increases on newer oral drugs tended to accelerate over time. OPP payments also varied by drug types but mostly declined over time, implying that the increase in payment for the newer drugs was mainly borne by payers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>H.

This paper examined multifactorial determinants (personal, family, community, and health services) associated with maternal nutrition practices in Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were from a household survey of pregnant (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 667) and recently delivered women (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1,835). Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the determinants of four outcomes: consumption of diverse diets, consumption of iron folic acid (IFA) and calcium tablets, and weight monitoring during pregnancy. Population attributable risk analysis was used to estimate how much the outcomes can be improved under optimal program implementation. During pregnancy, women consumed 28 IFA and 8 calcium tablets, 18% consumed diverse diet, and 17% were weighed ≥3 times. Nutrition knowledge was associated with consumption of diverse diet (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2 times), IFA (2.3 times), calcium (11.7 times), and weight monitoring (1.3 times). Beliefs and self‐efficacy were associated with IFA (OR = 2.0) and calcium consumption (OR = 4.6). Family support and adequate health services were also associated with better nutrition practices. Under optimal program implementation, we estimate that 51% of women would have adequate diet diversity, an average consumption of 98 IFA, and 106 calcium tablets, and women would be weighed 4.9 times during pregnancy. Strengthening existing program operations and increasing demand for services has the potential to result in large improvements in maternal nutrition practices from current baseline levels but may not be sufficient to meet World Health Organization‐recommended levels without creating an enabling environment including improvements in education and income levels to support behaviour change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2002, a widely publicized report projected an anatomy educator shortage based on department chairpersons' perceptions. Now, 17 years later, the question lingers: “Does an anatomy educator shortage persist and, if so, how severe is the shortage?” Trends in the number, type, and fill rate of anatomy educator job openings were explored by analyzing job posting in the United States over the past two years. A survey was distributed to leaders of anatomy‐related departments in the United States, Canada, and European Union. Most departmental leaders who responded (65% or more) from the United States/Canada (n = 81) and the European Union (n = 52) anticipate they will have “moderate” to “great” difficulty hiring anatomy educators in gross anatomy, histology, and embryology over the next five years. Within the United States, the number of anatomy educator job postings at medical schools more than doubled from at least 21 postings in 2017 to 52 postings in 2018. Twenty‐one percent of postings between 2017 and 2018 were never filled. While the number of anatomy educator openings within the United States/Canada is perceived to remain in a steady state for the next five years, the European Union estimates a five‐fold increase in the number of openings. Departmental leaders prioritize anatomy educator applicants who have teaching experience (mean ± SD = 4.64 ± 0.84 on five‐point Likert scale), versatility in teaching multiple anatomy disciplines (3.93 ± 1.07), and flexibility in implementing various teaching pedagogies (3.69 ± 1.17).

The algorithm can provide the configuration scheme of distributed generators installed capacity in line with the given load demand. Comprehensively considering the output characteristics of distributed sources such as wind and photovoltaic generators in different timeframes, the outputs of distributed generators are classified into several typical modes, and the installed capacity of distributed generator is matched in line with the representative output mode and the load demand curve so as to realize the balance of energy supply and demand in the industry park. The energy storage device is used to balance the energy due to the asynchronism of the distributed generator output and the load demand. The capacity requirements of the battery under various installed capacities of distributed generators are provided. The proposed algorithm is programmed in MATLAB and verified by the actual data of an industry park in northeast China. The results show that the proposed algorithm can comprehensively consider the output characteristics of distributed generator in different time ranges, and provide reasonable matching schemes of energy supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Post-glacial climate, vegetation and fire history were reconstructed from a sediment record from Begbie Lake, British Columbia, Canada, located in a municipal water supply area servicing &gt; 350,000 people. Watershed managers have identified wildfire as a threat to water supply and seek to understand how vegetation and fire have varied through time with climate. In the cold late-glacial, open Pinus woodlands, periodically disturbed by fire, transitioned to mixed conifer forests subject to high-severity fire. The early Holocene is of interest to watershed managers because climate was warmer and drier than present. During this interval, low streamflow, abundant fire-adapted taxa, elevated background charcoal and regional increases in biomass burning indicate that fire seasons were longer and that fire was an important disturbance mechanism. Climate moistened in the mid Holocene, facilitating canopy closure and decreased fire disturbance. However, surface fires prevailed in Quercus ecosystems, which were expanding locally. Charcoal increased between 6180–2500 cal yr BP as climate further cooled and moistened, likely reflecting human activity and/or increased climate variability. Modern conditions arose within the last few millennia, impacted most recently by European settlement. In combination with paleoclimate modelling, modern management practices and forecast simulations, the Begbie Lake record informs about ecosystem changes within the watershed, yielding insights for management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In literature it is believed that the dual price of water is an objective premise for shaping the market price of water. However, the authors note that a single vector of dual prices in the distribution of water, when ambiguous, should not become the basis for making decisions both regulating the price of water and affecting the procedures for modernizing the water supply network. This work cautions water management engineers not to duplicate common software errors and indicates how, despite the complete lack of literature tips, the technical problems encountered could be practically solved. The linear dependence of the row vectors of the left-hand parameters of binding constraints in the linear programming model for water consumption is identified here as the reason for the ambiguity of dual price vectors. This ambiguity in the issues of water distribution requires shaping alternative technical scenarios allowing for a variant selection of the method for modifying the water abstraction system. Therefore, the principles for determining the proportionality of simultaneous changes in certain parameters of the right-hand conditions of constraint conditions are described. These principles for the optimal selection of the most productive vectors for the parametric linear programming method were formulated and indicated on a simplified model of water distribution. The methodology developed in the work enables, among others, generating alternative technical scenarios for saving varying amounts of water, resulting in various financial savings</jats:p>"

Here, we document shelf‐edge scale clinoform sets which prograded through the entire width of an epicontinental marine basin (ca. 400 km), eventually encroaching onto the opposite basin flank, where they started to prograde upslope and landward, in defiance of gravity (“upslope‐climbing clinoforms”). The giant westward‐prograding Eridanos muddy shelf‐edge clinothem originated from the Baltic hinterland in the Oligocene and achieved maximum regression in the Early Pleistocene, on the UK Central Graben (CG) and Mid North Sea High (MNSH), after crossing the whole North Sea mesopelagic depocentre and causing near complete basin infill. Here we integrate well and seismic data through the MNSH and CG and examine the Eridanos final heyday and demise, identifying five clinothem complexes (A1, A2, A3, B and C) and six depositional sequence boundaries (SB1 to SB6) in the Miocene‐Recent section. Tectonic and climatic events drove the recent evolution of this system. Early Pleistocene climate cooling, in particular, resulted in a stepwise increase in sediment supply. This climaxed in the earliest Calabrian, following a likely Eburonian eustatic fall (=SB3) when the Eridanos clastic wedge was restructured from a 100–300 m thick compound shelf‐edge and delta system to a “hybrid” shelf‐edge delta at sequence boundary SB3 (ca. 1.75 Ma). In the ca. 40 kyr that followed SB3, a progradation rate peak (&gt;1,000 m/kyr) is associated with clinoforms starting to accrete upslope, onto the east‐dipping slope between CG and MNSH. This “upslope‐climbing clinoform” phase was quickly followed by the maximum regression and final retreat of the Eridanos system in the Early Calabrian (=SB4), likely as the result of climate‐driven changes in the Baltic hinterland and/or delta auto‐retreat. To our knowledge, this contributions represents the first documentation of “upslope‐climbing clinoforms” recorded in the stratigraphic record.</jats:p>",

One of the proposals was a collaborative project between UBA and the National University of General Sarmiento. Based on the hypothesis that students’ voluntary involvement in social concerns improves their attitudes towards themselves and learning, the aim was to focus on the development of social and professional skills by implementing an interdisciplinary work for water quality and supply assessment in low-income homes from a southern district of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. Eighteen volunteers—Chemical and Civil Engineering students—were recruited during August–December 2016. Tasks were distributed according to their interests: survey making, sampling, lab analysis, infrastructure checking, etc. Volunteers were surveyed in social involvement, lab skills, data compilation and analysis, leading to a final report with recommendations for a proper water use. The survey results compiled their feedback: 72% admitted an update on water quality problems, 60% learned new lab techniques and were able to analyze results, 89% supported the University’s involvement in social concerns and 56% expanded their opinion about the professional field. The students confirmed their interest in participating in the next UBANEX project.</jats:p>",

A logistic (−1.12, 0.06) distribution could describe the bacterial reductions on chicken breasts at 50–60 °C. Weibull, exponential and log-linear models were compared for describing the bacterial reduction on chicken breasts at 70 °C and the Weibull model showed the best fit as indicated by the pseudo-R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error of prediction (SEP) values. For chicken wingettes, a logistic (−0.95, 0.07) distribution could be used to describe the bacterial reduction at 50–70 °C.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern operating conditions of large industrial enterprises require the provision of high reliability of power supply to consumers while reducing the cost of the electricity consumed. These requirements are ensured by the widespread introduction of own sources of electrical energy. These include combined heat and power plants, gas turbines, gas pistons and steam and gas power plants. At the same time, there is a significant complication of the industrial network configuration and possible emergency modes.\n\nOne of the emergency modes in such networks is the loss of excitation of the synchronous generator. The admissibility of such a regime is specified by regulatory documents. In this situation, the generator goes into asynchronous mode and consumes reactive power from the network. The purpose of this work is to identify the admissibility of the synchronous generator operation for a certain time in the asynchronous mode as a result of the loss of excitation. An algorithm has been developed to calculate the transient electromechanical process of a synchronous generator taking into account the loss of machine excitation. Investigations have been carried out for various operating modes of an industrial power plant taking into account the initial generator load using the KATRAN software. The calculation results allow determining the generator load by active power at which the synchronous generator can operate in the asynchronous mode without excitation.</jats:p>",

Rapeseed was subjected to control, B, P and B + P treatments, either with or without B. pumilus (PGPB) inoculation, and grown in pot culture for 6 weeks. In the absence of B. pumilus, the addition of B, P or both elements improved the growth of rapeseed compared with the control. Interestingly, B. pumilus inoculation inhibited plant growth and enhanced B uptake under B and B + P but not under control and P conditions. In addition, B. pumilus inoculation decreased the pH of soil under B and B + P supplies. Bacillus pumilus inoculation thus increased rapeseed B uptake and inhibited growth under B supply, which suggests that the effects of PGPB on rapeseed growth depend on the addition of B to soil. Bacillus pumilus inoculation may therefore be recommended for the enhancement of rapeseed B levels in B-deficient soils but not in B-sufficient ones.</jats:p>",

In the last decade, seawater desalination has consolidated its position as an alternative source to increase the supply for agricultural irrigation in Spain and Israel, where the farmers’ acceptance is progressively rising, despite the supply price being much higher than that of other conventional water sources. This article describes the current situation of desalinated seawater production and supply to agriculture in the southeast of Spain, and analyzes key questions such as its role in regional water planning, the infrastructure needed for conveyance and distribution, the energy requirements, the production and distribution costs, and the final price to farmers. The study is based on descriptive and quantitative data collected from desalination plants and irrigation district managers through technical questionnaires and personal interviews. The results show how seawater desalination is effectively alleviating the regional constraints in the irrigated agriculture supply, and why it is becoming strategic to maintaining food production and socioeconomic development. However, the high-energy requirements and associated costs in comparison with other water sources limit a more widespread use for agriculture, and for this reason desalinated water still only plays a complementary role in most irrigation districts.</jats:p>"

The growing demand and issues in the supply have raised interest in the microbial production of the sesquiterpene khusimol, the main compound of the vetiver essential oil due to its woody smell. In this study, we engineered the biosynthetic pathway for the production of (+)-zizaene, the immediate precursor of khusimol. A systematic approach of metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli was applied to modulate the critical bottlenecks of the metabolic flux towards (+)-zizaene. Initially, production of (+)-zizaene was possible with the endogenous methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the codon-optimized zizaene synthase (ZS). Raising the precursor E,E-farnesyl diphosphate supply through the mevalonate pathway improved the (+)-zizaene titers 2.7-fold, although a limitation of the ZS supply was observed. To increase the ZS supply, distinct promoters were tested for the expression of the ZS gene, which augmented 7.2-fold in the (+)-zizaene titers. Final metabolic enhancement for the ZS supply by using a multi-plasmid strain harboring multiple copies of the ZS gene improved the (+)-zizaene titers 1.3-fold. The optimization of the fermentation conditions increased the (+)-zizaene titers 2.2-fold, achieving the highest (+)-zizaene titer of 25.09 mg L−1. This study provides an alternative strategy to enhance the terpene synthase supply for the engineering of isoprenoids. Moreover, it demonstrates the development of a novel microbial platform for the sustainable production of fragrant molecules for the cosmetic industry.</jats:p>"

The study argues that joint knowledge development can be regarded as complementary assets to leverage supply chain information exchange (SCIE) and performance. This study used a resource-based view in its analysis. It employed statistical tests on a dataset consisting of 85 agricultural businesses in Vietnam, which was collected from a sample of 600 companies. The empirical results confirmed a strong association between a manufacturing fi rm’s information exchange and its joint knowledge development. Joint knowledge development has a mediating role in the supply chain such that SCIE can be attained. Accordingly, SCIE improves supply chain satisfaction and the operational and financial outcomes of SCIE characteristics. These findings are important for agricultural businesses that have to stretch their resources to accommodate their needs in executing sustainable agricultural strategies. In the future, researchers could conduct a longitudinal study and examine how SCIE evolves. A comparison of SCIEs between developed and developing economies could likewise be a noteworthy endeavor. This study opens up new research avenues in SCIE and suggests directions for future research and practice by exploring the conditions where SCIE can help to improve the performance of socio-knowledge development in agro supply chains.</jats:p>",

The main objective is to establish the mediating role of competitive strategies on the strength of relationship between resources, capabilities and performance of large construction business organisations in South Africa. A survey instrument was administered to Grades 7, 8 and 9 construction organisations listed in the Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) database. 72 usable questionnaires were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlations. The results show that organisational resources and capabilities do not exert a direct impact on performance of construction organisations, but technological resources showed significant relationship, when mediated by competitive strategy. This implies that performance of large construction organisations is contingent upon their competitive strategies and organisational capabilities, for them to achieve performance excellence. Furthermore, differentiation strategy influences an organisations’ financial performance negatively whereas cost-leadership strategy has a positive impact. It provides empirical evidence on the relationship between competitive strategy and organisational resources/capabilities in a new setting.</jats:p>"

From December 2012, five experiments were carried out along the main streams of the HRB. The monitoring indices contained physicochemical variables, habitat environmental indicators and the community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos. The correlations between species diversity and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis, correlation analysis method and redundancy analysis method. Results indicated that the species diversities of the Shaying River's upstream and Huai River's mainstream were better than the Shaying River's midstream and downstream. All the sections were divided into five clusters, and different clusters were affected by different physicochemical factors. Dissolved oxygen (DO), habitat quality index (HQI) and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) were the main factors affecting the species diversity of the Shaying River's upstream; total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), CODCr and permanganate index (CODMn) had a great influence on the Shaying River's midstream and downstream; DO, water temperature (WT), HQI and CODCr were the main factors affecting the Huai River's mainstream. These results provide valuable information for policy decision makers and stakeholders on water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable watershed management in the HRB.</jats:p>",

This article presents an experimental study concerning the effect of ceiling surface temperature and supply air velocity on the indoor air distribution in a room with UFAD as the internal and external sensible cooling loads change. The vertical distributions of indoor air temperature, air velocity and contaminant (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) concentration were evaluated by vertical air temperature difference (VATD), turbulence intensity (TI) and contaminant removal effectiveness (CRE), respectively. The results showed that the average VATD, TI and CRE levels were 0.5°C–1.0°C, 31%–41% and 0.85–1.06 when both internal and external sensible cooling loads were 41.5 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. These evaluation indices varied clearly when the external sensible cooling load increased from 41.5 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to 69.5 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, whereas they remained almost the same when the internal sensible cooling load increased from 41.5 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to 69.5 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The maximum TI coincided with the minimum CRE under the condition of a constant sensible cooling load. Moreover, an air diffusion performance index clearly reduced with an increase in the heat removal effectiveness. It is recommended that it is important to balance the indoor air quality and energy consumption in a room with UFAD + CC. </jats:p>",

To mitigate habitat loss and support fisheries, millions of fall-run hatchery salmon are released each year, often transported downstream to avoid in-river mortality, with consequences not fully understood. We synthesize historical trends in release location and timing (1941–2017), focusing on outcomes influencing stock resilience, adult straying, and ocean arrival timing. Over time, juveniles have been transported increasing distances from the source hatchery, particularly during droughts. Transport distance was strongly associated with straying rate (averaging 0–9% vs. 7–89% for salmon released on site vs. in the bay upstream of Golden Gate Bridge, respectively), increasing the effects of hatchery releases on natural spawners. Decreasing variation in release location and timing could reduce spatiotemporal buffering, narrowing ocean arrival timings and increasing risk of mismatch with peak prey production. Central Valley salmon epitomize the pervasive challenge of balancing short-term (e.g., abundance) against long-term (e.g., stability) goals.</jats:p>",

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important tool in this context as it is aimed to analyze the entire life cycle of the product/service, instead of focusing on one focal firm. However, the lack of standardized guidelines in its application raises questions regarding the usefulness and validity of results. This study contributes to the improvement of sustainability reporting through the identification of the uncertainty sources in life cycle methodologies that have the biggest impact in the definition of business and environmental strategies, exploring a supply chain‐oriented analysis. The focus is on life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). A multiobjective optimization‐based methodology is applied to a supply chain case study in the pulp and paper industry. Environmental and economic objectives are considered. Results show that different LCIA methods and different normalization data sets result in significantly different business and environmental strategies. However, different system models and cultural perspectives at the LCI step and variations in the characterization factors tend to lead to the same decisions. Important insights are gained regarding the impact of nonstandardized analysis of the application of LCA in supply chain design and planning decisions and consequently on business strategy definition and sustainability reporting. Furthermore, the importance of operations research methods to improve LCA‐based studies and of bridging the gap between LCA and supply chain management bodies of knowledge is highlighted in this work.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we developed a dynamic price game model for a low-carbon, closed-loop supply chain system in which (1) the manufacturer had fairness concern and carbon emission reduction (CER) behaviors, and market share and profit maximization were their objectives, and (2) the retailer showed fairness concern behaviors in market competition and provided service input to reduce return rates. The retailer recycled old products from customers, and the manufacturer remanufactured the recycled old products. The effects of different parameter values on the stability and utility of the dynamic price game model were determined through analysis and numerical simulation. Results found that an increasing customer loyalty to the direct marketing channel decreased the stable region of the manufacturer’s price adjustment and increase that of the retailer. The stable region of the system shrank with an increase of CER and the retailer’s service level, which expanded with return rates. The dynamic system entered into chaos through flip bifurcation with the increase of price adjustment speed. In the chaotic state, the average utilities of the manufacturer and retailer all declined, while that of the retailer declined even more. Changes to parameter values had a great impact on the utilities of the manufacturer and retailer. By selecting appropriate control parameters, the dynamic system can return to a stable state from chaos again. The research of this paper is of great significance to participants’ price decision-making and supply chain operation management.</jats:p>"

Thus, it remains unclear how responses of leaf gas exchange to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) vary among plant species and functional groups, or across different levels of nutrient supply, and whether they persist over time for long‐lived perennials. Here, we report the effects of eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on rates of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in 14 perennial grassland species from four functional groups over two decades in a Minnesota Free‐Air CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> Enrichment experiment, BioCON. Monocultures of species belonging to C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> grasses, C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grasses, forbs, and legumes were exposed to two levels of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and nitrogen supply in factorial combinations over 21 years. eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased photosynthesis by 12.9% on average in C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> species, substantially less than model predictions of instantaneous responses based on physiological theory and results of other studies, even those spanning multiple years. Acclimation of photosynthesis to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was observed beginning in the first year and did not strengthen through time. Yet, contrary to expectations, the response of photosynthesis to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was not enhanced by increased nitrogen supply. Differences in responses among herbaceous plant functional groups were modest, with legumes responding the most and C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grasses the least as expected, but did not further diverge over time. Leaf‐level water‐use efficiency increased by 50% under eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> primarily because of reduced stomatal conductance. Our results imply that enhanced nitrogen supply will not necessarily diminish photosynthetic acclimation to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in nitrogen‐limited systems, and that significant and consistent declines in stomatal conductance and increases in water‐use efficiency under eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> may allow plants to better withstand drought.</jats:p>",

Here we demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α in the fetus and the trophoblast interplay to regulate placental nutrient supply and fetal growth. Complete loss of fetal p110α caused embryonic death, whilst heterozygous loss resulted in fetal growth restriction and impaired placental formation and nutrient transport. Loss of trophoblast p110α resulted in viable fetuses, abnormal placental development and a failure of the placenta to transport sufficient nutrients to match fetal demands for growth. Using RNA-seq we identified genes downstream of p110α in the trophoblast that are important in adapting placental phenotype. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we showed loss of p110α differentially affects gene expression in trophoblast and embryonic stem cells. Our findings reveal important, but distinct roles for p110α in the different compartments of the conceptus, which control fetal resource acquisition and growth.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The popularity of e-commerce has impacted traditional retail business. Farmer cooperatives running green agri-food pick-your-own (PYO) farms are facing the choice of whether or not to adopt online channels. PYO operation refers to consumers picking and purchasing the agri-food growing on a farm, and due to it being environmentally-friendly, healthy, and popular, it has been widely adopted by many farm cooperatives. This paper aims to discuss the practicality of introducing online channels to already established PYO farms in the green agri-food supply chain (GASC), who can personally take charge of the online channel or transfer it to one online retailer. Firstly, we constructed the demand functions of green agri-food by putting consumer utility, the freshness of agri-food, and transportation cost into consideration. Secondly, five decision models are built to characterize five operation modes, namely pure PYO mode, self-operated dual-channel mode, decentralized dual-channel mode, centralized dual-channel mode, and contractual cooperation mode. Furthermore, by taking price, demand, and profit with different modes into consideration, we are able to explore the introduction of online channels and green brand construction. Finally, numerical analysis is performed. We found that: (1) introducing an online channel is preferable strategy since the profit of the farmer cooperative in pure PYO mode is always less than the profit of a farmer cooperative in non-self-operated dual-channel modes; (2) the decision of self-operating an online channel is related to the fixed cost of creating a new online channel and the green food brand effect of online channel, and it is the optimal mode in some cases, while the contractual cooperation mode is the optimal mode in the remaining cases; and (3) the green food brand effect of online channels is does not necessarily improve with scale, and the initial freshness has a positive relationship to the profit, demand, and price of farmer cooperatives and online retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last few years, microgrids have become a potential solution to improve reliability and security in the supply of electricity to power systems. When a microgrid changes its operation mode from grid‐connected to islanded, particular attention must be paid by the operation services. In the islanded mode, the microgrids’ frequency and voltage may reach undesirable values, harming the security and quality of the operation. This study aims to propose global and local strategies of load shedding to preserve the energy supply to high priority loads within quality standards. The focus of this study is to consider a microgrid operating only with primary control. In this sense, a proper microgrid time‐continuous load flow is applied, considering the constant verification of the frequency and the voltage of all buses. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the proposal presented and to give some indices that quantify the load shed in each period. The results show the superior performance of the proposed strategy compared to a state‐of‐the‐art load shedding solution that does not consider the priority of loads.</jats:p>",
