This study finds support for strengthening relationships between a focal organization and its suppliers.

Other challenges include the reduction in funding and subsequent impacts on services, the lending of electronic documents restricted by rights management software and licences, as well as the opportunities and potential threats offered by open access resources.

Case‐level tagging is required to enable a substantial redesign of the supply chain, but profit‐sharing and reading reliability should be carefully considered to ensure economic and technological feasibility. The comparison with the fashion industry evidences some key success factors of RFId; while some of them are industry‐specific, others can be replicated in the FMCG as well, but further efforts are still needed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This is one of the first attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of RFId potential in the FMCG supply chain, taking into account all the major factors involved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The requirements of the power supply design are proposed based on the principle of discharge process in depositing &amp; welding power supply, and a depositing &amp; welding power system schematic is designed according to the requirements. The control manner of the power supply combines RLC (Resistance-Inductance-Capacitance) circuit with fast SCR, and the deposition and restoration can be achieved by using the NE555 circuit to trigger the fast silicon controlled rectifier. Furthermore, parameters such as voltage, capacitance, frequency, motion mode of electrode are probed into, a depositing &amp; welding test is experimented and the waveform of the power supply are analyzed. According to the results of experiments and analysis, it is clear that the output of the power supply can meet the requirements of working successfully and achieve the required standard to do electrospark depositing and welding operations. However, the actual working electrospark frequency is lower than the trigger pulse frequency added on the fast SCR, which result in a lower efficiency in depositing &amp; welding work. Main reasons for this situation is that the relative movement of the electrode and the work-piece can’ t guarantee the best conditions for electrospark and the fast SCR in circuit can’t be reliably turn-off fast. These research laid foundations for further electrospark depositing &amp; welding power supply design and efficiency improvement.</jats:p>"

Optimization of the supply chain introduces a framework for decision making that drives fiscally responsible decisions. The cost‐effective supply chain is driven by implementing a value analysis process for product selection, being mindful of product sourcing decisions to reduce supply expense, creating logistical efficiency that will eliminate redundant processes, and managing inventory to ensure product availability. The value analysis approach is an analytical methodology for product selection that involves product evaluation and recommendation based on consideration of clinical benefit, overall financial impact, and revenue implications.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

A multiple-period model is necessitated by the multiple stages, capacity limits, stochastic demand, and the explicit consideration of inventories. With appropriate salvage value functions, a Markov equilibrium policy is found. Intuitive profit dominance allows for existence of a unique equilibrium solution, which is shown to be a modified echelon base-stock policy. This equilibrium policy structure is sustained in the infinite horizon. A numerical study compares the behavior of the decentralized system with the first-best integrated capacitated system. The performance of this decentralized system relative to the integrated system across other parameters can be very good over a broad range of values. This implies that an acceptable system performance may be attained without the imposition of a contract or other coordinating mechanism, which themselves may encounter difficulties in implementation in the form of negotiation, execution, or enforcement of these agreements. We find instances where tighter capacities may actually enhance channel efficiency. We also examine the effect of capacity utilization on the system suboptimality. </jats:p>",

Where water stress is evident, a detailed hydrological modelling approach is developed to enable an assessment of the robustness to uncertainty of future adaptation decisions. WEAP is coupled with a rainfall runoff model (hydrological simulation model), and forced using climate scenarios, statistically downscaled from three global climate models to account for the key sources of uncertainty. While hydrological models are widely applied, they are subject to uncertainties derived from model structure and the parameterisation of the catchment. Here, random sampling of key parameters is employed to incorporate uncertainty from the hydrological modelling process.

In red-fruited apple cultivars, the intensity and extent of coloration is an important consideration in determining the time of fruit harvest. Negative relationships have been found between tree nitrogen (N) status and fruit skin pigmentation, but how N affects flesh starch breakdown has not been examined in detail. The objective of this study was to determine how N supply affects flesh starch breakdown relative to skin color development. Seven-year-old ‘Gala’/M.26 trees were provided with four levels of N (8.8, 26.4, 52.7, and 105.4 g N per tree) in a modified Hoagland's solution. The effects of N supply on yield, fruit quality, and fruit maturation were evaluated. At harvest, fruit in the lowest N treatment was significantly smaller and had lower soluble solids but higher starch concentration, better color, and higher firmness than those grown at higher N supplies. Increasing N supply decreased both anthocyanin synthesis and chlorophyll degradation in fruit skin. Flesh starch concentration was higher at higher N supply at 38 days before harvest but was lower at higher N supply at harvest. Starch degradation was completed earlier during cold storage with increasing N supply. These results indicate that increasing N supply delays skin red color development but accelerates flesh starch degradation in ‘Gala’ apples. These differential effects of N supply should be taken into account when assessing fruit maturity for optimizing harvest time.</jats:p>",

This change also provided pharmaceutical manufacturers with information about distributor customer demand and inventories that had previously been withheld from them. Supply chain theory and practice in other industries suggest that by improving decision making and implementation, companies can operate with substantially lower inventories. This happened in pharmaceutical distribution when a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation led manufacturers to force distributors to operate with less inventory. Theory and practice further suggest that manufacturers who are provided with relevant information that they did not have previously would take advantage of this information to reduce their inventories. This evidently did not happen in pharmaceutical manufacturing. We contend that pharmaceutical manufacturers either do not know how to take advantage of such information or they do not care. </jats:p>",

The system generates cavitations in the fluid flow, which is expected to provide higher cooling and superior grinding-chip removal capability. The system is applied to one-pass surface grinding of steel plates, and residual stress and surface roughness are evaluated. The system has a major effect on improving surface roughness, but has a minor effect on reducing the residual stress under shallow-cut grinding conditions. The effects appear greater under the heavier grinding conditions.</jats:p>"

For instance, while the total number of donations made by older cohorts is expected to increase in the coming years, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the 70+ age group is forecasted grow from approximately 53% of all RBC transfusions in 2008 (209,515) in 2008 to 68% (546,996) by 2036. A series of alternate scenarios, including projections based on a 2% increase in supply per year and increased use of apheresis technology, delays supply shortfalls, but does not eliminate them without active management and/or multiple methods to increase supply and decrease demand.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> Predictions show that demand for blood products will outpace supply in the near future given current age‐ and sex‐specific supply and demand rates. However, we note that the careful management of the blood supply by Canadian Blood Services, along with new medical techniques and the recruitment of new donors to the system, will remove future concerns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With increasing interest in the implementation/functionality of a contaminant warning system for water distribution systems, questions exist over the application to a real distribution system. A methodology is described to assess the impacts of changes in the numbers of sensors, on the time delay required to detect a contaminant intrusion event and to maximize sensor detection redundancy as protection against false positives. The methodology is used to explore the point of diminishing marginal return of detection likelihood, and the average time delay of detected intrusion events. Pareto front performance improvement with increasing numbers of sensors (from 2 through 50) is characterized through a case study application to the City of Guelph water distribution system (WDS). The results provide a methodology for utilities to employ for decisions on the number of sensors to use for a system. Within the two scenarios applied, five and four sensors are shown to be the point of diminishing marginal return for Guelph WDS in terms of the Pareto front performance improvement, detection likelihood, and the average time delay for the case study. Nevertheless, given that the timeframe to detect a contamination event may be lengthy, placing more sensors than the point of diminishing marginal return may be appropriate.</jats:p>",

The BRICS’s decoupling distribution is similar to China, because China accounts for most part of TPES and GDP of the BRICS. To restrain the total resource or energy consumption from increasing too fast, it is suggested to match the indicators of GDP growth and the decreasing rate of resource consumption per unit of GDP appropriately.</jats:p>"

It is defined as the difference between the total water supply and demand. The North China Plain (NCP) currently faces a serious water shortage if the WRCC is not managed at a sustainable level. This study focuses on applying system dynamics (SD) methodology to evaluate different water use scenarios and their associated WRCC for the NCP. System characteristics of local water resources and demand in the NCP are captured and simulated using VENSIM® software. A SD model of the WRCC is constructed which consists of five sub-systems: agricultural irrigation, population growth, urbanization level, water recycle and industrial output. The impact on the WRCC is tested through three growth scenarios: keeping the status quo, aggressive industrial growth and modest growth combined with wastewater recycle. Based on the simulation results, the WRCC that can most likely sustain economic growth without overly stressing the water supply is the one with modest growth combined with wastewater recycle.</jats:p>",

Thechlorine data were collected from Mayoralty of Baghdad and Ministry of Environment(MOE) for the networks for both sides of the city Karkh and Rasafa for (2008-2009). Thestudy of these data indicates that there are no systematic testing program .Classified GISmaps showed that the areas far from the treatment plants have almost always lowchlorine concentration .This indicates that the problem of the low chlorine concentrationin the far areas is due to cracks of pipe along the conveyance path ,as expected. The area'smost frequently have low concentration are Al-sadir,Al-Kadhimya, and Al-Amiria . Itwas found also that the chlorine concentrations were lowest in summer months than thosein winter months.The Amiria area district (636) was selected as a case study to test theability of using the quantitative- qualitative model in the EPANET software, to find therequired onsite chlorine injection point number, locations and dose, so as to raise thechlorine concentration to the acceptable limits in the other nodes of the network. Thebulk decay coefficient was found to be (-2.212)1/day and the wall coefficients werefound to be between (-0.001)to(-0.9)1/day The main conclusion of this study is that theonsite injection can improve the chlorine concentration in Baghdad water supplynetworks. The EPANET model can be used effectively to obtain the required injectionprogram for this purpose.</jats:p>"

Allerdings verhindern gegenwärtig arbeitsstoffpaarbezogene Nachteile wie Kristallisation, Korrosion oder Instabilität eine höhere Marktdurchdringung. Im Rahmen des vorliegenden Beitrags wird das Potenzial neuer Arbeitsstoffpaare auf Basis ionischer Flüssigkeiten diskutiert. Anhand ausgewählter Arbeitsstoffpaareigenschaften wird konzeptionell gezeigt, dass die Verwendung ionischer Flüssigkeiten eine Eliminierung oder Reduzierung mehrerer Nachteile des Stands der Technik und damit einen leichteren Zugang zu bisher nur unzureichend genutzten energetischen Potenzialen erlaubt. </jats:p>",

Despite the extensive discussion of the technological characteristics and expected benefits of RFID in the literature, only little is known about the drivers and barriers of RFID implementations in practice.

However, similar applications in the north-west district where is severely cold and salty are seldom reported. This paper designed the refrigeration experiment, the freeze-thaw cycle experiment and the chemical immersion experiment after freeze-thaw, to test the PE coating steel pipe's reliability in the severely cold and salty region. The result showed that, after freeze-thaw or a period of refrigeration, a small number of dark spots appeared in the coating but didn’t change with the increase of freeze-thaw cycle times and the erosion of salt. The compositions were proved to be carbon and oxygen which indicated that the spots might be relative to the cryogenic stability of the coating rather than the corrosion of matrix steel. A crack and corrosion spot also appeared in test due to the excessively thick coating and the burr in steel substrate which can be eliminated by manufacturers through improving the coating formulas, surface pretreatment and coating process.</jats:p>"

Farber's (2005, 2008) empirical analyses and Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin's (2006; henceforth “KR”) theory of reference-dependent preferences. Following KR, our model has targets for hours as well as income, determined by proxied rational expectations. Our model, estimated with Farber's data, reconciles his finding that stopping probabilities are significantly related to hours but not income with Colin Camerer et al.'s (1997) negative “wage” elasticity of hours; and avoids Farber's criticism that estimates of drivers' income targets are too unstable to yield a useful model of labor supply.

We show that financing from a competitive financial market can create value for both the supplier and the retailer. We also demonstrate that in a competitive financial market with symmetric information on the retailer's initial budget, the retailer's operational and financial decisions could be decoupled. We provide numerical results to shed light on additional managerial insights as well. </jats:p>",

This computer application, called OPTIOFER, fits together the best GAMS and MATLAB features for the optimization of hydraulic and thermal generation bids models and their friendly visual representation. OPTIOFER makes use of GAMS to formulate and solve hydro and thermal models, whereas MATLAB and its toolbox GUIDE are used for implementation and graphical representation. The motivation for developing the package is to provide a flexible simulation environment for ongoing research conducted at the Electrical Engineering Department of Carlos III University, Madrid, Spain, and to enhance, mainly, graduate and M.S. power engineering courses. After a brief summary of power generating models considered for the bids formulation, the article illustrates the capabilities and main features of OPTIOFER using two simple hydraulic and thermal power systems as examples. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Body size profoundly affects many aspects of animal biology, including metamorphosis, allometry, size-dependent alternative pathways of gene expression, and the social and ecological roles of individuals. However, regulation of body size is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in developmental biology. The control of body size requires a mechanism that assesses size and stops growth within a characteristic range of sizes. Under normal growth conditions in\n            <jats:italic>Manduca sexta</jats:italic>\n            , the endocrine cascade that causes the brain to initiate metamorphosis starts when the larva reaches a critical weight. Metamorphosis is initiated by a size-sensing mechanism, but the nature of this mechanism has remained elusive. Here we show that this size-sensing mechanism depends on the limited ability of a fixed tracheal system to sustain the oxygen supply to a growing individual. As body mass increases, the demand for oxygen also increases, but the fixed tracheal system does not allow a corresponding increase in oxygen supply. We show that interinstar molting has the same size-related oxygen-dependent mechanism of regulation as metamorphosis. We show that low oxygen tension induces molting at smaller body size, consistent with the hypothesis that under normal growth conditions, body size is regulated by a mechanism that senses oxygen limitation. We also found that under poor growth conditions, larvae may never attain the critical weight but eventually molt regardless. We show that under these conditions, larvae do not use the critical weight mechanism, but instead use a size-independent mechanism that is independent of the brain.\n          </jats:p>",

The technologies adopted in terms of architecture and installation were very effective in creating a mobile laboratory open to further extension by online interoperation with other simulators and with biomedical devices for assessing human capabilities within this framework. This approach allows us to face the existing challenges in extending the capabilities of a logistics node over their current capabilities limited by technological and human factors. </jats:p>",

The three genes from the\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Streptomyces lydicus</jats:named-content>\n            streptolydigin gene cluster\n            <jats:italic>slgE1-slgE2-slgE3</jats:italic>\n            are involved in 3-methylaspartate supply. SlgE3, a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, is responsible for the biosynthesis of glutamate from glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate. In addition to\n            <jats:italic>slgE3</jats:italic>\n            , housekeeping NADPH- and ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase genes have been identified in\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">S. lydicus</jats:named-content>\n            . The expression of\n            <jats:italic>slgE3</jats:italic>\n            is increased up to 9-fold at the onset of streptolydigin biosynthesis and later decreases to ∼2-fold over the basal level. In contrast, the expression of housekeeping glutamate synthases decreases when streptolydigin begins to be synthesized. SlgE1 and SlgE2 are the two subunits of a glutamate mutase that would convert glutamate into 3-methylaspartate. Deletion of\n            <jats:italic>slgE1-slgE2</jats:italic>\n            led to the production of two compounds containing a lateral side chain derived from glutamate instead of 3-methylaspartate. Expression of this glutamate mutase also reaches a peak increase of up to 5.5-fold coinciding with the onset of antibiotic production. Overexpression of either\n            <jats:italic>slgE3</jats:italic>\n            or\n            <jats:italic>slgE1-slgE2</jats:italic>\n            in\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">S. lydicus</jats:named-content>\n            led to an increase in the yield of streptolydigin.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surfactant predominantly comprises phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, together with phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, neutral lipids, and surfactant proteins-A to -D. Together, dipalmitoyl-PC (PC16:0/16:0), palmitoyl-myristoyl-PC (PC16:0/14:0), and palmitoyl-palmitoleoyl-PC (PC16:0/16:1) make up 75–80% of mammalian surfactant PC, the proportions of which vary during development and in chronic lung diseases. PC16:0/14:0, which exerts specific effects on macrophage differentiation in vitro, increases in surfactant during alveolarization (at the expense of PC16:0/16:0), a prenatal event in humans but postnatal in rats. The mechanisms responsible and the significance of this reversible increase are, however, not understood. We hypothesized that, in rats, myristic acid (C14:0) enriched milk is key to lung-specific PC16:0/14:0 increases in surfactant. We found that surfactant PC16:0/14:0 in suckling rats correlates with C14:0 concentration in plasma chylomicrons and lung tissue triglycerides, and that PC16:0/14:0 fractions reflect exogenous C14:0 supply. Significantly, C14:0 was increased neither in plasma PC, nor in liver triglycerides, free fatty acids, or PC. Lauric acid was also abundant in triglycerides, but was not incorporated into surfactant PC. Comparing a C14:0-rich milk diet with a C14:0-poor carbohydrate diet revealed increased C14:0 and decreased C16:0 in plasma and lung triglycerides, respectively. PC16:0/14:0 enrichment at the expense of PC16:0/16:0 did not impair surfactant surface tension function. However, the PC profile of the alveolar macrophages from the milk-fed animals changed from PC16:0/16:0 rich to PC16:0/14:0 rich. This was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production. We propose that nutritional supply with C14:0 and its lung-specific enrichment may contribute to decreased reactive oxygen species production during alveolarization.</jats:p>",
