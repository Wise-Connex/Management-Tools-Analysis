      "abstract": "<jats:p>The basis of the sludge activity concept is described together with experimental applications. As a result of these it has been concluded that activated sludge plants normally operate under oxygen limiting conditions and that increases in the rate of aeration which enable the plants to deal with greater loadings require equal increases in the sludge and dissolved oxygen concentration. The increases necessary are not proportional to the increased loadings but to the square roots of them. Increase in turbulence of the mixed liquor does not appear to be a factor of importance down to retention periods of the order of two hours when treating an average strength sewage, but may have had an effect at lower aeration periods. Calculations using data obtained from a hybrid mechanical aeration plant at Manchester indicate that the percentage oxygenation of the sludge in a low intensity carbonaceous oxidation plant may be as low as 15%. Even in a high intensity plant treating sewage in two hours the calculations gave an estimate of 33% aerobicity. It appears that the sludge activity approach can be applied to nitrifying organisms and that they also tend to a maximum as the sludge concentration is increased. In full scale practice there will be an optimum dissolved oxygen level which gives the highest oxygen deficiency, and thus power economy, consistent with attaining the required nitrification.</jats:p>",

The focus of benchmarking has also shifted during this period. By tracing in detail the evolution of benchmarking in one specific area of business activity, supply and distribution management, as seen by the participants in that evolution, creates a picture of a movement from single function, cost‐focused, competitive benchmarking, through cross‐functional, cross‐sectoral, value‐oriented benchmarking to process benchmarking. As process efficiency and effectiveness become the primary foci of benchmarking activities, the measurement parameters used to benchmark performance converge with the factors used in business process modelling. The possibility is therefore emerging of modelling business processes and then feeding the models with actual data from benchmarking exercises. This would overcome the most common criticism of benchmarking, namely that it intrinsically lacks the ability to move beyond current best practice. In fact the combined power of modelling and benchmarking may prove to be the basic building block of informed business process re‐engineering. </jats:p>",

The average size of presettlement fish also differed; fish at inshore sites averaged ∼2 mm less in standard length than those at offshore sites. Settlement was quantified by using artificial substrata suspended above the benthos, and a nonsignificant trend for greater settlement at offshore vs. inshore sites was revealed. Recruitment surveys after the settlement season showed that densities of recruits were significantly greater offshore than inshore. Correlation analyses showed either significant inverse or nonsignificant relationships between densities of presettlement fish and settlement depending on the size of presettlement fish. The relationship between recruitment and densities of presettlement fish was not significant with each of the size classes of presettlement fish analyzed, but there was a strong positive relationship between settlement and recruitment.</jats:p>",

The second design makes it possible to obtain strictly linear behavior, which offers several advantages compared to classic devices.

Blood flow in 39 single adenomas and 20 glands classified as primary or secondary hyperplasia were studied intraoperatively with laser Doppler flowmetry. The ipsilateral inferior thyroid artery was occluded during continuous flowmetry recording, which resulted in a 40% reduction of parathyroid blood flow in both groups. In 12 patients with single adenomas, intact parathormone (iPTH) was measured intraoperatively before and during occlusion of the ipsilateral inferior thyroid artery and after extirpation of the adenoma. During occlusion the iPTH levels were mainly unchanged despite blood flow reduction of up to 80%. After removal of the adenoma the iPTH normalized within 15 minutes. In a control group of eight single adenomas, iPTH was measured similarly without vascular occlusion, demonstrating comparable iPTH levels. This study demonstrates similar routes of vascularization for single adenomas and hyperplastic glands, as was earlier seen for normal parathyroid glands. The increased parathyroid hormone secretion from single adenomas appears to remain mainly unchanged during significant blood flow reduction.</jats:p>",

The diagnostic features can usually only be resolved using electron microscopy and, since these features are often shared between closely related taxa, identification in field studies remain uncertain in most cases. As the respective influences of genetics and environmental factors upon morphological variation cannot be evaluated in field studies, examinations were conducted by growing a clonal culture of <jats:italic>Mallomonas tonsurata</jats:italic> in different media with varying silicon, nitrogen and phosphorus supply, followed by micromorphological analyses of scales and bristles. Increased silica content resulted in significant elongation of scales with a corresponding tendency to build slender scales. In experiments with varied ratios of nitrogen and phosphorus in the media the most pronounced changes were observed under phosphorus enrichment leading to significantly larger scales and more needle‐like bristle tips. These bristles resemble those of <jats:italic>M. areolata</jats:italic>. This shows that bristles are more variable than scales and thus must be regarded as of little value for taxonomical description. However, the above‐mentioned changes are not sufficiently pronounced to result in a sharp distinction between two different species. This confirms that siliceous structures of chrysophytes are, in principle, a most valuable tool for taxonomic differentiation although in field studies morphological variability of taxonomically relevant characters should still be considered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Systemic-onset juvenile chronic arthritis (SoJCA) is associated with high levels of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and is frequently complicated by severe microcytic anemia whose pathogenesis is unclear. Therefore, we studied 20 consecutive SoJCA patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels &lt;12 g/dL, evaluating erythroid progenitor proliferation, endogenous erythropoietin production, body iron status, and iron supply for erythropoiesis. Hb concentrations ranged from 6.5 to 11.9 g/dL. Hb level was directly related to mean corpuscular volume (r = .82, P &lt; .001) and inversely related to circulating transferrin receptor (r = - .81, P &lt; .001) suggesting that the severity of anemia was directly proportional to the degree of iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Serum ferritin ranged from 18 to 1,660 microgram/L and was unrelated to Hb level. Bone marrow iron stores wore markedly reduced in the three children investigated, and they also showed increased serum transferrin receptor and normal-to-high serum ferritin. All 20 patients had elevated IL-6 levels and normal in vitro growth of erythroid progenitors. Endogenous erythropoietin (epo) production was appropriate for the degree of anemia as judged by both the observed to predicted log (serum epo) ratio 10.95 +/- 0.12) and a comparison of the serum epo- Hb regression found in these subjects with that of thalassemia patients. Multiple regression analysis showed that serum transferrin receptor was the parameter most closely related to hemoglobin concentration: variation in circulating transferrin receptor explained 61% of the variation in Hb level (P &lt; .001). In 10 severely anemic patients, amelioration of anemia following intravenous iron administration resulted in normalization of serum transferrin receptor. Defective iron supply to the erythron rather than blunted epo production is the major cause of the microcytic anemia associated with SoJCA. A true body-iron deficiency caused by decreased iron absorption likely complicates long-lasting inflammation in the most anemic children, and this can be recognized by high serum transferrin receptor levels. Although oral iron is of no benefit, intravenous iron saccharate is a safe and effective means for improving iron availability for erythropoiesis and correcting this anemia. Thus, while chronically high endogenous IL-6 levels do not appear to blunt epo production, they are probably responsible for the observed abnormalities in iron metabolism. Anemia of chronic disease encompasses a variety of anemic conditions whose peculiar features may specifically correlate with the type of cytokine(s) predominantly released.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> \n   Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) of GaN on GaAs substrates was tried by alternate   supply of  GaCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and  NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, and the growth process was analyzed by the surface   photo-absorption (SPA) method. When the GaN layers were grown on GaAs   surface at 500° C, typical SPA signals indicating the layer-by-layer growths were   observed. Change in the reflection intensity (SPA signal) after the  GaCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> supply   for the GaN growth was much slower than that of GaAs. This result indicates that   the reaction between  GaCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and N or  NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> was much slower than that between    GaCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and As or  AsH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. The crystallinity of GaN grown on (001) GaAs was almost   amorphous. On the other hand, the GaN grown on (111) GaAs had a wurtzite   structure and was a single crystal. \n   </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Autophagy triggered by carbohydrate starvation was characterized at both biochemical and structural levels, with the aim to identify reliable and easily detectable marker(s) and to investigate the factors controlling this process. Incubation of suspension cells in sucrose-free culture medium triggered a marked degradation of the membrane polar lipids, including phospholipids and galactolipids. In contrast, the total amounts of sterols, which are mainly associated with plasmalemma and tonoplast membranes, remained constant. In particular, phosphatidylcholine decreased, whereas phosphodiesters including glycerylphosphorylcholine transiently increased, and phosphorylcholine (P-Cho) steadily accumulated. P-Cho exhibits a remarkable metabolic inertness and therefore can be used as a reliable biochemical marker reflecting the extent of plant cell autophagy. Indeed, whenever P-Cho accumulated, a massive regression of cytoplasm was noticed using EM. Double membrane-bounded vacuoles were formed in the peripheral cytoplasm during sucrose starvation and were eventually expelled into the central vacuole, which increased in volume and squeezed the thin layer of cytoplasm spared by autophagy. The biochemical marker P-Cho was used to investigate the factors controlling autophagy. P-Cho did not accumulate when sucrose was replaced by glycerol or by pyruvate as carbon sources. Both compounds entered the cells and sustained normal rates of respiration. No recycling back to the hexose phosphates was observed, and cells were rapidly depleted in sugars and hexose phosphates, without any sign of autophagy. On the contrary, when pyruvate (or glycerol) was removed from the culture medium, P-Cho accumulated without a lag phase, in correlation with the formation of autophagic vacuoles. These results strongly suggest that the supply of mitochondria with respiratory substrates, and not the decrease of sucrose and hexose phosphates, controls the induction of autophagy in plant cells starved in carbohydrates.</jats:p>",
