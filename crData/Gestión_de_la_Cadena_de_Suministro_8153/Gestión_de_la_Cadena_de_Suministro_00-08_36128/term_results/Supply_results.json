This claim is made on the basis of two assumptions derived from the literature, namely that intermediation reduces supply chain transparency and adds cost but not value. Observes, however, that intermediation is an important component in many international clothing supply chains and outlines an explanatory framework that focuses on information costs. The principal sources of information costs in international markets for clothing are then identified and, finally, a case study is presented to provide empirical illustration of the preceding arguments, demonstrating the explanatory power of the theory advanced.</jats:p>",

The health check procedure is activated via a quick scan methodology (QSM) requiring execution by a multi‐disciplinary team working on‐site. The degree of integration within the value chain is estimated by the QS team, using the uncertainty circle concept which apportions observed uncertainties in the product delivery process (PDP) according to source. In our experience the four major contributors are: the demand side; supply side; value added process side; and systems controls. The results clearly demonstrate a well‐trodden and hence proven route for value stream performance improvement. They also identify value chain exemplars and many areas of best practice, but most importantly they provide a list of actions focused on improving the performance of individual value streams. Properly applied, re‐engineering programmes based on these trigger points will speed up the progress curve towards effective supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Timber harvest choices were estimated as probit models for three ownership categories in coastal plain southern pine stands of North Carolina using individual permanent and remeasured stand-level data from last two available USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) surveys. The timber harvest decision was modeled as a function of timber values, a cost factor, and stand volume as a proxy for nontimber values. Probit models were statistically significant at 1% for all ownerships. Area expansion factors (the portion of forest area in the region represented by the sampled stand) were then combined with harvest probabilities to model the aggregate effects of price changes on timber supply, given a fixed forest area. Implied price elasticities were estimated using this modeling of aggregate effects, and a bootstrapping procedure was applied to estimate confidence limits for supply elasticities with respect to price. Our results showed that NIPF and industry were elastically responsive in the aggregate when price increases are perceived as temporary but much less elastically and usually negatively responsive when increases are perceived as permanent. Results are consistent with theory of optimal rotations and highlight the critical influence of both existing inventory structure and expectations on aggregate timber supply. FOR.

An analytical tool was required to evaluate alternative designs in terms of cost and customer service level, both of which are functions of probabilistic and dynamic elements. These elements include inventory policies, demand seasonality and volume, customer-choice patterns, and transportation delays. By using an innovative combination of simulation and discrete optimization models, we addressed the problem of analyzing a large number of alternatives efficiently. Our analysis indicated opportunities for significant savings in estimated annual transportation costs, and it provided insights on how to implement the proposed system. </jats:p>",

We measured supply-chain performance using a set of variables that capture the impact of supply-chain management on systemwide revenues and costs. We classified supply chains based on the products they support as inherently functional or inherently innovative. They differ in practices used and thinking. High performers among innovative-product supply chains use practices that enhance revenues more than high performers among functional product supply chains. They are more likely to engage in supply-chain management to enhance revenues. Finally, we found that the practices and reasons for engaging in supply-chain management that distinguish high performers from low performers are different for functional-and innovative-product supply chains. </jats:p>",

For the majority of countries, even stringent tobacco-control policies will have either a minimal impact or no net impact on total employment, as money that would formerly have been spent on tobacco tends to be spent on other goods and services. However, for a handful of tobacco-exporting countries that are not diversified, falling demand for tobacco would result in job losses, although such transitions would be gradual. Supply-side policies, such as price supports and quotas, provide incentives to grow tobacco, but their net impact on retail price, and hence consumption, is small. Given high demand and the presence of alternative suppliers, policies such as crop diversification or buy-outs are largely ineffective in reducing the supply of tobacco or its consumption. Nevertheless diversification, placed within broader rural development programs, can help meet the transition costs of the poorest farmers. Ultimately, the most effective supply-side policy may be to focus on reducing the demand for tobacco, and to allow supply to respond to slow changes in demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In traditional supply chain inventory management, orders are the only information firms exchange, but information technology now allows firms to share demand and inventory data quickly and inexpensively. We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information. </jats:p>",

Xilinx designed its products to be programmable, allowing customers to fully configure the function of the integrated circuit using software. In process postponement, a generic part is created in the initial stages of the manufacturing process. In the later stages, this generic part is customized to create the finished product. Xilinx manufactures a small number of generic parts and holds them in inventory. The use of these generic parts allows Xilinx to hold less inventory in those finished products that it builds to stock.

The location of auditory cortex in the chinchilla has previously been determined both electrophysiologically and by optical imaging of intrinsic signals. The spatial resolution of functional imaging techniques which rely on changes in the BOLD (blood oxygen dependent level) signal to create images of activity (i.e., fMRI and optical imaging) are ultimately dependent on the resolution of microcirulatory control mechanisms. For example, in response to pure tone auditory stimuli, functional resolution (within cortex) of approximately 400 um has been demonstrated using optical imaging. To better understand the limits of functional imaging the present study was undertaken to explore the structure and properties of the arterial supply within auditory cortex.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHODS: Plastic casts of the cerebral vasculature were prepared by cannulating the ascending aorta, incising the right atrium and then perfusing 50 ml heparinized PBS followed by 20 ml of Batson's #17 resin.</jats:p>",

The provision of safe water and sanitation for all poses several serious institutional and economic challenges at international, national and local levels. Despite the various political commitments made from the late 1970s onwards, these commitments have remained largely unfulfilled. Even though some efforts to expand coverage have been made over the past two decades, much of those efforts have been undermined by socioeconomic problems and growing population, particularly in the urban areas of developing countries. The water supply and sanitation sector is actually in acute need of new investments for expansion and maintenance of facilities. Nonetheless, some positive trends can be discerned, such as, for example, the increasing recognition of integrated water resources management, environmental sanitation, public‐private partnerships and women as a key for improvement and expansion of services.</jats:p>",

Our results showed that each palate muscle had a distinct morphological identity and that they generally shared more similarities with facial than limb muscles. The palatopharyngeus and uvula muscles contained 2 of the highest proportions of type II fibres ever reported for human muscles. In contrast, the levator and tensor veli palatini muscles contained predominantly type I fibres. A fetal myosin heavy chain isoform (MyHC), not usually found in normal adult limb muscles, was present in a small number of fibres in all palate muscles. The mean muscle fibre diameter was smaller than in limb muscles and the individual and intramuscular variability in diameter and shape was considerable. All palate muscles had a high capillary density and an unusually high mitochondrial enzyme activity in the type II fibres, in comparison with limb muscles. No ordinary muscle spindles were observed. The fibre type and MyHC composition indicate that the palatopharyngeus and uvula muscles are functionally involved in quick movements whereas the levator and tensor veli palatini muscles perform slower and more continuous contractions. The high aerobic capacity and the rich capillarisation suggest that the palate muscles are relatively fatigue resistant. Absence of ordinary muscle spindles indicates a special proprioceptive control system. The special morphology of the palate muscles may be partly related to the unique anatomy with only one skeletal insertion, a feature consistent with muscle work at low load and tension and which may influence the cytoarchitecture of these muscles. Other important factors determining the special morphological characteristics might be specific functional requirements, distinct embryological origin and phylogenetic factors.</jats:p>",

However, the most serious problem became public just four years ago—the contamination of the groundwater with arsenic. Considering the extent of the water supply problem, solutions for the future provision of safe drinking water are urgently needed. This article argues that ponds, a traditional water source in Bangladesh, could contribute to a solution. However, it is essential to recognise the problems and advantages of ponds in order to make suggestions on how to integrate ponds into the national water policy. Therefore, this paper analyses pond management—the use, maintenance and control of ponds—and its change from the past to the present. A holistic, dynamic and actor‐oriented approach on a small scale was proved to be the appropriate instrument for this analysis.</jats:p>",

Attempts to reintroduce Hihi to other islands have been unsuccessful, with populations slowly declining. The main hypothesis for these declines was an inadequate year‐round supply of carbohydrate food (nectar and fruit) due to human impacts on the forest habitat. When Hihi were reintroduced to Mokoia, another island with regenerating forest, we tested whether survival was limited by carbohydrate food in the year after release. We conducted an “on‐off” experiment in which ad libitum sugar water was available to birds for 2 out of every 4 weeks. We compared the masses of individual birds at the end of on and off periods to identify times when birds lost condition with no supplementary food and would be likely to starve. We also used mark‐recapture analysis of resighting data to test whether mortality rates were higher when supplementary food was unavailable. The only effect of the supplementary food was that Hihi spent less time foraging for nectar and fruit and more time foraging for invertebrates. There was no time of year when birds lost mass when the food was taken away, and survival rates were not significantly lower when supplementary food was absent. The low (38%) annual survival rate could not be accounted for by shortage of carbohydrate food, and population viability analysis suggests that the population is likely to slowly decline. Our experiment shows that declines of reintroduced Hihi populations may be unrelated to food supply and that alternative hypotheses should be developed and tested. Our results also show the importance of using experimental methods, when possible, to test hypotheses about factors thought to be limiting reintroduced populations.</jats:p>",

From 1990 to 1995, populations were monitored in large-scale (1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) experimental manipulations. Squirrels were studied on eight 9-ha grids: four unmanipulated control grids, two food-supplemented grids, a predator-exclosure grid, and a predator-exclosure + food-supplemented grid. Population density was measured on all grids by livetrapping and active-season survival was measured using radiotelemetry. Population densities were lowest in 1992 and 1993 (2 years after the snowshoe hare population decline). Rates of population change were negative from 1991 to 1993, when predation pressure was most intense after the snowshoe hare decline, and positive from 1993 to 1995, when hares and predators were at low densities. Predation accounted for 125 of 130 mortalities (96%) of radio-collared squirrels. Adult survival was significantly lower in 1992 and 1993 than in 1994 and 1995, and was a strong predictor of annual rates of population change in arctic ground squirrels. Treatments were ranked as follows in their effect on adult survival: predator exclosure + food-supplemented &gt; food-supplemented &gt; predator exclosure &gt; controls. Juvenile survival was lowest in 1992, and food addition and predator removal separately increased juvenile survival. On average, predator exclusion increased population densities twofold, food supplementation increased densities fourfold, and food supplementation and predator removal together increased densities 10-fold. We conclude that food and predation interact to limit arctic ground squirrel populations in the boreal forest during the decline and low phases of the snowshoe hare cycle. The snowshoe hare cycle may indirectly create a lagged secondary fluctuation in arctic ground squirrel populations through shared cyclic predators. </jats:p>",

This was achieved by measuring the time course of the pseudoflash induced through sequential anoxia followed by normoxia. We have also determined the separate times taken for this oxygen diffusion in gaseous and tissue (predominantly aqueous) phases by using helium and nitrogen as the carrier gas. Of the total time taken for diffusion, that in the gas phase required 613±136 ms (mean ± S.E.M., N=5) whilst that in the aqueous phase required 1313±187 ms. These values imply pathlengths of diffusion in the gaseous and aqueous phases of 4.80×10−3±0.53×10−3 and 8.89×10−5±0.61×10−5 m, respectively. In addition, the pathlength of gas-phase diffusion was used to derive a parameter relating to the tortuosity of the tracheal system. These values, together with those obtained upon bioluminescent oxygen consumption, have been used to model oxygen supply to the photocyte. From these studies, it would also appear that the modulation of tracheolar fluid levels might be a significant mechanism of control of tissue oxygen levels in at least some insects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this paper was to establish if duplex ultrasound parameters obtained for assessment of the patency of cavernosal arteries in the penile flaccid state can give sufficient clinical information without the use of intracavernosal injection of vasodilatory drugs. We assessed mean cavernosal peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the penile flaccid state (basal PSV), and after PGE1 injection (dynamic PSV) in 339 unselected patients with erectile dysfunction. In 55 of these patients the waveform acceleration in the flaccid state was also assessed. The results of the study can be summarized as follows: (1) a significant relationship was found between basal and dynamic PSV in the 339 patients (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>=0.477; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.0001); (2) a basal PSV &gt;12.5 cm/sec was predictive of a dynamic PSV ≥30 cm/sec in 129/139 (92.8%) of the patients, whereas in patients with a basal PSV ≤12.5 a dynamic PSV both &gt; or &lt;30 cm/sec could be found; and (3) an acceleration &gt;1 m/sec<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the flaccid state was coupled to a dynamic PSV &gt;30 cm/sec in 43/46 (93.5%) of the patients independent of the basal PSV. In conclusion, these results suggest that the combined duplex ultrasound assessment of PSV and waveform acceleration in the penile flaccid state can predict arterial dynamic inflow in the majority (51/55; 92.7%) of patients with erectile dysfunction, with less time and expense and less discomfort for the patient.</jats:p>",

A new design of manifold respirators with mixers is also presented in the paper. The design of the gaseous fuel supply system has a great influence on HC emissions in the dual-fuel engine at light load. The problem of scavenging is discussed and solved by using the manifold respirators in the dual-fuel engine. It performs the function of retarding the gaseous fuel entry timing from the moment of intake valve opening, and its delaying effects have been measured and tested. Experimental results show that the manifold respirator gives the best performance in reducing HC emissions compared with a common pipe mixer and a respirator with no mixer. In addition, the mixing effects are sensitive to the mixer configurations. </jats:p>",
