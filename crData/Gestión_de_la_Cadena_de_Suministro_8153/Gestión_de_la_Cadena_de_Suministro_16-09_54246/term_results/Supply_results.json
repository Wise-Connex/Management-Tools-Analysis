Under current status quo operations, the United States healthcare system is not sustainable. To move to a sustainable future, changes within the healthcare supply chain are necessary; and the future supply chain, as a key driver in the overall operations of healthcare, must move from a department within the healthcare organisation to a strategy that engages everyone within healthcare to address supplies’ impact on cost, quality and outcomes. Banner Health supply chain set out to change the culture and engage everyone across the healthcare system to consider supplies’ impact on cost, quality and outcomes. This paper shares how Banner Health maintains a unified approach and engages everyone across the organisation to consider supply chain as a strategy. It outlines processes and tools developed to successfully implement supply savings ideas and shares lessons learnt to transform a system's culture into one where supply chain is strategy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply services in India are currently not regulated and remain essential monopolies under the strict control of government. These services are mostly perceived as inefficient, reflecting insufficient municipal revenue generations which result in loss-making municipalities that need to be subsidized by the government. The efficiencies and productivities remain largely unmeasured and undetermined, and therefore the perception of inefficient services is not backed by scientific studies. This paper therefore sets up a framework for measuring the performance and productivity of Indian water supply operations. The study utilizes panel data on 21 municipalities observed over the financial years 2005 and 2010, to analyze the relative efficiencies and productivity growths of utilities. Data envelopment analysis is used to obtain efficiency scores and productivity measures such as the Malmquist index. The results indicate the presence of large relative inefficiencies and decreasing productivity of water supply services over time, alluding to a failure to revise tariffs upwards despite increasing input costs over time, thereby driving the need for sector regulation and tariff revision in accordance with X-factors, which was found to have a mean value of 2.4% for possible price cap regulation in the sector. The paper highlights related policy implications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Healthcare organisations rely on medical suppliers to deliver products that are critical to safe and effective patient care. But while suppliers are instrumental to care delivery, they can also be a source of risk. This paper examines ways in which supplier relationships can threaten patient privacy and safety, as well as impact a provider's accreditation status and revenues. We also present statistics showing how these threats are growing as healthcare becomes more digital. From there, we describe how healthcare organisations can protect themselves, their staff and their patients by building compliance into their supply chain processes. Readers will gain knowledge about:\nIndustry regulations that require healthcare organisations to manage their supplier relationships, and the penalties for non-compliance;\nhow patient data has become more vulnerable to attacks as a growing number of healthcare organisations transition to interoperable electronic health records (EHRs), including recent statistics on healthcare industry data breaches;\nthe significant risk that business associates can present to patient privacy and the responsibility of healthcare organisations to mitigate this risk; and\nseven steps that healthcare organisations can take to integrate compliance into their supply chain processes to protect patient privacy, accreditation status and revenues</jats:p>"

Based on the major customer disclosure of the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards 131, this study identifies three dimensions of the major customer networks of U.S. public firms—customer concentration, mutual dependence and customer interconnection—and investigates how they affect the supplier's return on assets (ROA<jats:sub><jats:italic>t</jats:italic>+1</jats:sub>) and return on sales (ROS<jats:sub><jats:italic>t</jats:italic>+1</jats:sub>).

One major challenge in conservation is that in many hotspots export industries continue to drive overexploitation. Conservation measures must consider not just the point of impact, but also the consumer demand that ultimately drives resource use. To understand which species threat hotspots are driven by which consumers, we have developed a new approach to link a set of biodiversity footprint accounts to the hotspots of threatened species on the IUCN Red List. The result is a map connecting global supply chains to impact locations. Connecting consumption to spatially explicit hotspots driven by production has not been done before on a global scale. Locating biodiversity threat hotspots driven by consumption of goods and services can help connect conservationists, consumers, companies, and governments in order to better target conservation actions.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

While previous studies have described supplier switching behavior based on supplier attributes and switching costs, our study leverages attribution theory to evaluate the impact of psychological contracts on supplier switching behavior. We report the results of a controlled experiment involving 265 subjects in which we manipulate three characteristics of a psychological contract breach: attribution (whether the breach was due to reneging by the supplier or a disruption), severity (whether the breach was major or minor), and timing (whether the breach was early or late in the life cycle of the exchange history). Our analysis indicates that in the context of supplier switching, buyers are affected by the attribution and severity of a breach but not by the timing. In contrast to previous experimental research in noncompetitive settings, we find that psychological contract violation mediates the relationship between breach and behavior. We further complement our primary findings with a vignette‐based experiment and interview data collected from experienced managers. Our research makes an important contribution to the relationship dissolution and industrial buyer behavior literatures by providing a behavioral explanation for supplier switching and reveals the complex role of psychological contracts in supply chain exchanges.</jats:p>",

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 23.0). The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using the Principal Components Analysis (CPA) technique was applied to identify the intended barriers. Seven factors which are the barriers to supply chain management strategy implementation; namely, management practices, human resource capabilities, customer service, external orientation, internal communication, innovation and employee motivation were extracted.

Plants are characterised by their tolerance to a shortage of it and the maximum number of seeds a plant could produce in a year. Interaction among plants is reduced to blocking a part of the resource by the plant’s nearest neighbours. Spatial and temporal external conditions remain unchanged. We consider two systems - plants of one type (target plants) and a mixture of two types, when the second type differs from the target ones only by the tolerance to a shortage or surplus of the resource. We show how the life cycle of a plant depends on its tolerance, supply of the resource and how it is affected by the presence of the second type of annuals. We demonstrate that coexistence of the two species is possible, and we determine the conditions for it.</jats:p>"

As a post-consumption activity, the reverse supply chain aims to extract value from products at the end of their lifecycle; it offers a means of pursuing sustainability through recycling, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and reusing. This study develops a series of procedures for implementing contracts between manufacturers and retailers to maximize individual profits and total profits through the reverse supply chain. To analyze the effects of the decision strategies made by parties acting on non-coordinative (decentralized) and coordinative contracts, we model a two-echelon reverse supply chain environment using a system dynamics approach. In this study, we examine three cooperative contracts with differing shares of cost and profit between the two parties. Each contract is analyzed according to the following three contract processes. First, the manufacturer proposes a set of contracts that can be considered by the retailer. Second, the retailer evaluates the proposed contracts and chooses the one that is expected to maximize profits. Finally, the retailer and manufacturer adjust the parameters of the best contract to achieve the mutual goal of the supply chain. Using the experimental results, we discuss the best coordinative strategy between manufacturer and retailer for maximizing profits in the reverse supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The U.S. Economy has been and continues to be burdened with a “Skills Gap” where the skills of the available workforce are mismatched with the skilled talent needs of employer. The skills gap is especially evident among knowledge workers.  Millions of people in the US are looking for jobs while millions of skilled jobs remain open. The unemployed and the underemployed in general do not posess the professional skills necessary for the jobs that are available. The conundrum is this recognized shortage of skilled knowledge workers has not led to the expected increase in salaries traditional economic analysis would suggest. This paper explains the true economic analysis of the skills gap in terms of an economic “wedge” that supresses knowledge worker saleries in the face of worker shortages. The paper recognizes a systemic disharmony between the momentum of traditional higher education and the rapidly changing needs and demands for professional skill sets in the marketplace. Traditional academic institutions are not predisposed to creating job-ready professionals that meet market needs, and private sector businesses are not positioned to fill the professional education, training and development gaps that exist. Significant opportunities exist to reposition the players to cerate opportunities for both academic intuitions and private sector companies to address the skills gap problem efficiently and effectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An effective green supply chain (GSC) can help an enterprise obtain more benefits and reduce costs. Therefore, developing an effective evaluation method for GSC performance evaluation is becoming increasingly important. In this study, the advantages and disadvantages of the current performance evaluations and algorithms for GSC performance evaluations were discussed and evaluated. Based on these findings, an improved five-dimensional balanced scorecard was proposed in which the green performance indicators were revised to facilitate their measurement. A model based on Rough Set theory, the Genetic Algorithm, and the Levenberg Marquardt Back Propagation (LMBP) neural network algorithm was proposed. Next, using Matlab, the Rosetta tool, and the practical data of company F, a case study was conducted. The results indicate that the proposed model has a high convergence speed and an accurate prediction ability. The credibility and effectiveness of the proposed model was validated. In comparison with the normal Back Propagation neural network algorithm and the LMBP neural network algorithm, the proposed model has greater credibility and effectiveness. In practice, this method provides a more suitable indicator system and algorithm for enterprises to be able to implement GSC performance evaluations in an uncertain environment. Academically, the proposed method addresses the lack of a theoretical basis for GSC performance evaluation, thus representing a new development in GSC performance evaluation theory.</jats:p>"

Our treatments vary the cost differences between firms in tiers 1 and 2. We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it outperforms the common assumption of leader–follower negotiations. We find a significant anchoring effect from a firm’s first bid but no effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect. We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while not compromising closure rates. Buy-side firms achieve much smaller price changes from anticoncessionary tactics and risk reduced closure, yielding no net benefit.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</jats:p>",

With the vertical technology spillovers, we explore the optimal decisions of centralized and decentralized supply chains with price dependent demand and propose coordination strategy for the decentralized supply chain. Considering the cost contraction effectiveness of the technology spillovers, the centralized and decentralized game theoretic models of a two-echelon supply chain are developed to investigate optimal decisions of pricing and carbon emissions reduction. Through a systematic comparison and numerical analysis, we show that the profits of both players and the entire supply chain improve with the effect of technology spillovers increasing. Carbon emissions reduction will be taken by various protective measures so that the supplier and the manufacturer who do not innovate can hardly share the results of innovating via the &amp;ldquo;free-riding&amp;rdquo; methods when the technology spillover is relatively small. We also propose a revenue-cost sharing contract through bargaining to enhance the performance of the decentralized supply chain.</jats:p>"

The potential of locally available mixed Mukondeni clay soils (MMCS) as a cheap adsorbent for the removal of fluoride from aqueous solution was investigated. Characterization of MMCS was done by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared and Brunauer Emmett Teller. Cation exchange capacity and point of zero charge of the clays were determined using standard methods. Parameters optimized included: contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial fluoride concentration, pH and temperature. Optimization experiments were done in batch procedures. The results showed that the optimum conditions for the defluoridation of water using MMCS are 60 min, 1.5 g, 9 mg/L, 1.5/100 S/L ratios, pH of 2 and a temperature of 25 °C. The equilibrium isotherm regression parameter (R2 = 0.95) showed that the Freundlich isotherm gave a better fit than the Langmuir isotherm (R2 = 0.52) which indicates multilayer adsorption. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics. This study indicated that locally available MMCS are good in the defluoridation of groundwater but modification through blending with metal oxide modified clays can enhance their adsorption capacity.</jats:p>",

The objective is to examine how the use of alternative measures of oil supply shocks affects our assessment of the dynamic effects of supply shocks on the real price of oil since 1990. Results show that for most of the 1990s, shortfalls in oil production that were brought about by geopolitical episodes accounted for about 7% of the variability in global crude oil production. However, this pattern reverses after 2000 onwards, as fluctuations in global oil production are largely attributed to market-specific events (6%). We show that oil supply shocks may have very different effects on the real price of oil, depending on the underlying specification of the shock. In particular, the measures that capture market-driven shifts in oil supply are found to be more plausible than the rest in explaining the variability of the real price of oil, especially when compared with flow supply shocks. In fact, analysis suggests that flow supply shocks underestimate the historical contribution of oil supply shocks to changes in the real price of oil, in contrast to total supply shocks that appear to have exerted significant upward pressure in the real price of oil especially between 2003 and mid-2008. Overall, endogenous supply shocks play an increasing important role in the historical evolution of the oil price, but it must be noted that oil price developments after 2010 are largely attributed to exogenous supply shocks. We conclude that historically the supply side of the market has been an important determinant of the real price of oil after all.</jats:p>",

Exergy flow diagrams for the systems of electricity and district heating as well as for the total supply system of energy and material resources for 2012 are presented. The share of renewable use has increased in both electricity and district heat production. The resource use is discussed in four sectors: residential and service, transportation, industry and agriculture. The resource use is also analyzed with respect to exergy efficiency and renewable share. The total exergy input of energy and material resources amounts to about 2700 PJ of which about 530 PJ was used for final consumption in 2012. The results are also compared with similar studies. Even though the share of renewable resource use has increased from 42% in 1980 to 47% in 2012, poor efficiency is still occurring in transportation, space heating, and food production. A strong dependence on fossil and nuclear fuels also implies a serious lack of sustainability. A more exergy efficient technology and a higher renewable energy share are needed in order to become a more sustainable society.</jats:p>"

Manufacturing firms are considered sustainable as long as their supply chains are also sustainable. The supply chain sustainability in manufacturing firms usually involves a wide range of stakeholders, within and outside the organization. Decision making for technology selection under sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) environment involves interaction among economic, environmental and societal factors in addition to quality, manufacturing flexibility, supply chain competitiveness, and customer satisfaction. To find a balance between different stakeholders’ preferences and often contradicting factors, creating optimal sustainable values for all of them makes the decision-making process much more complex. This study presents the list of critical factors for SSCM. The managerial implications of the result exhibit the development of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model for sustainable technology selection by developing an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model through simplified calculations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze the sourcing decision of a buyer choosing between two supplier types: responsible suppliers are costly but adhere to strict social and environmental responsibility standards, whereas risky suppliers are less expensive but may experience responsibility violations. A segment of the consumer population, called socially conscious, is willing to pay a higher price for a product sourced from a responsible supplier and may not purchase in the event of a responsibility violation from a risky supplier. We identify four possible sourcing strategies that a buyer might employ: low cost sourcing (sourcing from the risky supplier), dual sourcing, responsible niche sourcing (sourcing from a responsible supplier and selling only to socially conscious consumers), and responsible mass market sourcing (sourcing responsibly and selling to all consumers). We determine when each strategy is optimal and show that efforts to improve supply chain responsibility that focus on consumers (by increasing their willingness to pay for responsibility or increasing the number of consumers that are socially conscious) or increasing supply chain transparency may lead to unintended consequences, such as an increase in risky sourcing. Efforts that focus on enforcement and penalizing the buyer, however, never backfire and always lead to more responsible sourcing and less risky sourcing. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents an entropy-based method for designing an optimum bay water salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay (S.F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S.F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation–distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S.F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, numerous hydraulic transient simulations for different scenarios and various air pockets combinations were carried out in order to fully validate the diagnostic. As a result, it was determined that small air pocket volumes located along the pipeline profile were recognized as the direct cause of the PCCP rupture. Further, a detail survey of the pipeline was performed using a combination of non-destructive technologies in order to determine if immediate intervention was required to replace PCC pipes. In addition, a hydraulic model was employed to analyze the behavior of air pockets located at high points of the pipeline.</jats:p>"

Research found that air-scour versus water only backwash improved the nutrient limited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal by 8%. In addition, nutrient supplementation and backwash alteration improved DOC removals by 19% for the 25:5:1 column and 14% for the 100:10:1 column. Potassium supplementation with the 25:5:1 C:N:P ratio column had no discernible effect on DOC removal. No correlation with phospholipid (7–474 nmol P/g media) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (0.6 × 105–32.74 × 105 pg ATP/g media) values with DOC removal were found.

Tujuan penelitian ini adalah mendapatkan hasil analisis terhadap dua supplier bahan baku pembuatan rubber ring. Analisis tersebut dilakukan karena ada keterbatasan dan kelebihan diantara dua supplier. Supplier pertama dari perusahan Perkebunan Nusantara Karet (PT PN) yang mampu menyediakan bahan baku dengan kualitas baik tetapi memiliki kebijakan minimal pemesanan bahan baku karet diatas 5000 kg, sedangkan supplier kedua dari masyarkat memiliki ketersediaan bahan baku yang selalu ada tetapi kualitas bahan baku karet kurang baik sehingga harus ada proses penanganan tambahan dan tambahan bahan baku yang lain. Dengan permasalahan diatas maka dilakukan analisis perbandingan bahan baku dari kedua supplier tersebut dari aspek total ongkos yang dikeluarkan dan ketersediaan bahan baku. Metode yang digunakan dalam melakukan analisis perbandingan bahan baku ini adalah metode permintaan bahan baku karet dimasa yang akan datang, ongkos-ongkos yang terlibat dipersediaan, perbandingan ongkos yang dikeluarkan antara supplier PT PN dan supplier masyarakat. Berdasarkan hasil perhitungan perbandingan bahan baku diperoleh total ongkos yang paling kecil adalah menggunakan bahan baku dari supplier PT PN sebesar Rp. 192.842.775,00/tahun dengan laba yang diperoleh perusahaan sebesar Rp. 62.531.292/bulan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The production of oil requires a tremendous amount of energy through a distributed combustion network of processes along the oil supply chain spectrum. The consequences of fossil-based fuel combustion include the generation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and hazardous wastewater residues, which have adverse environmental effects. Moreover, GHG emissions impose indirect costs in terms of public health care expenses and environmental remediation measures on the society. Additionally, countries depending on fossil resource imports to meet their energy needs are exposed to the energy market cycles and geopolitical affairs. These events may represent significant economic distortions at regionals and locals levels. Potential mitigation options for GHG emissions are the application of renewable energy sources. This research deals with the integration of renewable energy systems in the upstream oil supply chain to evaluate the impact of energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on the oil operations efficiency and environment. The main focus is to evaluate solar energy as an alternative to produce part of the energy requirements in the upstream oil supply chain. In this chapter, potential solar energy integration in the upstream oil industry is identified to comply with CO2 constraints while sustaining production targets. An analysis of GHG emission sources and their associated flow rates in the upstream oil supply chain, mainly CO2, is also discussed in this chapter. An analysis of different types of solar energy options and the identification of the most suitable technologies for the oil and gas industry is studied.</jats:p>",

Then, the operational laws and the distance measures of HTrFNs are presented. Afterwards, a useful outranking method, the hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy QUALIFLEX method, is developed to handle the MCDM problems with hierarchical structure in the environment of HTrFN. At length, the proposed method is applied to evaluating green supply chain initiatives in order to achieve sustainable economic and environmental performance, and a case study concerned with a fashion retail chain is presented to demonstrate its feasibility and applicability, also, a comparative analysis with other relevant approaches is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Based on panel data of Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2003 to 2012, this paper employs spatial panel data models to examine the strategic interaction among local governments in industrial land supply and to indentify its possible sources. The empirical results show that there exists strategic interaction among local governments in industrial land leasing price. Local governments’ industrial land leasing price is significantly impacted by the action of neighbouring cities. They mimic each other – in terms of industrial land leasing price to attract outside investments. Empirical evidence reveals that the strategic interaction comes from both yardstick competition and resource flow effects. Local governments react more to their neighbours’ industrial land leasing price during political cycle periods. </jats:p>",

Groundwater discharge to the river can significantly impact the ecologic environment in the Nalenggele River basin, but few hydrogeological studies have been conducted in the inland arid basin. In this paper, two sections were chosen to analyze the groundwater discharge in the downstream of Nalenggele River. Section I–I′ is located in the west of the downstream of this river, while section II–II′ is in the east. Two methods were used to calculate the discharge in section I–I′: Darcy's law and Modflow simulation. In these two methods, the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the stream sediment is a key parameter, which was determined by a falling-head permeameter test in the river. The results show that the groundwater discharges by the above two methods are very close to the results of a previous study by the 222Rn mass balance method. This is the first attempt to use a field test method to obtain the vertical hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient, and to illustrate the groundwater discharge in the downstream of Nalenggele River in Northwestern China by classic methods.</jats:p>",

The dynamics of interest are originally described by a distributed-parameter model for fast steam flows over a pipe network coupled with a lumped-parameter model for slow internal dynamics of boilers. We derive a lumped-parameter model for the dynamics through physically relevant approximations. The derived model is then analyzed theoretically and numerically in terms of existence of normally hyperbolic invariant manifold in the phase space of the model. The existence of the manifold is a dynamical evidence that the derived model preserves the slow–fast dynamics, and suggests a separation principle of short-term and long-term operations of steam supply systems, which is analog to electric power systems. We also quantitatively verify the correctness of the derived model by comparison with brute-force simulation of the original model.</jats:p>",

We do so by using an extensive, hand-collected data set that captures the supply chain relationships of bankrupt firms over the time period 1990–2009. Looking at a sample of more than 2,000 loan contracts, we compare the average borrowing cost of suppliers in the two years prior to the bankruptcy of a key customer to the average cost in the two years following the announced bankruptcy. We find the average loan spreads increase by roughly 20% following the customer’s announced bankruptcy. These effects are even stronger if the bankrupt firm is operating within a distressed industry or when there is a strong supplier–customer relationship. We also find that the structure of lending agreements significantly changes in the aftermath of a client bankruptcy. More specifically, we find that the number of covenants increases and the lead banker(s) take an increasingly important role in the period following the client’s bankruptcy. Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into the financial implications of supply chain changes. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Uday Rajan, finance. </jats:p>",

Previous models aiming to constrain source processes were unable to include realistic mechanical and thermal rock properties, and the role of thermomechanical heterogeneity in magma accumulation was unclear. Here we show how spatio-temporal deformation and magma reservoir evolution are fundamentally controlled by three-dimensional thermomechanical heterogeneity. Using the example of continued inflation at Aira caldera, Japan, we demonstrate that magma is accumulating faster than it can be erupted, and the current uplift is approaching the level inferred prior to the violent 1914 Plinian eruption. Magma storage conditions coincide with estimates for the caldera-forming reservoir ~29,000 years ago, and the inferred magma supply rate indicates a ~130-year timeframe to amass enough magma to feed a future 1914-sized eruption. These new inferences are important for eruption forecasting and risk mitigation, and have significant implications for the interpretations of volcanic deformation worldwide.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydraulic power units operated as constant supply pressure systems remain to be widely used in the industry, to supply valve controlled hydraulic drives etc., where the hydraulic power units are constituted by variable pumps with mechanical outlet pressure control, driven by induction motors. In the analysis of supplied drives, both linear and rotary, emphasis is commonly placed on the drives themselves and the related loads, and the supply system dynamics is often given only little attention, and usually neglected or taken into account in a simplified fashion. The simplified supply system dynamics used in such analyzes is often justified by short supply lines and/or the utilization of accumulators near valve inlets, accounting for the majority of possible supply pressure variations. Such considerations are reasonable in many test benches, where the supply pressure variations are small enough such that limited impact on the drive dynamics is observed. Such ideal properties however, are not necessarily present in industrial hydraulic applications for various reasons, with the most common being large volumes of supply lines. Long supply lines, hence large supply line volumes, between the supply system and drives will reduce the flow-to-pressure gain of the supply system, and hence increase the time constant of the supply pressure dynamics. A consequence of this may be large variations in the supply pressure, hence large variations in the pump shaft torque, and thereby the induction motor load torque, with possible excitation of the induction motor dynamics as a result. In such cases, the coupled dynamics of the pressure controlled pump and induction motor may influence the supply pressure significantly, possibly affecting the dynamics of the supplied drives, especially in cases where pilot operated valves with internal pilot supply are used. This paper is concerned with the analysis and characterization of the coupled pump-induction motor dynamics, confined to hydraulic power units constituted by an axial piston pump with mechanical outlet pressure control, driven by an induction motor operated at grid conditions. Furthermore, a simplified general model representation of the coupled dynamics is established, accounting for the entire dominating dynamics of the supply unit. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the simplified model representation.</jats:p>",

Results show that the average production WF of Xiamen was 881.75 Mm3/year and remained relatively stable during the study period, while the consumption WF of Xiamen increased from 979.56 Mm3/year to 1,664.97 Mm3/year over the study period. Xiamen thus became a net importer of virtual water since 2001. Livestock was the largest contributor to the total WF from both production and consumption perspectives; it was followed by crops, industry, household use, and commerce. The efficiency of the production WF has increased in Xiamen, and its per capita consumption WF was relatively low. The city faces continuing growth in its consumption WF, so more attention should be paid to improving local irrigation, reducing food waste, and importing water-intensive agricultural products.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid urbanization faced by Sarawak has raised the concern on whether the current water supply isadequate to cater for the increasing demands in future. This study focuses on identifying the potential options of watersupply resources and management practices for Sarawak in future. The water supply resources and management practicesfrom other countries are reviewed as to provide guidance for Sarawak in improving their water supply resources andmanagement practices. The desk study is performed by collecting data and information from existing resources such asinternet, government agencies, journal papers, and published reports. In this study, five types of water resources wereconsidered to be used by studied countries including surface water, groundwater, desalinated water, rainwater and reclaimedwater. The usage of surface water is recorded as the highest among all resources for both in Sarawak and other countries. Interms of water storage system, the difference between Sarawak and other countries are not significant as they adoptedalmost the similar systems such as reservoir and well. Ideally, there are three proposed potential options regarding watersupply resources for Sarawak in future namely rainwater harvesting, desalinated water and reclaimed water. Nonetheless,most of the management practices in other countries had already been practiced by Sarawak itself but may differ in terms oftechnologies and method of applications. Thus, effective water resources management must be supported by understandingof the availability of the resource itself in order to address the probable challenges in future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Suppliers have a particular role to play in assuring competitiveness in supply chains. This article investigates the relationship between first and second tier suppliers in automotive supply chains in South Africa. Automotive component suppliers (first tier suppliers to assemblers (OEMS) such as Toyota) should make an extra effort to retain their suppliers (second tier), particularly suppliers of strategic parts, to assure the best value adding by the suppliers in the highly competitive supply chain landscape. To assure best value from suppliers they need to be retained in an active trusting, long term, collaborative relationship.  The more the customer trusts the supplier, the higher the perceived value of the relationship and the more likely parties will work together to retain the business relationship. The aim of this quantitative study amongst first tier suppliers is to obtain more insight into the relationships and the hierarchical correlation between the relationship value, trust and supplier retention in automotive supply chains in South Africa. With a regression analysis it was found that both trust and relationship value are substantial predictors of supplier retention, but trust is more important for supplier retention.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studying the operational motivation of a retailer to publicly announce his forecast information, this paper shows that by making forecast information publicly available to both his manufacturer and to the competitor, a retailer is able to credibly share his forecast information—an outcome that cannot be achieved by merely exchanging information within the supply chain. We model a market comprised of an incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a signal about the consumer’s demand, which may be high or low. We first confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since, regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level. However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as well as consumers. In addition, we show that compared to the advance purchase contract, all the firms except the incumbent manufacturer can be better off using public information sharing under a simple wholesale price contract. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

Such an approach, however, requires tools to analyse and simulate the complete system including both physical and cultural environments. One of the main challenges, in this regard, is the design and development of tools able to simulate the society's water demand behaviour and the way policy measures affect it. The effects of these policy measures are a function of personal attitudes that subsequently lead to the formation of people's behaviours. This work focuses on the exploration of social impact theory on water conservation attitudes of urban households. A model is designed and implemented using agent based modelling. The developed model's ability to represent social structure and mechanisms of social influences is tested against historical data from the 1988–1994 drought of Athens, Greece as a case study.</jats:p>",

Theoretical analysis of the possibility to achieve exploitation features of currently known portable sources of electric current has led the author to a conclusion that even the best solutions will not meet the desired mass and volume magnitudes in relation to the energy supplied. Therefore, if the sources of energy have reached the physically and economically justified capability limits and they are characterized by significantly varied exploitation properties, a solution combining the advantages of various sources of energy through energy management seems to be sensible. In this connection this article presents the idea of a system of energy control, which using available cells will allow for reducing the weight of power supply systems. The considerations are based on defense-related applications, this, however, does not exclude applications for civilian purposes.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that preventive or remediation actions are necessary to improve its water quality. Water samples were collected between 2012 and 2013 at five sampling stations at the Mopanshan Reservoir, and analyzed for CODMn and total nitrogen (TN). SPSS software was used to carry out analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Spatially, CODMn and TN exhibited a rather small distinction in the horizontal direction, but there was a significant difference regarding TN in the vertical orientation. The concentration of TN also increased with the increase in sampling depth. Seasonally, the concentration of CODMn and TN showed a pronounced seasonal pattern and was divided into four periods. CODMn reached a maximum in September and was at a minimum in June. And TN reached a maximum in June and was at a minimum in November or December. The use of correlation analysis shows that the regular variations of TN were primarily affected by temperature. The main form of nitrogen in the Mopanshan Reservoir is NO3-N, and the change of TN is consistent with that of NO3-N. By Pearson correlation coefficient, the seasonal variability of CODMn correlated to changes in the reservoir's water level. The results showed that the concentration of TN exceeded the guideline values in most months and CODMn was slightly over the standard limit. Thus, it is urgent that preventive actions and remediation processes are developed to improve the water quality in this reservoir.</jats:p>",

Islamabad is the capital city, located at the foot of the Margallah Hills, whereas Rawalpindi lies in the Potohar Plateau. Both cities are located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan, where the residents meet their basic need of water through groundwater resources. For the last many years, the quantity and quality of groundwater in these cities has been deteriorating very rapidly. In this study, the foremost recharge source for these cities was identified using tritium and major ion chemistry, and different physiochemical parameters were studied to find out the facts behind the quality deterioration of the groundwater. Tritium values and chemical data suggested that aquifers located in the territory of Islamabad were mainly recharged by upland areas (the Margalla Hills), which accounts for their low electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids contents. A higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) suggested an alteration in recharge patterns through soil compaction and cementation (from increased construction activity) that reduced the recharge inputs. The high SAR also disturbs the recharge pattern and had disturbed the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system, deteriorating the quality of the water.</jats:p>",

However, due to the complex nature of sedimentation, determining the governing equations is difficult and the results of the available classic models for computing bedload transport rate often differ from each other. This paper focuses on the capability of a support vector machine (SVM) as a meta-model approach for predicting bedload transport in pipes. The method was applied for the deposition and limit of deposition states of sediment transport. Two different scenarios were proposed: in Scenario 1, the input combinations were prepared using only hydraulic characteristics, on the other hand, Scenario 2 was built using both hydraulic and sediment characteristics as model inputs of bedload transport. A comparison between the SVM and the employed classic approaches in predicting sediment transport indicated the supreme performance of the SVM, in which more accurate results were obtained. Also it was found that for estimation of bedload transport in pipes, Scenario 2 led to a more valid outcome than Scenario 1. Based on the sensitivity analysis, parameters Frm and d50/y in the limit of deposition state and Frm in the deposition state had the more dominant role in prediction of bedload discharge in pipes than other parameters.</jats:p>",

Typically, when developing mathematical models magnetocavitation systems (magnetic bearings, electrostatic bearings, hybrid magnetic bearings (GMP, etc.) is considered just the very bearing as a separate, isolated Electromechanical system. This approach allows us to accurately explore the process magnetocavitation systems, but practically does not allow to evaluate the processes occurring in the system of magnetic bearing-object position. To solve this problem, the author proposes a different approach to the analysis of the processes in magnetocavitation systems in General and GPC in particular considering the magnetic bearing-object position, as a single complex. Goal. The work aimed the creation of a generalized analytical model of high-speed, AMPE with coercivity permanent magnet (VPM) on an elastic bearing supports, taking into account the mutual influence of processes in AMPA and bearing supports. This task is new and relevant and is essential to modern engineering. To solve this problem this paper developed a generalized mathematical model of the rotor system on a hybrid magnetic suspension. Evaluate the impact of hybrid magnetic bearings on the overall behavior of the rotor system. Performed analysis of processes in Electromechanical energy converters and mechanical processes occurring in the rotary system. Method and methodology. The research methodology is based on the joint solution of Maxwell equations and equations describing the mechanical processes of a rotor system with five degrees of freedom. Conclusion. The generalized mathematical model of high-speed, AMPE with VPM on a non-contact bearing supports and conducted her research. Based on research of the developed mathematical model, the authors developed an original control algorithm for the rotor position in a hybrid magnetic bearings, which allows for the design of high-speed, AMPE with VPM to abandon the position sensors of the rotor. In addition, on the basis of the results of calculations, a method was developed for diagnostics of eccentricity of rotor are high-speed, AMPE with VPM, as well as new methods of calculation of high-speed, AMPE with VPM, past experimental verification.</jats:p>"

Cette demande sociale implique au sein de la dyade ST-DO des modalités de contrôle de l’expression des responsabilités de chacun et une communication/un dialogue avec les parties prenantes. La stratégie de réponse à cette demande sociale doit alors permettre d’apporter des solutions aux attentes de réduction de l’incertitude et d’accès à l’information des parties prenantes. La problématique porte ici sur la compréhension de la formulation d’une réponse à une demande sociale d’amélioration des conditions de travail chez les sous-traitants au travers du cas Apple. L’étude présente une analyse des « Rapports de progrès de la responsabilité des fournisseurs » du géant de l’informatique Apple de leur naissance en 2007 à aujourd’hui. Le traitement de ce corpus à l’aide du logiciel d’analyse textuelle Alceste a permis de mettre en lumière une stratégie de réponse structurée autour de l’organisation des relations partenariales de la dyade DO-ST, de la gestion des risques chez le ST et de la structuration de la relation d’emploi chez le ST.</jats:p>",

Statistical relationships between CWSI and yield, quality parameters and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) were investigated. Irrigations were scheduled based on 100 (I100), 85 (I85), 70 (I50) and 0% (I0) of plant water requirement. CWSI values were calculated from the measurements of canopy temperatures by infrared thermometer, air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values for all the irrigated treatments. The highest IWUE was found in I70 with 9.16 and 1.66 kg m−3 for the root and sugar yield, respectively, in 2013. A non-water stressed baseline (lower line) equation for sugar beet was measured from full irrigated plots as (Tc − Ta)ll = −0.832VPD + 2.1811; R2 = 0.6508. There was a high determination coefficient between CWSI with the root and sugar yield and IWUE. The CWSI could be used to determine the irrigation time of sugar beet, and 0.3 could be offered as a threshold value. Results indicated that the CWSI can be used to evaluate crop water stress and improve irrigation scheduling for sugar beet under semiarid conditions.</jats:p>",

Industrial equipment (in particular, a hot-rolling mill) is subject to high loads that are close to critical. Therefore, the issues related to the development and applications of methods aimed at reducing of energy consumption during rolling are being solved before the product output. One of the efficient ways to reduce energy-power parameters of the process is the use of the rolling lubrication feed systems (RLFS) in the production of hot-rolled products. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the method of supplying lubricating material (LM), its quantity, shared contact surfaces nature. Currently, one of the significant drawbacks in the RLFS is the lack of correlation between the quantity of fed LM and properties of the rolled material. As a result, RLFS are used in a restricted mode, and power consumption reduction is not significant: 3-6%.</jats:p>"

Wool samples free of visible contamination were obtained from the withers of the ewes and the lambs using bended scissors. Approximately 10 ml of milk samples were collected by hand milking. Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, S, P, Se and Zn content were determined by ICP-OES (Perkin-Elmer, Optima 3300 DV). Statistical analyses were carried out by SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) GLM procedure. Wool mineral content did not show deficient supply in case of ewes. Young lamb’s wool mineral composition is distinct from those measured in adult ewes. This fact and the lack of significant correlation between ewe and lamb mineral status indicates strictly regulated mineral passage through placenta.</jats:p>"

RSST declare that sustainability of the ecosystem cycle must be achieved (even in the face of disaster conditions) by all institutions. RSST believe that practitioners can be taught the necessary attitudes and skills by business and engineering schools. It is noteworthy that the ecosystem cycle they describe is accompanied by marketing and financial decision cycles running parallel from inception of ideas to the “end of life” closure that starts a new cycle for closed‐loop product planning. For these coexisting, interdependent, all‐encompassing systems, the RSST team leaves no doubt about the evolution of teaching and research opportunities for young POM scholars. These authors focus on the fact that everything that is not morphing is likely to become counterproductive in the not too far future. This is a critical point of view which is based on the fact that the status quo is highly vulnerable. Also, very special is the RSST warning that changes are required in the status quo which must be made without damaging the existing fabric. This non‐disruptive way of doing POM business has been remarkably successful for the cohesion of the field over the past 25 years. There is agreement that it is great to shake things up without tearing those things apart. All of this leads to the conclusion that the advice of these authors (RSST) is correct and valuable. Debate and disputation of these points is encouraged and expected by the RSST team. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supercapacitors (also referred to as ultracapacitors, electric double-layer capacitors) bridge the gap between rechargeable batteries and electrolytic capacitors with moderate capacity and fast charging and are very promising for electric energy storage. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors are also superior regarding cycle life, specific power, and operating temperature. However, the cost per kWh of supercapacitors are tenfold to lithium-ion batteries. Printed electronics offers a route to a low-cost manufacturing platform that enables mass production of supercapacitors at low cost. Supercapacitors are usually charged with constant current supply, for example, Keithley 2200 programmable power supply. Here we present a current supply with single organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) to charge supercapacitors. The current supply takes power directly from the electric grid (115 V AC, US standard), converts the AC voltage to a quasi-constant current (~0.1 mA) regardless of the impedance of loads, and charges the supercapacitors. This work demonstrates steps towards all printable supercapacitor energy storage systems integrated with chargers that enable direct charging from the power outlet. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Solution-processed OTFTs based on the popular polymer semiconductor P3HT have been developed to rectify 115 V AC voltage. The P3HT OTFTs were fabricated on glass substrates and Au electrodes for drain and source were patterned with a standard UV-lithographic lift-off process. The thickness of the spin-coated P3HT layer is around 35 nm. In order to operate the transistors at such high voltage, a rather thick (2500 nm) polymer PMMA was deposited on the P3HT as the gate dielectric. For gate electrodes, 100 nm Al was subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow-mask. The channel length and width are 50 um and 55 mm respectively. The transistors delivers 0.7mA current when the drain voltage and the gate voltage are both at -200V. The average mobility is 2.6x10<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/Vs while the average threshold voltage is 2V. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A diode-configured OTFT was used to rectify 115 V AC as a half-wave rectifier. Paralleling a 15-uF capacitor with the load, the ripples were smoothed and a DC output was obtained. With a 10-kΩ load, the output current is 0.1 mA at a voltage of 1 V. Varying the load from 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ, the voltage across the load increased to 8 V (eight times higher) while the output current dropped only 20% to 0.08 mA. The rectifier thus provides quasi-constant current output for different loads. In addition, no other voltage step-down devices, for instance, transformers, are required to take the 115 V AC voltage down to a few volts. During charging of the supercapacitors, the load resistor also works as a protection device that protects against overcharging. This single OTFT current source was demonstrated to charge a 430mF supercapacitors to 1 V directly using 115 V AC voltage from power outlet.</jats:p>",

Aside from a few anecdotes, however, little is known about the decision‐making process that leads to speedy responses and about its impeding and supporting antecedents. Using the organizational information‐processing perspective, this empirical study unravels the disruption management process along a sequence of four stages—disruption recognition, disruption diagnosis, response development, and response implementation—and hypothesizes constraining and mediating effects of these stages. The findings contribute to an improved understanding of the role that the decision stages play in mitigating supply chain disruptions, and confirm the prediction that the speed with which information is processed and the stages are worked through positively affects supply chain performance. In addition, the findings suggest that one of the stages, <jats:italic>diagnosis</jats:italic>, acts as a constraining factor to the other stages. The stages also play a mediating role between the impact that the disruption has and a firm's readiness (prior to a disruption), dependence on a key supplier, and supply chain complexity. This provides guidance to decision makers in the application of resources both prior to a negative event and during a disruption recovery.</jats:p>",

Although quality can be maintained with appropriate operation and maintenance strategies, supplying increasing demand in terms of quantity is a problem, because large-scale investments are sought for water supply utilities. However, satisfaction of consumer cannot be neglected under these circumstances. Hence the objective of the current study is to examine the influence of the level of service supplied, water quality variations and the geographical location of consumers on their perceptions on service delivery, satisfaction and risk perception. The study was limited to Matara WSS, Southern Sri Lanka. Results of the logistic regression analysis show that the area of residence is the most influential parameter on the taste satisfaction and risk perception. Satisfaction on safety, odour and clarity is more than 95% of the respondents. However, satisfaction on the service delivery is poor and perceived pressure has a major impact on the satisfaction on service delivery and consumption, hence indicating that perceived pressure has a close relationship with the discharge. Further, the study confirms that socio-economic parameters are influential on the risk perception and satisfaction of the consumers. It can be concluded that proper management of available water quantity will increase the level of satisfaction in terms of service delivery.</jats:p>",

However, little information exists on the effects of cistern materials and construction methods on water quality. This study assessed the quality of rainwater and harvested rainwater stored in different types of cisterns, using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The harvesting system consisted of ditches underground to direct the water stream collected by catchments through pipes to the two-stage grit chambers, the rainwater runoff ultimately being fed into the cisterns. Water samples were collected monthly over 6 months from October 2008 to April 2009. The harvested rainwater generally did not meet drinking water standards due to severe bacterial contamination. To determine the factors affecting water quality, principal components and factor analysis divided the water's physicochemical composition into four principal components: ions, suspended pollutants, reducing substances, and acidity-alkalinity, which collectively accounted for 80.4% of the total variance. Cluster analysis confirmed the results. It was determined that pollutants in harvested rainwater were mainly derived from the catchments, surrounding fields, and local atmosphere. Furthermore, factor scores ranked water quality to select the optimum material and construction method. It was concluded that cement was superior to stabilized soil for rainwater storage. However, considering water quality, cost, and environmental friendliness the stabilized soil cistern using the stiff construction method was worthy of consideration.</jats:p>",

Therefore, 1,4-dioxane removal during catalytic ozonation was investigated in this study, and activated carbon was selected as the ideal catalyst. The removal efficiency of 1,4-dioxane by ozonation was promoted significantly using activated carbon compared with that of ozonation only. Tert-butyl alcohol significantly reduced the removal efficiency of 1,4-dioxane during catalytic ozonation, which suggested that hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were formed during catalytic ozonation and played an important role in decomposing 1,4-dioxane. Additionally, results concerning the stability of activated carbon indicated that the catalytic activity of this catalyst remained steady during ozonation.</jats:p>",

Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Thailand ranks number one in automotive production contributing $US11.4 billion to the Thai economy and 12 percent to Thailand’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product), with the automotive industry being Thailand’s leading export sector. However, the automotive companies envisage the difficulty of cultural diversity to manage and coordinate. Therefore, cultural values from the milieu are inducted into the workplace and have a strong impact on both individual behavior and organizational effectiveness and must be direction at all levels for cross-cultural, organizational effectiveness to be achieved. It also became evident that natural disasters are frequent and highly disruptive to the global automotive supply chain and paces must be taken to countervailing the notable and continuing loss to economic growth and organizational effectiveness to both sector units and the global industry. The implementation of strategically placed, environmentally ‘habituated’, automotive parts logistics cache might be one solution to the problem. Given the crucial importance of this sector to the economy of the region and the global supply chain, the researchers surveyed 220 managers using a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire within the multinational industrial clusters of Thailand’s ‘Detroit of Asia’ Eastern Seaboard region. Using Structural Equation Modelling to test the 11 variables on Logistics Management, Supply Chain Management and Organizational Effectiveness in a cross-cultural context, it was determined that collaboration within the supply chain and the exchange of information can reduce uncertainty, with trust being a key ingredient to a JV’s success. Communication (0.836), trust (0.834) and collaboration (0.824) were ranked as significant components of cross-cultural Supply Chain Management effectiveness. The research also confirmed that the hypothesized difficulty from cultural diversity is difficult to manage and to coordinate. Analysis also confirmed the ongoing and significant problems to the global automotive supply chain by natural disasters and the consequential economic losses.</jats:p>",

The authors propose in this study, a method for monitoring the dynamic evolution of risk associated to delays affecting the transportation operations. They use the failure mode and effects analysis around failure scenarios and they evaluate risk using probability and cost. A failure scenario probability is estimated dynamically in discrete points based on event occurrences during the process execution. Delay risk is then assessed on‐line and preventive actions can be undertaken before execution ended. The implementation of this method is performed by monitoring a delivery process facing risks associated to delays in the transport stream.</jats:p>",

Reports from laboratory-scale research on the particle growth kinetics of calcium carbonate in pellet reactors have been put forward. However, the reports have not been comprehensive as they only consider the influence of supersaturation on the calcium carbonate growth process. The influence of three factors, namely, the superficial velocity (SV), particle size (L0), and supersaturation (S) on the particle growth rate of calcium carbonate were investigated in a pilot-scale study, and two models of particle growth rate and fixed bed height growth rate were built. The linear particle growth model G = 3.90 × 10−SV1.93L0−1.56S2.13 at the bottom of the pellet reactor was built based on a pilot-scale study of particle growth kinetics influenced by SV, L0, and S. The growth of the fixed bed height is closely related to the particle growth and also influenced by the three factors. The fixed bed growth model Rh = 5.19 × 10−8SV1.65L0−0.93S2.58 also incorporates SV, L0, and S, and provides a method for calculating the fixed bed height. The two models were built based on the pilot-scale experiment and were different from those previously reported. They are applicable as pellet discharge guides and are used in the management of pellet reactors.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the use of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipe has increased dramatically, yet the potential for leaching of phthalates, which are endocrine disrupting compounds associated with adverse reproductive effects in humans, has not been examined. In this study, the potential of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (cPVC) and red, blue, and heat PEX piping to leach phthalates into static hot and cold water after 2, 8, and 48 hours was evaluated. Concentrations of six phthalates, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl-butyl phthalate (BBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and di(n-octyl) phthalate (DNOP), were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pipe type (F3,71 = 15.6, P = 0.001) contributed significantly to phthalate concentrations in water, while temperature (F4,71 = 1.74, P = 0.106) and time (F4,71 = 1.02, P = 0.427) were not significant factors. Significantly higher concentrations of DEP, DBP, and BBP were observed in cPVC pipe (&amp;lt;method detection limits (MDL) to 466 ng L−1, 252–4,219 ng L−1, 473–18,400 ng L−1, respectively) compared to blue PEX (T2 = 12.2, P &amp;lt; 0.001; &amp;lt;MDL, &amp;lt;MDL − 140 ng L−1, &amp;lt;MDL − 459 ng L−1, respectively), red PEX (T2 = 19.3, P &amp;lt; 0.001; &amp;lt;MDL, &amp;lt;MDL − 188 ng L−1, &amp;lt;MDL − 881 ng L−1, respectively), and heat PEX (T2 = 19.9, P &amp;lt; 0.001; &amp;lt;MDL, &amp;lt;MDL − 162 ng L−1, &amp;lt;MDL − 169 ng L−1, respectively). Phthalate exposure from drinking water via cPVC or PEX is low when compared to other dietary sources. Nonetheless, a shift from cPVC to PEX pipes in households would decrease potential exposure to phthalates.</jats:p>",

In developed countries, the production and consumption of energy from renewable sources for industry is growing every year. In Russia it is used hardly, but the potential of renewable energy is huge. This is due to the peculiarities of the country – there are a lot of hydrocarbons in Russia, and industry has focus on hydrocarbon energy sources. At the same time, in our country there are the situations where renewables can be an essential complement centralized system of electrification. But in Russia there is no mechanism of regulation of the supply / demand of alternative energy.

Here we investigate how the time taken to accumulate colluvium affects landslide triggering rate in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA and how this may affect future landslide hazards. We calculated the failure potential of 283 hollows by comparing colluvium depths to the minimum (critical) soil depth required for landslide initiation in each hollow. Our data show that most hollow soil depths are close to their critical depth, with 62% of hollows having soils that are too thin to fail. Our results, supported by numerical modeling, reveal that landslide frequency in many humid landscapes may be insensitive to projected changes in the frequency of intense rainfall events.</jats:p>"

A prototype receiver for wireless power reception, fabricated in in AMS CMOS 0.35 μm technology, was used to verify correct operation of the proposed tuning.

One set of factors that impacts on the funding of the supply-side of housing are economic factors comprising market forces, cost of inputs, the macro economy and the cost of funding. This paper sets to establish the relationship between economic factors and funding of the supply-side of housing in Kenya and also the effect of the major stakeholders on such a relationship if it exists. Using an explanatory form of approach in research design a survey was conducted where primary data was collected by self-administered questionnaires from a random sample of 212 branches in Nairobi of financial institutions drawn from a population of 43 commercial banks, 9 deposit-taking MFIs and three major financiers of housing development. Factor analysis, correlation analysis and ordinal logit regression were used to determine the relationship between funding of housing and economic factors. Results indicated a negative relationship between economic factors and funding of housing development. It was also established that there exists a positive moderating effect of stakeholders on the relationship between economic factors and funding of housing development. The implication being the government and policy makers should ensure that interest rates and inflation rates are kept at a level that will encourage investments in housing, with the government acting then more as an enabler.</jats:p>"

Specifically, this article focuses the number, nature and nomenclature of programs offered by existing public and private universities in Malaysia and assesses whether the graduates meet the demand of the industry players. This study covers eleven (11) public universities and three (3) private institutions which offer MIF programs both at undergraduate and graduate levels. Based on the survey on existing programs and student enrolment in Muamalat and Islamic Finance (MIF) programs offered by these institutions, the findings reveal that there are 89 Islamic finance programs offered at the various Malaysian institutions. Out of these, 21 are PhD, 36 Masters, 27 Bachelors and 5 Diploma programs. The survey also found that programs with banking and finance focus are the majority constituting at least 37%. These are followed by Muamalat (Shariah and Law) focused programs to the tune of 25%. Others are Islamic economics (20%), Islamic Management (15%) and Islamic accounting (3%). The analysis was also done to critically re-define Islamic Finance education into five domains that is Muamalat (Shariah and Law), Islamic Finance, Islamic Economics, Islamic Accounting and Islamic management and abbreviated as MIF. The study further recommends that Ministry of Education and MQA need to facilitate the approval of new programs in Islamic accounting, Islamic economics and Islamic management. Universities that offer MIF programs should also diversify their programs based on the five domains. Hence, there is a dire need for policy ramifications to include a balance of students’ enrolments in all the five domains to achieve the government target of 54,000 Islamic Finance talents in 2020.   </jats:p>"

However the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Indonesia was only 35%in 2013. One of the main factors affecting low exclusive breastfeeding rate was maternal perception of having low breastmilk supply. There were no previous studies examining the effect of \"Insufficient Milk Supply\" concept intervention on mother’s perception of low breastmilk production. This research was an innovation in nursing.Aim: To investigate the effect of intervention program based on “Insufficient Milk Supply” concept on mother’s perception of low breastmilk supply.Methods: This study was a quasy experiment pretest-posttest. Postpartum mothers were provided an intervention using a module based on the concept of \"Insufficient Milk Supply\". The perception of breastmilk production was measured using the Nine-items of Lactation Scale. Data were analyzed using independent t test and paired t test.Results: The t test assumptions were examined and yielded that the data were normally distributed and the variances were homogeneous. The results showed there were significant differences between the scores of pre- and post-test in the intervention group (t = -9,03, p &lt; 0.001).Conclusion: This study offers evidence that Insufficient Milk Supply can be used in nursing practice as a concept to improve the perception of the mother's breastmilk supply.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the watershed-scale mechanisms determining production of these compounds are still poorly understood. In a recent study, the addition of both nitrogen and phosphorus significantly increased 2-methylisoborneol (MIB). Not surprisingly, MIB was correlated with cyanobacterial abundance (a well-known producer of off-flavor compounds); however, MIB was most strongly correlated with diatom abundance. To empirically test for differences in the production of two important off-flavor compounds, specifically MIB and geosmin, by either cyanobacteria or diatoms, we conducted a fully factorial experiment that manipulated two factors that typically promote cyanobacteria (nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization) or diatoms (vertical mixing of the water column). As predicted, fertilization promoted cyanobacteria, and vertical mixing favored diatoms. Interestingly, the production of geosmin was rapid and consistent with an increase in cyanobacteria while MIB production increased later in the experiment when cyanobacterial biovolume tended to decline and diatom biovolume increased. Based on our current and previous studies, MIB and geosmin production is associated with cyanobacteria, but the direct or indirect influence of diatoms on production should not be ignored.</jats:p>",

Three multi‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) models, simple additive weighting (SAW), the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), were used for detailed ranking of the strategies and assessing the result of the Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM). The results of the MCDM models were not identical, so we used aggregation approaches including mean rank, Borda count and Copeland's methods to integrate rankings. The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that all MCDM models were sensitive to the social and environmental criteria. The SAW and AHP models were also less sensitive to changes in criterion weights than the TOPSIS model. The results showed the priority of the MCDM models over QSPM analysis in incorporating SDC in detailed evaluation of the strategies.

The process has proven effective for treating oxidized contaminants, and the effects of process variables on the degradation kinetics of various target contaminants have been investigated in our previous studies. In natural environments, natural organic matter (NOM) is found in surface or ground water. NOM absorbs UV light and can react with photochemically produced radicals, thus affecting target contaminant photochemical reactions and further influencing the efficiency of ARP. This study examines the impact of humic acid (HA) and Suwanee River NOM on bromate reduction rates with UV irradiation using a low-pressure mercury UV lamp. The effects of the sulfite dose, solution pH, and light intensity are studied and the pseudo-first-order rate constants in the presence of HA (kobs,HA) are compared to those observed in the absence of HA (kobs). At low HA concentrations of 1 mg L−1, kobs,HA was larger than kobs; however, kobs,HA was less than kobs at higher HA concentrations. Furthermore, kobs,HA did not increase with increasing sulfite doses in the presence of HA, which is unlike the behavior of kobs.</jats:p>",

Recent research has revealed that more N is needed per unit of grain (UNR) as yield potential decreases. Because UNR is the inverse of N use efficiency (NUE) at optimal yield, the implication of this research is that canola becomes less efficient at using N as yield potential decreases. Our research goal was to identify the NUE components that contribute to higher potential yields with more available water. In both years of a two‐location experiment, grain yield (Gw), grain N (Ng), and N supply (Ns) were significantly greater with increasing available water supply. The NUE component analysis indicated that differences in water‐enhanced yields were associated with higher N uptake (plant N [Nt]/Ns) and utilization (Gw/Nt) efficiencies, which in turn were attributed to a higher grain N utilization efficiency (Gw/Ng) component, followed by higher N retention (available N [Nav]/Ns). Differences in grain N accumulation due to a greater availability of water was mostly attributed to greater N retention efficiency. With increasing available water and fertilization, spring canola became more efficient at accumulating (i) grain biomass per unit grain N and (ii) grain N per unit of available N supply. These results emphasize the need to develop breeding and management strategies to improve water use efficiency and to select canola cultivars capable of coping with water stress that limits grain biomass production per unit plant N accumulation.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Core Ideas</jats:bold>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Spring canola exhibited Mitscherlich response to soil N and Liebig response to plant N.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Water availability limited yields by restricting N utilization, retention, and uptake.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Water availability limited grain N accumulation by lowering N uptake from soil.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

However, in practical terms a lot of factors influence on those characteristics therefore affecting the resulting magnitude of energy efficiency and leading to errors in the calculation. These factors include the technical condition of the equipment and piping systems, alterations in the modes of operation of pumping units over time, a significant impact of the ambient temperature on the power consumption, amount of precipitation and the chemical composition of the effluent. As an object of management water supply and water disposal systems are considered as a totality; therefore the assessment of the energy efficiency of pipeline enterprises ought to be based on a systematic approach, whereas the existing methods are mainly based on an analysis of operating modes of individual electrical equipment, not on the whole technological system. The article describes the management system of energy efficiency of pipeline water supply and water disposal systems. The management system is based on information base of statistic data of power, hydraulic and industrial indexes of wastewater management.

In linear traction drives of high speed vehicles moving with velocities about 350 - 450 km/h it is expedient to use synchronous motors with stator winding located on track structure and constant magnetic field sources (permanent magnets, superconducting windings or bulk superconductors) located on the vehicle. Such high speed traction system does not require the moving contact for its power supply and it means a considerable advantage of system. Lack of a moving contact on the vehicle involves also the use of contactless system for auxiliary power supply. Purpose. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the versions of contactless auxiliary energy consumers power supply of high speed maglev vehicles with synchronous traction motors. Method. Weight, size and energy parameters of maglev vehicles power supply sources for auxiliary consumers are discussed and their areas of use are analyzed. Results. For contactless power supply of auxiliary energy consumers of maglev vehicles with electrodynamic suspension it is expedient to use linear induction generators and rechargeable batteries. For maglev vehicles with electromagnetic suspension it is expedient to use linear generators, linear transformers and rechargeable batteries. Practical significance. Results may be used for creation of national commercial high speed maglev transport. Conclusion. The choice of combination of power supply sources for auxiliary consumers is determined by vehicle magnetic suspension type. For vehicles with electromagnetic suspension it is expedient to use linear transformers, linear induction generators and rechargeable batteries. For vehicles with electrodynamic suspension use superconducting magnetic systems it is expedient to use linear generators and rechargeable batteries.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the effect of using nitrogen fertilizer on groundwater contamination with nitrate in the central southern part of the Nile Delta. NO3− concentrations in shallow groundwater were assessed based on the applied urea dose (the common nitrogen fertilizer used) in year 2014. A groundwater modeling system (GMS) comprising MODFLOW and MT3D was used to simulate the three-dimensional groundwater flow and NO3− transportation processes in El-Menoufia Governorate, located in the central region of the Nile Delta aquifer. Calibration for MODFLOW was conducted to match known head configurations to minimize the water balance differences. Calibration of MT3D was accomplished by fitting the model to the measured NO3− concentrations during the year 2014. The results highlighted areas of groundwater contamination by NO3−, which occurred at shallow depths (40 m) due to the significant loads of nitrogen fertilizer application and the flood irrigation method. While the results suggested one approach was to avoid using contaminated shallow groundwater as a water source, a more sustainable approach would be to implement best management practices to reduce and control the amount of nitrate leaching into the shallow groundwater system in the future.</jats:p>",

Influential factors of SMPs as a DBP precursor were investigated in this study. Model feed substrates were biologically incubated to simulate the biological treatment of wastewater organics, and the SMPs produced were chlorinated according to the standard procedure to study the DBP formation potential (DBPFP) of SMPs. Feed chemical type is a crucial factor affecting SMP production and the following DBP formation. SMPs from four kinds of model feed substrates with the same initial organic carbon concentration produced DBPs with a wide range from 196 to 684 μg L−1 and also different DBP formation properties. Different organic substrates would facilitate the growth of different microbial species, which produce SMPs with varied levels and chemical structure and subsequently different DBP formation characters. For the environmental factors, an anaerobic condition showed a significant effect, producing extremely high chloral hydrate up to about 2000 μg L−1, probably due to the production of volatile fatty acids. Different incubation conditions can not only bring about different levels of SMPs and DBPs, but also SMPs with different DBP formation feathers.</jats:p>",

It is particularly useful for reconstruction of partial mastectomy defects. It is also used to cover breast implants. Most surgeons base this flap cranially on the submammary skin crease, reflecting it back onto the breast. The blood vessels supplying this flap are not well defined, and the harvest of the flap may be compromised due to its uncertain vascularity. The aim of the work was to identify perforator vessels supplying SMAF and define their origin, site, diameter, and length.<jats:italic> Materials and Methods</jats:italic>. The flap was designed and dissected on both sides in 10 female cadavers. SMAF outline was 10 cm in length and 7 cm in width. The flap was raised carefully from below upwards to identify the perforator vessels supplying it from all directions. These vessels were counted and the following measurements were taken using Vernier caliper: diameter, total length, length inside the flap, and distance below the submammary skin crease.<jats:italic> Conclusions</jats:italic>. The perforators at the lateral part of the flap took origin from the lateral thoracic, thoracodorsal, and intercostal vessels. They were significantly larger, longer, and of multiple origins than those on the medial part of the flap and this suggests that laterally based flaps will have better blood supply, better viability, and more promising prognosis. Both approaches, medially based and laterally based SMAF, carry a better prognosis and lesser chance for future fat necrosis than the classical cranially based flap.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Construction projects require the generation and communication of an ever-larger amount of information. Unfortunately, present project organisations do not foster proactive approaches to preventing costly production waste derived from communication problems. To address this, the effective exchange of information needs to be performed across all different parties, as the construction project commonly includes concurrent progresses along its supply chain. This article proposes a new concept that integrates feed-forward control with the principle of network science. Referred to as supply-chain information network, it aims to comprehend the correlations within a sequenced supply chain network, in order to identify the critical communication links supporting a preventive control. Its effectiveness was verified by applying the model to an actual case: the rebar supply chain from a multi-story building in Sydney, NSW, Australia. The analysis recognised four problematical players in the supply chain: (1) rebar factory linemen, (2) radio crew, (3) senior steel fixers and (4) steel fixers, based on four centrality measurements. Consequently, the experimental data confirm the hypothesis that proactive management of the supply chain will produce drastic improvements, achieving up to 23.3% reduction in waste time during placement. The relevance of this research lies in the operational introduction of network science to the construction supply chain, and its proactive culture resulted in significant improvements of process performance. In addition, the developed communication backbone suggests an actualised test bed of concurrent information exchanges that tried to escape the spatiotemporal limitation in a chained attribute in the construction industry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the optimal component procurement strategies of two competing OEMs selling substitutable products. The OEMs outsource their production to a common contract manufacturer, who in turn needs an input from a component supplier. Each OEM may either directly procure the input from the component supplier, or delegate the procurement task to the contract manufacturer. We first analyze the OEMs' procurement game under a non‐strategic supplier whose component price is exogenously given. It is found that symmetric equilibria arise for most situations, that is, both OEMs either control or delegate their component procurement in equilibrium. Interestingly, despite the commonly‐held belief that the contract manufacturer would be worse off as OEMs gain component procurement control, we show that the contract manufacturer may enjoy a higher profit. Then we study the OEMs' procurement game under a strategic supplier who can set its component price. We find that the supplier's strategic pricing behavior plays a critical role in the equilibrium procurement structure. In particular, in the equilibrium under strategic supplier, the larger OEM always uses delegation while the smaller OEM may use either delegation or control. By identifying the driving forces behind the OEMs' procurement choices, this research helps explain observed industry practices and offer useful guidelines for firms' component sourcing decisions. </jats:p>",

Disinfection rates, chlorine generation, energy demand, and generation of disinfection by-products were monitored over the 190-day study. Particular attention was given to the generation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the electrochemical treatment cycle. In addition, the potential for generation of THMs and HAAs during post-treatment storage of the water was assessed. The electrochemical treatment system resulted in a 2- to 3-log removal of total heterotrophic bacteria, with values below detection (&amp;lt;1 CFU/mL) often observed. Disinfection occurred with only very low levels of observed chlorine generation (&amp;lt;0.1 mg/L), suggesting that alternate disinfection mechanisms likely played a significant role in the observed removal of bacteria. THM and HAA concentrations after treatment were consistently well below regulatory levels. Results also showed that electrochemical treatment significantly reduced the formation of bromoform when the water received subsequent exposure to hypochlorite. Removal of naturally occurring bromide in the water by the electrochemical system may have been the cause (in part) for this observed mitigation of bromoform formation. The formation of calcium scale on the cathode surface over time was the primary operational challenge.</jats:p>",

This formation crops out throughout the whole of the Cantabrian Zone (of Palaeozoic age), one of the geological zones of the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain). The geographical distribution of this formation is very wide, surfacing in the provinces of León, Asturias, Palencia and Cantabria.This variety of chert had been included within the group generically known as ‘black chert’, a macrogroup including different types of chert that appear in different Palaeozoic formations in the area and which share a characteristic black colour at the macroscopic level. The characterisation presented here has enabled us to distinguish it from other varieties. In this study, Vegamián chert has been divided into two different groups depending on their textural, mineralogical, geochemical and thermal propierties. Type 1, the most suitable for knapping, is characterized by high content in silica (&gt;97%), laminated matrix and, occasionally, ghost of radiolarians.  In addition, the characteristics specific to this chert make it suitable for lithic knapping processes. To confirm its use by prehistoric populations, this chert will be compared to that found in two Mesolithic sites, the caves of La Uña and El Espertín (León, south versant of the Cantabrian Mountains), the raw materials from which are currently under study.</jats:p>"

On the market of milking machines there is a new solution in the form of mouthpiece vented liners - impulseair®, where air is supplied constantly by a calibrated nozzle in the head of a liner. The objective of the paper was to analyse and assess the selected parameters of milking determined in a milking machine with a claw with fixed volume of a milking chamber (250 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) with mouthpiece vented liners in comparison to other solutions used for air supply in milking machines. Measurements were carried out in laboratory conditions with milking to the upper milk pipeline, at variable mass intensities of liquid flow (within 0-8 kg·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), for three penetrations of artificial teats (46, 48, 62 mm), at three values of the system vacuum (46, 48 and 50 kPa). A significant impact of the manner of air supply to a milking machine and remaining independent variables of an experiment on the selected milking parameters was proved with the use of a statistical analysis. It was found that a milking unit with mouthpiece vented liners, although it reduces average vacuum of suction [pss], at the same time it limits fluctuations of underpressure in the dp cycle.</jats:p>",

To compensate for sparse data, a unique combination of model inputs was developed, including meteorological variables, potential evapotranspiration, and parameters defining hydraulic geometry. A slight decreasing trend of sediment loads and concentrations was statistically significant in the lowest 50% of flows, supporting the observed historical sediment decline. Historical changes in climate, including seasonality and decline of snowpack, contribute to changes in streamflow, and are a significant component describing the mechanisms responsible for the decline in sediment. Several wet and dry hypothetical climate change scenarios with temperature changes of 1.5 °C and 4.5 °C were applied to the base historical conditions to assess the model sensitivity of streamflow and sediment to changes in climate. Of the scenarios evaluated, sediment discharge for the Sacramento River Basin increased the most with increased storm magnitude and frequency and decreased the most with increases in air temperature, regardless of changes in precipitation. The model will be used to develop projections of potential hydrologic and sediment trends to the Bay-Delta in response to potential future climate scenarios, which will help assess the hydrological and ecological health of the Bay-Delta into the next century.</jats:p>"

The gas‐to‐methanol process converts waste flare gas into methanol using a series of truck‐mounted devices deployed at oil production wellheads. The methanol‐to‐butanol process uses a new proprietary catalyst which produces butanol via a diketene intermediate at a large centralized facility. The goal of this work is to identify the best ways of commercializing this technology in Alberta. To do this, a supply chain optimization model is formulated which considers specifically how many gas‐to‐methanol trucks should be used and where specifically in Alberta they should be deployed, the specific suppliers of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to use, where the location of the central methanol‐to‐butanol facility should be chosen, and the costs of transportation of materials between locations. The model framework also considers the possibility of getting methanol in full or in part by alternative means such as producing methanol from conventional pipeline natural gas, or purchasing methanol from petrochemical or biomass‐based routes. The supply chain optimization problem is formulated as a nonconvex NLP and BARON is used in a Pareto analysis considering weighted combinations of economic and environmental objective functions. The resulting analysis provides a variety of possible viable strategies which can provide both profitability and reduced environmental emissions in Alberta by using a combination of the novel portable flare gas capture devices with more conventional gas‐to‐liquids technologies.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It analyses the temporal and spatial distributions and utilisation of underground water according to the main components and corresponding water quality standards for underground water. Thereby, it can provide a scientific basis for the development, utilisation, planning, and management of groundwater resources. Set pair analysis (SPA), based on the improved five-element connectivity degree, was used in this research to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, so as to evaluate the groundwater quality in XuChang, Henan Province, China. Meanwhile, fuzzy evaluation was also used to measure groundwater quality. As demonstrated in the research results, SPA is proven to be convenient and useful with objective and stable results, it therefore is an effective approach with which to evaluate groundwater quality. In addition, the results obtained using SPA matched those from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; it was concluded, based on the analysis, that the groundwater in XuChang was severely polluted. The groundwater quality at the observation points located in the lower reaches is poorer than that of the upper reaches; hazardous substances permeate underground to pollute shallow groundwater through decomposition and loss due to weathering and rainfall.</jats:p>",

The authors hypothesized that changes in visual function after tumor removal may be related to changes in blood supply to the ON that might be seen in the pial circulation at surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography was used to attempt to document these changes at surgery. The first patient in whom the technique was used had a left-sided, 1.4-cm, tuberculum meningioma. Time-lapse comparison of images was done postsurgery, and the comparison of video images revealed both faster initial filling and earlier complete filling of the ON pial circulation, suggesting improved pial blood flow after surgical decompression. In follow-up the patient had significant improvements in both visual acuity and visual fields function. Intraoperative ICG angiography of the ON can demonstrate measurable changes in pial vascular flow that may be predictive of postoperative visual outcome. The predictive value of this technique during neurosurgical procedures around the optic apparatus warrants further investigation in a larger cohort.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study deals with placement of wind turbines in distribution networks for maximising the probabilistic index of load supply capability (LSC). To calculate this index, one of the most accurate and efficient probabilistic simulation methods known as Latin hypercube sampling is used. Variations of load and output power of wind turbines are considered in the probabilistic evaluation of LSC. Moreover, the constraints of maximum voltage drop and current carrying capacity of conductors are considered as the limiting factors of the network LSC. Since there is a correlation between the network load and the output power of wind turbines, considering this correlation in simulations will push the results closer to reality. Therefore, the Cholesky decomposition approach is used to take into account the correlation between the input variables of the problem. Casestudiesare carried out on the 33‐bus IEEE distribution network. The results of case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</jats:p>",

Equal molar ratios of CaCl2 and NaSO4 aqueous solutions were mixed with saline solution of NaCl (40 g/L). Turbidity measurements were carried out for the mixed solutions at different time intervals to determine induction period for the crystal formation of gypsum at ambient temperature (25 °C). Induction period was measured under different high supersaturation ratios ranging from 4.47 to 6.71. Induction period decreases exponentially with increasing supersaturation ratios. Free energy barrier values, critical nucleus radius and nucleation rates were calculated with and without addition of antiscalant {(scale inhibitor) [sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6, SHMP]} using crystallization equations that relate induction period with supersaturation ratios. The radius of critical nucleus increased by about 30% with SHMP addition compared with the baseline at all the studied supersaturation ratios. Most importantly, scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrographs show that, the shapes of crystals of the uninhibited solutions are needle-like and plate-like crystals at supersaturation ratios of 4.47 and 6.71, respectively. Addition of 4.0 mg/L SHMP antiscalant modify the shape of crystals to be similar to that at low supersaturation ratio.</jats:p>",

However, more restrictive transfusion triggers and the patient blood management initiative also reduce the demand for red blood cells (RBCs).

The paper discusses why a tracking and tracing system should represent an important added value for them. Design/methodology/approachWe describe here the configuration and features of a novel low-cost system to track and trace containers in an intermodal supply chain, provide information to shippers regarding delays and other unexpected events, and assist terminal operations accordingly. We then analyze the positive impacts of such a system over the entire supply chain, identifying the requirements of the main chain actors regarding the availability of information and how the proposed system contributes to the fulfillment of those requirements. FindingsThe visibility of containers throughout the entire supply chain provides multiple benefits for shippers, terminals and transport providers. Research limitations/implicationsThe operational and economic benefits of the system are clear, but the lack of historical data does not allow for a quantitative estimation of those foreseen benefits. Practical implicationsIntermodal terminals might see this type of information systems as an opportunity to generate added value for their customers, including shippers and carriers. In a scenario with high competition levels between terminals, this added value could represent the competitive advantage necessary to guarantee the growth of a terminal without requiring expensive investments and costs. Originality/valueThe paper describes the benefits provided by the system to the main stakeholders of the intermodal supply chain and provides some conclusions with respect to those benefits and to future developments. Keywords: Containers; tracking and tracing; supply chain; logistics; port</jats:p>"

The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Interest in assessing the sustainability performance of manufacturing processes and systems during product design is increasing. Prior work has investigated approaches for quantifying and reducing impacts across the product life cycle. Energy consumption and carbon footprint are frequently adopted and investigated environmental performance metrics. However, challenges persist in concurrent consideration of environmental, economic, and social impacts resulting from manufacturing processes and supply chain networks. Companies are striving to manage their manufacturing networks to improve environmental and social performance, in addition to economic performance. In particular, social responsibility has gained visibility as a conduit to competitive advantage. Thus, a framework is presented for improving environmental and social performance through simultaneous consideration of manufacturing processes and supply chain activities. The framework builds upon the unit manufacturing process modeling method and is demonstrated for production of bicycle pedal components. For the case examined, it is found that unit manufacturing processes account for 63–97% of supply chain carbon footprint when air freight transport is not used. When air freight transport is used for heavier components, transportation-related energy consumption accounts for 78–90% of supply chain carbon footprint. Similarly, from a social responsibility perspective, transportation-related activities account for 73–99% of supply chain injuries/illnesses, and days away from work when air freight transport is used. Manufacturing activities dominate the impacts on worker health when air freight transport is not used, leading to 59–99% of supply chain injuries/illnesses, and days away from work. These results reiterate that simultaneous consideration of environmental and social impacts of manufacturing and supply chain activities is needed to inform decision making in sustainable product manufacturing.</jats:p>",

One important factor in determining quality control process is supplying-chain factor, i.e. loin tuna distribution which ranging from fish hooked on the ship until the receiving product by the consumer. The objectives of this study is to describe loin tuna supply chain system in Maluku. The supply chain was analyzed by using black box diagram system approach and market integration model used to identify a valuate the relationship of each supply chain component with destined market. The results showed that there is no market integration between Japanese markets and Maluku, but there is long term cooperation between American market and Maluku.Keywords: tuna loin, supply chain,market integration, Maluku-------ABSTRAKPola penangkapan ikan tuna oleh nelayan di perairan Maluku sangat bergantung pada faktor kondisi alam dan teknis pendukung operasi penangkapan, seperti ketersediaan bahan bakar serta modal operasional. Hal ini berarti secara umum nelayan belum memiliki pola manajemen operasi penangkapan yang terstruktur dan terukur. Salah satu faktor yang sangat berperan dalam penentuan proses pengendalian mutu adalah rantai pasok (supply chain), yaitu proses distribusi barang (tuna loin) mulai dari produksi ikan di atas kapal hingga produk dikonsumsi oleh konsumen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menggambarkan dan menganalisa sistem rantai pasok pada produk tuna loin di Maluku. Analisis rantai pasok (supply chain) dengan pendekatan deskriptif dan model integrasi pasar digunakan untuk mengidentifikasikan sistem rantai pasok dan melihat seberapa jauh hubungan masing-masing elemen rantai pasok dengan pasar tujuan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan tidak terjadi integrasi antara pasar Jepang dengan Maluku, sedangkan pasar Amerika dan Maluku terintegrasi dalam jangka panjang.Kata kunci: tuna loin, rantai pasok (supply chain), integrasi pasar, Maluku</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Saffron’s color, taste and odor result from the chemicals crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, respectively. Hence, in addition to quantitative yield, secondary metabolites content are known as crucial factors for a successful saffron production. Moreover, enhancing resources efficiency, especially water and nitrogen, is becoming increasingly important for agricultural improvement in arid and semi-arid regions. Thus, the effects of irrigation levels and corm planting on crocin, picrocrocin and safranal content, water use efficiency (WUE) as well as nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of saffron were investigated as a two-year field experiment based on a randomized complete block design arranged in split-plot with three replicates. The irrigation levels (100, 75 and 50% of saffron water requirement) and corm planting pattern (50, 100, 200 and 300 corms m-2) were allocated to main and sub-plots, respectively. Based on the results, crocin and picrocrocin content increased with decreasing irrigation levels. The highest WUES (WUE based on dry stigma yield) was obtained when 50% of saffron water requirement was supplied. However, the lowest WUEC (WUE based on daughter corms yield) and NUEC (NUE based on daughter corms yield) were obtained when 50% of saffron water requirement was applied. Irrespective of irrigation levels, WUES, WUEC and NUEC increased with increasing the planting density. The results demonstrated that although relatively severe water stress increases WUES and secondary metabolites in saffron stigmas, it could decrease WUEC and NUEC through affecting daughter corm growth.</jats:p>"

A large fraction of malaria medicines for endemic countries in sub‐Saharan Africa is financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria and the US President's Malaria Initiative. These agencies together with the World Health Organization, UNITAID, the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are exploring ways to increase the level of artemisinin production, reduce volatility of artemisinin prices, and improve overall access to malaria medicines for the population. We develop a model of the supply chain, calibrate the model using field data, and investigate the impact of various interventions. Our model shows that initiatives aimed at improving average yield, creating a support‐price for agricultural artemisinin, and a larger and carefully managed supply of semi‐synthetic artemisinin have the greatest potential for improving supply and reducing price volatility of artemisinin‐based malaria medicine. </jats:p>",

In four WSWs, ESP performance had experienced a number of premature failures, which resulted in short average run lives of less than 1 ½ years, high operating costs, and unsustainable water supply required for injection pressure support and field development. To ensure that future ESP application in these wells is successful and improve run life, a multidisciplinary team was formed and conducted a comprehensive review to identify the causes of previous ESP failures and recommend methods to improve current practices based on all gathered engineering data; including, dismantle results of pulled ESP units, well and reservoir data, completion strategy, ESP equipment design, commissioning, and data monitoring.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The analysis indicated that the failures were primarily the results of corrosion and solids, and lack of close monitoring of ESP performance review, which prevented rectification of the problems in a timely manner. Secondary problems were also identified, such as tight wellhead clearance that damaged wellhead penetrators during installation, failure of tubing internal coating, and insufficient wellbore cleanout before making up ESPs during workovers, etc.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This engineering approach has successfully helped to increase confidence in, and reliability of, ESP operations, optimization, sustained field production levels, and reduced capital and operating costs due to improved pump run life.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reviews the performance of ESP systems in WSWs and the challenges faced during the past 4 years of operation.

This study comprises fieldwork aimed at locating the outcrops and obtaining samples. Some selected samples from two localities were used for both petrological (macroscopic and microscopic analyses from thin sections) and geochemical (X-ray fluorescence and powder diffraction) analysis. The macroscopic study shows a rather homogeneus coloration and a conchoidal fracture although two extreme types of cherts with a variety of intermediate forms can be differentiated according to the matrix composition. The microscopic analysis shows a high heterogeneity in carbonate versus silica percentage and gentle differences in some other features such as type of silica, origin of carbonates, occurrence of organic matter and type of skeletal components. The results of several geochemical analysis suggest that there are not geochemical features neither in the major elements nor in the traces that allows us to clearly distinguish between the analysed samples. All these studies allow us to define the main features of these chert nodules and to establish several types and varieties among them. Those varieties with high percentage of silica and with a more homogeneous matrix are the most suitable samples for knapping. These results together with the study of the geological and geographical location of archaeological sites suggest that the nodules from the Escalada Formation likely were lithic material supply sources used in knapping activitiesWhen aiming to demonstrate the use of these materials at archaeological sites the sole macroscopic analysis of the pieces does not suffice; further analyses, such as those involving thin sections, are necessary. The absence of chert from Escalada Formation in some Mesolithic sites in the area was confirmed via these additional analyses.</jats:p>"

Due to changes in regulatory policies and the development of strategic emerging industries, it is critical to investigate the scenario of rare earth supplies in 2025. To address this question, this paper constructed a dynamic computable equilibrium (DCGE) model to forecast the production, domestic supply, and export of China’s rare earths in 2025. Based on our analysis, production will increase by 10.8%–12.6% and achieve 116,335–118,260 tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) in 2025, based on recent extraction control during 2011–2016. Moreover, domestic supply and export will be 75,081–76,800 tons REO and 38,797–39,400 tons REO, respectively. The technological improvements on substitution and recycling will significantly decrease the supply and mining activities of rare earths. From a policy perspective, we found that the elimination of export regulations, including export quotas and export taxes, does have a negative impact on China’s future domestic supply of rare earths. The policy conflicts between the increase in investment in strategic emerging industries, and the increase in resource and environmental taxes on rare earths will also affect China’s rare earths supply in the future.</jats:p>"

Generally, the sources of Si and C in the TSSG method are Si chunk and Graphite crucible, respectively. The crystal growth through TSSG method is achieved by the precipitation of solid SiC from C dissolved a Si melt on a seed crystal located at the top of the liquid. The C solubility in pure Si liquid is extremely low, so that metallic solvents such as Cr, Ti and Fe were added to increase the C solubility in Si liquid. Consequently, the growth rate of SiC crystal through the TSSG method has been reached up to 2 mm/hour. However, as increasing C solubility, the loss of the graphite crucible became another critical issue. Because the C source in the TSSG method is the graphite crucible, the reservoir of Si liquid, the increase of C solubility means the decrease of the crucible durability. The graphite crucible durability influences not only on the thickness of the grown crystal, but also on the temperature distribution in the reactor.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we introduce our recent progress on the carbon supply in the TSSG method to produce a reliable long-term growth technique.

Based on data concerning the actual use of blood products, the number of blood products needed was estimated based on future population projections.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>We estimated that the number of blood donations increased from 5,020,000 in 2008 to 5,260,000 in 2012, but will decrease to 4,770,000 units by 2025. In particular, the number of donors in their 20s and 30s decreased every year. Moreover, the number of donations required to supply blood products would have been increased from 5,390,000 in 2012 to 5,660,000 units in 2025. Thus, the estimated shortfall of blood donations is expected to increase each year from 140,000 in 2012 to 890,000 in 2025 and then more than double to 1,670,000 in 2050.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p>If the current blood donation behaviors continue, a shortfall of blood availability is likely to occur in Japan. Insufficient blood donations are mainly related to a projected reduction in population of 20 to 30 year olds, a significant group of donors. Thus, it is crucial to recruit and retain new donors and to develop recommendations for proper use of blood products to minimize unnecessary use. This study provides useful information that can be used by governments to help ensure the adequacy of the blood supply through promoting donations and conserving blood resources.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to alleviate the conflict between the channels in dual-channel supply chain, the altruism tendency and trust input are important for strengthening the cooperation between the channels. We view the dual-channel supply chain as a nonlinear system that consists of co-competition, learning decision and dynamic game between direct channels and retail channels. Then, we develop learning dynamics and evolutionary game model to analyze the channels’ altruism behavior and the factors that influence trust input. We find that the evolutionary direction of altruistic behavior is determined by the sensitiveness and the learning abilities of both members of supply chains. The trust input decision of both channels is highly related to the output ratio of high-level trust input, only if the input–output ratio is ideal for both game parties, the system may come to an evolutionary stable equilibrium of high trust input. If the trust input of the two sides is unilateral, then one side chooses high trust input, while the other side chooses low trust input. In this case, even the input–output ratio is high, it will not be evolutionary stable. The profit both sides earned from the low-trust cooperation is the basic for further trust input, the increased free ride income, trust input risk and the trust evaluation cost will affect the enthusiasm of trust input for the dual-channel supply chain members. To promote high trust input in dual-channel supply chain, a certain amount of compensation should be negotiated in the contract in order to improve the performance of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Brazilian society, companies, and government are taking a step forward in the production of renewable jet fuel from biomass feedstocks largely available in the territory. This study evaluated the use of different feedstocks (sugar crops, oil crops, and lignocellulosic biomass) for co‐production of biojet fuel and higher value‐added products in a biorefinery platform. The co‐production of biofuels and biochemicals in a biorefinery context was demonstrated to be economically feasible. The main cost drivers of such a platform are feedstock biomass cost, selling price of the biochemicals, investment costs, and key process‐inherent parameters such as conversion yields, obtained fermentable sugars, or oil content in the feedstock. Sugarcane was the most promising feedstock for a biorefinery in the region of Minas Gerais, while soybean was the most promising feedstock for a biorefinery in the region of Rio Grande do Sul, despite its higher uncertainty. Succinic acid was the most promising chemical intermediate for biopolymers industry due to its relatively high market value, unique market opportunity as a substitute of conventional petrochemicals, and forecast for future growth. Ethanol‐to‐jet (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ETJ</jats:styled-content>) and hydro‐processed esters and fatty acids (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HEFA</jats:styled-content>) were the most attractive biojet fuel production routes in the present study. Scenarios for co‐production of biofuels and biochemicals in Brazil present large uncertainties and high financial risk, mainly due to the use of second‐generation feedstocks, and the introduction of new technologies and products. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Co-investment funds – which invest alongside private investors, especially business angels – thereby leveraging their networks and experience and minimizing public sector transaction costs – are a recent approach by governments in various countries to address the early stage entrepreneurial funding gap which is perceived as a barrier to the ability of firms to scale-up. However, little literature exists on their operation, impact and effectiveness. This paper assesses the early operation of the UK’s Angel Co-investment Fund, established in 2011. Interview evidence from angels and business managers suggests that the Angel Co-investment Fund is improving the availability of finance by enabling firms to raise funding rounds of between £500,000 and £2 m, hence addressing some aspects of the broken finance escalator model. However, our evidence suggests that it is not yet impacting the supply side, either in terms of stimulating the formation of new angel groups or enhancing learning amongst less experienced angels. Some aspects of the operation of the investment process have attracted criticism from angels and entrepreneurs which need to be addressed. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence for positive impact to justify the scheme’s expansion. </jats:p>",

Given the high stakes of this policy for the food supply, economy, and human and veterinary health, it is important to rigorously assess the effects of this policy. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of data provided by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). We examined the trends in both AMR proportion and MIC between 2004 and 2012 at slaughter and retail stages. We investigated the makeup of variation in these data and estimated the sample and effect size requirements necessary to distinguish an effect of the policy change. Finally, we applied our approach to take a detailed look at the 2005 withdrawal of approval for the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin in poultry water. Slaughter and retail showed similar trends. Both AMR proportion and MIC were valuable in assessing AMR, capturing different information. Most variation was within years, not between years, and accounting for geographic location explained little additional variation. At current rates of data collection, a 1-fold change in MIC should be detectable in 5 years and a 6% decrease in percent resistance could be detected in 6 years following establishment of a new resistance rate. Analysis of the enrofloxacin policy change showed the complexities of the AMR policy with no statistically significant change in resistance of both\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Campylobacter jejuni</jats:named-content>\n            and\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Campylobacter coli</jats:named-content>\n            to ciprofloxacin, another second-generation fluoroquinolone.\n          </jats:p>",

In this study, shotgun metagenomics was used to identify taste-and-odor producers and toxin-producing cyanobacteria over a 2-year period in a drinking water reservoir. The sequencing data implicated several cyanobacteria, including\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Anabaena</jats:named-content>\n            spp.,\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Microcystis</jats:named-content>\n            spp., and an unresolved member of the order\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Oscillatoriales</jats:named-content>\n            as the likely principal producers of geosmin, microcystin, and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), respectively.

The origin of the monoterpene cyclase required for MIB biosynthesis was putatively linked to a periphytic cyanobacterial mat attached to the concrete drinking water inflow structure. We conclude that shotgun metagenomics can be used to identify microbial agents involved in water quality deterioration and to guide PCR assay selection or design for routine monitoring purposes. Finally, we offer estimates of microbial diversity and metagenomic coverage of our data sets for reference to others wishing to apply shotgun metagenomics to other lacustrine systems.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>\n            Cyanobacterial toxins and microbial taste-and-odor compounds are a growing concern for drinking water utilities reliant upon surface water resources.

Using laboratory experiments in a recirculating flume with live seedlings in a mobile sand bed, we demonstrate how varying the balance between sediment supply and transport capacity shifts the relationship between plants and bar‐surface topography. Each experimental trial contrasted two sediment conditions, in which initially supply was maintained in equilibrium with transport via sediment recirculation, followed by sediment deficit, in which transport capacity exceeded supply, which was set to zero. For both sediment balances, the topographic response was sensitive to plant size, with larger plants inducing greater aggradation relative to a baseline condition. During sediment equilibrium, the positive relationship between plant size and topographic change also depended on species morphology (multi‐stemmed shrubs versus single‐stemmed plants). Plant morphology effects disappeared when the sediment balance shifted to a deficit, but the presence of plants had a greater impact on the magnitude of change compared to the topographic response under sediment equilibrium. Our results suggest that the interactions among sediment supply, plants, and topography may be strongest on rivers with a balance in sediment supply and transport capacity. Because of the large variability in fluvial sediment supply resulting from natural and anthropogenic influences, these interactions will differ spatially (e.g. longitudinally through a watershed) and at different temporal scales, from single flood events to longer time periods.

This can be visualized by calculating the Electrical Energy per Order (EEO). By optimizing the water matrix, e.g. by pretreating the water by filtration over activated carbon or with O3/H2O2, the energy demand decreased up to 70%. This is affected by the concentration and type of the natural organic matter present. By optimizing reactor geometry an additional decrease in energy demand, up to 40%, could be obtained.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified a total of 131 QTL, and QTL meta-analysis found four integrated QTL across the growth systems. Integration reduced the confidence interval by ~41%. QTL for root and shoot biomass were co-located on chromosome A3 and for lateral root emergence were co-located on chromosomes A4/C4 and C8/C9. There was a major QTL for LRD on chromosome C9 explaining ~18% of the phenotypic variation.

This study investigates role hazard, a critical yet understudied relational coordination problem. Drawing on role and institutional theories, we examine role ambiguity and role conflict as two facets of role hazard between buyer and supplier, their institutional source, performance outcomes, and firms’ action alignment mechanisms as potential remedies. A dyadic survey of buyers and suppliers in China reveals that both role ambiguity and role conflict can result from sub‐national institutional distance and jeopardize supply chain performance. The results also suggest that supply chain partners in different sub‐national institutions can mitigate role hazard through continuous information sharing and dynamic adaptation. This study provides novel insights into how buyers and suppliers can enhance their relational coordination in emerging markets by reducing role hazard caused by sub‐national institutional distance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Intake of total carotenoids increased with increased level of green forages in the diet. Apparent retention of N, Ca, and Zn was higher in GP laying hens fed diet containing 5.0% green forages as compared to those fed conventional diet containing 1.4% green forages. Results of the present study indicate that inclusion of 5% green forage in the diet of GP would improve the utilization of N, Ca, and Zn without any adverse effect on intake and utilization of other nutrients. Data related to nutrient intake, basal endogenous losses (BEL) and coefficient of retention (COR) of N, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn are novel and may be of use for future research.

Although it is known that persistence of perennial ryegrass is based on a high turnover of tillers during late spring and summer, little is known about other forage species, particularly in subtropical climates. To address this question, this study evaluated survival of grazed tall fescue tillers growing in a subtropical climate. We hypothesized that hard tactical grazing during winter to remove reproductive stems (designated as ‘flowering control’), and nitrogen fertilization in spring, would both improve tiller survival over summer, and thus enhance tiller density. This was assessed in two experiments. In both experiments, few tillers appeared during late spring and summer and so tiller density depended on the dynamics of vegetative tillers present in the sward in spring. In Experiment 2, flowering control and nitrogen fertilization both enhanced the survival of that critical tiller cohort, but the effects were not additive. Responses were similar but not statistically significant in Experiment 1, which had a warmer, drier summer and lower overall survival rates. Unlike grasses in temperate environments, persistence of tall fescue in this subtropical site appeared to follow a ‘vegetative pathway’; i.e., new tillers were produced largely in autumn, from vegetative tillers that survived the summer.</jats:p>",
