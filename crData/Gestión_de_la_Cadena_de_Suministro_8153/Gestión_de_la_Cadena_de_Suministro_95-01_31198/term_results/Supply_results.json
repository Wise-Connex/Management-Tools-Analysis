Placental glucose transport to the fetus requires a net maternal-to-fetal plasma glucose concentration gradient that is determined by placental as well as fetal glucose consumption. Fetal plasma glucose concentration, independent of maternal glucose concentration, regulates the partition of placental glucose uptake into transfer to the fetus and consumption by the placenta. Placental transport capacity increases with advancing gestation, probably by an increased number of transporter proteins as surface area increases. Placental glucose consumption contributes to most or all of placental lactate and fructose production and other less well defined non-oxidative pathways of carbon metabolism. Placental glucose consumption accounts for at least 50% of placental oxygen consumption which remains independent of short-term or long-term changes in placental glucose supply, thus requiring varying amounts of other carbon substrates. Placental glucose supply, therefore, plays a key role in regulating placental glucose metabolism and placental carbon balance, and interacts reciprocally with other carbon substrates to maintain placental oxidative metabolism.</jats:p>"

The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects. Initial variation in prey density influenced prey species composition only in ponds without predators. Increased prey density in ponds without predators reduced the survival of Hyla, apparently through increased interspecific competition among tadpoles.</jats:p>",

We studied the present and future impact caused by the market removal of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (\"Dacron®\"), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fiber and resin (\"Teflon®\"), and polyacetal resin (\"Delrin®\"). Findings were: 1) Dollar values of the permanent medical implant markets for PET yarn, PTFE fiber and resin, and polyacetal resin are a minute fraction, of their values for their other commercial markets; 2) The implant market value is clearly not commensurate with the liability risk; and 3) The majority of these materials consumed by this market are used in the production of lifesaving, permanent medical implants [e.g., vital blood vessel replacements made from knitted polyester (PET)]. The remainder is used in life-enhancing, permanent implants [e.g., hernia patches made of polyester (PET) fabric]. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the more significant structural changes in Western manufacturing industry is the redistribution of “value addition activities” in product supply chains. Final assemblers are often choosing to subcontract the design and manufacture of large sections of their products in an attempt to focus their effort. In turn suppliers take on more of the design and assembly of the end product and may also choose to delegate some of their own activities to second line suppliers. These changes require that the profile of capabilities necessary to design and manufacture the product is also redistributed among the partners in the chain. Competition between suppliers is fierce, particularly in view of the fact that the changing structure favors fewer sources. The suppliers which survive will probably be those who successfully position themselves in terms of appropriate value adding capabilities and differentiation through high levels of customer service.</jats:p>",

Three separability hypotheses using the Allen‐Uzawa elasticity of substitution are tested to examine the feasibility of various degrees of disintegration of the current industry structure. All three separability hypotheses are rejected, and the cost of disintegration is estimated. Further, estimates indicate that the electricity industry appears to have exhausted economies of scale.

These studies seem to suggest that the traditional division of labour remains more firmly entrenched than is widely thought, even in circumstances where changes have economic advantages. Such arrangements may also disadvantage men as well as women.

This article does not aim to deny the importance of these factors. Rather it seeks to explain how they developed synergetic effects and how they were knit together. The argument is put forward in three steps: First, I show the importance of the new technology's discursive integration, arguing that the development of specialized electric discourse led to a social shaping of technology that was highly compatible with generalized cultural patterns of late nineteenth-century Swiss society. The expressive dispositions and instituted means of expression that constitiute the elextric discourse were constantly pursuing and achieving effective resonances in other discursive fields. This allowed for a solid integration of the electrotechnical discourse in late nineteenth-century Swiss society.</jats:p><jats:p>Second, I argue that electrotechnology was modeled in such a way that it became coupled with existing technological (and scientific) practices, such as the national mapping endeavor, the urban gas and water supply, the sewer system, and the telegraphic networks. It is noteworthy that making electrotechnology compatible with other technological practices led not only to similar patterns in the design and management of both the old and the new technologies but also to operated with the existing water supply station.</jats:p><jats:p>Using the example of the electrification of Zurich, I then, in a third step, combine the two elements – discursive accommodation and practical assimilation – to demonstrate their effects on the selection and construction of technology. The article's somewhat complex argumentative strategy allows for a differentiated interpretation of the phenomenon and shows the importance of taking into consideration the sociocultural dimension of economic growth that had its roots in the diffusion of a new technology</jats:p>"

Recent fieldwalking recovered a large flint scatter in the vicinity of these hollows. Mesolithic activity was represented by worked flint displaying soft hammer technology whereas hard hammer technologies indicate Neolithic and Bronze Age tool production and usage. The presence of large numbers of cores and a vast quantity of industrial waste indicates on-site preparation of tools. Statistical analysis of the fieldwalking data implies that the flints are concentrated around the hollows. Auger sampling across the ponds revealed natural clay deposits that still hold water close to the pond surface. Consideration of exploitation of mineral resources on the Wold top and possible mechanisms of formation of Vessey Ponds highlights the complex effects of glacial activities on the local surface geology. Karstic origins for some features of surface geology are suggested. The nature of the ‘prehistoric’ economies represented by the flint scatter is considered along with ethnoarchaeological evidence to support the assumption that the ponds at Vessey were a potential water supply during the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages. Evidence from Vessey Ponds and elsewhere in Yorkshire implies an association between areas of ‘prehistoric’ activity and the availability of surface water. Above all else, this work highlights the impact of water supply on settlement pattern and land use on the Chalk of the Yorkshire Wolds.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Farm monitoring on sheep and beef cattle farms in Northland has been in operation for the past 8 years. The emphasis has been on monitoring the performance of sheep and beef cattle farms to provide the data to encourage group members to make decisions based on objective measurements. Monitor groups were initially supported by extension and science personnel with more recent groups being operated on a commercial basis. Key biological indices such as animal numbers, weights, weight gain, meat and wool production and pasture production are monitored. Group members are encouraged to use information from the monitor farm to identify opportunities on their own farms for improvement in production and income. Significant gains have been made in production but it can take 3 to 5 years for the full benefit to be realised. Pasture production information has been v,ital to identify changes in feed supply from year to year during the monitoring programme. Farm monitoring in the future is likely to be the basis on which farmers will be able to. meet year-round supply of product based on specifications of weight, date and carcass attributes. Keywords: beef and cattle, farm monitoring, objective measurement, pasture production, sheep</jats:p>"

In addition, the sesamoid bones, from two prepared skeletons, were examined for the presence of vascular foramina. Multiple vascular foramina were observed over the sesamoid surface. The most consistent elements of the arterial supply were proximal vessels supplying the axial and dorsal abaxial sides of the bone. In addition, palmar and distal sources often made contributions to the blood supply. Various minor or occasional sources were noted. This study demonstrates that the palmar metacarpal sesamoid bones of the dog have an abundant but highly variable vascular supply.</jats:p><jats:p>The blood supply of the canine palmar metacarpal sesamoid bones was examined, using several methods, in order to evaluate the possible involvement of vascular compromise in sesamoid disease. It was found that the sesamoid bones have an abundant blood supply which is presumably resistant to disruption.</jats:p>"

Having observed the impact of camp meetings and itinerant preachers, particularly in the Far West, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that, “Here and there, in the midst of American Society, you meet with men, full of a fanatical and almost wild enthusiasm” (1847: 142). Yet Tocqueville's discomfort with frontier revivalism was hardly universal. By the late 1820s, many Americans recognized the recruiting success of western Baptists, Methodists, and Christians, and young men like Charles Finney modified their camp-meeting techniques for use in eastern churches. Although his methods shocked many hard-core Calvinists, Finney's New Measures soon overwhelmed the quiet, traditionalist revivalism of Nathaniel Taylor, Asahel Nettleton, and Lyman Beecher. As Finney and his associates gained wider acceptance throughout the nation, they also moved the Second Great Awakening from its formative stage, described by Nathan Hatch (1989), to a mainstream stage described by William McLoughlin (1978), Paul Johnson (1979), and numerous other historians (e.g., Ryan 1983, Roth 1987, C. Johnson 1989).</jats:p>"

Microdissection and the techinique of Spalteholz for dehydrating and clearing the tissues (rendering them transparent) facilitated the study of the direct and indirect arterial branches which form the three principal networks: the deep fascia, the subcutaneous or adipose layer, and the skin or the dermoepidermic layer. The results are of practical importance since the fascio‐subcutaneous tissue layer can be used as a flap for covering soft tissue defects of the leg. © 1995 WiIey‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Elongation was retarded by 56 and 44% respectively in intact aerenchymatous primary roots of maize incubated in 0.1% stagnant agar, or exposed to 0.06 mol m-3 external O2 in gas-sparged solution. This growth reduction was accompanied by a 3-5-fold increase in alanine as a percentage of total soluble amino acids in the 0-2 mm root tips. The increase in this value was not in response to ethylene or translocation of alanine from other parts of the root. Moreover, in excised tips exposed to 0.06 mol O2 m-3, net production of ethanol, alanine and lactate occurred. Even so, these root tips continued to elongate at 30% of the rate observed in aerated excised root tips. It appears that adaptation of maize to O2 deficiency may involve a combination of aerenchyma formation and tolerance to anoxia. We suggest that metabolic cooperation, in the form of symplastic transport of energy-rich compounds, might exist between cortical cells receiving adequate oxygen supply and cells in anoxic zones.</jats:p>"

The northern site is situated on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain where there is evidence for a high, seasonal input of organic matter derived from the overlying water column. The southern site is the oligotrophic station of the French EUMELI programme off Mauritania and is characterized by low primary productivity in the overlying water column and consequently by a lower organic input to the deep‐sea floor. Low nematode density and total biomass in the surficial centimetre of the sediment at the EUMELI site (89 ind/10 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, 8.52 μg wwt/10 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), in contrast to the PAP site (254 ind/10 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, 54.16 μg wwt/10 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), supports a presumed lower food supply to this area. Similary, mean individual nematode body weight is significantly smaller at the oligotrophic EUMELI site (0.0241 μg dwt) compared to the PAP site (0.0511 μg dwt), which supports the hypothesis that mean nematode body size is correlated with food availability. However, differences are much less obvious when comparing geometric mean biomasses and median individual body sizes. The abundance size spectra for the two localities diverge appreciably only in the upper quartile. The differences in mean individual body weights are caused by the relatively greater abundance of larger nematodes at the more eutrophic PAP site.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Listeria monocytogenes takes up di- and tripeptides via a proton motive force-dependent carrier protein. This peptide transport system resembles the recently cloned and sequenced secondary di- and tripeptide transport system of Lactococcus lactis (A. Hagting, E. R. S. Kunji, K. J. Leenhouts, B. Poolman, and W. N. Konings, J. Biol. Chem. 269:11391-11399, 1994). The peptide permease of L. monocytogenes has a broad substrate specificity and allows transport of the nonpeptide substrate 5-aminolevulinic acid, the toxic di- and tripeptide analogs, alanyl-beta-chloroalanine and alanyl-alanyl-beta-chloroalanine, and various di- and tripeptides. No extracellular peptide hydrolysis was detected, indicating that peptides are hydrolyzed after being transported into the cell. Indeed, peptidase activities in response to various synthetic substrates were detected in cell extracts obtained from L. monocytogenes cells grown in brain heart infusion broth or defined medium. The di- and tripeptide permease can supply L. monocytogenes with essential amino acids for growth and might contribute to growth of this pathogen in various foods where peptides are supplied by proteolytic activity of other microorganisms present in these foods. Possible roles of this di- and tripeptide transport system in the osmoregulation and virulence of L. monocytogenes are discussed.</jats:p>",

Venous flow is subject to a pulsatile and uncertain variation, because the vena cava is more than 30 mmHg below atmospheric pressure. This occurs because the patient is about 1 m above the air-blood surface of the bypass reservoir. Before any reliable study of fluid exchange can be undertaken this effect must be controlled. It was then established that optimum oxygen exchange occurs when equilibration of the plasma oncotic pressure and the capillary hydrostatic pressure is achieved without alteration of the interstitial fluid volume. At the lower arterial blood pressures used during bypass, it is necessary to reduce the plasma oncotic pressure by using an appropriate volume of crystalloid prime. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changes in various nitrogen compounds during senescence of the fourth leaf were studied in two cultivars of spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.). One of the cultivars (Yecora) was supplied with two N levels; the other (Tauro) was grown with the high N level and pruned above the fourth leaf, whereas the control was left intact. In both cultivars grown with high N supply, net nitrogen export from the fourth leaf did not occur until 35 days after sowing (DAS). Loss of leaf soluble proteins started earlier than that of chlorophylis, and coincided initially with an increase in insoluble protein. In N deficient plants the level of total N, soluble protein, and the activity of nitrate reductase (NRA. EC 1.6.6.1) started to decrease about 5 days earlier, and along with chlorophyll, continued to decrease at a faster rate, than in high N plants. Also, with low N supply, the large subunit (LSU, 58 kDa) of ribulose‐1.5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) decreased in greater proportion than other soluble proteins, while with high N supply the decrease in Rubisco LSU was similar to that of other soluble proteins. Nitrogen deficiency caused a greater decrease in soluble proteins than in insoluble proteins, and NRA relative to soluble proteins. The faster senescing Tauro cultivar had lower levels of most parameters, especially NRA, soluble protein and, after 35 DAS. Rubisco LSU as a proportion of soluble protein. The decrease in sink strength due to shoot pruning did generally not affect the level of the various nitrogenous compounds until 35 DAS; thereafter the levels of most parameters, especially soluble protein, Rubisco LSU and, at late stages of senescence, insoluble protein, were higher in pruned than in control shoots. Thus, shoot pruning slows down senescence. The 56‐ and 78‐kDa polypeptides increased, rather than decreased, with leaf age; the level of these two polypeptides showed a negative relationship with Rubisco LSU (r = ‐0.933 and r = ‐0.758, respectively).</jats:p>",

Midwinter rates of net photosynthesis and transpiration were measured at air temperatures of 4, 7, and 11 °C in seedlings from all nutrient treatments. Recovery of net photosynthesis and transpiration in whole seedlings from the three N treatments was assessed at intervals for 28 days after the seedlings were frozen to −5, −15, and −25°C. Foliar N content differed significantly among nutrient treatments and was positively correlated with supply. Mitotic activity ceased earliest in plants with low N supply. Douglas-fir seedlings in the low-N treatment also ceased height growth earliest. These differences in growth had no significant correlation with frost hardiness. No consistent differences in frost hardiness among nutrient treatments were observed. Higher rates of N and P supply resulted in higher rates of winter net photosynthesis. Net photosynthesis was reduced dramatically by night frost, with greater damage occurring at lower temperatures. Net photosynthesis recovery occurred most quickly in seedlings with the midrate of N and P supply. </jats:p>",
