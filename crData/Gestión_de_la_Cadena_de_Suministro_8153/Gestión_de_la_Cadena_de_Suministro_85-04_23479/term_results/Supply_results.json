Six resolutions from this conference were considered in the LAA's National Plan for Document Supply and Delivery. A Document Delivery Conference was called in November 1984 to discuss reactions to the plan, and a working party was formed to progress the Conference's recommendations.

This paper suggests procedures for evaluating water supply performance when instream flows for fish are required of a municipal water supply. A computer simulation model is used with synthetic inflow sequences to investigate indices of system performance for the Seattle, Washington water supply system. A review of techniques used to establish instream flow requirements is presented with a history of instream flow requirements established for the Seattle supply. The trade‐offs between values of instream flows and municipal water supply performance are presented to quantitatively illustrate the impacts of instream requirements.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we first present a simple method for proving this proposition, using a social planning model that determines the optimal rates both of extraction of the depletable resource and of production of the backstop technology. We then present two examples that show how this method can be used to solve more difficult problems in the theory of resource economics. The first example involves learning-by-doing in the backstop sector; that is, backstop costs decline with cumulative production. The second example involves uncertainty of backstop costs. </jats:p>",

The initial, [Formula: see text]-supported growth coefficients ([Formula: see text] or relative growth rate) decreased with decreasing light intensity, but those for symbiotic growth showed relief from high light inhibition by passing through a maximum [Formula: see text] at an intermediate light intensity. In low light intensity (60 μE∙m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>∙s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) the low initial growth coefficient persisted to 40 days in Hoagland's solution, or for 58 days symbiotically at which time the corresponding biomass was reached.

The initial growth phase, which is N limited at a high C supply, was followed by a phase of growth that was C limited at a high N supply. The symbiotic N supply, unlike the combined N supply, was dependent only on the C supply because when the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration was raised the acceleration of symbiotic seedling growth equalled the maximum on [Formula: see text] nutrition. The results support a hypothesis that the change in kinetic phase is controlled by developmental morphogenesis independent of N source and C supply and that a plant pool of organic N metabolites plays a role in the regulation of the N metabolism that is involved in the growth effects. </jats:p>",

INT appeared to have a larger number of capillaries per fibre than EXT (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0–05).

No difference in glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities between EXT and INT was observed.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The institution of supply management has evolved to deal with a farm income problem and to achieve social objectives such as the maintenance of the family farm. In many respects, the institutions have developed in response to significant technological and market development that had potentially profound impacts on the number, size and profitability of farm operations. Supply management has proven successful in transfer— ring income, partially stabilizing prices and production and arresting the spread of vertical integration and maintaining the “family farm.” Although the institution has had its failures, more specifically, income transfers have been capitalized into asset values. Second generation farmers will face higher costs and will benefit only if they too can “short the market” and extract monopoly profits from the marketplace. Further, the rigidities in quota allocation methods have inhibited resource allocation, necessary structural adjustments and imposed real costs to consumers. These negative results are incongruent to an otherwise viable and dynamic Canadian agriculture.</jats:p><jats:p>Is It North It</jats:p><jats:p>One may argue that the consequences of regulation, which are reduced efficiency/competitiveness and lost opportunities, are acceptable if it is felt a transfer of benefits to a disadvantaged group of society is needed. However, can it be held that those farmers operating under supply management remain disadvantaged? If not, regulatory reform and/or adjustments are needed. Otherwise, the tendency towards deregulation in the general economy, widening price gaps, consumer resistance, and the like will lead to imposed changes by regulatory authorities.</jats:p><jats:p>Supply management is an acceptable regulatory tool that should be employed to achieve a myriad of policy objectives.</jats:p>",
