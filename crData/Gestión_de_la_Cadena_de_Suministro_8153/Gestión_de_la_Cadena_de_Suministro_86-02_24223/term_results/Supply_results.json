      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effects of lithium and cholinergic stimulation on inositol phospholipid metabolism have been assessed using rat parotid gland slices and isolated acinar cells labelled with 32Pi. Cholinergic stimulation using carbachol caused substantial breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) and enhanced labelling of phosphatidate (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). Lithium alone had little effect upon 32Pi incorporation, but in combination with carbachol it greatly reduced the PtdIns labelling response to the agonist. Instead the label accumulated in a lipid identified as cytidine monophosphorylphosphatidate. There was also an enhancement of the PA labelling response to carbachol. These lithium-induced alterations in agonist-stimulated phospholipid metabolism were reversed if 10-30 mM-inositol was included in the incubation medium. Despite reduced PtdIns synthesis, lithium had relatively little effect on polyphosphoinositide labelling in stimulated cells. Resynthesis of polyphosphoinositides was monitored in acinar cells that had been stimulated with carbachol and then treated with atropine to block muscarinic receptors. Treatment with lithium during the carbachol-stimulation phase reduced the rate of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis, but had no significant effect upon PtdInsP2. The results suggest that an active inositol phosphatase pathway is essential to maintain intracellular inositol levels, but that PtdInsP2 synthesis is not markedly reduced by a substantial fall in intracellular inositol. This implies a close control over the rates of PtdInsP2 breakdown and resynthesis during agonist stimulation.</jats:p>",

Growth of oil production, exports and revenues during the course of the twentieth century led increasingly to it playing an expanded but rather geographically and economically restricted role in the structures of both employment and national income. As late as the 1960s, more than half of all Iranians in gainful employment were to be found in agriculture or related activities and most Iranians were essentially rural dwellers. Only with the advent of land reform and other upheavals in the countryside from 1961 was there a marked change in the situation. Whatever its other merits, land reform overthrew a form of equilibrium in rural areas that had previously fostered conservatism, isolation and immobility. Among the changes brought in the train of reforms enforced by the central authorities beginning in the early 1960s were displacement of population at an accelerating rate. Rural People left agricultural employment and, as soon as opportunity presented itself, moved from the villages to the towns.</jats:p>",

Cardiac metabolism was stimulated by intracoronary infusion of isoproterenol, norepinephrine (NE), ouabain, and the cardiotonic agent 1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, 2-[2-methoxy-4-(methylsulfinyl)-phenyl] (AR-L 115), and the release of adenosine into the effluent was determined. Besides their inotropic effects on myocardial tissue, these substances affect differently the tone of coronary arteries. Thus they influence the supply-to-demand ratio for O2 and the tissue cyclic AMP content differently. When myocardial O2 consumption was increased to the same extent, the changes in coronary flow induced followed the order of AR-L 115 greater than isoproterenol greater than NE greater than ouabain. Conversely, the rank order of potency causing adenosine and inosine release was NE greater than ouabain greater than isoproterenol greater than AR-L 115. When NE-induced vasoconstriction was abolished by prazosin, the release of adenosine and inosine was significantly diminished. Enhancement of O2 supply by overperfusion of the coronary arteries in isoproterenol-stimulated hearts was associated with a significant reduction of nucleoside release into the effluent. Our findings suggest that the major stimulus for myocardial adenosine formation is an imbalance between O2 delivery and O2 demand and not the metabolic rate as such. In the isolated heart, adenosine is formed as a feedback signal and can compete with NE- and ouabain-induced vasoconstriction. </jats:p>",

The reactions catalyzed by free cells were assumed to obey Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics for a one‚Äêsubstrate reaction. Both external (outside the beads) and internal (inside the beads) mass transfer of the substrate were considered for the immobilized preparations. The theoretical calculations were compared with experimental data for the oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone by <jats:italic>Gluconobacter oxydans</jats:italic> cells immobilized in calcium alginate gel. Glycerol was present in excess so that the reaction rate was limited by oxygen. The correlation between experimental data and theoretical calculations was quite good. The calculations showed how the overall effectiveness factor was influenced by, for example, the particle size and the cell density in the beads. In most cases the reaction rate was mainly limited by internal mass transfer of the substrate (oxygen). As shown previously, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äêbenzoquinone can replace oxygen as the electron acceptor in this reaction.

In this case also, the correlation between the model and the experimental results was quite good. Much higher production rates were obtained with <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äêbenzoquinone as the electron acceptor compared to when oxygen was used. The reasons for this fact were that <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äêbenzoquinone gave a higher maximal reaction rate for free cells and the solubility of <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äêbenzoquinone was higher than for oxygen. Different methods of increasing the rate of microbial oxidation reactions are discussed.</jats:p>",
