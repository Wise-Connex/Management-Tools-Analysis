      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain technology (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content>) facilitates information transfer within and across firm boundaries. However, institutional environments in emerging markets give rise to challenges that inhibit the implementation of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> and the consequent realization of its benefits. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding as to the nature or the extent of these implementation challenges. We undertook a grounded theory study in the emerging market of India to investigate how <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> is implemented when subjected to prevailing institutional pressures. Based on an analysis of interviews with 50 supply chain managers, we find that early adopters of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> experience significant and numerous unmet expectations associated with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> implementation. These unmet expectations arise from competing institutional logics with the resultant isomorphic pressure causing the juxtaposition of two incompatible supply chains in India. A key finding of this study contradicts extant research, supporting recent work in emerging markets, to suggest a need to reassess our mental models developed in the West and conceptualize <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> models that are sensitive to the institutional environments of emerging markets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prior research has underscored the importance of internal and external supply chain integration, but the growing role of the supply management organization in developing this capability is not well specified. In this research, we explore the concept of supply management alignment, defined as the behavioral characteristics and process requirements for understanding and explicitly outlining internal stakeholder needs, and linking these to supplier performance agreements. Using the lens of dynamic capabilities, we propose a theoretical model for creating <jats:italic>supply management alignment</jats:italic>. This model presents the synergistic effects derived through strong internal lines of communication combined with external supply relationships based on defined metrics and processes. The underlying set of requirements to achieve supply management alignment is proposed and tested in this model, thereby enhancing our understanding of the processes and behaviors required for integration of internal stakeholder needs with external suppliers, which can lead to improved performance. We explore the complementary effects of supply management alignment on network agility and supplier performance improvements. Data from 151 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> manufacturing firms are used to test the model. The results provide a unifying framework tying together many of the prescriptive elements of strategic sourcing into a more coherent theoretical model and establish the basis for future studies of supply management alignment capabilities.</jats:p>",

Open access has contributed to the recent decline of interlibrary loan (ILL) and document supply requests but is not the only reason and probably not the most important. Open repositories and open-access journals have the potential to substitute ILL and document supply; yet for different reasons, including legal compliance, this substitution remains of limited interest. ILL and document supply institutions have started to integrate open access into their workflow and service provision in different ways, and the paper provides a conceptual framework with some perspectives for further service development. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Paradoxically, relatively few papers make the link between open access and document supply, with empirical and/or conceptual elements.

As a result, there is growing interest in using CO2 for miscible flooding, where that is appropriate. Much of the current experience of CO2 EOR has been in the US Permian Basin, based on using CO2 sourced from high CO2 content subsurface sources. While significant CO2 EOR potential exists in many basins around the world, application of CO2 EOR is often limited by the availability of CO2 at an acceptable cost. This paper addresses the key issue of CO2 sourcing for CO2 EOR in new basins in which CO2 is the most suitable miscible fluid and the different subsurface conditions encountered with the need for subsurface/surface integration.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The full potential for CO2 EOR to increase recovery factors will only be realised if supply options can be developed for EOR projects in locations that do not have access to an existing CO2 infrastructure. Value chains linking industrial sources of CO2 to appropriate field targets are expected to be the key enabler. Robust technical and non-technical integration across the capture-transport-injection chain is required, to ensure that the potentially competing operational requirements for capture and EOR usage are reconciled, and that commercial and regulatory considerations are addressed. CO2 capture options and a methodology for developing CO2 supply options will be described and illustrated with experience from the development of CO2 value chains for CCS demonstration projects such as Peterhead, Quest and Boundary Dam.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nigeria is endowed with abundant energy resources, both conventional and renewable, which can potentially provide the country with a sufficient capacity to meet the ambitions of both urban and rural Nigerians of a full, nationwide electrification level. Yet, Nigeria has one of the lowest consumption rates of electricity per capita in Africa. With the demand superseding the generation, there is inequitable access of rural communities to the electricity service in the country. There are inherent obstacles militating against the effective implementation of an orderly energy policy in Nigeria. The inefficiencies over shadowing the allocation of energy resources coupled with the near depletion of fossil fuels, make it imperative for the country to exploit its huge natural renewable resources to avoid a worsening energy supply scenario and provide feasible solar water pump to rural dwellers. This paper presents the applications of solar water pumping which are already quite significant and are growing at steady rate. Solar energy is suitable for small-scale water pumping in remote areas where the demand is regular, such as for drinking water, but it may also be used for irrigation. Most areas in Nigeria have climates suitable for solar pumping. A review is given of the use of solar energy for water pumping to improve the living conditions of the population in rural areas and to develop techniques for utilization of solar energy in a tropical environment condition. Results, suggests that, solar powered water pumping must be encouraged, promoted, invested, implemented, and demonstrated by full scale in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

This structure provides market reach extension in which eventually leads to revenue increase. Whatsoever, aside of this advantage, DCSC also brings some challenging problems. One prominent problem is of about between-channel pricing-problem. In its practice, DCSC actors often apply intuitive offline and online pricing without further analytical evaluation. Yet there is no representative mechanism to address this critical problem. This paper attempts to resolute this challenge by proposing a qualitative estimation mechanism on customer acceptance on online channel relative to offline one. This proposed approach is about to utilize an interplay relationship between offline and online prices. The main parameter to consider is a ratio of customer acceptance parameters. These parameters are elicited from 3 groups of products which are sold under DCSC structure in Indonesian cases to exhibit the different properties in each product group. Numerical experiment result shows that the utilization of this pricing mechanism may increase the financial performance of DCSC under observation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bioenergy is a new source of energy that accounts for a substantial portion of the renewable energy production in many countries. The production of bioenergy is expected to increase due to its unique advantages, such as no harmful emissions and abundance. Supply-related problems are the main obstacles precluding the increase of use of biomass (which is bulky and has low energy density) to produce bioenergy. To overcome this challenge, large-scale optimization models are needed to be solved to enable decision makers to plan, design, and manage bioenergy supply chains. Therefore, the use of effective optimization approaches is of great importance. The traditional mathematical methods  (such as linear, integer, and mixed-integer programming) frequently fail to find optimal solutions for non-convex and/or large-scale models whereas metaheuristics are efficient approaches for finding near-optimal solutions that use less computational resources. This paper presents a comprehensive review by studying and analyzing the application of metaheuristics to solve bioenergy supply chain models as well as the exclusive challenges of the mathematical problems applied in the bioenergy supply chain field. The reviewed metaheuristics include: (1) population approaches, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and bee colony algorithm (BCA); and (2) trajectory approaches, such as the tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA). Based on the outcomes of this literature review, the integrated design and planning of bioenergy supply chains problem has been solved primarily by implementing the GA. The production process optimization was addressed primarily by using both the GA and PSO. The supply chain network design problem was treated by utilizing the GA and ACO. The truck and task scheduling problem was solved using the SA and the TS, where the trajectory-based methods proved to outperform the population-based methods.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the influence of chemical oxygen demand (COD)/N ratio on the nutrient removal was analyzed to find the detailed removal pathways of nutrients. The result was found to be high efficiency for biochemical oxygen demand removal (95.86%) compared to that of COD (88.95%) and suspended solids (81.12%). The total phosphorus (TP) (67.66%) and PO4-P (61.42%) removal efficiencies were relatively lower than that of total nitrogen (TN) (81.42%) and NO3-N (76.70%). This may be due to the fact that the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/TP ratio (8.01) was relatively low. Decreasing the COD/N ratio decreased TP and PO4-P removal efficiency. However, the removal efficiency of TN and NH4-N was increased from 47.60 to 64.54 and 54.17 to 73.72% with decreasing of COD/N ratio from 8.19 to 7.64, respectively. In addition, the denitrification rate and nitrification rate were increased from 211.8 to 301.0 mg/L d and 87.7 to 109.4 mg/L d, respectively, when COD/N ratios changed from 8.19 to 7.64.

In this paper, disruption management strategy is an effective and necessary part of the supply chain disruption risk in supply chain management research, which is a new bright spot in the field. The new management ideas and sophisticated quantitative analysis results continue to emerge, but they are overall relatively fragmented, lack of system. So supply chain disruption research related to risk management is still in its infancy. Through the theories and methods of management science of quantitative supply chain integration and management, optimal configuration of the entire resources and benefit maximization of the whole supply chain can be achieved. The paper reviewed foreign research on quantitative integration of supply chain management, and proposed a comparative analysis, finally provided some possible future research directions.</jats:p>"

Pressure on scarce fresh water resources can be reduced by treating and reusing brackish water by advanced membrane treatment technologies. In this study, brackish water originating from effluent discharge of a local coal mine, seawater, groundwater and salt water swimming pool is treated by a laboratory-scale vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) system. VMD is an emerging technology that has the potential to become as important as conventional distillation system and aims to remove particles and dissolved impurities by evaporation and condensation techniques that mimic what occurs in nature. This study validates the mathematical modeling of the transport mechanisms used in the VMD process using data collected for different experimental situations. The response of flux rate to various process operating parameters, including pressure, temperature, flow rate and salinity concentration, is also demonstrated. This thermally driven separation process enables to remove 99.9% of total dissolved solids (TDS) from brackish water. The quality of the permeate water from all four water sources studied is of acceptable standards for potable use; however, it requires mineralization efforts before direct consumption.</jats:p>",

In the case where throughput (output rate) is not a significant metric of system performance (as typically studied in the literature), we derive analytical results to gain managerial insights. We find that the operational decision on optimal supply/demand balance and the strategic decision on how to achieve that optimal balance can be decoupled and stratified. With the purpose of providing a managerial guide, we identify conditions for when to manipulate demand rather than supply, and vice versa. For the first time in the literature, we study throughput considerations in this context, and we analytically characterize the optimal strategy. Specifically, we show that it is optimal to manipulate either demand, or supply (and not both), and that the optimal system balance and the strategy on how to achieve it are strongly tied. Our findings can shed light on the managerial decision making process in these environments, and they can be used to revisit any governing strategies dictating management of demand (or supply) as a first course of action.</jats:p>"

This is because such “green” BSSs impose significant reductions in the operational expenditures (OPEX) of telecom operators due to the possibility of on-site renewable energy harvesting. In this paper, the green BSSs power supply system parameters detected through remote and centralized real time  sensing are presented. An implemented sensing system based on a wireless sensor network enables reliable collection and post-processing analyses of many parameters, such as: total charging/discharging current of power supply system, battery voltage and temperature, wind speed, etc. As an example, yearly sensing results for three different BSS configurations powered by solar and/or wind energy are discussed in terms of renewable energy supply (RES) system performance. In the case of powering those BSS with standalone systems based on a fuel generator, the fuel consumption models expressing interdependence among the generator load and fuel consumption are proposed. This has allowed energy-efficiency comparison of the fuel powered and RES systems, which is presented in terms of the OPEX and carbon dioxide (CO2) reductions. Additionally, approaches based on different BSS  air-conditioning systems and the on/off regulation of a daily fuel generator activity are proposed and validated in terms of energy and capital expenditure (CAPEX) savings.     </jats:p>"

Also assessment tools for water supply were applied for failure assessment in the water supply system (WSS) management. The safety functioning of WSS is associated with analysis of relations between threats, reducing the frequency of their appearing, and, if threats appear, with the identification of their causes and reducing their negative consequences. Undesirable events are the result of phenomena independent from the human will, as well as those related to human activity, that in a significant way influence the WSS functioning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Camp de Tarragona Water Reuse Project is an emblematic example of how regional water scarcity can be overcome by considering reclaimed secondary effluent, which would otherwise be disposed of in the Mediterranean Sea, as an essential component of integrated water resources management. An advanced water reclamation plant (AWRP) was completed in 2011 to reclaim municipal secondary effluent from Tarragona and Vilaseca-Salou wastewater treatment plants. The reclaimed effluent is used for cooling and process water at the nearby Tarragona petrochemical park. The AWRP's current (2014) capacity is 19,000 m3/d (Phase I), and further expansions are planned to produce 29,000 m3/d (Phase II) and 55,000 m3/d (Phase III) in coming years. This locally available additional water supply will replace surface water supplies currently transferred from the Ebro River for use at the petrochemical park; as a result, an equivalent volume of surface water will be available for urban water supply in the coastal areas of Tarragona province. By developing this new and locally available water supply source, industrial growth in a water scarce region has been supported, while promoting local industry's sustainability. This industrial water reuse project provided 0.20 hm3 of water from September to December 2012, its first operational year, and 1.37 hm3 in 2013. The paper presents and discusses the planning, design, construction and operation phases of this water reclamation and reuse project, including start-up and commissioning, facilities preservation protocols from construction completion to servicing start-up, and the operational, management and economic arrangements adopted to provide a reliable source of reclaimed water for cooling water systems and demineralized water for boiler feed at the Tarragona petrochemical park and a nearby cogeneration power plant.</jats:p>",

      "type": "report",
      "container-title": [],
      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Original objectivesThe objectives of this project were to evaluate the growth performance, meat yield and quality attributes of broiler strains widely differing in their genetic potential under normal temperature vs. warm temperature (short and long-term) conditions. Strain differences in breast muscle accretion rate, metabolic responses under heat load and, gross and histopathological changes in breast muscle under thermal load was also to be characterized. BackgroundTremendous genetic progress has been made in broiler chicken growth rate and meat yield since the 1950s. Higher growth rate is driven by higher rates of feed intake and metabolism, resulting in elevated internal heat production. Hot rearing conditions negatively affect broiler growth by hindering dissipation of heat and may lead to a lethal elevation in body temperature. To avoid heat-induced mortality, broilers reduce feed intake, leading to depressed growth rate, lower weight gain, reduce breast meat yield and quality. Thus, the genetic potential of contemporary commercial broilers (CCB) is not fully expressed under hot conditions. Major conclusions, solutions, and achievementsResearch conducted in Israel focused on three broiler strains – CCB, Featherless, Feathered sibs (i.e., sharing similar genetic background). Complimentary research trials conducted at Auburn utilized CCB (Cobb 500, Cobb 700, Ross 308, Ross 708), contrasting their performance to slow growing strains. Warm rearing conditions consistently reduced feed intake, growth rate, feed efficiency, body weight uniformity and breast muscle yield, especially pronounced with CCB and magnified with age. Breast meat quality was also negatively affected, as measured by higher drip loss and paler meat color. Exposure to continuous or short-term heat stress induced respiratory alkalosis. Breast muscle histomorphometrics confirmed enhanced myofiber hypertrophy in CCB. Featherless broilers exhibited a significant increase in blood-vessel density under warm conditions. Rapid growth and muscle accretion rate was correlated to various myopathies (white striping, woody and necrotic) as well as to increases in plasma creatinekinase levels. Whether the trigger(s) of muscle damage is loss of cellular membrane integrity due to oxidative damage or tissue lactate accumulation, or to loss of inter-compartmental cation homeostasis is yet to be determined. Based on genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping, identification of the gene with the recessive mutation Scaleless (sc) facilitated the development a dCAPS assay to discriminate between sc carrier (sc/+) and non-carrier (+/+) individuals. ImplicationsThis project confirmed that featherless broiler strains grow efficiently with high yield and quality of breast meat, even under warm rearing conditions that significantly depress the overall performance of CCB. Therefore, broiler meat production in hot regions and climates can be substantially improved by introducing the featherless gene into contemporary commercial broiler stocks. This approach has become more feasible with the development of dCAPS assay. A novel modification of the PCR protocol (using whole blood samples instead of extracted DNA) may contribute to the efficient development of commercial featherless broiler strains. Such strains will allow expansion of the broiler meat production in developing countries in warm climates, where energy intensive environmental control of rearing facilities are not economical and easily achievable. </p>"

Considering the Malaysia weather, it is in general the weather change very fast from the sunny clear sky up to the very thick cloud. Hence, the perturb and observe (P&amp;O) control scheme is designed to crop solar energy in the most efficient manner and store the energy to the battery. To convert the output from solar or battery into high quality three-phase sinusoidal alternating current (AC) voltage, low resistive MOSFETs switches inverter is used by adopting Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation Technique (SPWM). The frequency of the AC voltage can be adjusted from 30 up to 65 Hz with constant voltage over frequency (V/F) ratio. It is expected that the device can be used as stand-alone electrical supply for dedicated devices such as agricultural water pumping, drug-cold-storage in remote village, cold storage for fisherman, self-powered and unmanned water pump, forest security and surveillance device, etc. Furthermore, the device is also equipped with status display, over current and excessive charging protection, and low power warnings.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes vertical marketing systems and the role of retailing therein. Specially analyzed is the power of retail chains’ demand with regard to the entire supply chains they head, as well as the present-day new competition in retailing and modern business concepts related to the vertical marketing systems. Additionally, analyzed are also select indicators to examine the significance of retailing in an individual national economy. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the new indicators of significance of retailing in economy with regard to the realized GDP, as a component of value chains. These indicators complement the usual retailing significance analyses from the point of view of its share in the number of employees and the number of companies. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>From the conducted analysis, one may conclude that the vertical marketing systems become increasingly important, and retailing assumes a new role in economy in that sense. Thus, new indicators of retailing significance might also be necessary.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To meet Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) cellulosic biofuel mandates, the United States will require an annual domestic supply of about 242 million Mg of biomass by 2022. To improve the feedstock logistics of lignocellulosic biofuels in order to access available biomass resources from areas with varying yields, commodity systems have been proposed and designed to deliver quality-controlled biomass feedstocks at preprocessing “depots”. Preprocessing depots densify and stabilize the biomass prior to long-distance transport and delivery to centralized biorefineries. The logistics of biomass commodity supply chains could introduce spatially variable environmental impacts into the biofuel life cycle due to needing to harvest, move, and preprocess biomass from multiple distances that have variable spatial density. This study examines the uncertainty in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of corn stover logistics within a bio-ethanol supply chain in the state of Kansas, where sustainable biomass supply varies spatially. Two scenarios were evaluated each having a different number of depots of varying capacity and location within Kansas relative to a central commodity-receiving biorefinery to test GHG emissions uncertainty. The first scenario sited four preprocessing depots evenly across the state of Kansas but within the vicinity of counties having high biomass supply density. The second scenario located five depots based on the shortest depot-to-biorefinery rail distance and biomass availability. The logistics supply chain consists of corn stover harvest, collection and storage, feedstock transport from field to biomass preprocessing depot, preprocessing depot operations, and commodity transport from the biomass preprocessing depot to the biorefinery. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the spatial uncertainty in the feedstock logistics gate-to-gate sequence. Within the logistics supply chain GHG emissions are most sensitive to the transport of the densified biomass, which introduces the highest variability (0.2–13 g CO2e/MJ) to life cycle GHG emissions. Moreover, depending upon the biomass availability and its spatial density and surrounding transportation infrastructure (road and rail), logistics can increase the variability in life cycle environmental impacts for lignocellulosic biofuels. Within Kansas, life cycle GHG emissions could range from 24 g CO2e/MJ to 41 g CO2e/MJ depending upon the location, size and number of preprocessing depots constructed. However, this range can be minimized through optimizing the siting of preprocessing depots where ample rail infrastructure exists to supply biomass commodity to a regional biorefinery supply system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Flood irrigation in the winter has been widely applied in northwest China for several years, but little attention has been paid to the flood irrigation program to date. In order to seek a reasonable irrigation quota, a flood irrigation experiment using two common quotas (1,800 and 1,200 m3 ha−1) was conducted in an area irrigated by saline water in the Nanjiang basin with shallow groundwater. Soil electrical conductivity in six treatments irrigated by saline water, with various salinity backgrounds, was investigated using Hydra and DDS-307 before and after flood irrigation. The results indicate that the quota of 12,00 m3 ha−1 was small enough to prevent soil salt from leaching out of the root zone. Although the quota of 1,800 m3 ha−1 may guarantee regular plant growth in the following year, it resulted in at least 267.2 g m−2 of salt entering the shallow groundwater. Therefore, flood irrigation had an important and profound effect on plants, soil environment, and shallow groundwater. The quota of flood irrigation in winter should be determined cautiously according to the hydraulic characteristics and salt background of the soil.</jats:p>",

The bullwhip effect is one of the most important issues in the supply chain management and it is present in many companies. It preserves a character of invisibility because there are lots of causes for its formation and they are usually difficult to discern. The bullwhip effect is a phenomenon of an increase in the order variability within a supply chain. The higher we are within the supply chain, the higher is the order variability. The company encountered with the whip effect can successfully reduce its impact by improving the information flow, as well as improving partners’ cooperation within the supply chain. In this way the company can limit its negative repercussions and increase the profit. The article focuses on the overview of the bullwhip effect within a distribution chain, from its causes to suggestions and measures how to ease its negative repercussions on the organisation. Part of the causes could be found in the market demand variability and in the lack of communication about the actual marked demand within the supply chain. The rest of the causes are related to obstacles that emerge among different partners within the supply chain (role of culture). A qualitative analysis is applied on the basis of the selected cognitions from the supply chain management. The quantitative analysis is based on the theoretical research of the effective flow of information among the participants and its contribution to the reduction of the bullwhip impact. The article discusses two research questions: 1) The correct information flow within the supply chain and the improvement of the communication among partners can lead to the bullwhip effect reduction, and 2) A reduction of the bullwhip influence can lead to the increase of cooperation among partners. The results of the analysis can be used for further research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The house price and lending boom of the 2000s is widely considered to be the main cause of the financial crisis that began in 2007. However, looking to the past, we find a similar boom in the late 1980s which did not lead directly to a global systemic banking crisis – there were widespread banking difficulties in the early 1990s but these were linked mainly to commercial property exposures. This raises the question whether the received wisdom is incorrect, and other factors than the housing boom caused the crisis, while macroprudential policy is overly targeted at the control of house prices and lending<jats:italic>per se.</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p>Accordingly, in this paper we compare and contrast the cycles in house prices over 1985–94 with 2002–11. There are more similarities than contrasts between the booms. Stylised facts include a similar rise in real house prices where booms took place, and a marked rise in the real mortgage stock along with real incomes. The aftermath periods are also comparable in terms of house price changes. Econometrically, determinants of house prices are similar in size and sign from the 1980s to date.</jats:p><jats:p>There remain some contrasts. Leverage rose far more in the later episode and did not contract in the aftermath. Mean reversion of house prices is greater in the earlier period. The earlier boom period showed differences with average house price behaviour which was not mirrored in the most recent boom and inflation was higher. Despite the contrasts, on balance we reject the idea that the recent boom was in some way unique and hence the key cause of the crisis. There is a need for further research to capture distinctive structural and conjunctural factors underlying the recent crisis which differ from the earlier boom and some suggestions are made.</jats:p>",

Hollow-fiber membranes made from polyvinylidene fluoride with a nominal pore size of 0.1 μm were used in the series of experiments involving the constant-flow mode of operation with automatic periodical backwashing. Easily available indexes of water quality, such as dissolved organic carbon, UV absorbance, Ca concentration and turbidity could not explain the degree of fouling encountered in the filtration tests. In contrast, a clear correlation between the concentrations of biopolymers determined by liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and membrane fouling was confirmed in this study. The concentrations of humics exhibited a weak correlation. The impacts of seasonal variation of feed water and coagulant dosage on membrane fouling were also explained well by biopolymer concentrations. Concentrations of biopolymers can be a useful indicator of the fouling potential of feed water in microfiltration.</jats:p>",

Several incidents of wire breakage have highlighted the importance of the catenary/pantograph heating problem, in those incidents the contact wire had melted and broke itself. The experimental setups consists of estimating the contact’s thermal resistance and area in order to calculate which part of the interface heat flux go throught the catenary’s contact wire and which part go throught the pantograph’s collector strip. The numerical model is based on several phenomena as heat conduction into the wires, heat exchange with ambiance through convection, Joule effects and heat flux from the interface.</jats:p>",

Various inventory policies such as economic order quantity, periodic ordering (T, M) and stock to demand have been considered.

The approach is of aggregating the optimized value at each echelon referred to as aggregated supply chain in the paper. Then the concept of integrated supply chain is introduced which optimizes the supply chain as a whole, rather than aggregating local optima. The comparison is made between the two approaches that prove the integrated supply chain's superiority. Furthermore, dependent optimization is run as it is not practically possible for each echelon to optimize at the same time. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Each echelon is allowed to optimize at a time and other echelons assume corresponding values. This final comparative multi criterion analysis is based on the three factors, i.e. inventory cost, customer service level and inventory turnover with different weights assigned to each factor at different levels of a supply chain. Finally a consolidation of results is made to reflect the overall preference which proves that an integrated supply chain best serves all the parameters combined together.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a price-endogenous, dynamic, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to determine the biofuel feedstock supply response in U.S. agriculture and future biorefinery locations that meet the mandated cellulosic biofuel production targets. With a large number of supply units and potential processing locations involved, the problem could not be solved directly using MINLP solvers. We developed a sequential two-stage solution procedure to cope with this computational difficulty. The original MINLP model is decomposed into a price-endogenous agricultural sector model that solves the supply response and equilibrium in agricultural product markets, and a dynamic linear mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that solves the optimum facility location and supply chain network. The two models are solved sequentially with feedback from each other. Because of the large number of binary variables involved, computational difficulty was also encountered when solving the MIP model. We employed a heuristic backward-recursive technique to cope with this difficulty. Using moderately large test problems, we demonstrate that the heuristic solution procedures are computationally convenient and produce near-optimal solutions. We then applied this method to solve the full-scale model where nearly 3,000 U.S. counties were considered both as spatial supply units and potential refinery locations over the 2007–2022 planning horizon. Empirical results show that: (i) the U.S. biofuel mandates would lead to a significant increase in food commodity prices; (ii) regional comparative advantage in producing biofuel feedstocks would be more important than proximity to biofuel demand locations when determining the optimum refinery locations; and (iii) incorporating biofuel refinery locations in land-use decisions makes a considerable difference in the regional biomass production pattern. </jats:p>",

A series of jar-tests were conducted to investigate the coagulation performance with polyaluminum chloride and floc properties of Microcystis aeruginosa, a unicellular cyanobacteria, in the presence of HA. Meanwhile the coagulation mechanism was explored through the measurement of zeta potential of the supernatant. The results showed that an optimal removal efficiency of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was obtained at pH 8.0 with a low concentration of HA (2 mg/L) and at pH 6.0 with a high concentration of HA (8 mg/L). The floc structure was more compact and bigger-sized and the calculated fractal dimension (Df) was larger at maximum coagulation efficiency. The variation of Df was consistent with that of Chl-a removal efficiency under the same coagulation conditions. Charge neutralization was inferred to be the dominant mechanism to remove algal cells with low concentration of HA, while charge neutralization, gathering and the bridging process worked together to remove algal cells with a high concentration of HA. These results provide insight on how to achieve an optimal removal efficiency of algae in the presence of different concentrations of HA in water treatment.</jats:p>",

A number of observations are made about the impact of each policy on the supply chain performance. The models we developed are solved by using a commercial software GAMS/CPLEX.

Given concerns about the effects of uncertainty on the outcomes of long‐term decisions, many water planners seek adaptation alternatives that are robust given a wide range of possible climate futures. However, there is no standardized paradigm for quantifying robustness in the water sector. This study uses a new framework for assessing the impact of future climate change and uncertainty on water supply systems and defines and demonstrates a new metric for quantifying climate robustness. The metric is based on the range of climate change space over which an alternative provides acceptable performance. The metric is independent of assumptions regarding future climate; however, GCM‐based (or other) climate projections can be used to create a “climate‐informed” version of the metric. The method is demonstrated for a water supply system in the northeast United States to evaluate the additional robustness that can be attained through optimal operational changes, by comparing optimal reservoir operations with current reservoir operations. Results show the additional robustness gained through adaptation. They also reveal the additional insight regarding robust adaptation gained from the decision‐scaling approach that would not be discerned using a GCM projection‐based analysis.</jats:p>",

Macedonia was found to be characterized by intensive water consumption, with some sectors having a significant virtual water content in their products. Virtual water multipliers were used to analyze the trade balance and determine whether national commercial trade strategies are in line with Heckscher–Ohlin (HO) theory. It was found that Macedonia trade strategies in terms of virtual water were generally in line with HO theory. However, as a consequence of significant exports and high virtual water content in vegetables, fruit, grapes and sheep and goat products within the agriculture sector and in food and basic metal products in the manufacturing sector, the region was a net exporter of virtual water, losing about 124 million m3 of water at 2005 level or 18% of total water consumption. Reducing exports of the most water-intensive products with significant net positive exports would result in substantial water savings of 42% of total water consumption. The results presented here can help policy makers in promoting production specializations that are more environmentally sustainable or in redesigning existing water pricing policies at national level to encourage rational use of water.</jats:p>",

However, until now the COQ has been measured almost exclusively only internally, i.e. within a company, while the role of a supply chain in delivering quality product to end users has been ignored. In this paper we argue that all the entities within supply chain affect the quality of a product or a service and their quality related activities should thus be inevitably considered. The objective of this research is to develop a mathematical model to estimate COQ as key performance measurement within manufacturing supply chain while considering quality Excellency status. Using classic PAF (Prevention-Appraisal-Failure) model classification to develop mathematical model and its integration with significant variables in supply chain entities are the key methodology in this work. Perceived quality is assumed as an appropriate definition of quality in manufacturing supply chain. Moreover, proposed model is examined against real time quality cost data of manufacturing supply chain in two intervals, first at quality immaturity period and then at quality maturity period. Statistical tools are used to validate the model and compare its behaviour in the two intervals. The results are then analyzed and discussed, and possible future works are presented.</jats:p>",

This study seeks to understand how, forming strategic supply chain relationships, and developing strategic supply chain capability, influences beneficial supply chain outcomes expected from utilizing industry-led innovation, in the form of electronic business solutions using the internet, in the Australian beef industry. Findings should add valuable insights to both academics and practitioners in the fields of supply chain innovation management and strategic supply chain management, and expand knowledge to current literature.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– This is a quantitative study comparing innovative and non-innovative supply chain operatives in the Australian beef industry, through factor analysis and structural equation modeling using PAWS Statistical V18 and AMOS V18 to analyze survey data from 412 respondents from the Australian beef supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Key findings are that both innovative and non-innovative supply chain operators attribute supply chain synchronization as only a minor indicator of strategic supply chain capability, contrary to the literature; and they also indicate strategic supply chain capability has a minor influence in achieving beneficial outcomes from utilizing industry-led innovation. These results suggest a lack of coordination between supply chain operatives in the industry. They also suggest a lack of understanding of the benefits of developing a strategic supply chain management competence, particularly in relation to innovation agendas, and provides valuable insights as to why an industry paradox exists in terms of the level of investment in industry-led innovation, vs the level of corresponding benefit achieved.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Results are not generalized due to the single agribusiness industry studied and the single research method employed. However, this provides opportunity for further agribusiness studies in this area and also studies using alternate methods, such as qualitative, in-depth analysis of these factors and their relationships, which may confirm results or produce different results. Further, this study empirically extends existing theoretical contributions and insights into the roles of strategic supply chain management and innovation management in improving supply chain and ultimately industry performance while providing practical insights to supply chain practitioners in this and other similar agribusiness industries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– These findings confirm results from a 2007 research (Ketchen<jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2007) which suggests supply chain practice and teachings need to take a strategic direction in the twenty-first century. To date, competence in supply chain management has built up from functional and process orientations rather than from a strategic perspective. This study confirms that there is a need for more generalists that can integrate with various disciplines, particularly those who can understand and implement strategic supply chain management.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Possible social implications accrue through the development of responsible government policy in terms of industry supply chains. Strategic supply chain management and supply chain innovation management have impacts to the social fabric of nations through the sustainability of their industries, especially agribusiness industries which deal with food safety and security. If supply chains are now the competitive weapon of nations then funding innovation and managing their supply chain competitiveness in global markets requires a strategic approach from everyone, not just the industry participants.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This is original empirical research, seeking to add value to embryonic and important developing literature concerned with adopting a strategic approach to supply chain management. It also seeks to add to existing literature in the area of innovation management, particularly through greater understanding of the implications of nations developing industry-wide, industry-led innovation agendas, and their ramifications to industry supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and protein absorption analysis revealed that modified PE surfaces produced active groups, including carboxyl (O═C─O), hydroxyl (C─OH), and carbonyl (C═O), increased surface roughness, and enhanced the adsorption of both the bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen. During the startup period of 33 days, the average removal rates of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-H) were 68 and 72% before and after modification which were 36 and 43% for total nitrogen, 47 and 45% for total organic carbon. The results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated that modified carriers adsorbed and gathered more species of bacteria on surfaces. Thus, surface modification of PE suspended carrier by PLA improved the efficiency of reactor startup for drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

Salmonella is still one of the most important pathogens that occur in the poultry supply chain. Therefore, this study analyzed the susceptibility of Salmonella isolates collected from a poultry supply chain to β-lactam antibiotics, and examined the phenotypes of the isolates based on enzyme-inducible AmpC β-lactamase analysis. All analysis of the putative positive isolates in the current study confirmed that 27.02% (77/285 analysis) of all ESBL tests realized with the isolates produced a profile of resistance consistent with β-lactamase production. All isolates of  S. Minnesota serotype had ESBL phenotype. Aztreonam resistance was the least common amongst the Salmonella isolates, followed by ceftazidime. The presence of inducible chromosomal ESBL was detected in 14 different isolates of the 19 serotypes investigated. These results are very indicatives of the presence of ESBL genes in Salmonella isolates from a broiler supply chain, reaffirming the growing global problem of ESBL resistance.</jats:p>"

In doing so, we operationalize firm resilience to understand how supply chain disruption orientated firms can develop resilience to supply chain disruptions. We find that supply chain disruption orientation alone is not enough for a firm to develop resilience. Supply chain disruption oriented firms require the ability to reconfigure resources or have a risk management resource infrastructure to develop resilience. The way in which supply chain disruption oriented firms develop resilience through resource reconfiguration or risk management infrastructure depends on the context of the disruption as high impact or low impact. In a high impact disruption context, resource reconfiguration fully mediates the relationship between supply chain disruption orientation and firm resilience. In a low impact disruption context, supply chain disruption orientation and risk management infrastructure have a synergistic effect on developing firm resilience.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Results indicate that market‐oriented firms are more likely to realize the strategic importance of managing the supply chain when operating under conditions of high environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity. This provides a better understanding of the complex relationship between the demand and supply sides of the firm. This study highlights the importance of marketing theory and concepts to supply chain management scholars, and vice versa. This further accentuates the importance of eliminating the disconnect between supply and demand‐management processes, also described as the “Great Divide” (Drucker 1973; Esper et al. 2010a,b). A number of key managerial implications are offered as well.</jats:p>",

This paper mainly forces on the visualization of large consumers’ operation risk information in the power supply company. First, the characteristics of operational risk information are analyzed from different dimension features, and various visual elements which are applicable to different risk factors are summarized. On the basis of the first step, combined with the diversified characteristics of large consumers’ risk information, two modified risk visual elements, Heatmap and Treemap, are designed. Finally, the visualization schemes of large consumers’ operational risk information are proposed by instance. Results show that administrators can timely discover and recognize large consumers’ operational risks from these schemes, which effectively improved risk visualization and early warning capabilities.</jats:p>"

Although attention is usually paid to Fe (hydr)oxides as major sources of available Fe, Fe-bearing clay minerals are typically the dominant phase in mineral dust. The mineralogy and chemistry of clay minerals in dust particles, however, are largely unknown. We conducted microscopic identification and chemical analysis of the clay minerals in Asian and Saharan dust particles. Cross-sectional slices of dust particles were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) techniques and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). TEM images of FIB slices revealed that clay minerals occurred as either nano-thin platelets or relatively thick plates. Chemical compositions and lattice fringes of the nano-thin platelets suggested that they included illite, smectite, illite–smectite mixed layers, and their nanoscale mixtures (illite–smectite series clay minerals, ISCMs) which could not be resolved with an electron microbeam. EDXS chemical analysis of the clay mineral grains revealed that the average Fe content was 5.8% in nano-thin ISCM platelets assuming 14% H2O, while the Fe content of illite and chlorite was 2.8 and 14.8%, respectively. In addition, TEM and EDXS analyses were performed on clay mineral grains dispersed and loaded on micro-grids. The average Fe content of clay mineral grains was 6.7 and 5.4% in Asian and Saharan dusts, respectively. A comparative X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk dusts showed that Saharan dust was more enriched in clay minerals than Asian dust, while Asian dust was more enriched in chlorite. Clay minerals, in particular nanocrystalline ISCMs and Fe-rich chlorite, are probably important sources of Fe to remote marine ecosystems. Further detailed analyses of the mineralogy and chemistry of clay minerals in global mineral dusts are required to evaluate the inputs of Fe to surface ocean microbial communities.\n                    </jats:p>"

MRC enables efficient wireless power transfer over middle‐range transfer distances. MRC for wireless power transfer should operate at a high frequency in the industry science medical band, such as 13.56 MHz, because the size of the transfer device decreases at higher transfer frequencies. Therefore, the output frequency of the power supply on the transmitting side should be 13.56 MHz. In addition, the rectifier on the receiving side is operated at a high frequency. This paper focuses on the reflected power in the power supply and rectifiers. Thus, the parametric design method is clarified for the power supply, including a low‐pass filter to match the output, the impedance of the power supply with the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. In addition, the effects on the rectifiers of silicon carbide and gallium nitride diodes are confirmed by performing an experiment and a loss analysis.</jats:p>",

Storage proteins account for more than half of the total protein in mature cereal grains and have important impacts on their nutritional quality for humans and livestock and on their functional properties in food processing. Gluten proteins - gliadins and glutenins of wheat determine the quality of the grain for breadmaking and their amount and composition can be influenced by agronomic impacts leading to changes in dough properties and that of baking quality.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Recently, the emphasis on health human resources (HHR) planning has shifted away from a utilization‐based approach toward a needs‐based one in which planning is based on the projected health needs of the population. However, needs‐based models that are currently in use rely on a definition of ‘needs’ that include only the medical circumstances of individuals and not personal preferences or other socio‐economic factors. We examine whether planning based on such a narrow definition will maximize social welfare. We show that, in a publicly funded healthcare system, if the planner seeks to meet the aggregate need without taking utilization into consideration, then oversupply of HHR is likely because ‘needs’ do not necessarily translate into ‘usage.’ Our result suggests that HHR planning should track the healthcare system as access gradually improves because, even if health care is fully accessible, individuals may not fully utilize it to the degree prescribed by their medical circumstances.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fragmented state of the construction industry is a global phenomenon visible in South African construction. The number of parties to a construction project has been on the upward trend in recent times. This increase in the number of members of a typical construction supply chain is invariably accompanied by an increase in management complexity. To counter the pitfalls of such complexities, the discipline has witnessed the proliferation of supply chain management (SCM) concepts of which integration is a notable aspect. Based on a succinct conceptual framework that was derived from the construction SCM literature, this paper reports on barriers to supply chain integration. A questionnaire was distributed among the participants of two South African projects. The responses indicate that lack of integration is partly responsible for performance-related failures in the form of rework and defects. Moreover, poor payment mechanisms between contractors, their subcontractors, and suppliers tend to work against nurturing long-term relationships on a project and business basis. The conclusion is that there is major scope for promoting a collaborative working approach between supply chain partners in South African construction. </jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, one essential problem is dealt with: The frequencies of the components caused by the DE in the stator current spectrum are similar to some of the frequencies introduced by the unbalanced voltages. Thus, the present paper attempts to explain, analytically, experimentally and by simulation, the generation process of all frequency components that are a function of the unbalanced voltages and the DE. For that reason, a detailed analytical study for three-phase induction motor working with DE is performed. First, an analytical expression for the mutual inductances between stator phases and rotor loops under DE is derived using mixture of winding function and Fourier series approach. Then, both theoretical and simulation studies are presented in order to show how the stator current is influenced by the simultaneous presence of DE eccentricity and unbalance supply voltages. Finally, experimental results have been presented to validate the analytical and simulation results. </jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper examines variables that affect a project champion's ability to gain this commitment from colleagues.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the huge potential benefits of radio frequency identification (RFID) in collaborative use with transaction partners, many companies are reluctant to implement RFID with their partners and skeptical of its strategic value in inter-firm, supply chain networks. However, existing research is concentrated on the internal adoption and benefit measurement of RFID system, without careful consideration of the strategic value in an inter-organizational context at implementation stage. Hence, this study empirically identifies the reciprocal strategic value of RFID implementation in inter-firm, supply chain networks based on the resource-based theory and social capital theory. Additionally, mutual quality constructs of RFID system from an inter-organizational context are investigated as determinants of the strategic value. Empirical results have shown that supply chain visibility and agility are improved through high-level, shared information quality and inter-organizational system quality of RFID. Inter-organizational trust is enhanced by high-level, inter-organizational service quality and supply chain agility. Moreover, all strategic values of RFID (visibility, agility, and trust), when enhanced by RFID, have positive impacts on supply chain performance. This study expands the discussion scope of RFID to the implementation stage at the inter-firm level beyond the internal adoption level, improving the delay of RFID diffusion among transaction partners. Furthermore, the study describes strategic points that can be used to maximize the RFID value in supply chain networks. </jats:p>",

It is either determined by the preferences of one of the partners only (Husband Dictatorship or Wife Dictatorship), or by both spouses’ preferences, in which case each partner’s influence depends on the relative wage rates (Split Might). The model is illustrated empirically using a sample drawn from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) where expenditures on children’s goods are a public good in both spouses’ preferences. It turns out that the spending pattern reflects the husband’s preferences in about 54% of the couples in our sample. Still, in about 45% of the households, the wife acts as a dictator. Somewhat less than 1% of the couples is characterized by a split might regime.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>JEL-classification</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n                <jats:p>D11; D12; D13.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The role played by the texture of the sediment supply on channel bed adjustments in gravel‐bed rivers is poorly understood. To address this issue, an experimental campaign has been designed. Flume experiments lasting 96 h in a 9 m long, 0.60 m wide have been performed with different sand‐gravel mixtures as feed textures. The response of the surface texture has been found to be highly dependent on the grain size distribution of the feed. When the feed texture included gravel, the finest fractions of the sediment supply infiltrate beneath the surface. Conversely, sand remains on the surface when the feed texture lacks gravel. This different textural response becomes obscured when water discharge increases. Further, the sediment transport rate approaches the feed rate differently depending on the content of gravel in the feed texture. When a small proportion of gravel is part of the feed texture, bed load transport rate asymptotically approaches the feed rate. However, when a significant fraction of gravel is part of the feed grain size distribution, bed load transport rate approaches the feed rate by following an oscillatory path. These findings have been verified in terms of a one‐dimensional numerical model. This modeling reveals that the higher the differences in mobility among the grain sizes contained in the feed texture, the more evident is the nonasymptotic transient trend toward equilibrium.</jats:p>",

A large proportion of this work is funded by “earmarked” donations, since donors often exhibit a preference for the programs they are willing to fund. From extensive research involving qualitative descriptions and quantitative data, and applying system dynamics methodology, we model vehicle supply chains (VSCs) in support of humanitarian field operations. Our efforts encompass the often‐overlooked decentralized environment by incorporating the three different VSC structures that IHOs operate, as well as examining the entire mix of development and disaster response programs, and the specific (and virtually unexplored) effects of earmarked funding. Our results suggest that earmarked funding causes a real—and negative—operational impact on humanitarian disaster response programs in a decentralized setting. </jats:p>",

Many studies have been conducted to investigate the factors affecting nitrate load in surface and subsurface flow. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the various factors affecting nitrate transport using principal component analysis (PCA) and nearest neighborhood analysis methods. Hydrological and biogeochemical data from a small (&amp;lt;500 km2) agricultural watershed in east central Illinois, USA for the duration of 10 years have been used in this study. The PCA approach divided various factors that influence nitrate transport into three principal components. The first component contained air temperature, cover phenotype, evapotranspiration, cover factor and dry mass factors. The second component contained precipitation and flow, which was defined as the hydrologic component. The third component included tillage practices and nitrogen application and was termed the anthropogenic component. The results from the PCA approach suggested all three components had significant influence on nitrate transportation and transformation. Among these three components, the hydrological components had the highest contribution on both surface and subsurface nitrate load. The nearest neighborhood analysis yielded a similar conclusion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article studies the impact of modular assembly on supply chain efficiency. In the modular assembly approach, a manufacturer acquires pre‐assembled modules from its suppliers, rather than the individual components, as in the traditional assembly approach. We analyze the competitive behavior of a two‐stage modular assembly system consisting of a manufacturer, and a supplier who pre‐assembles two components into a module. The firms can choose their own inventory policies and we show the existence of Nash equilibrium in the inventory game. Moving from the traditional to the modular approach has a twofold effect on the supply chain. First, we investigate the effect of centralizing the component suppliers. It can be shown that when there is no production time shift, the module supplier always holds more component inventories than suppliers do in the traditional approach, which yields a lower cost for the manufacturer. However, the suppliers, and therefore the supply chain may incur a higher cost in the modular approach. Second, we study the effect of a shift in production time from the manufacturing stage to the supplier stage. From numerical studies, it has been found that such a lead time shift always benefits a centralized supply chain, but not necessarily so for a decentralized system. Combining the two effects, we find that the modular approach generally reduces the cost to the manufacturer and the supply chain, which explains the prevalence of modular assembly from the perspective of inventory management. These results also provide some insight into how firms can improve supply chain efficiency by choosing the right decision structure and lead time configuration. </jats:p>",

We investigate the behavior of the supply chain under centralized, manufacturer Stackelberg, conditional manufacturer Stackelberg, retailer Stackelberg, conditional retailer Stackelberg, and vertical Nash model structure. The nature of the above models provides great insights to a firm's manager for achieving optimal strategy in a competitive marketing system. Quite often, not all items produced in a firm are of perfect quality; some are perfect (conforming) quality and others are imperfect (nonconforming) quality. The nonconforming products are sold in a secondary shop or by other retailers. The procurement cost of finished products depends on the quality of the products due to more investment in advanced technology, better raw materials, and skilled labor, etc. The warranty policy for the products is also imposed to attract the customers to buy more. Here, both members (manufacturer and retailer) jointly share the cost of the warranty policy. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal selling price and promotional effort of the retailer, while the optimal wholesale price and quality of the products are determined by the manufacturer so that the above strategies are maximized. Finally, numerical examples with sensitivity analysis of the key parameters are illustrated to investigate the proposed model.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, except for SI, LSR and IT have significant effects on SCP through LI establishing the mediating role of LI. The paper also finds that SCC has a significant effect on SCP. Further, when countries are considered individually the paper finds that IT has a significant indirect effect on SCP in the case of all the countries while LSR has a significant indirect effect on SCP, both in the case of Brazil and Korea. Additionally, in the case of Korea SI has a significant indirect effect on SCP.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Like other survey-based research, the findings of this paper are also limited by the sample size.

For frontline logistics employees (FLEs) of manufacturing firms who are delivering and marketing products in retail stores daily, the ability to understand both the marketing and supply implications of their actions is essential. Despite the importance of cross‐functional integration at the retail frontline, little logistics research has explored how logistics frontline employees interact with managers and each other to integrate knowledge and information. The purpose of this research is to examine the antecedents to cross‐functional integration across demand and supply functions in multiple social networks of the FLE. Mixed methods, including social network analysis, structural equation modeling, and analysis of variance, are applied to test social capital theory hypotheses regarding the impact of relational embeddedness and social mechanisms, socialization and shared interpretation, on individual demand and supply integration across friendship, key enabler, and ideation networks of the frontline employee.</jats:p>",

We introduce the sources of demand for certification and supply chain standards and the political and economic context in which they have expanded since the 1990s. We explore how various agrifood certification and supply chain standards have been used to achieve changes in production methods and/or in product attributes to meet social goals, and we discuss the prospects for applying these models to commodity crops. We conclude that the nature of corn and soybean production, distribution, and consumption—with numerous sales outlets and invisible consumption as part of processed foods and other products—makes certification schemes to limit agricultural pollution unrealistic and supply chain standards extremely challenging. </jats:p>",

There could be several driving forces, including competitive pressure, regulatory pressure, etc., but there exist certain pre-requisites such as the level of employee engagement with the environment attitude. When these characteristics are deeply rooted in the organizational culture, they may help improve the GSCM practices in the organization. In this connection, this article aims to investigate GSCM practices of the automobile industry in India and also examines the moderating role of environment attitude in the employees’ engagement to understand whether it leads to an improvement in the GSCM practices. This study is important because there is no empirical research evidence on how the interaction between environment attitude and the employees’ engagement in the automobile industry alters GSCM practices. </jats:p>",

This method, based on statistical models, allows the estimation of THM concentration by monitoring parameters whose determination is direct and easy, and therefore, THM presence can be carried out in real-time. These parameters values are introduced in a multiple regression model resulting in the concentration of THMs levels. This model has taken into account parameters compulsory in water quality analysis and it has been shown that six parameters are enough to determine accurately THM concentration. In addition, the feasibility of a low-cost device that directly gives THM concentration is demonstrated. This device can be easily designed to be transported to different points of the water supply network where it is intended to make control campaigns.</jats:p>"

Unlike mesh and cross link that reduce clock skew uncertainty by multiple driving paths, our focus is on controlling skew uncertainty in the structure of the tree. We observe that slow slew amplifies supply voltage variation, which induces larger path delay variation and skew uncertainty. To obtain the optimality, we formulate a symmetric clock tree synthesis as a mathematical programming problem in which the slew effect is considered by an NLDM-like cell delay variation model. A symmetry-to-asymmetry tree transformation is proposed to further reduce wire loading. Experimental results show that the proposed four methods save up to 20% of clock tree capacitance loading. Beyond controlling slew to suppress supply-voltage-variation-induced skew, we also discuss the strategies of clock tree synthesis under variant variation scenarios and the limitations of the ISPD 2010 benchmark.</jats:p>",

When a manufacturer uses a retailer as a channel for reaching end customers, the advertising strategy takes on an additional dimension: which party will perform the advertising to end customers. Cost sharing (“co‐operative advertising”) arrangements proliferate the option by decoupling the execution of the advertising from its funding. We examine the efficacy of cost sharing in a model of two competing manufacturer–retailer supply chains who sell partially substitutable products that may differ in market size. Some counterintuitive findings suggest that the firms performing the advertising would rather bear the costs entirely if this protects their unit profit margin. We also evaluate the implications of advertising strategy for overall supply chain efficiency and consumer welfare. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to present and apply an original assessment of quality, safety and environmental effects due to the international distribution of food products via different container solutions.

PW is potentially a valuable water resource particularly there where the ramp up of oil production puts further strains on water and the environment in an area already having severe water shortages. PW should therefore be seen as part of the country's strategic water reserves rather than as effluent. This study gives first estimates of anticipated PW volumes correlated to peak oil production and water consumption needs with time up to 2035. At least a fivefold increase of PW within the next two decades relative to the current 1 Mbbl/d can be anticipated. The estimated PW quantity before 2030 represents nearly a third of water injection or salt-tolerant plant irrigation needs. These quantities and the chemical composition of PW from these fields indicate that quality standards for these purposes can be technically attained and sustained for use in Basrah.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two related problems are integrated in this paper, the first is the targeting problem and another is production/inventory decisions in a supply chain. The supply chain under consideration consists of a supplier of raw material, a single producer, and multiple newsvendors. The producer can adjust the process mean before starting the production run. Once set to a certain target value, the process mean is not changed until the production lot is completed. At the end of a production run, the producer screens the lot and uses specification limits to evaluate the quality of the item. Nonconforming items are scrapped with no salvage value; however, conforming items are delivered to newsvendors who are subjected to random demand. If demand on a newsvendor in a season is lower than anticipated, surplus items will be returned to the producer at a certain transportation cost. We first develop a mathematical model that maximizes the expected total profit of the supply chain. Then, a table for two special functions is devised to simplify the solution method and is used to find the optimal solution of the proposed model. We also study the significance of this integration by comparing the performance of the proposed model with an independent model where the process mean selection and lot‐sizing decisions are found separately.</jats:p>",

To accommodate such uncertainties, a direct adaptive controller based on a two-layer NN is introduced to maintain the desired supply air temperature under varying operating conditions. To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, extensive experiments have been conducted on a pilot HVAC system. The experimental results substantiate that our method outperforms a conventional proportional–integral–derivative controller in terms of promptness to changing working conditions and robustness to external disturbances. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Informal community‐based supply, characterised by abstractions from surface water and shallow wells, is the main water supply source in the urban areas of developing nations. Formal sector supply has failed to extend their services to many urban areas yet the formal sector continues to view these community‐based practices as small‐scale, traditional and ‘backward’, and ones that must be eradicated from urban areas. While the formal sector continues to idealise the notion of the ‘modern infrastructure ideal’, based solely upon the expansion of piping networks, this paper argues against this ideal, instead presenting an opportunity for ‘institutional bricolage’ between the formal sector and the techniques that have arisen as a part of informal community‐based water supply in developing nations. Based on interview and questionnaire data, this paper uses the city of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N</jats:styled-content>dola, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">Z</jats:styled-content>ambia to demonstrate the resilience that has arisen within communities as a response to the failure of the formal sector, and hence the value of informal supply systems in the future water provisioning policies for developing cities. Informal supply is abundant in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N</jats:styled-content>dola and local communities have taken their pre‐existing rural customs and adapted these to provide water in the urban context; so that hand dug shallow wells now dominate supply. These practices have been successful in providing daily water, however, challenges remain, for example ensuring safe water quality with appropriate well protection. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">H</jats:styled-content>erein lies the opportunity for the formal sector to become involved in informal community‐based supply; instead of aiming to marginalise the residents of informal areas out of urban centres, the formal sector should adopt and better support the techniques used in informal areas, for example, through well protection education and provision of resources, to help in achieving the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MDG</jats:styled-content> for safe water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The main purpose of this study is to propose a multi-criteria model for selection of end-of-life electronic products (e-waste) collection system in a reverse supply chain. The pertinent criteria for such decision analysis and selection are determined through an extensive literature review and a questionnaire survey method. On collection systems, a few alternatives are considered for evaluation. Subsequently, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process rating method is used to evaluate the priorities of the criteria and the alternatives. Finally, global weights of the criteria and evaluation score of the alternatives are combined to get the final ranking of the collection systems evaluated. The result demonstrates the relative importance of the criteria for evaluating the alternative collection systems. Also, a real application substantiates the preference of collection system(s) to be selected. The use of this newly proposed fuzzy analytical hierarchy process analytical model indicates that decision-makers can use it to determine the appropriate collection system(s) from a set of available options in a given place or country, where cultural and other parameters are varied. Moreover, this model guides the decision process to be systematic and helps reduce considerable amount of efforts needed conventionally by using the criteria weights generated by fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach. </jats:p>",

This study developed a fed batch bioprocess using glucose as sole carbon and energy source for the HCD of the well described biocatalyst <jats:italic>Pseudomonas putida</jats:italic> KT2440 without the supply of oxygen enriched air. Growth kinetics data from batch fermentations were used for building a bioprocess model and designing feeding strategies. An exponential followed by linearly increasing feeding strategy of glucose was found to be effective in maintaining biomass productivity while also delaying the onset of dissolved oxygen (supplied via compressed air) limitation. A final cell dry weight (CDW) of 102 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> was achieved in 33 h with a biomass productivity of 3.1 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> which are the highest ever reported values for <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> strains using glucose without the supply of pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air. The usefulness of the biomass as a biocatalyst was demonstrated through the production of the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). When nonanoic acid (NA) was supplied to the glucose grown cells of <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> KT2440, it accumulated 32% of CDW as PHA in 11 h (2.85 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) resulting in a total of 0.56 kg of PHA in 18 L with a yield of 0.56 g PHA g NA<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

Optimal postnatal nutrient supply is essential to limit growth restriction and ensure adequate growth and neurodevelopment. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We compared an enhanced postnatal nutrient supply to a standard supply and evaluated the effects on growth velocity, head circumference growth and cerebral maturation - the latter by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized increased growth velocity, head circumference growth and decreased mean diffusivity (MD) in cerebral white matter (WM) areas, suggesting improved cerebral maturation among infants on the enhanced nutrient supply. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In this randomized controlled trial, infants on the enhanced nutrient supply received increased amounts of energy, protein, fat, essential fatty acids and vitamin A until discharge. DTI was performed close to term equivalent age. Outcomes were growth velocity, head circumference growth and WM mean diffusivity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among the 50 included infants, 14 in the intervention group and 11 controls underwent a successful DTI. Infants on the enhanced diet achieved improved growth velocity (16.5 vs. 13.8 g/kg/day, p = 0.01) and increased head circumference (&amp;#x0394;z score: 0.24 vs. -0.12, p = 0.15). A significantly lower MD was seen in a large WM area such as the superior longitudinal fasciculi (1.19 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 1.24 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, p = 0.04, adjusted for age when scanned). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Enhanced nutrient supply to VLBW infants is associated with improved growth velocity, increased head circumference growth and decreased regional WM mean diffusivity, suggesting improved maturation of cerebral connective tracts.</jats:p>"

Although plasticity in response to food is still present in older flies, it is unknown how sustained environmental variation affects life‐history traits. Here, we explore how such life‐long fluctuations of food supply affect weight and survival in groups of flies and affect weight, survival and reproduction in individual flies. In both experiments, we kept adults on constant high or low food and compared these to flies that experienced fluctuations of food either once or twice a week. For these ‘yoyo’ groups, the initial food level and the duration of the dietary variation differed during adulthood, creating four ‘yoyo’ fly groups. In groups of flies, survival and weight were affected by adult food. However, for individuals, survival and reproduction, but not weight, were affected by adult food, indicating that single and group housing of female flies affects life‐history trajectories. Remarkably, both the manner and extent to which life‐history traits varied in relation to food depended on whether flies initially experienced high or low food after eclosion. We therefore conclude that the expression of life‐history traits in adult life is affected not only by adult plasticity, but also by early adult life experiences. This is an important but often overlooked factor in studies of life‐history evolution and may explain variation in life‐history experiments.</jats:p>",

Current research on return contracts assumes suppliers are responsible for all surplus products. In practice, retailers tend to order more than necessary and leave suppliers with large after‐season returns. To mitigate the problem, a new type of return contract with a threshold ordering quantity has been developed by some enterprises. Under these contracts, suppliers specify a threshold for retailers’ ordering quantity. They buy back only the portion in excess of the threshold. In this paper, we show that this new type of contract can achieve two objectives: (a) the supply chain is coordinated, and (b) both the supplier and the retailer can gain more profit than they can gain under a wholesale‐price‐only contract. The new contract does not require any manipulation of wholesale prices. This makes it more acceptable in practice by supply chain members. We also illustrate our findings in a numerical example.</jats:p>",
