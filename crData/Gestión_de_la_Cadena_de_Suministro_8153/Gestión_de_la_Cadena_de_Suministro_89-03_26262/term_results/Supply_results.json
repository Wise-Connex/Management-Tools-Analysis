All cultures with a given Si: P supply ratio received the same time‐averaged supply of Si and P. The Si: P supply ratio had a strong effect on the species composition of the algae.

Diatom species showed differentiation in their ability to compete for Si and P. On average, algal cells became smaller as the Si: P supply ratio decreased.

The development of a consistent framework that establishes a likely projection of future energy supply and demand is critical to this planning process. This framework is called the GRI Baseline Projection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Overall, the 1988 GRI Baseline Projection indicates that U.S. gas production can be held stable over the next 25 years as a result of incremental production of gas in the lower-48 using new technologies and production practices and the introduction of Alaskan gas into lower-48 markets. In the 1988 GRI Baseline Projection, detailed sensitivity analyses were made of the effects on this gas supply outlook arising from significant changes in the outlook for oil prices or the demand for gas, such as might be expected should environmental policy decisions encourage gas consumption.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>These sensitivity analyses lead to some interesting observations. The linkage between oil and gas prices may not be as strong as past experience has indicated. That is, while gas prices will follow oil prices down, they will not necessarily follow oil prices up. Return to gas demand levels comparable to the peak level of the early 1970s will require a substantial increase in gas imports. New gas supplies must be viewed from three perspectives: cost, location relative to gas demand, and the incremental unit size at which the new sources are introduced into the U.S. gas supply slate.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the relationship between timber supply—in the sense of whether to bring harvest to the market now or in the future—and various forest taxes is analyzed by using an intertemporal consumption-savings model, which is extended to allow for harvesting decisions. In the presence of perfect capital markets and certainty, harvesting decisions of nonindustrial forest owners are independent from their consumption preferences. However, under future timber price uncertainty and risk aversion, harvesting decisions depend on the consumption preferences of forest owners. The implications of this nonseparability between consumption and harvesting decisions are developed for various individual forest taxes as well as for various changes in the structure of forest taxes, which will keep the government's tax revenue constant. Due to the nonseparability, harvest responses to changes in tax rates and in the structure of taxes may differ considerably from those under certainty. For. Sci. 35(1): 137-159.</jats:p>",

The implications of this nonseparability between consumption and harvesting decisions under credit rationing are developed for various individual forest taxes as well as for various changes in the structure of forest taxes, which will keep the government's tax revenues constant. The importance of credit rationing lies in the fact that the distribution of revenues between the current and future period affects harvesting decisions.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper surveys the literature on agricultural supply response to prices in developing countries. Empirical estimates of elasticities depend both on the methodology adopted and on country‐specific factors relating to technology, economic structure and macro constraints. The paper seeks to establish some general conclusions on supply responsiveness within these limitations. Supply response to output prices at the aggregate and at the crop levels is considered first. Crop‐specific acreage elasticities range between zero and 0.8 in the short run while long‐run elasticities tend to be higher — between 0.3 and 1.2. Yield elasticities are smaller and less stable than acreage elasticities. Clearly, inter‐crop pricing can be relied upon to effect shifts in the commodity composition of agricultural output. Evidence also suggests that supply elasticities vary systematically with such factors as price and yield risks, multiple‐cropping, the importance of the crop, farm incomes, farm size, tenancy and literacy. The most controversial and important aspect of supply response is the effect on aggregate agricultural output of agriculture's terms of trade. Conventional time‐series estimates range from 0.1 to 0.3. A major cross‐country study reports an aggregate elasticity as high as 1.66. It is argued that cross‐country estimates are apt to exaggerate aggregate responsiveness while time‐series studies underestimate it somewhat. For LDCs, a tentative range of 0.4 to 0.5 seems plausible. Hence, the distributive effects of the terms of trade are likely to be more significant than the allocative effects. Asian evidence shows that only a third of the inter‐country differences in fertilizer use can be attributed to fertilizer price policies. Provided new technologies and infrastructure are in place, fertilizer subsidies can help in technology diffusion and in overcoming credit constraints. The choice between price supports and input subsidies will depend on a variety of country‐ or situation‐specific factors. Nevertheless, a significant general factor favoring price supports is that they can more easily be coupled with price stabilization goals than input subsidies. Though sparse, the available evidence on the response of marketed surplus suggests that price policy is not a reliable instrument for regulating inter‐sectoral trade.</jats:p>",

The semi-free market environment that existed prior to 1973 has long since disappeared. The political and economic situation of the world is becoming even more complex and unpredictable, resulting in greater uncertainties in commodity prices in general and petroleum products in particular. In the last two years we have seen wild fluctuations in oil prices that ranged anywhere between $30 per barrel to $9 per barrel. These sharp cycles in prices have made it virtually impossible to predict the next price cycle, which makes forecasting future exploration, drilling and production almost a futile excerise.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The prospect of a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq has pushed oil futures higher due to the belief that such a ceasefire would lead to greater cooperation within OPEC. The contention that the oil prices would increase as a result of the ceasefire is speculative in nature and does not take into consideration factors such as production history, reserves and a possible economic slowdown in the Western economies following the present expansion.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, production and reserve figures were examined for OPEC in general and Iran-Iraq in particular.

Surveys additional to this study confirmed that enteroviruses and pathogenic bacteria (as defined by EC directives) were absent, consistent with the general absence of coliforms. Fixed points were sampled regularly for bacteriological analysis and for relevant physical and chemical parameters. Heterotrophic plate counts were carried out using standard methods and a study was conducted to test alternative techniques. It was found that bacterial regrowth occurred close to the treatment works and longer retention resulted in little increase in plate counts. Monochloramine residuals of 0.26mg/l or less did not prevent regrowth. The assimilable organic carbon concentration decreased through the distribution system and increased following booster chlorination. Plate counts showed a seasonal pattern peaking in the spring and autumn and decreasing in the summer and winter. The predominant genera of bacteria were Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes and Aeromonas with maximum counts of 17,000, 23,000 and 1,700 CFU/ml respectively. Heterotrophic plate counts using the R2A medium, spread plate method and 7 day incubation period were on average 190 times greater than counts using the UK standard method.

Water samples from Omi-ebo stream were taken from two types of sites viz: undisturbed surface water and agitated water from the stream edge and areas of decaying organic matter. The total bacterial count and coliform density of the agitated water were higher than those of the undisturbed surface water indicating that most of the micro-organisms are associated with decomposing organic matter. The coliform density (MPN method) and the total bacteria count showed gross faecal contamination of this water source. Isolation of E. coli type I and the presence of Clostridium melchii pointed to recent faecal and_remote pollution of this source. The presence of other heterotrophic bacteria with varying pigmentations was noted. The pipe-borne water samples indicated some degree of faecal pollution and did not meet the WHO standards for potable water. The baseline data suggest that the water supply sources io this community do not meet the acceptable standard.

It is argued that initially the kings of Dahomey sought to operate the slave trade as a royal monopoly, and relied exclusively upon slave-raiding rather than purchasing slaves from the interior. From the mid-eighteenth century, however, Dahomey did seek to operate as a ‘ middleman’ in the supply of slaves from the interior, and since its kings did not normally attempt to control this aspect of the trade this involved the emergence of a private sector in the slave trade. Although merchants in Dahomey were in origin state officials, licensed to trade on behalf of the king or ‘caboceers’ (chiefs), they subsequently acquired the right to trade on their own account also and thus became in some measure independent of the state structure. The autonomy and wealth of the merchant community in Dahomey were further enhanced by the transition from slave to palm oil exports in the nineteenth century, when leading merchants moved into large-scale oil production, using slave labour supplied by the king. There were recurrent tensions between the monarchy and the merchants over commercial policy and over the monarchy's expropriatory fiscal practices, and the conflict of interests between the two was exacerbated by the development of the oil trade, undermining the solidarity of Dahomey in the face of the European imperialism of the late nineteenth century.</jats:p>",

Anesthetized, open-chest dogs were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis that produced significant epicardial S-T segment elevation (12 mV) only when superimposed on atrial pacing. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined using radioactive microspheres, and O2 consumption was determined by measuring O2 saturation of venous blood draining the ischemic region. The dogs were treated with saline or 0.2 mg/kg + 0.2 mg/kg/hr SQ 29,548, and the effect on ischemia was determined during 5-minute pacing-induced ischemic episodes at 10, 40, and 70 minutes postdrug or saline treatment. SQ 29,548 significantly reduced S-T elevation at 40 and 70 minutes postdrug compared with saline values and at all times measured compared with its paired predrug pace+stenosis values. SQ 29,548 reduced S-T elevation approximately 45% compared with its paired predrug values at 70 minutes. SQ 29,548 resulted in a significantly higher subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio (0.70 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.05) compared with saline-treated animals (0.42 +/- 0.06), with an overall increase of flow to the ischemic region of approximately 40%. This increased flow was matched by a proportional increase in O2 consumption without a change in O2 extraction. The O2 supply/consumption balance was also unchanged by SQ 29,548 implying that despite the increase in blood flow, the ischemic region was still flow-limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lack of nutrients triggers a pleiotropic response characterized by accumulation of storage carbohydrates, early G1 arrest, and sporulation of a/alpha diploids. This response is thought to be mediated by RAS proteins, adenylate cyclase, and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinases. This study shows that expression of the S. cerevisiae gene coding for a cytoplasmic catalase T (CTT1) is controlled by this pathway: it is regulated by the availability of nutrients. Lack of a nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus source causes a high-level expression of the gene. Studies with strains with mutations in the RAS-cAMP pathway and supplementation of a rca1 mutant with cAMP show that CTT1 expression is under negative control by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and that nutrient control of CTT1 gene expression is mediated by this pathway. Strains containing a CTT1-Escherichia coli lacZ fusion gene have been used to isolate mutants with mutations in the pathway. Mutants characterized in this investigation fall into five complementation groups. Both cdc25 and ras2 alleles were identified among these mutants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past ninety-odd years i.e. ever since the establishment of the first government funded agricultural college, the Department of Agriculture, under its different titles, played an indispensable role in support of agricultural research at tertiary institutions. However, its direct involvement with university faculties was terminated in 1973 when the faculties were fully incorporated into the universities. Undoubtedly the Department has a vital interest in the well-being of tertiary institutions for the training of high level manpower needed to fulfil its research mandate. At present its indirect and direct support of research at university faculties is in the form of researchers seconded and funded for post-graduate studies, the initiation and funding of research contracts by university personnel and the recent expansion of its facility for research fellowships aimed at closer cooperation with and support for tertiary institutions.</jats:p>"

Howe (Caulerpales) grown under several N addition regimes were determined by perturbation and continuous mode techniques, and as N demand, by the product of growth rate and tissue N. Uptake rates are reported as the slope of rate vs. concentration curves in each case. N uptake rates of <jats:italic>U. curvata</jats:italic> were inversely correlated with tissue N and affected only slightly by temperature. There was no correlation of N uptake rate with tissue N in <jats:italic>C. decorticatum.</jats:italic> N uptake rates of <jats:italic>C. decorticatum</jats:italic> were affected by temperature but to a lesser degree than were growth rates. Neither N addition per se nor light affected N uptake capacity of either species. The proximal mechanism for seaweeds accumulation of N at low light and temperatures may be that N uptake is less limited by light and temperature than is growth. This in turn may partially compensate for the effects of reduced light and temperature on growth by increasing pigment and enzyme levels. Perturbation uptake rates were higher than continuous mode or N demand rates in <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic> but not in <jats:italic>Codium.</jats:italic> N uptake rates of <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic> were higher than those of <jats:italic>Codium,</jats:italic> but N storage capacities were lower. These two observations suggest that <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic> experiences a fundamentally more variable N supply than does <jats:italic>Codium.</jats:italic> This is consistent with the clarification of <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic> as an ephemeral form and of <jats:italic>Codium</jats:italic> as persistent. A seaweed's functional form therefore appears to influence the spectrum of resource variability available to it as well as its ability to persist in the environment.</jats:p>",
