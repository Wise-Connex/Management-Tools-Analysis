The present study was performed first to examine whether a maximal decline in coronary sinus (CS) oxygen content was reached during hypocapnia. During hypercapnia a myocardial \"over perfusion\" has been demonstrated. The second purpose of the present study was to examine whether a myocardial \"over perfusion\" is essential to maintain a sufficient myocardial tissue oxygen supply during hypercapnia. Closed-chest dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital and hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation. Nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide could both be added to the inspiratory gas to create arterial hypoxemia (arterial So<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> 65%) and hypercapnia, respectively. Arterial hypoxemia during hypocapnia increased myocardial blood flow (MBF) by 50%, while CS So<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decreased significantly. The decrease in CS So<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> demonstrates a reserve capacity of myocardial oxygen extraction during hypocapnia, thereby ruling out any major coronary vasoconstriction during hypocapnia. Hypercapnia during normoxemia increased MBF, myocardial oxygen delivery, and CS So<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> substantially, but this was not observed when hypercapnia was created during arterial hypoxemia. From the present results we conclude that hypocapnia does not cause any major coronary vasoconstriction, while hypercapnia results in a myocardial \"over perfusion,\" which is a luxury perfusion not essential to maintain sufficient myocardial oxygen supply during hypercapnia. </jats:p>",

Each reach contained a deep, fast‐flowing chute leading to an area of diverging, shallow flow which contained a middle bar. The measurements are self‐consistent, and indicate that, where flow is concentrated in a deep chute, shear stress is high, but where flow diverges, depth, slope and shear stress decrease. In the first survey, the bed was scoured in the chute and sediment transport rates were high, but where flow diverged sediment transport rate decreased. It appears that deposition leads to bar growth, bar growth in turn reduces slope and depth, deposition is encouraged, and the bar continues to grow vertically, laterally and upstream. In the second survey no sediment transport was observed, despite hydraulic conditions very similar to the first survey. The absence of sediment transport is attributed to the cessation of sediment supply to the river channel.</jats:p>",

However, fuel expenditures by the Liberian Electricity Corporation (LEC) for its rural public stations represent a major and growing burden on the financially hard‐pressed utility. In this paper we evaluate the economics of supplying wood to rural electric power plants utilizing different sources of feedstock. We also evaluate the cost implications of differences in wood supply requirements based on the use of steam or gasifier technology, and from variation in plant utilization level.</jats:p><jats:p>The wood supply we consider as sources are: (1) retired rubber trees; (2) the harvesting of secondary‐growth forest just before the land is returned to temporary cultivation; (3) the establishment of commercial short‐rotation wood energy plantations; and (4) adding to the system of shifting agriculture the planting of fast‐growing wood species. The results indicate that wood can probably be supplied under a wide range of supply and demand conditions for US$1.00–1.70 per GJ. We estimate that wood steam plants can generate power for about $0.09‐0.14 per kWh and gasifier plants for $0.10‐0.18 per kWh. These costs are well below the present cost of oil‐based rural electric power generation in Liberia (about $0.20–0.27 per kWh).</jats:p>",
