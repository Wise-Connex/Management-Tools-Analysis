      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Groundwater is effluent in regions of discontinuous permafrost in the Interior Plains and the Cordillera. Groundwater flow in the Precambrian Shield is considered to be negligible. Winter baseflow records, chemical analyses of river waters, the presence of\nsprings, and the local occurrence of halophytic flora provide evidences of groundwater movement in regions where no piezometric data from borings are available. Quantitative information on the groundwater contribution to the Upper Liard basin is obtained from the relation between discharge and\nspecific conductance. This relation could be used elsewhere if more data were available. Several thermal springs in the Cordillera derive their heat from deep circulation of meteoric waters. The heating of meteoric waters by an exothermic reaction with sulphides in rock may contribute heat to water\nin two springs discharging sulphate waters. Groundwater is available for domestic and community supplies in the glaciated valleys in the Cordillera and in alluvium in other regions. It is used or can be used in many settlements and towns. Whitehorse and Dawson are the largest towns with well\nfields.</jats:p>"

The rostral hypophysial arteries arose bilaterally from the arterial circle of the cerebrum, while the caudal hypophysial arteries arose from the rete miabile on the dosal and caudal surfaces of the gland. The ramifications of the rostral hypophysial arteries supplied the vascular structures in the hypophysial stalk, which were classified on the basis of their structure into three groups; arborization forms, spike forms, and capillary loops. These structures drained into large portal vessels leading to the pars distalis. The pars distalis received a second smaller group of portal vessels from the capillary bed of the lower infundibular stem. The small group of portal vessels was limited in its extent by a well‐developed hypophysial cleft. No direct arterial supply to the pars distalis could be demonstrated. The findings of this study support the view that the blood in the hypophysial portal system flows distally from the hypophysial stalk to the pars distalis.</jats:p>",

Increasing the number of seedlings per hill led to a rise in the number of shoots per plot and this was more pronounced in high than in low plant densities. Significant differences in shoot number between high and low nitrogen plots occurred only at the higher plant density, but high nitrogen and wide spacing led to an increase in the number of shoots per hill and per plant. Increasing the number of seedlings per hill resulted in an increase in the number of shoots per hill but a decrease in the number of shoots per plant. The effects of treatments on leaf blade area at ear emergence and on grain yields were similar to those on shoot number. The percentage increase in the yield of grain per unit area due to increasing the number of seedlings to three and four were 12 and 9 respectively. The percentage shoot mortality was greater in plots with low than with high plant density. Plants were higher in high nitrogen plots, especially at high plant density, while high nitrogen supply and four seedlings per hill increased the number of days from seeding to ear emergence. The former treatment also increased ear length. Low plant density and three seedlings per hill increased the ear to shoot dry weight ratio. The best combination of treatments for high grain yield was high nitrogen, 15 cm x 15 cm spacing, and four seedlings per hill.</jats:p>",
