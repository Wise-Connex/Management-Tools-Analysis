This paper uses the experience of India as a lens through which to view the problems of access to water in urban areas and the various options available for reform. Using two sets of data from the National Family Health Survey, as well as published and unpublished secondary sources, the paper presents the status of access to drinking water in urban India, the performance of India's urban water sector compared to other Asian metropolitan regions and the reform efforts that are under way in several Indian cities. A review of these ongoing reforms illustrates some of the political economy challenges involved in reforming the water sector. Based on this analysis, we draw out directions for more effective research, data collection and policy reform. While each country faces unique challenges and opportunities, the scope and range of the Indian experience provides insights and caveats for many low-income nations.</jats:p>",

The paper describes the goals of the programme, the priorities for the programme, the mechanisms for providing access to digital material acquired by the Library and gives an overview of the approach to ensuring that material stored in the Digital Library System remains permanently accessible.

The reason for this is the ability of the Library to sustain storage and access over a much longer period than can be achieved by commercial companies. The Library has also built up significant expertise and a world leadership in the field of digital preservation. The use of a programme and project structure to manage the development of the infrastructure, processes and procedures has already shown that it can deliver significant benefit in the changing landscape of digital dissemination of information. The use of an iterative and incremental approach both for the programme as a whole and for projects within the programme has shown significant benefits in allowing the BL to make progress where the end goal is very ambitious and there is no obvious off‐the‐shelf solution.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This may have broad applications for similar complex projects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The BL Digital Library Programme is providing a solution to the acquisition and dissemination of digital material on a larger scale than is common within the library and archiving community.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Varying concentrations of SDS-total trihalomethane at any time (SDS-TTHMT) (2.68–85.78 μg/L) were detected in the two simulated water sources. Evaluating the impact of each test variable on attained SDS-TTHMT levels revealed that for both water sources, the majority of samples exhibited higher SDS-TTHMT levels in the presence of higher chlorine doses. For the two sources, 85 to 87.5 percent of the sample pairs exhibited higher SDS-TTHMT levels at higher incubation temperatures. Incubation periods at which maximum THM levels were attained varied with water source type as well as pH values. All comparable samples exhibited SDS-TTHMT values higher (1.41 and 7.07 folds) than actual surveyed TTHM levels. Statistically, SDST-TTHM showed significant correlations with applied chlorine dose at the 0.05 level, and with TOC, bromides, contact time, and temperature at the 0.01 level. The predictive model, formulated using multiple regression approaches, exhibiting the highest coefficients of determination was logarithmic for the laboratory simulated THM database (r2=0.70; p&amp;lt;0.001) with a very high significance level (&amp;lt;0.01 level).</jats:p>",

Auf Grund sinkender Entwicklungs- und Fertigungstiefen sind bei einem Produktwechsel nicht nur die Leistungen des Herstellers anzupassen oder neu zu gestalten, sondern zudem wesentliche Teile des Supply Chain-Netzwerks (SCN) zu modifizieren. Zur erfolgreichen Durchführung des Produktwechsels müssen alle Aktivitäten für den Auslauf des alten Produkts sowie für die Entwicklung und den Anlauf des neuen Produkts zwischen dem Hersteller und den Partnern im SCN abgestimmt werden. Für diese schwierige Aufgabe liegen bisher in der unternehmerischen Praxis kaum geeignete Lösungen vor. Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden daher Überlegungen angestellt, welche Probleme ein Produktwechsel verursacht und welche Koordinationsformen und -instrumente während der Produktwechselphase im SCN zweckmäßig zu nutzen sind.</jats:p>",

First, despite the rapid growth of real agricultural output during this period, per-capita consumption of the majority of the agricultural population declined during the 1990s (when agricultural liberalization policies were introduced in India) after steadily rising during the 1980s. Second, non-food crop supply elasticities, which had been positive, turned \"perversely\" negative during the 1990s. Employing a model of a peasant economy with an effort supply function originally proposed by Leibenstein, we explain the two puzzles in terms of the interplay between the conditions of global integration (falling value-added prices) and the nature of local credit markets and institutions (including the practice of requiring collateral in the form of non-food crops).</jats:p><jats:p>EconLit Classification: P160, O100, F150, Q100</jats:p><jats:p>Keywords: Capitalist Systems, Political Economy, Economic Development, Economic Integration, Sustainable Development</jats:p><jats:p>Parole chiave: Sistemi capitalistici, Politica economica, Sviluppo economico, Integrazione economica, Sviluppo sostenibile</jats:p>",

A large‐scale appraisal shortly after introduction concluded that the effects on mothers' labour supply were surprisingly small. The more long‐term effects reported in this paper suggest that this conclusion may need modification. Almost 4 years after the reform the employment probability had declined significantly, and employed mothers were much more likely to be on leave. All in all the reduction in labour supply is estimated to be 3¾ hours per week or almost 20 per cent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sydney's water crisis has been attributed to long‐term drought, a population growing at &gt;50 000 a year, the early impacts of global warming and the demands of a 4.2 million population leading a water‐thirsty lifestyle. In this paper the drought is linked with a return to a drought‐dominated flow regime in eastern New South Wales. This began in 1991 and is associated with a shift from flood to drought domination that occurs every 20 to 50 years. Its impacts will be further exaggerated by global warming. The reduction of runoff into Sydney's reservoirs is due primarily to regime shift, resulting in the diminution of inflows to about 25% of their levels in the 42 years before 1991. Possible ways of managing these dwindling water resources include building more reservoirs, exploiting largely unknown sources of groundwater, constructing a desalination plant, harvesting rainwater in the city, recycling used urban water and reducing individual water use. Despite arguments against the first three of these options, a desalination plant is currently under construction and investigations of deep groundwater proceed (shelved 18th June, 2008). Given that sources of water are distant and located in areas where rainfall reductions have been significant, greater efforts should be made to use water already in the city (rainfall and recycled water). Water restrictions and better domestic management of water are also areas where great savings can be and have been made.</jats:p>",

Analyses were performed with two-dimensional (2D) high resolution gas chromatographic (HRGC) separation and parallel mass spectrometric (MS) and olfactometric (O) detection. Additionally, analyses of off-odor-free samples exposed to natural sunlight or to “artificial” UV radiation (replicating natural sunlight) were analyzed to assess off-odor compound formation. 14 common characteristic odorants in commercial off-odor and irradiated samples were identified. These were predominantly saturated and mono or di-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, with several substances exhibiting the characteristic fatty and plastic-like odor impressions. Eight of the compounds identified were detected for the first time as off-odor “sunlight” flavor contributors to mineral water and had amongst the highest flavor dilution (FD) factors in the extracted samples.</jats:p>",

These are grouped into ten categories, and two over‐arching themes are found. First, firms use various forms of outsourcing and subcontracting to reduce their own need for internal flexibility. The second related insight is that, having externalised the need for flexibility, firms improve flexibility of the whole chain by engaging in committed relationships with counterparts. The authors term the ability to change counterparts “configuration flexibility” and the ability to change the timing, volume and design of supply “planning and control flexibility”. Therefore, it is suggested that firms make complex trade‐offs between the two in the interest of achieving overall supply chain flexibility. These are presented in a model to allow for future refinement and testing.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Supply chain flexibility is a strategic objective, but is not achieved by all members of supply chains aiming for as much flexibility as possible on all dimensions.

Estimates of the efficiency of methanotrophy in peat soils vary widely in part because of differences in approaches employed to quantify methane cycling. High resolution profiles of dissolved methane abundance measured during the summer of 2003 were used to quantity rates of upward methane flux in four peatlands situated in Wales, UK. Aerobic incubations of peat from a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic mire were used to determine depth distributions of kinetic parameters associated with methane oxidation. The capacity for methanotrophy in a 3 cm thick zone immediately beneath the depth of nil methane abundance in pore water was significantly greater than the rate of upward diffusion of methane in all four peatlands. Rates of methane diffusion in pore water at the minerotrophic peatlands were small (&lt;10%) compared to surface emissions during June to August. The proportions were notably greater in the ombrotrophic bogs because of their typically low methane emission rates. Methanotrophy appears to consume entirely methane transported by pore water diffusion in the four peatlands with the exception of 4 of the 33 gas profiles sampled. Flux rates to the atmosphere regardless are high because of gas transport through vascular plants, in particular, at the minerotrophic sites. Cumulative rainfall amount 3-days prior to sampling correlated well with the distance between the water table level and the depth of 0 μmol l−1 methane, indicating that precipitation events can impact methane distributions in pore water. Further work is needed to characterise the kinetics of methane oxidation spatially and temporally in different wetland types in order to determine generalized relationships for methanotrophy in peatlands that can be incorporated into process-based models of methane cycling in peat soils.\n                    </jats:p>"

This paper argues that qualitative research is needed to select and hone additional measures. According to theory, cooperation to reduce water use is more likely if people: a) believe in the necessity to reduce use; b) feel costs are fairly shared; and c) believe their actions can affect the situation. The case study of Lydd, Kent, is presented. Lydd is the first location in which compulsory water metering has been imposed in the UK. Qualitative information was collected to inform the communication strategies being implemented by the water supply company. The investigation found that none of the three factors predicted by theory were completely present. The paper concludes by providing some recommendations for improving the water company's communications strategy for encouraging a reduction in domestic water use. The key role of qualitative information in assisting in the targeting and design of water demand management programmes is highlighted.</jats:p>",

Using Bakker's typology of market environmentalist reforms in resource management as a guiding frame to link this case to a bigger ‘neoliberal’ conversation, I distinguish how reforms to resource governance at the national level, coupled with changes in the ways in which resource management institutions and resource management organisations function at the local level have acted to constitute local practices of neoliberal governance. Local articulations of (national and supranational) neoliberal and development discourses are revealed as a means for reconceptualising the role of the state and the emergence of new forms of hybrid governance in Tagbilaran. Analysis of the operation of BWUI, a public/private water utility, and the politics of privatisation/private sector participation enables a closer inspection of how water and water services are politicised and resisted by local publics.</jats:p>",

A fast protect circuit was designed, and its response time is less than 5μs, which can avoid damaging workpiece and electrical components by switching off machining voltage and step motor as soon as a short circuit was detected. A series of ECM experiments using the power supply have been carried out, and results of test have proved that high frequency, short pulse width power supply helps to achieve better quality surface, higher machining accuracy.</jats:p>"

Preservation of this segment during right hemicolectomy is likely to prevent loss of its function. This study aimed at evaluating the arterial supply of the ICV to help preserve the valve during right hemicolectomy. Fifty‐four fresh human cadavers (37 male, 17female; median age: 54 years, range: 18–90 years) were studied after relatives gave written, informed consent. At postmortem, 20 cm of terminal ileum with the ileocecal segment and up to 20 cm of ascending colon were removed en bloc with its mesentery and blood supply. The ileocolic artery was cannulated and injected with 10 ml of water‐soluble red dye under pressure. The arterial supply was dissected to demonstrate a pattern. In all, the ICV was supplied by the ileocolic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric, which divided into an anterior and a posterior cecal artery. A marginal branch of the right colic was noted to contribute to ICV blood supply in only two (4%). Furthermore, study of the anastomosis at the ICV showed that the anterior cecal artery was present in all (100%), posterior cecal in 48 (89%), and recurrent ileal artery in 53 (98%). A rich anastomosis between vessels at the ICV; small “windows,” short tributaries, were seen in 38 (70%), whereas a poor anastomotic network at the ICV; large “windows,” long tributaries, between these vessels were seen in 12 (22%). In four (8%), we were unable to clearly determine between rich and poor anastomotic networks. Other variants included, absent posterior cecal artery in six (11%) and absent recurrent ileal artery in one (2%). The ICV has a predictable blood supply in the majority of patients. Preservation of the anterior cecal artery would ensure a vascularized ICV in right hemicolectomy. Clin. Anat. 22:712–715, 2009. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, automatic modification of stresses in rigid parts of a pipe line system is modeled using the trial results of a second-order explicit Finite Volume (FV) Godunov type scheme for one-dimensional transient flow in pipes. The developed model for numerical analysis of transient pressure is based on Riemann solution of continuity equation coupled with the momentum Equation (including convective term). The implementation of boundary conditions such as reservoirs, valves, and pipe junctions in the Godunov approach is similar to that of the method of characteristics (MOC) approach. The computed pressure waves are compared with analytical solution as well as laboratory measurements for single pipes. The model is applied on two classic problems (systems consisting of a reservoir, a pipe and a valve). The second-order Godunov scheme is stable for Courant number less than or equal to unity, and therefore, can be applied for the problems with variable mesh spacing. In order to show the ability of the developed model to deal with such cases, the computed maximum pressure distribution along a pipeline with variable segment coordinates are used for trial modification of pipe thickness and stress distribution.</jats:p>",

The supply side authorities normally design these techniques and implement them on demand side consumers. Load manage-ment (LM) initiated on the demand side leads to valley filling and peak clipping. Power factor correc-tion (PFC) techniques have also been analysed and presented. It has been observed that many power utilities, especially in developing countries, have neither developed nor implemented DSM for their electrical energy management. This paper proposes that the existing PFC techniques should be re-eval-uated especially when loads are nonlinear. It also recommends automatic demand control methods to be used on the demand side in order to acquire optimal energy consumption. This would lead to improved reliability of the supply side and thereby reducing environmental degradation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant designed to satisfy only the contracted-for water supply, the water company would be missing out on potential benefits that could have been obtained selling water in periods of high demand. On the other hand, sizing the RO desalination plant to produce water to satisfy peak demand means incurring additional costs as well as having the plant partially idle during periods of average or low demand. A model was developed using Excel macros to perform dynamic programming to optimize the capacity expansion of an RO desalination plant. The objective function is to maximize the present value of the total net benefits over the lifetime of the RO desalination plant. The model can be used to test different scenarios to capture time-variant tourism demand and price uncertainties on investment decisions. This study focuses on tourism dominated arid coastal regions, using Sharm El Sheikh (Sharm) in South Sinai, Egypt, as an example.19 RO plants in Sharm were surveyed and data were collected including unit production costs, O&amp;M costs, energy consumption rates, contracted-for water supply, and utilization. Unit production cost of an RO desalination plant varies according to the degree of operation of the plant. This fact has to be taken into consideration when calculating the costs of RO desalination and when deciding on the plant capacity in order to maximize the total net benefit. Using the collected data, cost functions were developed for O&amp;M costs as a function of utilization and plant capacity. The cost model calculated similar values to the actual total net benefit for one of the surveyed RO plant taken as an example. Using the optimization model, the maximum total net benefit is obtained with a smaller installed capacity than the actual case. A modified pricing structure is suggested in the paper that ties the water selling price to consumption in an effort to reduce demand in excess of contracted-for water supply aiding the water company to fulfill its contractual commitments to all users. However, price elasticity has to be taken into consideration to determine the impact of price change on water demand.</jats:p>",

We first present a mixed-integer linear program to determine the optimal locations of the collection centers and remanufacturing facilities along with the integrated forward and reverse flows such that the total cost of facility location, processing, and transportation associated with forward and reverse flows in the network is minimized. Second, we devise two tabu search heuristics—sequential and random neighborhood search procedures—in which we effectively combine search functions using move and exchange neighborhoods to improve efficiency in exploring the solution space. We also suggest a transshipment heuristic to quickly, but effectively, estimate the objective function value (goodness) of a feasible solution in the course of a tabu search. Third, we present a Benders decomposition solution approach that incorporates the tabu search heuristics as well as Benders cuts that are strengthened to facilitate faster convergence and improved computational efficiency, especially for large-scale instances. While the solutions using tabu search heuristics make the applicability of the Benders decomposition approach possible via providing initial upper bounds and facilitating the generation of good initial Benders cuts, the lower bounds obtained by the Benders approach computationally verify the high quality of the tabu search heuristic solutions. We present computational results illustrating the efficient performance of the solution algorithms in terms of both solution quality and time, especially for larger size problems. </jats:p>",

The current paper describes the process in general, and focuses in particular on attaining these criteria while maintaining a low total hardness concentration (120 mg/L as CaCO3). The process is based on dissolving calcite using H2SO4 and replacing the excess calcium ions generated in this process by Mg2 +  ions (using a specific cation exchange resin—Amberlite) and by Na+ (using a second cation exchange resin—chabazite, from the zeolite group). Once exhausted the resins are re-loaded with Mg2 +  and Na+ by the brine generated in the RO process, thus no unwanted brines are generated.

Removal of BPS and DHB was relatively low at 20% and 30%, respectively. Removal of BPP was low in slow sand filtration, but Pt-loaded photocatalyst removed BPP effectively. Removal of BPS was low with Pt-loaded photocatalyst, but slow sand filtration removed BPS effectively. The combination of a slow sand filter and Pt-loaded photocatalyst may be helpful to degrade BPs. The magnitude of decomposition of BPs by photocatalytic reaction may be related to electrophilic frontier density. But the degradability of BPs in slow sand filtration is not the same as that in photocatalytic reaction with Pt-loaded titanium dioxide. The biodegradability of BPs by slow sand filtration cannot be explained by molecular orbital calculation.</jats:p>",

Among the four aspects of supply chain integration (cash flow, material flow, product flow and information flow), the integration of information flow is the most critical element in enabling coordinating activities and supply chain alliances. Yet, there are unanswered questions regarding the extent to which information exchanged is effective in the supply chain alliance. In this study, we adopted the ‘contingency theory’ as the theoretical foundation, and interviewed eight selected firms to investigate the impact of supply chain partners among organizations on information sharing quality, and the impact of inter-organizational information sharing quality on the supply chain integrated-performance. The results show that (1) supply chain partners within and between groups have a positive impact on inter-organizational information sharing quality, (2) inter-organizational information sharing quality has a positive impact on the supply chain integrated performance, and (3) information sharing quality should be multi-dimensional. We believe that the successful implementation of SCM systems among firms will produce significant synergy and be associated with the competitive advantages. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</jats:p>",

The nutrient state of bacteria affects onto its specific AOC formation potential. The specific AOC formation potential of bacteria starved, which expected to be similar state to natural bacteria in a reservoir, was 0.8 × 10−13 g/cell. It was half of that of bacteria in the logarithmic growth phase. The difference of specific AOC formation potential of bacteria between in the logarithmic growth phase and in the starving condition would be caused by the amount of cellular organic carbons. The specific AOC formation potential of picophytoplankton was 6.4 × 10−13 g/cell, and 8 times higher than that of bacteria starved. The AOC formed by chlorination of picoplankton should be considered for AOC control in summer season when both bacteria and picophytoplankton multiply.</jats:p>",

Human blood samples from β‐thalassemia patients and healthy controls were analyzed with HRT, which was carried out on starch–agarose mixed gel. First, the whole blood samples were electrophoresed for 2 h, then paused for 15 min and ran for 15 min by turns. This “pause‐run‐pause” experiment was performed for several turns and the total electrophoresis time lasted for about 6 h. The results showed that some other hemoglobin (Hb) components were released from the origin of each sample during the HRT, and the samples from β‐thalassemia patients released more Hb than the healthy controls. This finding demonstrates that Hb may exist differently associated in RBCs, and it may have an important theoretical and clinical significance in Hb and RBC research.</jats:p>",

The resulting system of equations is estimated with two‐stage least squares (2SLS), showing that this sample of Malian cotton producers have responded to prices in a relatively inelastic manner, with supply elasticities only about one‐half of those estimated for producers in developed countries. Policy reforms could help producers respond more easily to prices changes, as well as to raise average productivity levels.</jats:p>",

The microgrid was constructed at the Expo 2005 Aichi site as part of a demonstration promoted by NEDO. A solution is needed for problems in which instability in DGs that utilize natural energy such as solar light and wind force negatively influences existing electric power systems. Consequently, we developed an energy‐control system and controlled the output of the DGs to reduce fluctuations at the grid‐connection point caused by unstable PV‐system output. Our microgrid consisted of DGs such as PV systems, fuel cells, and NaS batteries, and these DGs were controlled by an energy‐control system. We tested and then verified the practical effectiveness of installing the microgrid as follows. We found that (1) 99.5% of the power imbalance in supply and demand over a period of 30 min was within a range of ±3% under normal operating conditions, (2) the microgrid contributed to load leveling, (3) the energy‐control system smoothed the power‐flow fluctuations of PV‐system output at the grid connection point, and (4) installing microgrids should help reduce additional Load Frequency Control (LFC) capacity in the future. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plant control with PID controllers is embedded in the model of a drinking water treatment plant and the ozonation process in the plant is used as a case study. It is concluded that direct control of water quality objectives, e.g. Giardia inactivation for ozonation, can largely reduce uncertainty and variation in process performance and leads to improvements of drinking water quality. In the discussed case it led to less bromate formation at the same disinfection capacity. Embedded plant control with PID controllers in the model of drinking water treatment plants through the use of code for writing control functionality has a large potential for model based optimization of operation.</jats:p>",

With a constant demand rate, the leadtime may be interrupted by a random number of OFF periods of the supplier. Using the regenerative cycle analysis, a long-run average cost function is obtained and shown to have some important properties. Accordingly, an effective search algorithm is proposed to find the sub-optimal inventory policy. In the end, we also investigate the effects on the average cost of the uncertain order delay which attribute to both the supply interruptions and the random leadtime.

Using 14–18 year time series of phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment at up to 10 sites along 320 km of coast in a rocky intertidal ecosystem, we examined the influence of climatic variation at 3–7 year (El Niño‐Southern Oscillation [ENSO]), 7–10 year (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation [NPGO]), and 20+ year (Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]) timescales. Phytoplankton and mussel recruitment revealed order‐of‐magnitude increases and seasonal shifts in the 2000s compared to 1989–1999, but seasonal shifts were in opposite directions with phytoplankton blooms occurring earlier and recruitment occurring later in the year. The NPGO had the strongest relationships with both phytoplankton and recruitment, while relationships between these factors and ENSO and PDO were weak. Increases were associated with cooler ocean temperature and intensification in the ocean gyre‐scale circulation reflected in a stronger North Pacific Current (NPC). Phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment were positively correlated, suggesting that increases in larval food may have driven the changes in mussel recruitment. With our prior demonstration that mussel growth rate is sensitive to phytoplankton concentration, these results suggest an important effect of bottom‐up forcing on the dynamics of coastal mussel populations. We conclude that central supply‐side ecological processes in coastal ecosystems are sensitive to long‐term ocean basin‐scale oceanographic and atmospheric fluctuation. Despite these changes, intertidal community dynamics have changed only in relatively subtle ways, suggesting a role for local ecological interactions in dampening the effects of dominant modes of climate forcings in coastal ecosystems.</jats:p>",

Demands for ready-for-use parts occur according to Poisson processes, and are accompanied by returns of failed parts. The demands are met from stock if possible, and otherwise they are backordered and fulfilled as soon as a ready-for-use part becomes available. Returned failed parts are immediately sent into repair. The repairables are assigned to static priority classes. The repair shop is modeled as a single-server queue, where the failed parts are served according to these priority classes. We show that under a given assignment of repairables to priority classes, optimal spare parts stock levels follow from Newsvendor equations. Next, we develop fast and effective heuristics for the assignment of repairables to priority classes. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the system under these static priorities to the case with a First-Come First-Served (FCFS) service discipline. We show that in many cases static priorities reduce total inventory holding and backordering costs by more than 40%. Finally, we analyse the effect of the number of priority classes. We show that 2 priority classes suffice to obtain 90% of the maximal savings via static priorities.</jats:p>",

Relatively high dosages of polymers were directly exposed to oxidants for long reaction times in the FP tests to assess the potential to form NDMA and obtain mechanistic insight. Results show that the NDMA FP of the polymers generally follows the trend of aminomethylated polyacrylamide (Mannich polymer)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;poly(epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine) (polyamine) &amp;gt; poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (polyDADMAC) &amp;gt; cationic polyacrylamide copolymer (cationic PAM). The high NDMA FP of Mannich polymer was largely due to the high amount of dimethylamine (DMA) residue in the polymer solution. For the other three polymers, the DMA concentration was increased after oxidation, indicating polymer degradation, and the trend of DMA increase agreed with that of NDMA FP. Among the oxidants, NDMA formation followed the order of monochloramine &amp;gt; free chlorine &amp;gt; chlorine dioxide, despite that the DMA release from the polymers caused by the oxidant followed the opposite order. At equal dosages, nitrite and nitrate generated NDMA from the polymers at levels comparable to those by free chlorine and chlorine dioxide; even so, the nitrosifying agents are unlikely to contribute significantly to NDMA formation due to expected lower concentrations in drinking water treatment systems. Jar tests followed by monochloramination of real water samples using conditions in line with those at potable water treatment plants generally showed relatively small contributions from polyamines and polyDADMACs to the overall NDMA formation.</jats:p>",

Water quantity limitations of the sources cause economic constraints on system operation, requiring more expensive alternative sources. This paper presents a linear cost minimisation model for such a groundwater-based multiple-source water supply system where water demand is relatively high and groundwater availability is limited, while a minimum supply is to be ensured to the local coverage area of each well. The model decides on the optimum production amount from each source with the objective of cost minimisation for a specified set of demand and source constraints. The model would be useful for system analysis, planning and management purposes, such as analysing water production at various levels of system loss or unaccounted-for water (UFW), or determining optimal production schedules under different system operation scenarios. The model is applied to simulate a groundwater-based sub-network of Dhaka city water supply system where seasonal demand from the system is the highest when the groundwater level is relatively low. Model results show that significant cost reduction would be possible under different operational scenarios through optimal production scheduling at various UFW levels. </jats:p>",

However, it is unclear if collaborative relationships provide benefits that compensate for the additional expense associated with such relationships. Further, it is unclear what factors promote successful collaborations. This research examines collaborative relationships in two separate studies using structural equation modeling: one study examines buyers’ perceptions and the second study examines suppliers’ perceptions. The two studies are then compared using invariance testing in order to determine economic and relational factors that drive satisfaction and performance from each party's perspective. Results show that collaborative activities, such as information sharing, joint relationship effort, and dedicated investments lead to trust and commitment. Trust and commitment, in turn, lead to improved satisfaction and performance. Results from the two independent studies exhibit similarities and differences; while the conceptual model is highly similar, certain paths vary in their significance and/or their importance across buyer and supplier firms such that buyers focus more on relationship outcomes while suppliers look to safeguard their transaction specific investments through information sharing and joint relationship effort. Managerial and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Over the period, Australia’s economy was growing and unemployment was low. Political rhetoric supported ‘traditional’ family values, family tax policy favoured single income or ‘modified male-breadwinner’ households, and part time work was the most common ‘family-friendly’ workplace measure. Against this background, we investigate the market labour supply and intra-household time use of mothers and fathers in couple-headed households with at least one child aged 0 – 4 years (N=747 in 1997 and 626 in 2006). We identify associations between household labour supply and total (paid and unpaid) work, the way paid work, domestic labour and childcare is divided between mothers and fathers, and their subjective feelings of time pressure, at each time point. We find that by 2006, there was lower average maternal market work and a higher proportion of families with young children conformed to the one-and-a-half earner family form than in 1997. In the main there was increased total household work, increased gender specialisation in paid work and caring labour, and much higher subjective time pressure, especially for fathers and the relatively few mothers who were employed full time. </jats:p>",

Evidence that community pharmacies provide these medications with sufficient patient assessment and medication counseling to ensure compliance with the government's Quality Use of Medicines principles is currently tacking. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Objective:</jats:title><jats:p> To assess current practice when asthma reliever medication is provided in the community pharmacy setting and to identify factors that correlate with assessment of asthma control. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods:</jats:title><jats:p> Researchers posing as patients visited a sample of Perth metropolitan community pharmacies in May 2007. During the visit, the simulated patient enacted a standardized scenario of someone with moderately controlled asthma who wished to purchase a salbutamol (albuterol) inhaler without prescription. Results of the encounter were recorded immediately after the visit. Regression analysis was performed, with medication use frequency (a marker of asthma control) as the dependent variable. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> One hundred sixty community pharmacies in the Perth metropolitan area were visited in May 2007. Pharmacists and/or pharmacy assistants provided some form of assessment in 84% of the visits. Counseling was provided to the simulated patients in 24% of the visits. Only 4 pharmacy staff members asked whether the simulated patient knew how to use the inhaler. Significant correlation was found between assessment and/or counseling of reliever use frequency and 3 independent variables: visit length (p &lt; 0.001), number of assessment questions asked (p &lt; 0.001), and the simulated patient who conducted the visit (p &lt; 0.02). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> Both patient assessment and medication counseling were suboptimal compared with recommended practice when nonprescription asthma reliever medication was supplied in the community pharmacy setting. Pharmacy and pharmacist demographic variables do not appear to affect assessment of asthma control. This research indicates the need for substantial improvements in practice in order to provide reliever medication in line with Quality Use of Medication principles of ensuring safe and effective use of medication. </jats:p></jats:sec>",
