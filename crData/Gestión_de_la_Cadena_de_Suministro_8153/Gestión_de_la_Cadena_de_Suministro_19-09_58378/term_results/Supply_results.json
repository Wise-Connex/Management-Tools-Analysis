      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Real-time, digital information has become critical to the success of both today’s 24/7, business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) operations, and to their suppliers, manufacturers and partners. Traditionally, companies have operated supply chains with a linear, sequential paradigm, following a model made popular and accessible by the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. Digital technology capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, robotics, additive manufacturing and advanced analytics are not only driving changes to the SCOR standard, but are also raising a new set of questions regarding the nature and relationship of more complex and tightly integrated supply networks. These dynamic, interconnected systems concurrently plan, execute and enable digital supply ‘chains’ — we refer to this next generation model as a digital supply network (DSN). This paper lays the foundation for this transformational journey, by introducing key disruptions that are enabling organisations to move beyond the limitations of traditional supply chains and explaining the core characteristics of DSNs. With the intent of providing a voice of leadership as supply networks become more digital, Deloitte Consulting and the Association of Supply Chain Management will release an initial version of the DSN Capability Model in September 2019 to provide an overview of DSNs. In subsequent releases, we will expand the body of knowledge, helping organisations to understand and build digitally enabled operational capabilities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">It is now widely recognised that effective logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) plays a vital role in economic and wider societal well-being. A key facet of contemporary supply chain management (SCM) thinking is the shift away from traditionally fragmented supply chain configurations to ones that are characterised by high levels of integration of supply chain processes and data. Experience suggests that success in achieving higher levels of supply chain integration (SCI) depends on both physical and technical aspects (ie the so-called ‘hard-wiring’), as well as human and behavioural components (ie the so-called ‘soft-wiring’). It would appear, however, that the latter has received relatively little attention in the LSCM academic literature. Furthermore, the empirical evidence suggests that the majority of supply chain improvement initiatives in companies have been primarily concerned with technological, structural and process issues. This paper argues that the difficulties often encountered in attempting to put LSCM theory into practice are largely a consequence of a lack of focus on, and understanding of, the human dimension. Based on this discussion, the paper offers some suggestions for improvement in this area to both the supply chain research and practitioner communities. It uses several cultural and literary references throughout to illustrate these suggestions.</jats:p>"

Funding for roads in South Africa is complex, controversial and faces different viewpoints. In this environment, it is difficult to implement any new form of road user charges, including the user-pay principle, or promote a sustainable road infrastructure policy framework.Objectives: This article examined the road funding framework in South Africa to fully understand its capability to fund the country’s road infrastructure network while quantifying and presenting the linkage between road-generated income, its distribution, allocation and the expenditure of these funds through a consolidated report and comparing the country’s income and expenditure on roads to international standards.Method: Numerous financial statements were assessed through a budget analysis to present the current road funding framework in South Africa in terms of the income generated from the road sector, its allocation, distribution and the expenditure of these funds. Local road funding trends were then compared with selected countries in terms of road-generated income, its allocation and expenditure.Results: South Africa’s current road funding framework collects a substantial amount from road users, but there is a mismatch between road-generated income collected and governmental road expenditure. Furthermore, South Africa’s road expenditure in not outside the norm compared to international countries.Conclusion: Investigation into the effectiveness of South Africa’s current road cost recovery methods is needed, and the impact of future technologies on its income-generating potential must be examined.</jats:p>"

Basically, these techniques are based on splitting the single inline short section, used in the conventional technique, into a couple of two sub-short sections made of two distinct plastic material types: high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE) and (LDPE). The 1D unconventional water hammer solver based on the method of characteristics was used for numerical computations. Results evidenced that the specific setup of the compound technique based on (HDPE-LDPE) sub-short sections (where the former sub-short section is attached to the hydraulic parts, while the latter is attached to the main steel pipe) is the most prominent configuration providing an acceptable trade-off between attenuation of pressure head surge, and limitation of excessive wave oscillation period spreading. Furthermore, this compound technique setup allowed more important pressure head peak (or crest) attenuation as compared with the dual technique based on (LDPE-LDPE) sub-short sections; while inducing about similar values of wave oscillation period spreading.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>How to feed a growing global population in a secure and sustainable way? The conventional, biogenic agriculture has yet failed to provide a reliable concept which circumvents its severe environmental externalities—such as the massive use of land area, water for irrigation, fertiliser, pesticides, herbicides, and fossil fuel. In contrast, the artificial synthesis of carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy would allow not only for a highly reliable production without those 10 externalities, but would also allow to increase the agricultural capacities of our planet by several orders of magnitude. All required technology is either commercially available or at least developed on a lab-scale. No directed research has, however, yet been conducted to wards an industry-scale carbohydrate synthesis because the biogenic carbohydrate production was economically more competitive. Taking the environmental and socioeconomic externalities of the conventional sugar production into account, this economical narrative has to be questioned. We estimate the production costs of artificial sugar at 1 C/kg. While the today’s spot market price for conventional sugar is about 0.3 C/kg, we estimate its total costs (including external costs) at 0.9 C/kg in humid regions and 2 C/kg in semi-arid regions. Accordingly, artificial sugar appears already today to be the less expensive way of production. The artificial sugar production allows in principle also for a subsequent synthesis of other carbohydrates such as starch and cellulose as well as fats. This manuscript aims at rising research interest and at enhancing awareness for a transition to a nonagricultural and more resource conserving way to supply carbohydrates for food.</jats:p><jats:p />"

Such mutual cooperation, focusing beyond day-to-day business and transforming from a contract-based relationship to a value-based relationship is well received in the industries. Also, coupling information sharing in their collaborative setup is valued as an effective forward step. Moreover, advent of technologies naturally supports information sharing across the supply chain. As meeting consumers demand is the main aspect of supply chain, studying supply chain behavior with demand as a shared information makes it more beneficial. The chapter shall analyze demand information sharing in a two-stage supply chain with the performance measure being total cost in terms of profit. In order to quantify and understand better, the different levels of collaboration and their impact on the performance measure are analyzed using discrete event simulation. Arena software is used to simulate the required inventory control scenarios. </jats:p>",

The commuter bus sector is complex and its operations are not in line with the recommended regulations. Procurement in the sector is marred by many challenges, such as the fact that no new contracts have been concluded since 2001.Objectives: This article investigates the perceptions of key stakeholders on the application of the procurement practices within the commuter bus industry in Gauteng to improve the industry’s performance.Method: This article is descriptive and exploratory in nature and employed a mixed-method research approach. The data were collected from a sample of 18 respondents who are key stakeholders directly involved in the procurement of subsidised commuter bus services in Gauteng by means of a face-to-face interview using a semi-structured questionnaire.Results: The findings of the article revealed that there are three procurement practices employed within the commuter bus industry, namely, interim, negotiated and tender contracts and all these are long overdue.Conclusion: The findings of the article recommend that the key stakeholders need to select the most suitable procurement practice(s) to be employed within the industry and it highlights the challenges stemming from the lack of proper implementation of the guiding policies.</jats:p>"

Many articles have been published with regards Industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. This paper aims to propose the term “Supply Chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of Industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. As Industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of Supply Chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of Supply Chain 4.0 strategy.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (SLR) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, Industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. The three phases of the SLR process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. A concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the SLR to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The SLR showed that there is limited research linking Industry 4.0 to supply chain. Nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. These constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. Each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the SLR. The SLR also demonstrated that maturity propositions for Industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. Hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of Supply Chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. As these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the Supply Chain 4.0 concept.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. As Supply Chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. As the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The SLR demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of Industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. This research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. The value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form Supply Chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

A qualitative approach is adopted to explore the linkages and relationships between political disruptions and supply chain disruptions and performance. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at 25 different textile manufacturing firms. This study confirmed the prevalence of severe and variegated impacts of political disruptions on the textile supply chain. Supply chain disruption is found to be a key mediating factor that directly and indirectly affect supply chain performance through an increased production and delivery lead-time, transportation delays, interruptions of raw material supplies to plants and distributors and the restricted access to workplaces for suppliers and workers. The linkages are represented through vicious circles that illustrate the interactions and inter-relationships between disrupted supply chain and performance. This study provides empirical evidence to help government to formulate pertinent labour laws and industrial policy to mitigate political disruptions and minimise deleterious effects of supply chain disruption on production and distribution networks whilst respecting and protecting the democratic rights of people.</jats:p>",

Этот рисунок, датируемый девятнадцатым веком и представленный во вводных к учебникам, можно рассматривать как графическое представление невидимой руки Адама Смита, которая, как говорят, ведет цены к их оптимальному уровню. Однако такое представление страдает рядом принципиальных недостатков. Вопервых, в нем не отражен динамический взгляд на рыночные силы, поэтому остается неясным, как цены сходятся к равновесию. Вовторых, спрос и предложение рассматриваются как детерминированные, хотя на самом деле они по своей природе неопределенны. В данной статье эти вопросы рассматриваются с помощью квантовой структуры для моделирования спроса и предложения, причем не как пересечение, а как вероятностная волна с соответствующей энтропийной силой. Такой подход используется, чтобы получить первичные принципы метода для моделирования изменения цен на активы с использованием квантового гармонического осциллятора, который ранее использовался и эмпирически проверялся в квантовых финансах. Метод продемонстрирован для простой системы, также обсуждаются его применения в других областях экономики.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>One of the most iconic and influential graphics in economics is the figure showing supply and demand as two lines sloping in opposite directions, with the point at which they intersect representing the equilibrium price which perfectly balances supply and demand. The figure, which dates back to the nineteenth century, can be seen as a graphical representation of Adam Smiths invisible hand, which is said to guide prices to their optimal level, and features in nearly every introductory textbook. However this figure suffers from a number of basic drawbacks. One is that it does not express a dynamical view of market forces, so it is not clear how prices converge on an equilibrium. Another is that it views supply and demand as deterministic, when in fact they are intrinsically uncertain in nature. This paper addresses these issues by using a quantum framework to model supply and demand as, not a cross, but a probabilistic wave, with an associated entropic force. The approach is used to derive from first principles a technique for modeling asset price changes using a quantum harmonic oscillator, that has been previously used and empirically tested in quantum finance. The method is demonstrated for a simple system, and applications in other areas of economics are discussed.</jats:p>",

Biomass, one of the most important renewable energy resources, is abundant in agricultural-based countries. Typically, the biomass supply chain is large due to the huge amount of relevant data required for building the model. As a result, using a standard optimization package to determine the solution for the biomass supply chain model might not be practical. In this study, the focus is on developing and applying advanced methodologies that can be used to determine a solution for the biomass supply chain model efficiently. The decisions related to plant selection, and distribution of biomass from suppliers to plants require optimization. The methodologies considered in this research are based on stochastic programming, parameter search, and simulation-based optimization. Computational results and managerial insights based on case studies from different regions of Vietnam are provided. The results show that parameter search is suitable for small problems only, while stochastic programming is suitable for small and medium problems. For large problem, simulation-based optimization performs better when considering the quality of the solution and the run time, although, this method does not guarantee an optimal solution. It provides good solutions where the gaps to the optimal solutions are between 0.59% and 8.41%.</jats:p>"

However, it is also true that it is necessary to investigate which orientation is the most appropriate in terms of the supply of these activities, according to what may or may not be of interest to our population, in order to be able to foresee future needs and to be able to offer a quality service.\nObjectives: The main objective of this research has been to identify these interests in order to present a proposal for activities in the aquatic environment aimed at satisfying the needs of the entire group present in the city of Yecla, analysing the context in relation to the supply and demand of the aquatic activities established in the town.\nMethod: Using two tools created specifically for each group, according to the level of participation in aquatic programmes offered by the local body, aspects such as satisfaction, sporting habits, activities of interest and their timetable preferences, motivations towards practice and some teaching and management aspects related to the services provided and those that could be taken up are analysed.\nResults: Numerous results were found in which it is worth highlighting that the activities most in demand are mainly aquatic fitness, and educational and therapeutic swimming as the activities with the greatest preferential inclination, as well as three marked time slots of interest for attending these activities, which take place from Monday to Thursday, as they determine. As for the reasons that lead them to practice these activities, health stands out in the first place, followed by the development of skills and belonging to a social group, leaving physical appearance and social approval as the factors least appreciated by this group, not very different from the reasons that lead them to practice any other type of activity. The elements with the highest levels of satisfaction appear to be those related to the staff of the facility, with the changing rooms being the lowest rated in terms of the degree of conformity with everything analysed. Small differences are found in terms of sex, age and level of studies, such as a lower score recorded in different variables the higher the level of education, or variations in the reasons for practising according to the age considered.\nConclusions: On the basis of these results, some indications are put forward for drawing up a programme of aquatic activities adjusted to the current interest of the population, suggesting attending to the deficiencies detected and improving the service in those aspects that remain uncovered, such as evaluation and teaching planning, rectifying the problems detected in the facility, the orientation that can be given to the time slots, the type of activities and the approach to which they should be directed.\nKeywords: Satisfaction, service quality, aquatic activities, aquatic programmes, supply and demand, practice interests.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of global supply chains has had profound effects on individual economies and the global trading system, thereby complicating standard macroeconomic analyses. For many of the new and challenging questions brought about by this phenomenon, such as its impact on the global business cycle and measurements of competitiveness, the answer largely depends on one specific aspect of global value chains: how easily they can re-configure in response to changes in prices. We propose a parsimonious, generalized specification to test the degree of global-supply-chain flexibility. Our estimates show that, in the short run, the production structure is highly inflexible, and that this rigidity has, if anything, risen over time as supply chains have deepened over time. This finding is robust to alternative price measures, including those that account for the U.S. dollar’s outsized role in trade through invoicing. While in the long run all estimated elasticities rise, supply chains remain somewhat inflexible. Our results have implications for analyses of cross-country business-cycle dynamics, the propagation of sectoral shocks, and the measurement of international competitiveness.</jats:p>",

The consideration of choosing the non-Food &amp; Beverage businesses was merely because the products have longer physical endurance so they can be stored in warehouses for preparation, so it is assumed to have longer supply chain. The research respondents were 30 non-Food and Beverage start-up businesses operating more than two years. From the results of the study there were two findings. First, there are three kinds of supply chain management models adopted by the student's start-up business. Model 1 consist of Suppliers - Manufacturers - Distributors - Resellers - Consumers. Model 2 consist of Suppliers - Manufacturers - Resellers - Consumers. Model 3 consist of Suppliers - Retailers - Consumers. Second, in order to provide raw materials, 40% non-F &amp; B student's start-up businesses using a small supplier strategy with two suppliers. 7% start businesses using many supplier strategies with four suppliers.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Aspects of global change (e.g. urbanization, climate change) result in novel, stressful thermal environments that threaten biodiversity. Though much research quantifies the thermal sensitivity of adult organisms, effects of global change on developing offspring (e.g. embryos) are also important. Oviparous, non-avian reptiles have received considerable attention because eggs are left to develop under prevailing environmental conditions, making them vulnerable to increases in ambient temperature. Though many studies assess embryo thermal tolerance and physiology in response to long-term (i.e. chronic), constant incubation temperatures, fewer assess responses to acute exposures which are more ecologically relevant for many species. We subjected eggs of the brown anole lizard (<jats:italic>Anolis sagrei</jats:italic>) to heat shocks, thermal ramps, and extreme diurnal fluctuations to determine the lethal temperature of embryos, measure the thermal sensitivity of embryo heart rate and metabolism, and quantify the effects of sub-lethal but stressful temperatures on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes and survival. Most embryos died at heat shocks of 45 or 46 °C, which is ∼12 °C warmer than the highest constant temperatures suitable for development. Heart rate and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption increased with temperature; however, as embryos approached the lethal temperature, heart rate and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>production continued rising while O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption plateaued. These data indicate a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at high temperatures. Exposure to extreme, diurnal temperature fluctuations depressed embryo developmental rates and heart rates, and resulted in hatchlings with smaller body size, reduced growth rates, and lower survival in the laboratory. Thus, even brief exposure to extreme temperatures can have important effects on embryo development, and our study highlights the role of both immediate and cumulative effects of high temperatures on egg survival. Such effects must be considered to predict how populations will respond to global change.</jats:p>"

The demand for chrysanthemums increases from year to year so that special concern for chrysanthemums is required in order that their quality and availability are maintained. Bandungan as one of the centers of chrysanthemum production in Indonesia has some problems in functioning as part of the chrysanthemum supply chain, such as, 1) difference in selling price based on time of day, 2) difference in selling price based on days of importance, and 3) there still being a long supply chain to go through. The research concerned here aimed at measuring the performance of chrysanthemum supply chain management in Bandungan by using the SCOR analysis with five performance attributes, namely, 1) supply chain reliability, 2) supply chain responsiveness, 3) supply chain agility, 4) supply chain cost, and 5) supply chain asset management. The research was conducted in February 2019. The research was descriptive type with quantitative approach. The sample consisted of farmer, retailer, florist and consumer which numbered 30 respondents. The result shows that the perfomance in relation with supply chain reliability, supply chain responsiveness, and supply chain agility is satisfactory in category (with scores within the 31-40 range) while the performance in relation with supply chain cost and supply chain asset management is moderate in category (with scores within the 21-30 range). The performance of chrysanthemum supply chain management in Bandungan would become increasingly better if all the actors in the supply chain take special notice of any performance that is done. The result of the research could hopefully be a reference in the making of strategies for development and improvement in the chrysanthemum business in Bandungan.</jats:p>"

It can be applied as a suitable source of DC voltage and is convenient to supply such inverters that need three or more voltage terminals to supply all sections of the inverter. The converter in question works as a multi-pulse rectifier supplying a three-level NPC (Neutral Point Clamped) inverter. The load introduced by the inverter is simulated as an impedance depended on a selected inverter state. All possible states are determined by using a set of three digits: 0, 1, 2. The sourcing converter is constructed from diode bridge rectifiers connected in parallel as well as the system of magnetically coupled reactors. The reactors are used to shift subsequent line voltages so that they create a multiphase voltage system supplying component rectifiers. The article presents two alternative rectifiers: A 12-pulse diode rectifier using one magnetically coupled reactor unit 3CRλ, and a 24-pulse one using three 3CRλ units. Simulation and experimental tests have been executed and selected results included. Conclusion and discussion are added.</jats:p>"

Patients with a head injury can experience permanent damage to brain tissue or secondary injuries such as brain ischemia due to hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalance, even respiratory failure and heart failure. The head injury patients are initially examined using a standardized scoring system to assess the consciousness level of patients with impaired consciousness, namely the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). One of the possible treatments for decreasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion managements to position the patients with a head elevation of 15˚-30˚. This treatment aimed  to increase venous drainage from the head and to reduce systemic blood pressure that may be compromised by cerebral perfusion pressure. This study aimed to determine the effect of giving oxygen through a simple mask and the 30˚ head elevation position to the changes of the consciousness level for the patients witha head injury in the emergency department at Dr. Kariadi Hospital, Semarang. This study was quasi-experimental research without control with pre-test and post-test one-group design with used a sample of 23 respondents. The instrument used an observation sheet containing the GCS examination results and analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. Based on the results of the bivariate analysis using the Wilcoxon correlation test, a p-value of 0,000 &lt;0,05 was obtained so it could be concluded that the H0 is accepted. Therefore, giving oxygen through simple masks and patient positioning with 30˚ head elevation affect the consciousness level of head injury patients at Dr. Kariadi Hospital, Semarang.</jats:p>"

Nepal has made its considerable efforts to improve the water supply and sanitation (WASH) situation in the country by formulating and enforcing a number of WASH policies, guidelines and acts for the last two decades. But WASH situation of Nepal has not been well documented so far. Aim of this article is to describe the situation of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in Nepal by analyzing secondary data and information obtained from published and unpublished literature. About 97 of the total population have access to basics anitation facilities and 87 percent access to basic water supply facility. Sanitation coverage is95 percent in six Provinces and below 90 percent in Province no. 2 of Nepal. The momentum of sanitation coverage was accelerated immediately after internalization and implementation of the Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan in 2011 and Nepal reaches at close to the elimination of open defecation. The gap between rich and poor in accessing to and using toilet facility has been narrowing down due to the nationwide sanitation campaigns. But there is disparity in accessing and using piped water between rich and poor. Only 25 percent of water supply systems are well functioning and 68 percent can supply water to water taps throughout year. One-fourth of the existing toilet facility across the country are poorly constructed that needs to be upgraded. The government should make consolidated and integrated efforts to reduce existing inequity in the WASH sector and enhance the sustainability of water supply and sanitation services.</jats:p>"

Heterogeneity relates to preferences, income, wealth, and the labor market status. If each worker faces a small, possibly nonuniform wage change, the implied aggregate wage-elasticity can be represented by a closed-form expression. This expression captures an extensive and an intensive margin. We empirically implement the procedure for a dynamic model of individual labor supply and a micro panel of men in Germany from 2000 to 2013. We find that the extensive margin is less time-varying than the intensive margin, and that its size varies with the measure of reservation wages. Self-reported reservation wages render a larger extensive margin than other proxies. The estimated aggregate Frisch wage-elasticity varies between 0.85 and 1.06, and the two margins matter equally strongly for the unbalanced sample.</jats:p>",

From the early dated discoveries of Nikola Tesla, Alessandro Volta to the latest applications of electricity has made it indispensable for our daily life. The wide-ranging applications of power have made ease of living. From greenland to brownland we are dealt with the utilization of the electricity. Power generation, transmission, distribution, and efficient utilization promote the progress of a nation. Power crisis which has been abating. India suffers large deficits which need to be overcome at the earliest. We see a lot of power outages and most of the time we never know the reason behind it. Even in the 21st century, the digital age, we should not be facing this problem. One of the reasons behind the shortfall of a proper power supply is the inefficient power monitoring ensued by breakdowns, repairs and maintenance work of power plants, transformers, and transmission lines. This project is designed as the one-time solution to monitor the outages in real time without the requirement of a meatware. A power monitoring system automatically analyzes and retrieves the power quality events. The monitoring system comprises of smart grids and a centralized workstation. Smart grids contribute towards sending data of power supply status to the workstation continuously. Based on the status drawn by the grids the workstations analyze the data and intimate the electricity boards about the power outages. Thus elimination of manual summoning the designated authorities by automatic monitoring acts as the core of the proposed project. The automatic switching to an alternative resource is done by the automatic phase selector. The smart grids also promote to increase efficiency and energy conservation. The gravity of the paper is power monitoring and shift to a secondary power resource in the absence of the primary. Power monitoring acts as a preventive measure to recover the huge deficits suffered by the power crisis.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of collectors’ multiple fairness concerns on pricing decisions in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), which consists of one manufacturer, one retailer, and two collectors. Specifically, the collectors are concerned with both distributional fairness and peer-induced fairness. By considering fairness concerns and selecting Nash bargain solution as the reference point of fairness distribution, this paper studies the equilibrium solution of Stackelberg game models in the CLSC with symmetrical and asymmetrical information of fairness concerns, respectively. The results show that in the former case, distributional fairness is always at the cost of sacrificing the manufacturer’s profits, which is a means of gaining more benefits for the collectors. In the latter case, the profits of both the manufacturer and the collectors turn into a loss. No matter in which case, the collector who is concerned with both distributional and peer-induced fairness is always in a passive position. Generally speaking, whether the decision maker concerns fairness and whether it can be perceived by the CLSC members both impact the members’ decision making. Additionally, the utilities of both the manufacturer and the collectors receive Pareto improvement under the proposed incentive contract.</jats:p>"

However, little attention has been paid these problems of water quality in raw water, water treatment and household drinking water. Based on water quality data we show that the raw water sources of the Huangpu River and the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary are polluted by microbes (TBC), eutrophication (TP, TN and NH3-N), heavy metals (Fe, Mn and Hg) and organic contamination (chemical oxygen demand [COD], detergent and volatile phenols [VP]). The average concentrations of these contaminants in the Huangpu River are almost double that of the Changjiang estuary forcing a rapid shift to the Changjiang estuary for raw water. In spite of filtering and treatment, TN, NH3-N, Fe, COD and chlorine maxima of the treated water and drinking water still exceed the Chinese National Standard (GB5749). We determine that the relevant threats from water source to household water in Shanghai are: 1) eutrophication arising from highly concentrated TN, TP, COD and algal density in the raw water; 2) increasing salinity in the river estuary, especially at the Qingcaosha Reservoir (currently the major freshwater source for Shanghai); 3) more than 50% of organic constituents and by-products remain in treated water; 4) bacteria and turbidity increase in the course of water delivery to users. The analysis presents an holistic assessment of the water quality threats to metropolitan Shanghai in relation to the city&amp;rsquo;s rapid development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sustainability of global food chains and intense agricultural production has become questionable. At the same time, the consumers’ interest in short supply chains (SSCs) and direct sales from producers has increased. SSCs are connected to sustainability by researchers. Their (supposed) positive sustainability attributes are based mostly on extensive production methods and short transport distances. However, from other points of view, the economic and environmental sustainability of the short chains is questionable. Our research aims to cast light on the SSCs’ role in circular economy and sustainability. By deep literature review and content analysis, we determine the sustainability aspects of short (local) chains and their effects related to economy and environment. Short supply chains are connected most widely to circularity and sustainability by the subjects of environmental burden (transport, production method, emission), health, food quality, consumers’ behavior, producer-consumer relationships, and local economy. According to our experience, these factors cannot be generalised across all kinds of short chains. Their circular economic and sustainability features are dependent on their spatial location, type, and individual attitudes of the involved consumers and producers.</jats:p>"

One of the basic questions is why, despite numerous evidence of benefits resulting from the use of pro-environmental practices in supply chains, the level of GSCM implementations is low. Therefore, the aim of the paper is determining which barriers constitute the greatest obstacles on the way of GSCM implementation. The studies were conducted among Polish market entities. Therefore, they were prepared in the part of Europe in which there are not many studies regarding this topic. As a result of the conducted studies, it was determined that the greatest barriers for pro-environmental practices are included in the field which concerns knowledge and cost. What is more, the importance of particular barriers was specified in the paper.</jats:p>",

The study has tried to investigate the direct impact of supplier innovativeness, information sharing, and strategic sourcing on supply chain agility.&#x0D;\nMethodology: In addition to that the current study is also interested in examining the mediating role of information sharing and strategic sourcing in the relationship between supplier innovativeness and supply chain agility. The previous research studies have analysed the influence of supplier innovativeness on the performance of the firm.&#x0D;\nResults: It has been revealed through some research studies that there is a positive association among the performance of manufacturers and supplier innovativeness as well as relationship performance. Thus the current study is among the pioneering studies on this issue. Employing the survey-based methodology, the SEM-PLS technique is used to test the hypothesized relationships. So, the current study has used SEM-PLS as a statistical tool to answer the research questions raised in this study and research objectives envisaged in the current study. The findings of the study have provided support to the theoretical foundation and proposed hypothesis of the current study. Current study will be helpful for policymakers and practitioners in understanding the issues related to supply chain risk, supply chain integration and supply chain performance. In the author's knowledge this is among very few pioneering studies on this issue.</jats:p>"

Despite the tremendous interest by supply chain managers to leverage the IoT, there are still a paucity of studies that integrate the management side of supply chain with the technical side of the IoT. This chapter attempts to fill the current gap in research. This chapter discusses capabilities of the IoT-based supply chain applications. Then, it presents a conceptual framework of the IoT applications essential for smart supply chain. Finally, this chapter discusses technical and managerial challenges faced by supply chain managers in implementing the IoT. </jats:p>",

Companies and the Chinese government focus on food safety and security, as well as supply stability. The Meiyu Cooperative is a National Top 100 farmers’ cooperative in China that addresses these concerns successfully. It has established ‘a trinity cooperation mechanism’ to coordinate and integrate vegetable production, supply and sale, and financial credit. The cooperative has successfully built close relationships with farmers and companies, thus achieving financial, social, and environment benefits. This cooperation mechanism represents an innovative model for integrating the vegetable supply chain and providing necessary services based on farmers’ demands. This case study is addressed to senior undergraduate students and postgraduate students specialising in agricultural economics and can also be used for training administrators in food companies.</jats:p>",

Then the levels of access to drinking water in the localities were also determined. Finally, a diagnosis was made of the system set up in the Couffo department to monitor the implementation of municipal programming. This paper concludes that the actual construction of the works is also independent of the low access to drinking water services in the beneficiary localities at the 5% threshold. However, there is a 43.5% chance that the actual completion of the works depends on poor access to drinking water in the localities. In addition, it appears that the absence of an effective system for monitoring-evaluation of the implementation of communal planning not only favours the execution of unscheduled works but also the non-compliance with the order of priorities in localities to be equipped with WHF.</jats:p>"

Asim Rizvi has recently joined as senior supply chain manager at Food Lord, a renowned chain of restaurants in Pakistan. As instructed by his CEO, Rizvi has to take a decision for centralization, or to continue the decentralization of supply chain operations at two of their highest selling branches. These two branches were located at a distance of 125 km from each other. The objective of supply chain operations’ consolidation was to minimize cost and further improve the service level. Rizvi was confused about the decision because any decision cannot be taken on the basis of cost and benefit analysis only. A 360-degree analysis and future requirements also play a vital role to decide about supply chain operations. The CEO was very excited to take this decision; that is why newly hired manager Rizvi was analyzing all the facts to reach a decision that would be best for their business. Centralized or decentralized supply chain decision was not easy because normally the business dynamics completely change due to unpredictable customer demand, unavailability of professional suppliers and unavailability of a strong information system, etc.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Complexity academic level</jats:title>\n<jats:p>BBA and MBA</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Supplementary materials</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Teaching notes are available for educators only.

Merging four automotive data sets, we create a supply chain sample that reports the failure rate of 27,807 auto components, the location of 529 upstream component factories, and the location of 275 downstream assembly plants. We find that defect rates are higher when upstream and downstream factories are farther apart. Specifically, we estimate that increasing the distance between an upstream component factory and a downstream assembly plant by an order of magnitude increases the component’s expected defect rate by 3.9%. We find that quality improves more slowly across geographically dispersed supply chains. We also find that supply chain distance is more detrimental to quality when automakers produce early-generation models or high-end products, when they buy components with more complex configurations, or when they source from suppliers who invest relatively little in research and development.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.</jats:p>",

Coordination, cooperation and collaboration within RSCM is essential for overcoming these destructive incidents. This paper explores the research undertaken in recent years, focusing on coordination, cooperation and collaboration in the field of supply chain management (SCM) and RSCM in order to provide unique definitions of these concepts taking the disaster setting into consideration. A systematic literature review including 202 academic papers published from 1996 onwards in top journals dealing with commercial supply and relief supply chain coordination, cooperation and collaboration is applied. In order to answer the underlying research questions in a proper way, a descriptive analysis and qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the papers are conducted. Descriptive results indicate that RSCM coordination, cooperation and collaboration have increasingly shifted into the focus of scientific research since 2001/2004 (i.e., 9/11 and the Indian Ocean Tsunami). Based on the qualitative content analysis, clear definitions of the terms coordination, cooperation and collaboration in SCM and RSCM were elaborated. The research landscape, as a result of the quantitative content analysis, allowed the identification of three issues that need to be addressed in future research work.</jats:p>",

Constrained by funding, NAVSUP WSS uses the Wholesale Inventory Optimization Model (WIOM) to maximize customer service. Since demand distributions for different parts change over time, NAVSUP WSS reruns WIOM quarterly. However, large changes to the solution create an administrative burden. To deal with this problem, referred to as churn, WIOM has a persistence parameter that can discourage change from one run to the next, but it is inherently at odds with customer service performance. This research develops the Comparative Optimized Results Simulation to explore the system’s performance under different persistence settings and periodicities of running WIOM. The research finds that periodicities greater than quarterly significantly degrade customer service, and increasing the persistence parameter dramatically improves churn while only marginally degrading customer service.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing number of pharmacists in the US has generated concern regarding potential oversupply. A 2018 analysis from the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) in the US projected a best case scenario of an oversupply of more than 18,000 pharmacists in the year 2030. In this commentary, the limitations of this general health labor force analysis by the NCHWA are described. The goal of this work was to provide a more nuanced examination of the pharmacist labor demand in the US. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were utilized to examine, annually over a ten year period ending in 2017, the number of pharmacists, the ratio of pharmacists to persons living in the US, the ratio of pharmacists to older adults living in the US, and the ratio of medications to pharmacists. The number of pharmacists grew from 266,410 in 2008 to 309,330 in 2017. As anticipated, despite a growing US population, the ratio of people living in the US per pharmacist dropped unabated from 1141 to 1053 from 2008 to 2017, respectively. However, the reverse trend was observed for the ratio of persons 65 years or older per pharmacist. This ratio increased from 146.1 older adults to each pharmacist in 2008 to 164.3 in 2017. The accelerating demographic shift to an older population is also reversing an overall trend in the number of medications to pharmacist that will continue for the foreseeable future. While the ratio of medications to pharmacist dropped overall from 2008 to 2016, it has begun to rise again from 2016 to 2017. Beyond the increasing number of medications attributable to a rapidly aging population, there is a growing demand for clinical care from pharmacists due to the maturing environment of complex, costly medications for chronic disease treatment. As the portion of total health expenditure is increasingly devoted to medications and the US health delivery system continues its movement to community-based care, the demand for pharmacist care will require a larger number of pharmacists trained for advanced-practice care.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To protect civilians in the event of a bioattack, that is, the intentional release of pathogens against them to cause harm, public authorities maintain stockpiles of antibiotics. Unfortunately, a minute quantity of pathogens is sufficient to infect a large number of people. Furthermore, the treatment time window can be very short, for example, on the order of hours. Therefore, a significant amount of resources goes into maintaining a responsive antibiotics supply chain. In “Designing Response Supply Chain Against Bioattacks,” Simchi-Levi, Trichakis, and Zhang devise a decision-support framework for end-to-end supply chain design that captures logistical costs, transportation and dispensing times, and health effects of treatment delays. The authors model the problem as two-stage robust optimization on a network, which has been shown in the literature to be NP-hard. Using the so-called affinely adjustable robust counterpart, the authors are able to solve this problem on cases with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Furthermore, they prove that affine policies are optimal under certain conditions. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the efficacy of affine policies for the general problem. An illustrative and high-fidelity case study is performed to examine the biodefense supply chain design for the Strategic National Stockpile maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. </jats:p>",

The rainwater is here used for both indoor and outdoor non-potable water consumption. The study was carried out with reference to different residential building typologies (flat and condominium) in a specific local climate condition (Ancona). The buildings are characterized by different rooftop areas (100–400 m2), building floor elevations (one to three floors) and inhabitant numbers (3–54 persons). Moreover, in order to highlight the role of the tank capacity on the performance of DRWH, its capacity was changed in the range 50–200%. The combinations of all these parameters led to 276 test cases. The technical performance is evaluated by means of the water saving and retention efficiencies. The economical assessment is provided by comparing the costs and the savings due to the replacement of the water supplied with the rainwater. It is found that the payback periods changed in the range 10–35 years for the site-specific variables such as local rainfall and water service tariff. Cost–benefit analysis can help the design of DRWH systems, with particular attention to the sizing of the tank.</jats:p>",

Through field observation and questionnaire survey, a literature review was supported by an empirical study on supply chain evolution and revolution drivers, the impacts on firm performance and comparative advantages were included. The horizontal relation on the drivers of supply chain integrations was empirically investigated and tested. The primary data and field observation were collected from 21 Ethiopian basic metal industries and 91 respondents incorporated as a case company. Followed by the investigation and explored on how supply chain drivers impacts on firm performance and comparative advantage of manufacturing industries incorporated. While globalization, the digital revolution, social media throughout the society, innovation and new product developments are considered as the main drivers of supply chain evolution and revolutions. Commonly, this supply chain evolution and revolution drivers have a positive impact on firm performance and global competitiveness. Further, the result shows that depending on their type and supply chain scenario the drivers of supply chain evolution and revolution have both positive and negative impacts on firm performances and comparative advantages. Moreover paper investigated the relationship between supply chain evolution and the evolution drivers linkages o supply chain performance and comparative advantages, so that management will be able to pursue better supply chain strategies applicable directly to their business environment. Nevertheless, the study results provide the organization with innovative insights for, controlling adoption and implementation supply chain drivers in the firms. </jats:p>"

Increasing rates of urbanisation are putting more pressures on resources; influencing what foods we eat, where and when we eat them; the way our food is grown, processed and delivered to consumers; and impacting on our health and nutrition. Worldwide, interest in urban food systems and the increasing engagement of municipal government in food issues is growing rapidly as cities are largely dependent on external food sources. Food chains are growing longer, global trade is increasing and the diversity of food available to consumers is increasing. However, while urbanization presents many opportunities for smallholder producers, the lack of knowledge, resources and infrastructure continues to limit their participation in modern urban food systems. Furthermore, poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition are shifting from a rural problem to an urban problem. Urban food systems are being challenged to be more inclusive, responsive and resilient. This impacts on the need for greater investment in wholesale marketing and distribution systems, food quality and safety, transport and logistics, and improved food waste management.</jats:p>",

Although many efforts have been dedicated to develop SSG devices, the efficiency remains relatively low. Previous work was mainly focused on thermal insulation film and light absorption. Attention has seldom been concentrated on device structure. Inspired by the manner of water transportation within flowers, we designed an artificial SSG unit which can effectively speed up the water transpiration from the bulk to the surface. Another advantage of such a device is that steam generation is separated from the bulk salty solution and thereby the solar thermal evaporation can be improved greatly. As demonstrated via the desalination experiment, the mass change and evaporation rate under 1 solar irradiation can reach as high as 2.51 kg/m2 and 1.26 kg/m2·h−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaporation efficiency is 74%. These values are much higher than those of traditional SSG devices and bulk water.</jats:p>",

A detailed note on the classification of available benchmark-problems is reported. The major aim of the study is to improve the optimal solution of GYN, which can emerge as a standard benchmark-problem for future studies. On applying the developed EA models, an improved optimal cost compared with the literature is obtained for GYN. From the results, it is found that DE outshines GA by its better convergence capability and robustness in attaining an optimum solution.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the optimal government policies on closed-loop supply chains and how these policies impact the market demand and the returning strategies of manufacturers and retailers. This paper presents a design of closed-loop supply chains under government regulation by considering a novel three-stage game theoretic model. Firstly, Stackelberg models are adopted to describe the one-shot game between the manufacturer and the retailer in a local market. Secondly, based on the Stackelberg equilibriums, a repeated and dynamic population game is developed. Thirdly, the government analyzes the population game to find the optimal tax and subsidy policies in the whole market. To solve the proposed model, the idea of backward induction is adopted. The results suggest that, by collecting tax and allocating subsidy, the government can influence the market demands and return rates. The centralized supply chain structure is always preferred for the government and the market. The government prefers to allocate subsidy to low-pollution, low-profit remanufactured products. The environmental attention of the government affects the subsidy policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture and food manufacturing have a considerable effect on the environment emissions: holdings and farms play an important role about greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. This study aims at evaluating the environmental impact of one of the most important Italian DOP product: organic Parmesan Cheese. Environmental performances of the whole dairy supply chain have been assessed according to the life cycle assessment approach (LCA). In this analysis Parmesan Cheese is made from an organic dairy farm in Emilia Romagna, which uses the milk from three different organic livestock productions. Organic agriculture is different from conventional; the major difference is represented by the avoidance of the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides made in chemical industry process. Organic agriculture uses organic fertilizers to encourage the natural fertility of the soil respecting the environment and the agro-system. In this case, life cycle approach is used to assess the carbon footprint and the water footprint of organic Parmesan Cheese considering the milk and cheese production. The object at this level is investigating the environmental impact considering the situation before some improvement changes. The functional unit is represented by 1 kg of organic Parmesan Cheese; inventory data refer to the situation in year 2017 and system boundaries consider the inputs related to the cattle and dairy farm until the ripening (included). The carbon footprint is investigated using IPCC 2013 Global Warming Potential (GWP) 100a method, developed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and reported in kg of CO2eq. Otherwise, water footprint allows to measure the water consumption and in this work it is assessed using AWARE method (Available Water REmaining).</jats:p>",

However, corporate crime and harm remain under-researched themes in relation to labour exploitation, in both theoretical and empirical terms. The purpose of this article is to argue that, in the context of agricultural and food supply networks, harmful labour practices result from structural problems associated with the demand for products. Although individual employers and businesses have a role in facilitating these harmful practices, these practices also emerge from otherwise legitimate agri-food supply network dynamics, such as subcontracted labour, which results in fragmented responsibility. Therefore, labour practices have significant implications for the nature, organization and control of corporate harms, whereby harmful consequences become normalized, accepted and embedded in agri-food supply network practices. Criminological analyses of food production and contemporary markets more widely can begin to address the systemic challenges of harmful labour practices, in both domestic and global supply networks. </jats:p>",

This study develops hypotheses based the on selected literature reviews in the relevant research areas, and tests the hypotheses in the empirical sample data set collected from 76 electronics firms by using hierarchical multiple regression method.  The results of this study shows that industry-4.0 as an emerging strategic factor has not only directly helped the level of market responsiveness of the firms, but also has significantly strengthens the already proven positive causal relationship from operational integration within the supply chain to the overall market responsiveness as part of supply chain performance.  To improve the supply chain responsiveness in the electronics industry, managers can now make more confident and informed decisions to channel their resources towards the initiatives of industry-4.0 by up-grading perhaps their current information systems and business processes, knowing full well the dual benefits offered by the Industry 4.0 initiatives. The study extends the concurrent literature by conceptualising the moderating effect of industry-4.0 on the causal relationship between supply chain integration and business responsiveness. </jats:p>"

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject.  The target population was 168 heads of procurement. The 2018 NGO coordination board directory has a listing of all the 168 NGO’s spread all over the country. The study will combine two methods in its data collection that is, questionnaires and key informant interviews. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analyses were used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Results: The independent variables reported R value of .846 indicating that there is perfect relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.716 which means that 71.6% of the corresponding variation in procurement performance of the non-governmental organizations can be explained or predicted by (supplier commitment to quality,  supplier financial status, supplier technical expertise, supplier basic profile) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 1.240), p=0.00 &lt;0.05).Conclusion: The response rate of the study was 71%. The findings of the study indicated that supplier commitment to quality, supplier financial status, supplier technical expertise and supplier basic profile have a positive relationship with procurement performance of NGO’s in KenyaContribution to theory, practice and policy: the study recommended that NGO’s should embrace supplier evaluation criteria so as to improve procurement performance and further researches should to be carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

The object of the research was fruit production in the world and Poland. The study presents a diagram of the supply chain in agribusiness. A method of graphic presentation of the flow of raw materials and fruit products from producers of raw materials and means of production for agriculture to the final consumer was also used. Trends of changes in the production of fruit and their preserves are presented. The research used literature on the subject, available mass statistics data and data prepared by the Institute of Economics, Agriculture and Food Economy – the National Research Institute. Based on the research, it was found that the fruit logistics chain includes thousands of farmers, many agri-food processing units, wholesale and retail food trade. It must be very flexible, constantly adapting to the challenges of a changing, globalizing market. In conditions of dispersed fruit production, success is determined by the efficiency of chain management combined with solidarity and mutual trust of all participants in the flow of goods, information and financial resources.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply chain risk management (SCRM) begins at the foundation of any company’s capability. Whether it is in procuring rare earth minerals, securing timberland or caring for cows grazing in a field, leaders must manage risks that are not always covered by the company organisational chart. Just because these risks are outside of the corporate purview and often shared broadly does not mean firms are free from monitoring and mitigating them. There are groups, associations and councils of supply chain stakeholders that come together to help monitor and protect these types of foundational supply chain inputs. By remaining active in them and supporting them, supply chain managers continually monitor the risk and help guide mitigation strategies. Organisations employing SCRM correctly understand and monitor these risks. They employ structured SCRM frameworks that extend from mission and policy through operations to human performance development. At every level, resources are empowered to monitor and engage with their supply chain stakeholders to manage risk. At the operational level, they employ a model to identify and prioritise risks. Many use the CARVER model, made up of these steps: criticality, accessibility, recuperability, vulnerability, effect and recognisability. This paper explains how a prioritisation model applies to a foundational supply chain risk, like that of the raw materials/cattle of the beef industry. Recent and widely available data, as well as general familiarity with beef in the US, make the industry a useful example to demonstrate supply chain prioritisation and planning.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the objective of this study is to study the effect of the money supply, exchange rate, interest spread and stock market in the short and long run and volatility issue. The study employed monthly data, from January 1997 to August 2018. Method analysis is the Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and GARCH model. The findings stated that the money supply, real effective exchange rate, interest spread, had a long-run effect on the performance of the stock market. Money supply and the real effective exchange rate had a positive effect on the stock market performance in the short run. Conversely, the interest spread showed a negative influent on the stock market performance in the short run. The volatility indicated a high persistence between the money supply, real effective exchange rate, interest spread and stock market (KLCI). The implication of the study is the investors or policymakers should take account the changes of interest rate and exchange rate before making stock investment or policy to stabilize the stock market performance.Keywords: Performance, Money Supply, Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), Interest Spread</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cloud computing contracts are among the most frequently concluded contracts over the Internet. Until now, however, they have been considered mainly from the perspective of data protection and intellectual property laws. Although these analyses provide valuable insights, they do not fully cover an important area, i.e. consumer protection. The article focuses on the latter issue, taking Consumer Rights Directive as a reference point. The Directive is one of the latest acts concerning consumer protection in the European Union. It also introduces a new type of agreement that should cover cloud computing contracts. In addition, characteristically for European law, it provides for an information duty as a means of consumer protection. The article examines these two aspects by seeking an answer to the following questions: (1) do cloud computing contracts classify as contracts for the supply of digital content? And (2) do the provisions on information duty suit well cloud computing contracts? The analysis includes the results of empirical studies of these contracts. In the conclusion, the article states that the new type of contract may not significantly improve consumer protection, mainly due to the ambiguity resulting from recital 19 of the Directive. On the other hand, consumers may benefit from the provisions on information duty, though it does not directly address the main problems connected with cloud computing contracts.The article is divided into four parts. The first provides an introduction to the topic. The second discusses cloud computing contracts as contracts for the supply of digital content. The third analyses the provisions on information duty from the point of view of the contracts under consideration. Finally, the fourth summarises previous comments.</jats:p>"

Considering the influence of the environmental protection input on the whole supply chain, there are different decisions among the participants in the supply chain, and the different choices will have impacts on the benefits of the whole supply chain when manufacturers select a closed-loop supply chain model of third-party recycling. Hence, this work compared and analyzed the impact of centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making on the returns and pricing strategies of each participant. Finally, an optimized cooperative mechanism decision model considering a cost profit sharing contract was further designed. The model is conducive to obtaining the maximum profit value in centralized decision-making and avoids the negative impact of a “double marginal effect” on supply chain income in decentralized decision-making, and finally, improves the overall coordination and profit of a green closed-loop supply chain. The numerical examples are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed models. This work provides a helpful decision support and guidance for enterprises and the government on the used products recycling decisions to better manage the green closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

Melons may contaminate with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Findings of studies indicating that pathogens may transfer from the skin to the flesh of the fruit while fruit cutting. Salmonella, Listeria, Norovirus, and E. coli can easily multiply on the flesh which is low in acidity when temperature is ambient. Thus, consumption of melon in the past considered a reason of illness outbreaks. To reduce the possibility of illness, personnel and kitchen hygiene should be strictly considered during the preparation of melons for consumption. So that, it is important to take care of hygienic measure such as sufficiently large and clean working areas, clean hands, clean knives and chopping boards. These apparently simple of hygiene rules are more important since a small dose of pathogens can cause a serious infection and illness. Further, recommending to food retail stores, catering businesses and households to cut up a quantity that they can eat in a serve, and/or can sell within two hours. Households should quickly eat melons after cutting up or put in the refrigerator as quickly as possible. Cut melons which are unrefrigerated for longer time or exposed to direct sun light, should not be eaten. More attention should be given to people who are vulnerable, including, sick persons, elderly as well as small children and pregnant women.</jats:p>"

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject.  The target population was 168 heads of procurement. The 2018 NGO coordination board directory has a listing of all the 168 NGO’s spread all over the country. The study will combine two methods in its data collection that is, questionnaires and key informant interviews. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analyses were used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Results: The independent variables reported R value of .846 indicating that there is perfect relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.716 which means that 71.6% of the corresponding variation in procurement performance of the non-governmental organizations can be explained or predicted by (supplier commitment to quality,  supplier financial status, supplier technical expertise, supplier basic profile) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 1.240), p=0.00 &lt;0.05).Conclusion: The response rate of the study was 71%. The findings of the study indicated that supplier commitment to quality, supplier financial status, supplier technical expertise and supplier basic profile have a positive relationship with procurement performance of NGO’s in KenyaContribution to theory, practice and policy: the study recommended that NGO’s should embrace supplier evaluation criteria so as to improve procurement performance and further researches should to be carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is facing difficult challenges to upgrade in terms of professionalisation, productivity and technological improvements, but also to avoid exclusion of small-scale farms. This study identifies the main factors affecting the competitiveness and slowing the modernisation of the supply chain in one of the most promising and dynamic dairy production areas in the world – the mesoregion ‘Grande Fronteira do Mercosul’ in Southern Brazil. The analysis is based on the perceptions of supply chain leaders about the challenges to improving the industry’s competitiveness. The paper also presents various strategies already implemented by some actors to overcome such barriers to competitiveness. The empirical results have manifold implications. One of which is that the problems and strategies must be the target of managers and authorities in a sustainable common project of development to the benefit of the whole dairy supply chain.</jats:p>",

District heating and cooling systems are a viable solution to provide heat and cold in urban environments. Renewable heat and cold sources that may get incorporated in future urban energy systems will not provide the same high temperature output as current fossil fuel fired systems. Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) systems are decentralized, bi-directional, close to ground temperature networks that use direct exchange of warm and cold return flows and thermal storage to balance thermal demand as much as possible. 5GDHC offers a way to incorporate low temperature renewable heat sources including shallow geothermal energy, as well as reduce total demand by recuperating generated heat from cooling and generated cold from heating. The large scale of 5GDHC allows for optimal design of technical parts like heat pumps and thermal storage vessels, while increasing overall system efficiency by incorporating a large variety of supply and demand profiles. We provide a definition for 5GDHC and show how this concept differs from conventional district heating systems. The Mijnwater system in Heerlen, the Netherlands is showing what a city-level 5GDHC system can look like.</jats:p>"

The voltage, current, drainage rate, electro-osmotic transport volume, and energy consumption coefficient during the electro-osmotic process were measured and calculated. After treatment, the final soil moisture at designated positions in the test samples was measured to investigate the effects of different power supply modes. Further, the divergent phenomena observed with constant voltage and constant current were discussed. Based on an analysis of the measured energy consumption coefficients with time, we obtained a linear relationship between the applied/equivalent voltage and energy consumption coefficient. Furthermore, the electro-osmotic processes are divided into four stages by equal drainage quantity to obtain the energy consumption and electro-osmotic transport volume under different working conditions. The results reveal that the energy consumption of electro-osmosis is mainly determined by the applied voltage or the equivalent voltage for dredged sediment, while the value of electro-osmotic transport volume depends mainly on the change in soil water content rather than power supply modes. The drainage rate in constant-current mode was observed to be relatively steady, maintaining an approximately constant rate until the soil moisture was dramatically reduced. In other words, constant-current mode shows the advantages of being powerful and persistent in electro-osmotic treatment.</jats:p>"

This involves determining the best locations for charging stations in order to ensure that vehicles are charged enough for rendering a service when needed. The problem objective is to maximize the flow coverage for the electric vehicles through optimizing the number of recharging stations and their specific type at each station. Flow coverage is referred to as the ratio of car flows that are covered with regard to a special budget level. It also tries to minimize the locating cost related to these infrastructures. A genetic algorithm-based approach is proposed. Numerical application is provided, and results compared against branch and cut algorithm. The proposed approach performs better. </jats:p>",

For the purpose of avoiding excessive scour and flow choking, the slot-type flip bucket was developed. In this paper, a flow-separating slot-type flip bucket (FSSFB) is proposed on this basis, which can divide the approach flow into three branches by dividing walls, and thus generate two small, completely separated jets resulting in better energy dissipation performance and reduced scour. Based on model tests, the jet trajectory of the FSSFB is investigated. Considering the local head loss from the flow passing the dividing walls, the take-off velocity is amended for calculating the jet trajectory using the projectile method. Based on fitting analysis, the head loss coefficient is a function of the relative width b/B, the relative angle θ/β of the slot and the Froude number Fro of the approach flow. Finally, an empirical relationship for the head loss coefficient is provided, and the error in the calculation of jet trajectory is less than 10% for the FSSFB.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this chapter is to enhance the quality of food packaging and to come up with more innovative ideas and methods based on various tools of quality. Various approaches based on new (N7) and basic (B7) tools of quality namely cause and effect diagram, inter-relationship diagram, and affinity diagram have been applied to understand and eliminate the root causes of the various problems being faced by the key supply chain players in the food packaging industry. The results of the study show that the problem does not lie in the methods or techniques applied but in perspective and inclination of the management and key players of the food packaging supply chain towards the quality. </jats:p>",

The monoecious cucumber plant was used in this study to assess the responses of sex differentiation and the breeding process to nutrient supply and the degree of artificial pollination using pollen solutions of different concentrations. Results We found that the nutrient supply significantly increased the number of female flowers after pollination, although the number of female flowers did not increase with the concentration of the pollination solution. The number of male flowers did not decrease even under the low nutrient concentration; consequently, the optimal benefits under different nutrient and pollen resources in the environment were maximized when the number of female flowers decreased due to low nutrient levels after pollination. Pollination treatment affected the fruit growth, seed set, and fruit yield. However, the number of fruit, fruit set percentage, and total seeds per plant did not increase with the pollination level, although the fruit weight and seed number in one fruit did increase. The trade-offs for cucumbers associated with flower differentiation with respect to nutrient supply and pollination may not be optimal for fruit growth or seed set. Conclusions It is concluded that the response of plant flowering to external factors is direct and instantaneous, and there may not be an overall and long-term resource allocation for fruit development and seed formation.</jats:p>"

To achieve this goal a literature search was performed identifying chemical processes. These options were then analysed and evaluated considering the aspects energy density, safety, eco-friendliness, and technical feasibility of the construction. The expansion of liquified carbon dioxide with phase change achieves the best result due to its high level of safety and the simple technical feasibility of the system.

Manufacturing is contributing a critical part of noncompliance to environment and human rights in the modern society. While a lot of companies are seeking strategies to either promote corporation image or stimulate employees' work passion, most of research and guidelines are focusing on how to measure the sustainability based on the cases from big firms. Most of manufacturing firms are medium and small sized; they are searching for a comprehensive and systematical way to implement sustainability practice step by step without using very experienced professionals. This chapter is supplying a systematic framework for firms to achieve sustainability in manufacturing environment with the widely used problem solving tool Six Sigma. Inexperienced professionals will be able to implement the sustainability practice from defining problems to achieving leadership in sustainability. It illustrates how to customize the framework content based on individual needs. </jats:p>",

The methodical approach to assessing enterprises` resource potential supply of agricultural industrial production in view of their belonging to certain spheres of agribusiness is offered. Such structuring of resource potential involves a chain evaluation of its sectoral components, including within individual regions. This indicator integrates into itself the characteristics of the internal environment of the production process, taking into account the main resources of participants in agro-industrial production: land, logistical, financial, labor, innovative, informational. Provision of enterprises` resource potential  in a separate sphere of agribusiness is calculated through the calculation of the weighting factors of each type of resource and their factor indicators, followed by the calculation of the generalizing integral indicator. For each type of resources involved in agrarian-industrial production, the differentials of their weighting determined by the method of expert assessments using the parameters of qualitative assessment of the resource potential components. The differential of experts` competence optimized in order to assess the degree of their qualification in the studied field of knowledge. The method of determining the factor indicators of the components of the resource potential is based on a differentiated approach to the formation of their base of comparison. The scheme of implementation of an integrated assessment of the resource potential availability of agro-industrial enterprises is presented, which describes the rotation of stages of its implementation. On the basis of the proposed method, the growth of the integral index in Cherkasy region was diagnosed, indicating an increase in the resource potential of agro-industrial enterprises. The purpose of the article is to develop a methodology for assessing enterprises` resource potential supply of agricultural industrial production, which will provide an opportunity to assess the degree of resources` attraction, their development and the efficiency of investment in economic turnover and also solves the problem of setting indicators with different units of measurement to a single generalization.</jats:p>"

New strategies are needed to achieve change in an era of increasing urgency. This paper proposes that academics study the supply chains of individual corporations and link them to environmental and social impacts in geographically specific areas. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have used this approach successfully, issuing reports about corporate activity related to deforestation, sweatshops, and other issues of social concern. But academics, by and large, have studied generic products, industries, and sectors. To verify this, after reviewing approximately 11,000 studies on supply chains, we identified just 27 academic papers that focused on individual corporations. These were primarily by NGOs and social scientists, with no studies by industrial ecologists meeting our review criteria. To uncover corporate supply chains, researchers used two distinct methodological approaches: <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> (interviews, surveys, and surveillance) and <jats:italic>ex situ</jats:italic> (trade data, document analysis, and maps). In this paper, we explain why and how academics should study the supply chains of individual corporations. This is done by combining approaches from industrial ecology, with those from geography, sociology, and other social sciences to develop a political‐industrial ecology of supply chains. This both physically links actual product flows with their environmental impacts, and explores how they affect justice, equity, and welfare. The work we propose offers clear collaborative linkages with NGOs, industry, and the media.</jats:p>",

Combination of the above-mentioned factors resulted in 17 scenarios, and each scenario was run for a 12-hour simulation in the model. The results indicated that based on land developments, areas with more dominant agricultural land generated more TN and TP, areas with more undeveloped lands generated more TSS, and more urbanized areas generated more runoff. Moreover, the 50% urbanization scenario resulted in more runoff and pollutant loads, compared with the 20% urbanization scenario. Under scenarios with climate variability, runoff and pollutant load peaks occurred earlier in time, due to the higher intensity rainfall events. Furthermore, LIDs decreased pollutant loads up to 25%, indicating their effectiveness in decreasing the impact of urbanization on receiving water bodies.</jats:p>",

The paper first describes the changing nature of distribution resulting from the growing popularity of online shopping. The online retailer’s order characteristics and the legacy order-fulfilment strategy are then described. Next, the goals for a new order-fulfilment system are identified, and several specific recommendations for achieving those goals are discussed. The paper then describes a distributed database solution employing multimodal, batch-picking carts and optimised picking strategies. The implementation strategy is described in detail, and the results achieved by the new system are presented. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the merits of the new system relative to the stated goals. In addition to achieving impressive improvements in the speed of order fulfilment, the new system requires significantly less time to train new workers, is readily scalable to meet changing workloads, and provides ample flexibility for meeting future needs as business volume grows.</jats:p>"

However, the criterion used in the SI is difficult to adjust to satisfy local conditions and objectives. The SI also employs an ambiguous definition of value. Thus, this study adopted a water supply reliability index (WSRI) as an alternative to the SI for providing the criterion for water resources project planning. The value of the WSRI is easily understood, because it is defined according to the real water supply situation and it has a strong linear relationship with values of SI. For any given water supply system, the estimated results derived from this study could serve as an additional remark on different SI values to explain the relevant water supply considerations. In addition, for a new planning site, the estimated results of this study could provide another way for engineers to evaluate the maximum water supply capability. Consequently, an interesting avenue of investigation in future research would be the incorporation of the WSRI with the risk of deficit frequency in establishing an efficient and transparent bottom-up approach for water resources management, involving all the relevant stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The study preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analyzed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Multiple regression models were used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.Results: The F critical at 5% level of significance was 26.5. Since F calculated which can be noted from the ANOVA table above is 81.8 which is greater than the F critical (value= 26.5), this shows that the overall model was significant. The study therefore establishes that; prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups, internal compliance controls affect compliance with AGPO regulationsConclusion: The findings of the study indicated that prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups and internal compliance controls have a positive relationship with compliance with AGPO regulations for special groups among parastatals in KenyaContribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups and internal compliance controls so as to improve compliance with AGPO regulations for special groups.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Projected future shoaling of the wintertime mixed layer in the Northeast (NE) Atlantic has been shown to induce a regime shift in the main nutrient supply pathway from the Atlantic to the Northwest European Shelf (NWES) near the end of the 21st century. While reduced winter convection leads to a substantial decrease in the vertical nutrient supply and biological productivity in the open ocean, vertical mixing processes at the shelf break maintain a connection to the subpycnocline nutrient pool and thus productivity on the shelf. Here we investigate how meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) not yet taken into account impacts the mixed layer shoaling and the regime shift in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variability. To this end we have downscaled sensitivity experiments by a global earth system model for various GIS melting rates with a regionally coupled ocean-atmosphere climate system model. The model results indicate that increasing GIS meltwater discharge leads to a general intensification of the regime shift. Atlantic subpycnocline water masses mixed up at the shelf break become richer in nutrients and thus limit the projected nutrient decline on the shelf. Moreover, the stronger vertical nutrient gradient through the pycnocline results in an enhanced interannual variability of on-shelf nutrient fluxes which, however, do not significantly increase variations in nutrient concentrations and primary production on the shelf. Moreover, due to the impact of the GIS meltwater discharge on the NE Atlantic mixed layer depth, the regime shift becomes initiated earlier in the century by about 1–2 decades, depending on the discharge rate. The effect on the onset timing, though, is found to be strongly damped by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. A GIS melting rate that is even 10 times higher than expected for emission scenario RCP8.5 would lead to an onset of the regime shift not until the 2070s.\n                        </jats:p>"

Under such conditions the task of heat consumption reduction by transfer to low-temperature and use of the associated procedures is relevant.\n\nMaterials and Methods. Research was performed on the basis of residential and administration buildings designed within the whole Russia, the facilities were selected based on the year of putting into operation and their purpose. The source of data concerning buildings became documents included into the scope of the design and detailed documentation: plans, drawings and explanatory notes. As meeting the demands of hot water supply makes the main contribution to daily nonuniformities of heat energy consumption, the attention was paid to equipment of hot water supply systems. For calculations, the commercial product of Microsoft Office Excel 2010 was used.\n\nResults. During selection of roof boiler house as a source of heat supply increase in consumption of equivalent fuel in relation to the variant of connection to heat power plant operating on solid fuel by 187,314 tons of fuel oil equivalent is possible. General refusal from power-and-heat generation complicates operation of large district heat supply systems. The design parameters of coolant in building heating system differ from project to project: from 95/70 °С, used everywhere till the beginning of the XXI century, up to 90/65 °С corresponding to existing practice of designing or 80/60 °С as at the facility in Sevastopol. Reduction of design temperatures by 5 % is insufficient to decrease general heat consumption of the building. Reduction of heat consumption is explained by selection of advanced materials for pipeline heat insulation. Use of automation diagrams for heat points on the basis of regulator ECL Comfort 310 contributes to improvement of hydraulic control for heating systems, however, concealed automation results in violation of high-quality mode for heat network control and decrease of coolant parameters on adjacent (often non-automated) consumers.\n\nConclusions. Supplement of central high-quality control by local constant temperature/variable flow control at individual heat unit and installation of temperature controllers on heating radiators with mechanical thermostatic head have potential for reduction of the heat energy volume used ineffectively. Increase in level of controllability for heating system together with cheaper and responsive automation systems are basic conditions for increase in quality of heat supply in future.</jats:p>"

Our paper provides an ex-ante evaluation of the two IWB schemes, directed at stimulating the labour supply and more equal income distribution. The methodological approach combines the tax-and-benefit microsimulation model with the discrete labour supply model. Our results show that both individual and family-based IWB schemes would considerably boost labour market participation, although family-based benefits would have disincentivizing effects for the secondary earners in couples. Most of the behavioural changes take place among the poorest individuals, with significant redistributive effects.</jats:p>",

There is a lack of available sustainable arsenic removal technologies in the rural Bangladesh. This paper reports on a successful retrofit that allows for readily available, cost effective and dependable membrane system application for arsenic removal in rural Bangladesh. The retrofit is very simple, overcoming the limitation of a hydraulic pressure by a low cost pump placement in line to the membrane system. The system was field tested in a well with high arsenic concentration 0.1 mg/L (Government of Bangladesh Limit is 0.05 mg/L), along with high iron and hardness. In the field trial, the retrofitted technology was successful and produced water that does not contain any arsenic (0.0 mg/L), low in iron, and low in hardness. The system cost, along with the retrofitting, is only a hundred and seventy US dollars, a sum within the reach of many in Bangladesh. It is also important to note that we are using an existing technology available off the shelf and retrofitting it using locally available materials. The work reported in the paper will create a significant impact relief to the people in the arsenic affected regions of Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

A field study was conducted with structural questionnaires that targeted the orange supplies, traders and agricultural equipment suppliers/fabricators. Result obtained reveals that the orange handling activity is dominated by male traders. Average of 2 to 5 bags of oranges are usually handled by about 53.3% of the respondents, while 8.3% handle more than 10 bags of the oranges daily. Dan Tivi was found to be the commonest orange variety in the study area. Some other varieties established in the study area are; Dan Nassarawa, Dan Ondo and Dan Delta representing about 8.3, 1.7 and 1.7% of the varieties handled in the study area respectively. The mode of transportation, sorting, and washing was found to be manual with a lot of challenges. The predominant manual handling of the orange established in the study area could be amongst the major reasons for the high losses usually recorded by the traders on a daily basis. Thus, useful suggestions that could be employed by researchers and policymakers to provide improvements in the supply chain activities to prevent such losses are presented.  Keywords— Orange, Assessment, Supply Chain, Handling</jats:p>"

Here we examine the fit of gradual, one-way social change as it relates to the size and shape of lithic supply zones for Upper Mercer and Flint Ridge flint as well as the inflow of exotic materials. Our results show no singular cline either in the size of successive lithic supply zones or in the inflow of exotic materials. Hunter-gatherer societies can make remarkable behavioral changes through time and not necessarily in any consistent (unilineal) direction. Such differences impose more contingency—and less directionality—into particular historical sequences.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we explore how the people delivering water through water tankers shape the distribution of water across the city. Drawing on empirical descriptions of water sourcing and distribution by truck drivers, we show that who gets what water at what price is shaped by the ability of tanker drivers to act as brokers, piecing together various social and material arrangements and resorting to different rationalities and expertise. We analyze how state actors deal with tanker supply seeking to reconcile their mandates with the realities of water supply. Analyzing urban water supply through the practices of water distribution, we show the messy and open-ended character of water governance processes. A practice-based approach makes the complex interrelations between different water providers across the city visible, and underscores the role of individual and collective identities, emotions, moral norms, and unequal interdependencies between actors in shaping urban water distributions.</jats:p>"

The study preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analyzed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Multiple regression models were used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.Results: The F critical at 5% level of significance was 26.5. Since F calculated which can be noted from the ANOVA table above is 81.8 which is greater than the F critical (value= 26.5), this shows that the overall model was significant. The study therefore establishes that; prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups, internal compliance controls affect compliance with AGPO regulationsConclusion: The findings of the study indicated that prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups and internal compliance controls have a positive relationship with compliance with AGPO regulations for special groups among parastatals in KenyaContribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace prequalification criteria, opportunity awareness and sensitization, capacity of special groups and internal compliance controls so as to improve compliance with AGPO regulations for special groups.</jats:p>"

So that there are often advantages and disadvantages of raw materials during the production process, which causes changes in the budget of production costs that are not in accordance with the initial plan, resulting in decreased corporate profits. Decision Support System (SPK) is a system that can help someone in making decisions that are accurate and right on target. Many problems can be solved by using SPK, one of which is determining priorities in the supply of raw materials. There are several methods that can be used in building a DSS, including simple addtive weighting (SAW). The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is often also known as the weighted sum method, by finding the weighted sum of performance ratings for each alternative of all attributes. This study discusses the making of a decision support system as a tool for determining priorities in the supply of raw materials using the simple additive weighting (SAW) method. This application was developed with the Power Builder 8.0 programming language and Sybase SQL Anyware 5.0 as its database.

Nevertheless, farmers' engagement in SFSCs is still limited in many countries. Two studies designed to illustrate the role of competencies in the development of SFSCs are reported in this paper. The first one assessed the influence of farmers' self-perceived competencies on their willingness to participate in SFSCs. The second examined whether the engagement in SFSCs affects the levels of participants' competency needs. Study 1 revealed that willingness to participate in SFSCs is affected by the levels of farmers' competencies on issues pertaining to management, entrepreneurship, marketing, networking and cooperation. Although other factors such as farmers' citizenship behavior, their environmental concern and the perception that engagement in SFSCs can increase farm income are also associated with this willingness, self-perceived competencies represent the most important set of predictors. Study 2 uncovered that participation in SFSCs increases farmers' needs in all the above-mentioned categories of competencies. Taken together, these results indicate that farmers' competencies significantly affect their involvement in SFSCs, and that engagement in SFSCs augments competency needs, thus highlighting the importance of creating spaces that help farmers develop and exploit new capabilities.</jats:p>",

We develop an optimization model that incorporates several features, including (1) partial failure of facilities (instead of complete shutdown) resulting in interrupted supply capacity, (2) the effect of disruption on customer demand, and (3) the possibility to use multistrategies to mitigate disruption. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model to determine the optimal location of facilities and assignment of customers to opened facilities. An accelerated Benders decomposition method with valid inequalities is proposed to solve the problem. We discuss the computational efficiency of this decomposition procedure using two case studies as well as randomized data. For medium- and large-sized instances, our approach can decrease computational times by as much as 60% on average. We analyze the effect of multimitigation policies on the optimal solution and the model performance. Compared with the existing single-mitigation strategy models, we find that our model reduces the need for redundancy by as much as 50% and improves the total cost by as much as 8% in our case studies.</jats:p>",

First, it aims to reveal the basic modes of governance run by the manufacturer across the examined triadic supply chains. Secondly, the paper compares the groups of triadic supply chains, applying certain modes of governance, including network governance, in terms of the relational benefits and supply chain performance. To investigate the relationship between network governance and the supply chain performance, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Varimax Rotation was used, followed by the cluster analysis and non-parametric tests. The study showed that the triadic supply chains significantly differentiate in terms of the modes of governance. Further findings also indicated that the triadic supply chains that follow the network governance mode consider their performance to be significantly higher in comparison to the supply chains that do not run this type of governance mechanism. Firstly, the research showed that it is difficult to unequivocally reveal the pure mechanisms of governance, undistorted by the influence of another distinct mode in the triadic supply chains. On the contrary, they are more or less influenced by other modes of governance distinguished in the literature. Likewise, it is also important to highlight that the mechanism of governance is inseparably bound with a certain dyadic relationship established between two actors in the wider structure of supply chains. The study also showed that incorporating a clan as a social mechanism of governance together with a market and hierarchy results in increasing the relational benefits and overall performance for both dyads in the triadic supply chains.</jats:p>",

Various organizations seek to implement SSCM to achieve their competitive advantage. One of the important implementation activities is the identification of drivers and barriers of strategy implementation, which has been a focus area for scholars. The purpose of this paper is to identify key drivers and barriers to creating and improving sustainability in the Iranian oil and gas supply chain. However, a distinct focus on the oil industry has been the subject of limited previous attention. This study is planned to recognize and prioritize the drivers and barriers for implementation of SSCM in Iranian oil context. These drivers and barriers are presented in a form of a conceptual framework. A comprehensive literary review using metasynthesis is used to identify a number of drivers and barriers that identifies 112 drivers and 41 barriers and then evaluates using the Delphi three‐round study. The evaluation process involves 30 supply chain management experts from oil companies, and the analysis showed the important drivers and barriers for consideration in SSCM implementation. The proposed drivers and barriers enable the oil supply chain manager to identify appropriate strategies for deploying and improving SSCM implementation in the company. This study would expand the scope of SSCM research in the context of oil. In addition, the identification of drivers and barriers would be useful for industrial decision makers, policy planners, and strategic managers to recognize a set of related hurdles for effective SSCM implementation.</jats:p>",

The paper focus on a case study of the sustainability of small-town piped water systems; the main used technology in rural areas of the Volta Region in Ghana. Part of the project was the implementation of infrastructure and building capacities in the community to manage and use their system after project completion. A recent development is that CWSA is shifting from community ownership and management (COM) towards participation in management, a shift that is expected to ensure the sustainability of the water systems. The study aimed to analyze the viability of the Kwamekrom water supply system in the Volta Region of Ghana, which was under the COM system utilizing a survey mechanism. The study revealed based on performance indexes indicated that the Kwamekrom water system was not sustainable under the COM. The result was mainly due to poor financial management and lack of adequate technical expertise coupled with socio-political impact under the COM. The new reform towards participation in the management of rural water supply is, therefore, an approach which could lead to sustainability.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is very important to create a sensor system that detects contamination events in real time, maintains the reliability and efficiency of measurements, and limits the cost of the instrumentation. To this aim, two problems have to be faced: practical difficulties connected to the experimental verification of the optimal sensor configuration efficiency on real operating systems and challenges related to the reliability of the network modelling approaches, which usually neglect the dispersion and diffusion phenomena. The present study applies a numerical optimization approach using the NSGA-II genetic algorithm that was coupled with a new diffusive-dispersive hydraulic simulator. The results are compared with those of an experimental campaign on a laboratory network (Enna, Italy) equipped with a real-time water quality monitoring system and those of a full-scale real distribution network (Zandvoort, Netherlands). The results showed the importance of diffusive processes when flow velocity in the network is low. Neglecting diffusion can negatively influence the water quality sensor positioning, leading to inefficient monitoring networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to solving a practical problem: the choice of equipment for pre-treatment of salt water that feeds the desalination plant. The preliminary stage of desalination is the purification of water from sand particles, which can significantly reduce productivity and even damage the desalination plant, which is situated at the next stage. For pre-treatment, settling tanks, hydrocyclones, sand filters, etc. are used. The main dimensions of hydrocyclones of standard designs are calculated based on well-known recommendations. Modern computer simulation systems allow you to create three-dimensional models of the apparatus being studied, and then calculate the velocity and pressure fields in them. It was necessary to estimate the amount of sand contained in the feed water. To solve this problem, an experimental hydrocyclone was developed and manufactured. The hydrocyclone was numerically simulated and the sand capture coefficient was estimated under various operating conditions. It has been established that an experimental hydrocyclone reliably captures grains of sand 50 microns in size and above. The average daily mass of trapped sand was experimentally determined. Numerical modeling made it possible with reasonable accuracy to estimate the sand capture coefficient by an experimental hydrocyclone. During the tests, the mass of sand entering the pipeline per day was determined. The hydrocyclone reliably captures sand particles of 50 microns or more. At the same time, a significant part of particles less than 50 microns is not captured by the hydrocyclone, which is why a sand filter was chosen for industrial use. In the future, it is advisable to use a serial connection of a hydrocyclone and a sand filter, but such a solution requires additional technical and economic calculation. It is concluded that in the case under consideration, it is advisable to use a sand filter for preliminary water treatment</jats:p>"

Iron (Fe) delivery by the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) through ice shelf and iceberg melting enhances primary productivity in the largely iron-limited Southern Ocean (SO). To explore this fertilization capacity, we implement a simple representation of the AIS iron source in the global ocean biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. We evaluate the response of Fe, surface chlorophyll, primary production, and carbon (C) export to the magnitude and hypothesized vertical distributions of the AIS Fe fluxes. Surface Fe and chlorophyll concentrations are increased up to 24 % and 12 %, respectively, over the whole SO. The AIS Fe delivery is found to have a relatively modest impact on SO primary production and C export, which are increased by 0.063±0.036 PgC yr−1 and 0.028±0.016, respectively. However, in highly fertilized areas, primary production and C export can be increased by up to 30 % and 42 %, respectively. Icebergs are predicted to have a much larger impact on Fe, surface chlorophyll, and primary productivity than ice shelves in the SO. The response of surface Fe and chlorophyll is maximum in the Atlantic sector, northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and along the East Antarctic coast. The iceberg Fe delivery below the mixed layer may, depending on its assumed vertical distribution, fuel a non-negligible subsurface reservoir of Fe. The AIS Fe supply is effective all year round. The seasonal variations of the iceberg Fe fluxes have regional impacts that are small for annual mean primary productivity and C export at the scale of the SO.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in isolated areas which are far from the main grid has provided energy to non-electrified households. Such off-grid technology is very promising in the Asia Pacific region where increase in population and regional development has brought an increase in energy demand. This paper presents a methodology to assess the available supply of energy from solar PV systems and the corresponding demand from non-electrified areas. Non-electrified high population density areas were extracted using global population distribution and nightlight data, while the suitability of installing solar PV systems in those areas were identified based on slope, land cover and estimated solar PV power output. Moreover, the cost and benefits of installation were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity generation from PV (LCOEPV) and the percentage in the total household budget that can shoulder the said expense. Lastly, this study also proposed a novel and simple method to extract the power transmission lines (TLs) based on global road network and nightlight data used for defining off-grid areas. Results show that there are three general types of electrification trend in the region with only 11 out 28 countries exhibiting the ideal trend of decreasing population living in unlit areas with increasing GDP. This study also generated maps showing the spatial distribution of high potential areas for solar PV installation in Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as case studies. To date, the high estimated household income allotted for PV electricity is still experienced in most countries in the region, but these countries also have high initial generated electricity from PV systems. Outputs from this study can provide stakeholders with relevant information on the suitable areas for installations in the region and the expected socio-economic benefits.</jats:p>"

This includes the description of „a generic conceptual model of a retail node‟ followed by the introduction of performance indicators relevant for simulation base analysis. Hence, a concept for further studies from a practical point of view has now arisen. This article therefore introduces a new case study where the flow of products in a real company is conceptualized for simulation base analysis to raise the awareness of the organization in case of uncertainties.</jats:p>",

One major challenge which impedes the progress of attaining sustainable development of the social healthcare system in China is that the number of hospital admissions is disproportionate. Superior hospitals are overcrowded, whereas subordinate hospitals are experiencing low admissions. In this paper, we apply the game theory model to coordinate the healthcare supply chain network, which is composed of the government, medical insurance fund, superior hospitals, subordinate hospitals and patients. Especially by taking the reference price effect into account, this paper analyzes different medical insurance reimbursement strategies and their influence on patient choice and the healthcare supply chain network. The result shows that the reference price effect increases the leverage of medical insurance, guides patients’ choice, optimizes the allocation of medical resources and reduces the medical expends. In comparison to a decentralized decision- making strategy, a centralized decision- making strategy can stimulate both superior hospital and subordinate hospital’s cooperative intentions which benefits the social healthcare system.</jats:p>"

By establishing the profit distribution model of the construction supply chain, the optimal emission reduction, the construction supply chain and the maximum profits of enterprises under the two conditions of decentralization and centralization are obtained, and then the comparative analysis of the two is conducted to obtain the reasonable range of the profit distribution proportion of the construction supply chain under the centralized situation. The results show that the full partnership has a positive effect on enterprises to take action to reduce emissions, and the reasonable profit distribution proportion is helpful to the construction of supply chain profit and the improvement of enterprises’ profit.</jats:p>",

Construction industry has a high carbon footprint, the development of green building is a necessary way to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development of construction Industry. The government has formulated a series of financial subsidies policies and tax preferential policies to promote the development of green buildings. Contractors play an important role in the construction process, but there is no incentive mechanism to encourage contractors to work hard to improve the green building level. This paper studies the incentive mechanism and pricing strategy of green building under a two-level supply chain system consisting of a developer and a contractor. The optimal incentive intensity and optimal price of the developer, and optimal green level of the contractor is obtained. The results show that the incentive mechanism can not only increase the profits of the developer and the contractor but also improve the green building level, then promote the sustainable development of the construction industry.</jats:p>",

With this project, all wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated to determine wastewater reuse purposes for the first time. The results obtained from this project were that although there are 1,015 existing WWTPs, only 15 of them realized wastewater reuse. In 2017, the total volume of reused treated wastewater in Turkey amounted to 29.6 million m3/year, accounting for 0.78% of the treated urban wastewater. With the present water potential and sectoral water use rates, Turkey should make key administrative and technical regulations in the coming years for water reuse. This paper aims to give an overview of wastewater reuse activities from present status to future potential in Turkey and the opportunities and challenges in expanding water reuse. The status of WWTPs, treatment processes and their compliance with the WWTPs where reuse is carried out in Turkey are evaluated in this study. The realization of the planned goals and challenges are discussed after regulatory changes in Turkey for reclaimed wastewater and reuse targets for 2023.</jats:p>",

Sustainability is a concept that has come into picture a few years back and presently making a big mark in every field. A balanced scorecard framework is proposed for measuring sustainability performance of business organizations. Four main dimensions are considered, namely organization, process, core, and learning. Each of these dimensions comprises of various indicators obtained from global reporting initiative (GRI) and corporate social responsibility reports. The application of the sustainability scorecard is performed via multi criteria decision making technique called analytical network process (ANP). A numerical study is provided. </jats:p>",

This paper aims at designing the network of Supply Chain for R&amp;D projects. Accordingly, it proposes a Goal programming model for solving a Project-oriented Supply Chain Management problem. The proposed model is developed to determine the optimal combination of the main contractors, executers, and various alternatives for project implementation. The model optimizes time, cost and reliability in the whole lifecycle for the R&amp;D projects. A case study is presented to validate and illustrate the proposed model. The main reason for the high cost and time in the case study was due to the incorrect choice of the network of suppliers and consultants. The model has been tested by the numerical data, revealing that the model could have a significant contribution to the productivity of project-oriented organization. This model could serve as a guideline for managers and decision makers in R&amp;D projects, enabling them to identify the best networks of the SC in their organizations to resolve and improve problems. It also acts as a useful basis for researchers to continue research concerning SCM in R&amp;D projects.</jats:p>",

Labour supply decisions of mothers are found to be substantially more responsive to changes in their own wage (at intensive and extensive margins) than is the case for fathers, with minimal cross‐wage labour supply responses from fathers. Our results imply that policies increasing the wage of mothers will be associated with marked increases in labour market participation and in the working hours of mothers in the Australian labour market, with little offsetting decline in the labour supply of fathers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electricity has become one of the main driving forces for development, especially in remote areas where the lack of energy is linked to poverty. Traditionally, in these areas power is supplied by grid extension projects, which are expensive, or stand-alone systems based on fossil fuels. An actual alternative to these solutions is community micro-grid projects based on distributed renewable energy sources. However, these solutions need to introduce a holistic approach in order to be successfully implemented in real cases. The main purpose of this research work is the definition and development of a comprehensive methodology to encourage the use of decentralized renewable power systems to provide power supply to non-electrified areas. The methodology follows a top-down approach. Its main novelty is that it interlinks a macro and micro analysis dimension, considering not only the energy context of the country where the area under study is located and its development towards a sustainable scenario; but also the potential of renewable power generation, the demand side management opportunities and the socio-economic aspects involved in the final decision on what renewable energy solution would be the most appropriate for the considered location. The implementation of this methodology provides isolated areas a tool for sustainable energy development based on an environmentally friendly and socially participatory approach. Results of implementing the methodology in a case study showed the importance of introducing a holistic approach in supplying power energy to isolated areas, stating the need for involving all the different stakeholders in the decision-making process. Despite final raking on sustainable power supply solutions may vary from one area to another, the implementation of the methodology follows the same procedure, which makes it an inestimable tool for governments, private investors and local communities.</jats:p>"

The services are flexible to users as they do not have to wait in a line to pick up a bicycle from any bike sharing system and can return it to any other location of the bike sharing system. This chapter mainly focuses on why it is important to use bike sharing transportation rather than any other mode of transportation. In this chapter, the authors address the customer satisfaction level and focus on the service quality of the bike sharing system BIXI in Montreal. A questionnaire survey is conducted with the users of BIXI. A total of 580 responses are collected. Descriptive statistics, complaint analysis, and data analysis are done to identify areas of improvement. </jats:p>",

Results show that, firstly, after installing a guide wall, the Fr becomes smaller and even lower than 1.0, which means the flow status changes from supercritical to subcritical in some conditions with the help of the guide wall. Secondly, the water depth at the convex bank decreases with the increase of the relative axial radius while this presents to be adverse at the concave bank. Thirdly, for water surface differences in cross-sections, the maximum value decreases with the increase of the relative axial radius, and increases with the increase of the discharge per unit width or the bottom slope. Additionally, a novel formula for calculating the maximum water surface difference was obtained in this article.</jats:p>",

WELS is a national, government-run scheme that mandates water efficiency labelling for indoor water-using fixtures and appliances. The scheme also imposes a minimum standard for some products. The evaluation considered the environmental and economic impacts of improvements in the water efficiency of WELS-labelled products since the scheme's inception in 2006 and forecast for 20 years. The study estimated water, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and utility bill savings as well as the costs associated with the scheme. The evaluation showed WELS to be an important component of urban water management in Australia, saving 112 GL in 2017–18, across the country, and 231 GL/year by 2036–37. The largest economic benefits of WELS came from the energy saving from reduced water heating. Over 30 years, these energy savings are also expected to reduce GHG emissions by a cumulative 53.5 Mt. On average, Australians saved $A42 (US$30) per person per year in 2017–18 due to the water efficiency driven by WELS. Overall, the evaluation shows the WELS scheme to be highly beneficial for Australia with significant net benefits to the present and projected into the future.</jats:p>",

The results of the study yield that environmental and social criteria are often used together for supplier selection whereas global risk criteria are rarely used, even less as we move along multiple tiers of the supply chain. From the review, the authors also identified the top criteria along these four dimensions for global sustainable supplier selection. Along the economic dimension, the top three criteria are quality, cost, and general supplier characteristics. The social dimension has employees, transparency and engagement, and local communities' influence as the top criteria. Along the environmental dimension, the top criteria are pollution and hazardous emissions, standards and management systems, green product and design, and green competencies and processes. The top criteria along the global dimension are distance, other risks, and politics and economy.</jats:p>",

Sociotechnical tinkering not just (re)distributes water, but also provides an avenue through which powers to control water flows can be wielded and exercised. In this sense, empirical attention to sociotechnical tinkering provides a useful entry-point for rethinking the distribution of control, authority and responsibility in water governance, or more broadly the relations between power and infrastructure. This, in turn, may yield new inspirations for identifying pragmatic possibilities for progressive water politics.</jats:p>"

To analyze the technical and economic indicators of the use of wind and photovoltaic stations in the power supply systems of non-traction consumers of railway power grids.\nThe research methodology is based on modern methods of computational mathematics, statistics and information analysis using modern computer technology.\nFindings. The authors analyze the current prerequisites for the use of electricity generated from renewable sources (wind and photovoltaic stations) to supply non-traction consumers of railway power grids. The authors note that for reliable power supply to non-traction consumers in the presence of accidental wind flow or intensity of solar radiation, the capacity of wind and photovoltaic plants will need to be significantly overestimated, which leads to a significant increase in capital costs for construction. The paper presents examples of implementation of options for the construction of the above wind and photovoltaic stations for the variable nature of wind speed and intensity of solar radiation for specific regions of Ukraine (Vasylivka, Zaporizhia region). The authors present variants of the basic schemes of wind, solar and combined electric power supply systems for non-traction consumers. Information on technical and economic indicators of the most common domestic photo modules and wind turbines on the Ukrainian market is provided.\nThe originality of the work is reflected in the examples of the introduction of options for the construction of wind and photovoltaic stations for the variable nature of wind speed and intensity of solar radiation for specific regions of Ukraine.\nPractical implications. The above calculation of the cost of the required number of power sources at wind, solar and combined power plants helps to choose the least expensive option for the introduction of renewable energy sources for non-traction consumers of railway networks.\nKeywords: renewable energy sources, photovoltaic installation, railway power supply networks, non-traction consumers of railway power grids, electricity production, solar radiation intensity, wind flow rate, capital expenditures.</jats:p>",

Personal values, measuring a firm’s financial aspects for non-compliance to ethical behavior, have a positive association with unethical behavior. The relationships of top management commitment, personal values with internal employees’ unethical behavior are significant. The significant relationship between management commitment and unethical behavior can be supported by the findings as well. It was also found that ISO certificates and firm size as the control variables did not have any effect on the relationship between the independent variables and unethical behavior. The analysis also shows that ISO 26000 certificate, the international standard for socially responsible operations, does not impact this relationship.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Measuring substantial managerial effort for corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices by asking questions like, “how committed employees think top management is to social responsibility,” may not fully measure substantial managerial effort for CSR practices. To improve the results of the current study, future research can use the CSR index or disclosure as a measure to better reflect management commitment and practice for social responsibility. Second, the current study is limited to measuring how many occurrences of unethical behavior are witnessed by employees instead of what specific unethical behavior is more often witnessed. Considering India has the second largest population in the world, 181 responses may not represent the true practices in the business environment in India for generalization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The findings suggest that management should put more of an emphasis on improving the commitment of upper-level managers to decrease the overall unethical practices of their employees. The study finds that employees’ personal values influence their ethical behavior. Therefore, communications and training of employees at all levels should emphasis on improving personal values.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>Businesses should influence academics to incorporate personal value building in course curricula. The Indian CSR law should incorporate the holistic view of CSR taking care of needs of all stakeholders under the provision of the regulation. In 2015, India became the first country in the world to legislate CSR practices in corporations but it misses the opportunity to sensitize the management and employees on ethical practices as it mainly identified philanthropic expenses as mandatory CSR spending and silent on ethical business practices.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The present study contributes to the literature by bringing supply chain context to the effect of different factors on unethical behaviors and interaction of internal and vendor firms in terms of ethical practices.

Optimizing supply chain performance is a primary concern of manufacturing and logistics organizations. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is helping organizations to build automated and interconnected smart environment by object identification and tracking, motivating the first step towards an IoT-enabled world. This chapter attempts to understand extant literature studying applications of RFID in implementing the IoT in supply chain management. We categorize extant literature, firstly, based on research methodology and secondly, based on supply chain processes. We find that presently academic activity is around conceptualizing the usability of RFID in the IoT with limited analytical and empirical evidence. Supply chain processes such as demand planning, procurement, retail shelf space management and product returns are prospective areas for interesting future research.</jats:p>",

Vegetation height may vary in an area, showing a two-layer combination of high and low collocation. This study aimed to understand the effects of double-layer vegetation in different submerged states on flow resistance. Plantings of vegetation at different heights may control landslides and contribute to soil and water conservation. This study explored the water flow resistance characteristics of double-layer vegetation at different heights. A plastic bar was used to simulate rigid vegetation, and an indoor channel fixed bed experiment was used to simulate vegetation with different heights of 5 cm and 7 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm, 5 cm and 9 cm, and 5 cm and 10 cm. By analyzing the relationship between the Darcy–Weisbach resistance coefficient (f) and water depth (h), it was concluded that when the vegetation is in a non-submerged state, f and h satisfy f= 5.6427 h+ 0.0245. When the water depth just submerges the low vegetation, f changes abruptly, and f and h satisfy the relationship f= 3.4075 h + 0.0021. When the water depth is the same as the height of high vegetation, f attains the maximum value. In addition, the flow resistance f increases by 0.03 with a 1 cm increase in the vegetation height h. When the vegetation is completely submerged, f is negatively correlated with h.</jats:p>",

The problems in the ger area are a lack of a drainage system, the use of unimproved sanitation technology, and an unsafe water supply, in addition to the direct discharging of wastewater into pit latrines, soak pits, yards, and streets. The contribution of this study is the application of this method in a previously unstudied area to enhance the participation of ger communities that are absent in the development plan of Ulaanbaatar city. A field survey was conducted in one of the ger areas, the Damba planning unit, and 298 samples were collected from residents. Data were analyzed and compared using ordinary least squares (OLS) and Tobit regression models. Model results showed that the average total willingness to pay for the water supply and wastewater treatment facility installation was 1000 thousand Mongolian tugrik (MNT), and the average total willingness to pay for the operation and management costs was a maximum of 3000 MNT per month. The important factors affecting the residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for installation were the housing type, current monthly payment for water supply, income level, and education, in order of significance. People living in their own detached house and educated greater than high school were more willing to pay for the installation of water supply and wastewater treatment facilities. Those who were paying higher for their monthly water supply were more willing to pay for the installation cost. With respect to the WTP for O&amp;M cost, the WTP was associated with the family size, income level, housing, time for water access, and education, in order of significance. Families a larger number of members were more willing to pay, and low-income people were less willing to pay for O&amp;M. Education showed a positive influence on the WTP for O&amp;M. Water access time also affected the WTP of those who could not access water within 30 min, as they indicated low WTP values.</jats:p>"

A novel ventilation strategy, stratum ventilation with pulsating air supply, have potentials to improve thermal comfort in warm conditions. Experiments were conducted in a classroom mock-up with dimensions of 8.4 m (L)×5.4 m (W)×2.6 m (H) served by stratum ventilation with pulsating air supply. There are two rows, and each row can hold six occupants. Twenty-five healthy subjects (i.e., 10 males and 15 females, aged 21-36 years) were recruited to attend the experiments. All the subjects were exposed to four test conditions with different combinations of supply air temperatures, air velocities and/or periodic time. Subjects’ perceptions on thermal comfort, thermal sensation and draft perception were obtained via the questionnaires. The longer cycle time will eliminate the difference on thermal sensation between genders. The difference on draft sensation disappeared at high velocity. Males show good tolerance to thermal environment. For all the cases, more than 80% of subjects voted thermal comfort as comfortable which shows that the thermal environments produced by stratum ventilation with pulsating air supply were acceptable.</jats:p>",

The carsharing systems are facing many challenges from the design to operation stages. In the design and strategic management level, it is important to find the best location for the stations, a minimum number of vehicles and a minimum number of operating staff, and in the operation stage, the most important problem is to relocate the vehicles moved by the members among the network to maximize the satisfied demands while the system is still economical. Effective and efficient optimization technology that can respond to user's demand is one of the necessary components for a successful carsharing system.

In this chapter, the authors address the problem of supplier selection in multi-tier global supply chains with the purpose of overall quality management. A hybrid approach based on total cost of ownership (TCO) and network data envelopment analysis (DEA) is proposed. The TCO looks beyond the quoted cost to cover additional true costs related to the entire purchasing cycle. The cost categories included are quoted price, manufacturing costs, quality costs, design costs, logistics costs, after sales service, and social/environmental costs. Network DEA is used to rank the suppliers based on the TCO cost categories. The advantage of network DEA is its ability to investigate intermediate linkages between different stages of the supply chain. The results of network DEA are efficient suppliers and improvement targets for inefficient suppliers for improving overall quality in global supply chains. A numerical application is provided. </jats:p>",

To answer this, I surveyed well owners and non-well owners throughout Kansas (n = 864). The results indicate that controlling for water supplies uncovers differences across many associations between water conservation efforts and other PEBs with commonly studied demographics (sex, income, political affiliation, education, age, and geography).

Therefore, a tool is needed to monitor the rice production process from upstream to downstream (land-to-table) by implementing a traceability system to promote food transparency. In this system, all actors must be responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of products through various handling processes carried out from cultivation to product distribution. This paper aimed to develop a smart IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system in the rice supply chain using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The actors involved in the rice supply chain consist of farmers, processing industries, distributors, bulogs, and retailers. Furthermore, this paper discussed the system architecture and the development of traceability system design using a data flow diagram (DFD).

Recently, green supply chain management has gained great interest from researchers and practitioners. Consideration has been given to consider environmental factors in entire supply chain starting from procurement, production, transportation, consumption, and post-disposal of products to make the whole product life cycle green. And those companies implementing ISO 14001 are controlling and minimizing risks not only internally but also externally with their suppliers. In this chapter, the authors are benchmarking sustainability performance of suppliers using ISO 14001 and rough set QFD. For this objective, firstly they identify the requirements for green supply chain planning on the basis of ISO 14001. Then, they evaluate the suppliers on the basis of these requirements using a QFD-based approach. To handle the uncertainties arising due to lack of or limited data, rough set theory is used. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively handle imprecise information and facilitates selection of green supply chain initiatives in a structured way. </jats:p>",

It is noteworthy that in many real‐world cases, each of vertical and horizontal cooperation has an important role in the success of supply chains. Nevertheless, only vertical cooperation in most previous research is considered. This paper addresses both vertical and horizontal cooperation in two competitive reverse supply chains, each of which includes one collector, one remanufacturer, and one retailer. Our primary concern is to analyze quality improvement competition between the remanufacturers. Moreover, retail price competition between the retailers and the quality competition are simultaneously considered in the extended model. In this research, the investigated system has been analyzed under different structures including decentralized, centralized, horizontal cooperation, and coordinated decision‐making models. The results show that when the remanufacturers cooperate horizontally, the profit of each collector and that of the retailer will decrease compared with those in the decentralized structure. To overcome this problem, a new coordination contract named multiple‐link two‐part tariff is proposed to simultaneously coordinate the members of each chain. The proposed contract effectively convinces the remanufacturers to participate in the coordination model instead of the horizontal cooperation. Moreover, it provides a win–win–win condition for all chain members and improves the quality level of the remanufactured products. The results indicate the proper performance of the proposed contract in improving the benefits of the competing chains, especially when there exists no intense competition between the remanufacturers (i.e., when the market sensitivity to the quality of the remanufactured products is low and consequently less effort is needed to increase the quality of the remanufactured products). Moreover, the proposed contract not only is able to simultaneously increase both remanufactured products demand and of end‐of‐life products supply but also involves both economic and environmental benefits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, energy efficient and sustainable supply chain has attracted a great deal of attention. To achieve sustainability, it is of paramount importance to use environmentally friendly procedures in each stage of the supply chain including suppliers, production/manufacturing, and transportation. Transportation plays a critical role in supply chain since the suppliers and customers are typically distributed in large geographical areas. Nowadays, railway is considered as a primary mode of transportation. Railways are considered as complex systems that are subject to degradation and failures. To avoid failures, tremendous efforts should be invested on preventive maintenance (PM) for performing optimal maintenance actions. Proper PM actions such as condition-based maintenance (CBM) play a major role in keeping the supply chain from crumbling down and working with high efficiency. This chapter reviews promising research works in the application of state-of-the-art CBM strategies that contribute to the advancement of smart transportation system via fault diagnostics/prognostics.</jats:p>",

To maintain good operation during power failure, UPSs must have adequate energy for their operation. It depends on the reliability and performance of batteries. Owing to low capital cost and wide availability, lead-acid batteries have been used extensively as the main energy source in UPSs. Nevertheless, as batteries technology grown, Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries have offered more promising performance than lead-acid batteries; they are installed in various portable electronic devices. This paper provides an overview of the performance of lead-acid and NiMH batteries during the operation of a single-phase UPS. Their performances are studied based on 2 characteristics which are discharge curve and State of Charge (SOC). Based on those characteristics, both batteries have shown different performances. Simulation results have shown that the NiMH battery exhibits better discharge curve with higher voltage capacity and constant discharge current, and it is more reliable to obtain 12V at minimum percentage of SOC than the lead-acid battery.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Present understanding of Cu transport and metabolism is limited and inconsistent across vets and veterinary professionals. There has been much progress from the studies of the 1980s and early 1990s in cellular Cu transport and liver metabolism which has not been translated into agricultural practice. Cu metabolism operates in regulated pathways of Cu trafficking rather than in pools of Cu lability. Cu in the cell is chaperoned to enzyme production, retention within metallothionein or excretion via the Golgi into the blood. The hepatocyte differs in that Cu-containing caeruloplasmin can be synthesised to provide systemic Cu supply and excess Cu is excreted via bile. The aim of the present review is to improve understanding and highlight the relevant progress in relation to ruminants through the translation of newer findings from medicine and non-ruminant animal models into ruminants.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, a control strategy which enables active network uninterrupted transfer to islanded mode and continues its operation when the quality of supply from the utility grid is insufficient is proposed. Islanded operation is initiated based on an immunity curve, which defines the tolerance of the considered system for different voltage disturbances. The proposed strategy is based on expanding the functionality of the energy storage system and the application of a central controller. Moreover, it does not interfere with the method for control of energy sources. An original mechanism was developed and implemented to reserve power and energy in the ESS, enabling the switch to islanded mode at any time. A simulation model of the considered network was developed using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform to verify the proposed strategy. Simulation results illustrating the functioning of the state of charge storage control mechanism and demonstrating the flexible operation of the network in grid‐connected and islanded modes are provided. The results clearly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for improving the quality and reliability of power supply.</jats:p>",

To this end, we interviewed 29 senior managers from 23 New Zealand‐based companies. The key reported drivers were customer expectation, top management commitment, moral and ethical values of managers, reputation management, and economic and operational benefits. Conversely, cost concerns, strategic and structural restraints, supplier and customer issues, and a lack of effective regulations were cited as critical obstacles to SSCM implementation. Thus, the evidence from our findings provides support for both instrumental and normative logics for SSCM implementation. The findings further indicate that, in general, instrumental and normative logics are congruent; however, varied tensions arise when managers seek to simultaneously address competing yet desirable SSCM aspects. Accordingly, we argue that it is imperative to understand, work through, and manage such tensions as balancing divergent sustainability aspects holds considerable potential for successful SSCM implementation.</jats:p>",

As such, local governments play an important role in urbanization processes by coordinating land supply and population growth. Using the 2009–2013 panel data of 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, this research tests the relationship between land supply and population growth to explore the urbanization strategy adopted by local governments. Simultaneous equation models for land supply and population growth are developed in this research. Empirical results identify land supply as the cause and population growth as the effect.

The initial investments are made for quality improvement and setup cost reduction, which ultimately reduce electrical energy consumption. The inspection costs are considered in order to ensure the good qualities of the product. Centralized and decentralized strategies are used to analyze the proposed supply chain model. The main objective of this study is to reduce the overall cost through efficient electrical energy consumption in supply chain management by optimizing the lot size, the number of shipments, the setup cost, and the failure rate. A quantity-based transportation discount policy is applied to reduce the expected annual costs, and a service-level constraint is incorporated for the buyer to avoid a stockout situation. The impact of the decision variables on the expected total costs is analyzed, and sensitivity analysis is carried out. The results show a significant reduction in overall cost, with quality improvement and setup cost reduction ultimately reducing electrical energy consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\nKarachi is the most populous city in Pakistan and it plays an important role in urban demography of Pakistan. It is growing rapidly, as every fifth urban citizen lives here. This urbanization creates serious challenges for all sectors of Karachi. Especially the health sector, from demand and supply view point is facing serious challenges in terms of non-availability of qualified doctors, specifically female doctors, medicines, latest equipment, poor infrastructure, and patient’s queues belonging to other rural areas because of the lack of quality healthcare facilities, makes the public hospitals crowded and overburdened. Like all over Pakistan, public sector hospitals are very much neglected in Karachi also and needs special consideration. The focus should be on developing patient oriented supply chains for efficient patient’s care and healthcare facilities. Moreover, the case study of Qatar hospital a part of our basic research study also highlighted the depriving condition for women patients’ in Emergency Department, because only male doctors are there but female doctors are not available. Although we observed that the gender wise daily patient flow was consist of 65% females, whereas only 35% male patients. The study suggests that there is an urgent need of women doctors and paramedics staff in the public sector hospitals of suburbs of Karachi. This paper presents a synoptic view of concerns of the residents of Karachi, and identification of their selection criteria of health care facilities. The study also aimed to provide solutions and recommendations for the improvement of these facilities. Cross sectional questionnaire and random sampling with two stage clusters sampling was used to record the responses of 1991 households, 46% respondents were female and 54% were male. Among the total of 11127 respondents, only 580, (5.2 %) sought treatment in public health hospitals and, 2440 (21.9 %) visited private hospitals. Research results shows that Cost is the only significant factor because of which people opt for treatment at public healthcare facility.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A premium cost is introduced and Stackelberg game policy is employed to obtain the analytical solution. Some numerical examples are given to validate the model. Sensitivity analysis and managerial insights are given to show the applicability of the model.

Costs represent an important economic category that is closely related to the price. Each company must perfectly manage costing, especially absorption costing, which consists of budgeting overhead costs on the production (performance, products and services). Absorption costing is characterized by including indirect (overhead) costs together with direct costs of production into the calculation, i.e. it must absorb them completely into the costs. The absorption method is represented by the surcharge calculation. However, creating the calculation formula for absorption costing and the procedure of cost and price calculation have their specifics in various branches of the economy. Differences can be seen in examples of selected case studies. They deal with the representative cost and price calculation of construction work on a particular construction, cost and price calculation of the road transport and one-component and two-component cost and price calculation of the water and sewerage charges. All types of calculation must reflect the economic situation of the company marketing of a new product. The diversity of the product types mentioned above indicates the need for other inputs in the calculation and different calculation procedures. Without mastering absorption costing, it is not possible to introduce more accurate calculation methods, such as the Dynamic Calculation with Contribution Margin or in the next step implement the Balanced Scorecard. Correct absorption costing can be checked by the fact that the sum of all company production costs must correspond to the sum of the financial accounting cost accounts. However, cost control is not the subject of this article.</jats:p>",

In the current situation of the police organisation it is precisely the recruitment of warrant officers that is more of a problem – since the number of decommissioners exceeds the number of candidates, and we have not even taken into account that the knowledge and practice of those who leave the organization with many years, sometimes decades of professional experience, cannot be replaced by the mere presence of staff. It may well be asked: ‘Why is this happening?’ Also, it would be interesting to know why the warrant officers who are already members of the staff (obviously those who have already graduated from state or law enforcement higher education institutions) want to study further at a given specialisation of the National University of Public Service to become commissioned officers. Additionally, there are quite a huge number of warrant officers with these parameters in law enforcement bodies, especially police organizations. The answer could be very simple: they want to get ahead, to work in a better paying, working in a more managering position. But can this be the only way? Taking all this into account, I think it would be very timely to deal with the status, recruitment and working conditions of the subordinate (executive) staff working in the implementation as deeply as scientifically as it does for the officer.</jats:p>"

Among the various controls of HVAC systems, chiller sequencing control is of great importance for multi-chiller plant to keep cooling reliability, system stability and energy efficiency. However, conventional chiller sequencing control usually lacks consideration of system stability and the accessional cost caused by the sequencing actions. Especially, those short-time or unnecessary sequencing actions become the main reason for operators to shut down automatic control. To enhance the reliability of chiller sequencing control, a robust hybrid predictive control is developed. This control is developed based on the typical total cooling load-based control and use an ARX prediction model to double check necessity of the sequencing actions. Case studies were carried out on a TRNSYS dynamic simulation with the configuration data from a real secondary school. Results showed that the switch number can be reduced more than 20% and operation cost can be reduced up to 4.25% without scarified in thermal comfort and energy efficiency.</jats:p>",

In this regard, this study provides a multi‐objective integrated resilient‐efficient model to design a blood supply chain network under uncertainty. To evaluate the efficiency, an augmented form of the data envelopment analysis model is incorporated into the extended model. On the other hand, to improve supply chain resilience, different resiliency measures as optimization tools are introduced and inserted into the considered network. As blood donors have a main role in the blood supply chain, this paper undertakes motivational social aspects to stimulate blood donation for reducing possible shortages. Furthermore, to handle the multi‐objective problem, an interactive fuzzy approach is utilized. Finally, to indicate the applicability of the extended model and its solution approaches, a case study is provided considering realistic data. The results revealed that simultaneously considering all three measures of efficiency, resilience, and cost can assist in improvement of blood supply chain network design and a trade‐off among these three measures can be set by decision maker's preferences.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, hospitals and blood centers experience severe blood shortage due to the very limited donor population. Therefore, the necessity to forecast the blood supply to minimize outdating as well as shortage is obvious. This study aims to efficiently forecast the supply of blood components at blood centers. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Two different types of forecasting techniques, time series and machine learning algorithms, are developed and the best performing method for the given case study is determined. Under the time series, we consider the Autoregressive (AUTOREG), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Method (ESM), and Holt-Winters models. Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression are considered under the machine learning algorithms. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. We leverage five years worth of historical blood supply data from the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation (TBSF) to conduct our study. On comparing the different techniques, we found that time series forecasting methods yield better results than machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the least value of the error measures is observed in seasonal ESM and ARIMA models. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. The models developed can act as a decision support system to administrators and pathologists at blood banks, blood donation centers, and hospitals to determine their inventory policy based on the estimated future blood supply. The forecasting models developed in this study can help healthcare managers to manage blood inventory control more efficiently, thus reducing blood shortage and blood wastage.</jats:p>",

It is observed, through the multiple case study analysis that the impact of the pressures to adopt green supply chain management practices is high on Indian ceramic enterprises but the implementation of practices is in the early stage. The improvement in performance is also not found to be significant at this stage. This study also found that large ceramic enterprises are doing better than the medium enterprises in terms of green supply chain management implementation, largely because of higher pressures and availability of resources.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study prioritizes the constructs of green supply chain management pressure, practice and performance for Indian ceramic enterprises and compares the large and medium enterprises on the basis of these constructs.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The control scheme uses a single function approximator, called critic, to evaluate the optimal cost and determine the optimal switching. After offline training of the critic, which is a function of system states and elapsed time, the resulting optimal weights are used in online control, to get a smooth output AC voltage in a feedback form. Simulations show the desirable performance of this controller with linear and non‐linear loads and its relative robustness to parameter uncertainty and disturbances. Furthermore, the proposed controller is upgraded so that the inverter is suitable for single‐phase variable frequency drives. Finally, as one of the few studies in the field of ADP, the proposed controllers are implemented on a physical prototype to show the performance in practise.</jats:p>",

In this context, sustainable supplier selection plays an epochal role for taking strategic business decisions. So, a systematic approach is required to deal with the sustainable factors. By integrating the three pillars of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and social factors, this chapter presents an integrated model for supplier selection from a sustainability perspective. The proposed framework combines analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and quality function deployment (QFD) methods to deal with the sustainable criteria. Finally, suppliers are ranked using VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija kompromisno Resenja (VIKOR) method. The proposed framework is used to analyze a case study of a dairy company, but it can also be implemented for sustainable supplier selection in any industries. The study brings an artefact for managers to effectively analyze suppliers with the integrated decision-making model. </jats:p>",

The local response was to adopt a community-wide positive mental health and wellbeing initiative. This paper describes the process and achievements of the initiative called ‘Our Healthy Clarence’. Key stakeholders were interviewed at year two and relevant documents reviewed. Data were analysed using document and thematic analysis. Our Healthy Clarence was established following community consultation, including forums, interviews, surveys and workshops. It adopted a strengths-based approach to suicide prevention, encompassing positive health promotion, primary and secondary prevention activities, advocacy, and cross-sectoral collaboration. A stakeholder group formed to develop and enact a community mental health and wellbeing plan. Factors contributing to its successful implementation included a collective commitment to mental health and wellbeing, clarity of purpose, leadership support from key local partners, a paid independent coordinator, and inclusive and transparent governance. Stakeholders reported increased community agency, collaboration, optimism and willingness to discuss mental health, suicide and help-seeking. Our Healthy Clarence draws ideas from mental health care, community development and public health. This initiative could serve as a model for other communities to address suicide, self-harm and improve wellbeing on a whole-of-community scale.</jats:p>"

The influence of restraining prices in the electricity market on the financial condition of power supply companies has been shown as following: slowdown in profitability, lack of funds for the renewal and modernization of production assets, increase in transmission losses, malfunctions and reduced quality of the provided services. It has been stated that using the data of the objective assessment of financial state, it is possible to achieve an increase in the efficiency of the power supply organizations and to ensure their stable financial condition. The need to develop methods for assessing the financial status of power grid organizations, taking into account their industry characteristics has been substantiated. The method proposed in the research, which is based on using a point-rating system, involves the classification of organizations according to the type of their financial condition, according to the actual level and rating of each of the selected financial indicators in points. Approbation of the developed methods (as an example are taken the power supply organizations of the Primorsky Territory: Far Eastern Distribution Grid Company JSC, Mikhailovskagropromenergo JSC, Transfiguration Energy Networks LLC) shows their reliability. The methods provide a comprehensive and objective assessment of the financial status of power supply organizations and allow not only to identify specific shortcomings in the activities of a particular organization, but also to provide conditions for their elimination in order to sustainably develop the enterprises of the electric power industry and increase the efficiency of their operation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n              <jats:p>For a better understanding of functioning and stability of ecosystems, it is important to know to what extent constituent species show similarity in their long-term fluctuation patterns, i.e. whether their numbers and biomass frequently show simultaneous peaks and lows. Synchronic peaks and lows of important species would enhance variability in the functioning of the entire system and might affect its stability. When fluctuation patterns of individual species are largely independent, their peaks and lows would tend to extinguish each other’s effect on overall parameters (such as total zoobenthic biomass), thus promoting system stability. A long-term (46 years) monitoring study of the macrozoobenthos in a large (50 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) tidal-flat area revealed that the 4 most important bivalve species (3 suspension feeders: <jats:italic>Cerastoderma edule</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mytilus edulis</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mya arenaria</jats:italic> and 1 deposit/suspension feeder: <jats:italic>Limecola (Macoma) balthica</jats:italic>) frequently showed peak numbers of their recruits in the same years. The annual growth rates of the three suspension feeding species showed some synchrony as well. Annual survival rates, on the other hand, did not show any synchronization, wiping out the initial synchrony of numbers within less than 2 years. As a result, annual biomass values did not show any positive between-species correlations. Annual amounts of bivalves that are accessible as bird food rarely declined to levels below 5 g AFDW m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and showed limited (5 to 10 fold difference between maximal and minimal values) variation. Oystercatchers left the area quicker in late winter and showed increased death rates at very low levels of food supply. Total bivalve bird food did not show any significant long-term trend. However, biomass of <jats:italic>Mya arenaria</jats:italic> showed an increasing trend and that of <jats:italic>Limecola balthica</jats:italic> a declining trend.</jats:p>",

While reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by using of dual-screens its can significantly increase the heat stress of the furnace, the volume of the furnace chamber and the temperature of the flue gases had left unchanged. The boilers with a capacity of 1–10 MW, with the above technical design solutions of the Gas Institute of the NAS of Ukraine, with a total heat capacity of more than 60 GW, continue to be operated and produce in Ukraine and the CIS countries. Installed boilers relatively nitrogen oxide emissions comply with new EU directive (EU) 2015/2193. The using of gas slot bottom burners can reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 15 % compared to the basic factory vortex types GMG or GMGB installed on many boilers was shown. A project for the reconstruction of boilers TVG-8 (TVG-8M) and KVG-7.56 with an increase in convective surface area by replacing the factory pipe 28x3 mm with 32x3 mm had developed. Using the improved slot bottom burners in particular equipped with calibrated nozzles for precise dosing of natural gas into the air was envisaged. As a result of a research test of the reconstructed boilers for 3-5 years these technical solutions could increase the energy efficiency of existing TVG and KVG boilers up to the current European level —94–95 at rated heat output was shown.

There are various quality management practices that are currently being implemented in palm oil industry. This research attempts to identify the current quality management practices in palm oil upstream supply chain and to develop an instrument to produce quality palm oil in upstream sector. This paper presents a systematic review on quality management practices in upstream sector and the final selection comprehends 32 articles selected and comprehensively analyzed to assess quality management practices in upstream processes of palm oil supply chain. This study adds value to the current knowledge by extending organizational readiness theories. This study is relevant, practical, and useful to both practitioners and academics by providing a holistic implementation roadmap for the upstream chain to guide the managers to implement quality management practices at the organisational level.</jats:p>",

Two flat aluminium electrodes are used in monopolar arrangement for the production of coagulants. The central composite design is used as a second-order mathematical model. The model describes the change of the measured responses of turbidity removal efficiency and energy consumption according to the initial conductivity (X1), applied voltage (X2), treatment time (X3) and inter-electrode distance (X4). The evaluation of the model fit quality is done by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Fisher's F-test is used to provide information about the linear, interaction and quadratic effects of factors. Multicriteria methodology, mainly the desirability function (D), is used to determine optimal conditions. The results show that, for a maximal desirability function D = 0.79, optimal conditions estimated are X1 = 1,487 μS/cm, X2 = 5 V, X3 = 6.5 min, X4 = 14 mm. The corresponding turbidity removal rate and energy consumption are 84.15% and 0.215 kWh/m3 respectively. A confirmation study is then carried out at laboratory scale using the optimal conditions estimated. The results show a turbidity removal rate of 72.05% and an energy consumption of 0.210 kWh/m3.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the relationship among dental healthscape design elements, client emotions, and revisit intentions was investigated using a Kansei engineering-based approach. The effects of dental healthscape elements on clients’ positive emotions and the effects of positive emotions on clients’ revisit intentions were holistically examined on the basis of the stimulus–organism–response model. Through this approach, 17 elements of design, ambience, and social interaction factors that comprise the dental healthscape and 20 Kansei words used to express clients’ positive emotions regarding dental service were identified. A questionnaire survey was used to assess Kansei and revisit intention in healthscape scenarios, composed of varied design elements. Primary data were collected from 600 individuals from 2017 to 2018 throughout Taiwan. Partial least squares was applied to holistically analyze the effects of dental healthscape elements on clients’ positive emotions and the effects of positive emotions on clients’ revisit intention to generate a Kansei model for the dental healthscape. All 20 Kansei words had significant positive effects on the dental revisit intention of clients. The five positive emotions most associated with increased revisit intention were thoughtful, hopeful, tender, comfortable, and cozy. The Kansei model of the dental healthscape provides references for healthscape design that maintains positive client emotions during the dental service and results in high revisit intention. This approach can realize an emotion-centered design for dental healthscapes that promotes preventive dental care, early treatment, and effective use of medical resources, and consequently contributes to green dentistry supply chains.</jats:p>"

Efficient knowledge sharing is the basis for the collaborative operation of the supply chain. Combined with evolutionary game theory, this paper studies the evolution path and stable strategies of knowledge-sharing behavior between construction supply chain enterprises, analyzing the factors that influence the establishment of a knowledge-sharing alliance. A numerical simulation is conducted to verify theoretical results and the effects of parameter adjustments on behavioral evolution. The results indicate that under different income relationships, knowledge-sharing behavior in construction supply chains presents different evolutionary trajectories. In addition, the probability of accepting the sharing strategy is positively correlated with the penalty coefficient, incentive coefficient, trust level, and synergy coefficient and negatively correlated with cost. This study provides a new perspective and theoretical guidance for establishing stable knowledge collaboration between enterprises and promoting the sustainable development of the construction supply chain.</jats:p>"

This is a key question of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which was posed into the “FAO’s methodological and operational guide to study and understand Food Supply and Distribution Systems (FSDS) to cities in developing countries and countries in transition” in order to face the current overwhelming increase of urban population and the increasing urbanization pressures on food systems. Following some previous work in the field where it was argued that clarifying the various problems and structure behind Food Supply and Distribution Systems (FSDS) in urban environments is vital to assess policies that aim at meeting urban food needs, the purpose of this paper is to show that the methodological approach known as system dynamics modeling and simulation can lead, in terms of knowledge and/or theoretical contribution, to the unfolding of complexity in this area of research as well as bring into the analysis the relationships across a few goals of the Agenda 2030. As an additional result, we show how the developed model can be applied (case of the production of milk for consumption in the city of Bogota, Colombia) to analyze the dynamics of food supply and distribution systems in urban environments.</jats:p>"

However, the related studies have not quantified the total IWR and the imbalance of irrigation water supply and requirements in the TRB. The study analyzed the spatial-temporal variations of IWR by a modified Penman–Monteith (PM) method during 1990–2015. Five major crops—rice, wheat, maize, cotton, and fruit trees—are chosen for calculating the IWR. It was found that the IWR increased significantly, from 193.14 × 108 m3 in 1990 to 471.89 × 108 m3 in 2015, for a total increase of 278.74 × 108 m3. For the first period (1990–2002), the total IWR remained stable at 200 × 108 m3 but started to increase from 2003 onwards. Significantly more irrigation water was consumed in the oasis regions of the Tienshan Mountains (southern slope) and the Yarkand River (plains). Furthermore, there was an intensified conflict between IWR and water supply in the major sub-basins. The ratios of IWR to river discharge (IWR/Q) for the Weigan-Kuqa River Basin (WKRB), Aksu River Basin (ARB), Kaxgar River Basin (KGRB), and Yarkand River Basin (YRB) were 0.93, 0.68, 1.05, and 0.79, respectively. The IWR/Q experienced serious annual imbalances, as high flows occurred in July and August, whereas critical high IWR occurred in May and June. Seasonal water shortages further aggravate the water stress in the arid region.</jats:p>"

Prior research has drawn on both institutional and stakeholder theories to explain the adoption of codes, but no study has modeled adoption as a temporally dynamic process of diffusion. We propose that the drivers of adoption shift over time, from exclusively nonmarket to eventually market-based mechanisms as well. In an analysis of an original data set of more than 1,800 firms between the years 2006 and 2015, we find that strong nonmarket labor institutions in a firm’s home country are critical to initiating and sustaining the diffusion process. Market mechanisms, such as investor scrutiny and brand risk, emerge as important later. Contrary to prior research, we did not find a significant effect from nongovernmental organization (NGO) pressure. We conclude that markets for corporate social responsibility can and do arise, but only after they are effectuated by nonmarket institutions. </jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper examines the relationship between sustainable supply chain risks, supply chain integration, and firm’s financial performance. This study employs 296 survey observations along with financial data of published annual statements to estimate the quantitative causal-effects of three dimensions of sustainable supply chain risks on supply chain integration and financial performance. The findings of the study suggest that sustainable internal business process risks, sustainable supply risks, and sustainable demand risks have a negative relationship with supply chain integration. Furthermore, results of the study explored that all the three supply chain integration practices have a positive impact on firms’ financial performance, which suggests that implementing supply chain integration practices reduces the effect of supply chain risks and increases the firm’s performance.</jats:p>"

Two major concerns are IP theft through reverse engineering and malicious modification of the design. The latter concern in part relies on successful reverse engineering of the design as well. IC camouflaging and logic locking are two of the techniques under research that can thwart reverse engineering by end-users or foundries. However, developing low overhead locking/camouflaging schemes that can resist the ever-evolving state-of-the-art attacks has been a challenge for several years. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art with respect to locking/camouflaging techniques. We start by defining a systematic threat model for these techniques and discuss how various real-world scenarios relate to each threat model. We then discuss the evolution of generic algorithmic attacks under each threat model eventually leading to the strongest existing attacks. The article then systematizes defences and along the way discusses attacks that are more specific to certain kinds of locking/camouflaging. The article then concludes by discussing open problems and future directions.</jats:p>",

In order to improve the reliability of SMPS and reduce the manufacturing cost, this paper proposes a reliability analysis and optimization design method based on the tolerance and sensitivity analysis. Finally, this method is applied to the tolerance design for the positive switching power supply of the SMPS circuits, and the optimal tolerance design scheme is obtained.

This paper studies the SC financing problem of a capital‐constrained SME entrepreneur under two alternative financing schemes provided by an online P2P lending‐investment platform, namely debt financing (DF) and equity financing (EF). Considering the competition between a local and a foreign SC in a shared market, we investigate the direct (i.e., subsidizing domestic production) and indirect (i.e., subsidizing P2P platform service fee) roles of government intervention toward SC localization. Formulating a three‐level Stackelberg game model, this paper presents a scenario‐based decision‐making framework to jointly evaluate four different SCF scenarios through the lens of local SC, P2P financing platforms, and government. The results reveal that there exist three possible regions (i.e., DF, EF, and Conflict), within which the government and the P2P financing platforms can examine the alternative SCF schemes in order to achieve a mutually agreeable agreement. Our sensitivity analysis on interest rate and exchange ratio suggests that, when financed via an online P2P lending platform (i.e., DF), the local SC always achieves a higher profit under the direct intervention policy. The indirect policy, however, is preferred only when EF is the main source of SCF and the exchange ratio is sufficiently high.</jats:p>",

They propose a TQM-based multi-dimensional approach to improve supplier quality. They discover how the potential risks influence the performance of procurement in the supplier selection process of supplier relationship management. This chapter introduces a current supplier assessment approach by using weighted score ranking method as a single dimension mechanism for supplier selection in a specific retail industry. To estimate the efficiency of this mechanism, they use principal component analysis (PCA) statistical approach on real datasets to identify the most important factors that influence the decision-making of supplier selection. The strengths and weaknesses of this single dimension weighted ranking method are analyzed. The authors propose a total quality management (TQM)-based multi-dimensional mechanism to help the buyer identify, avoid, monitor, and reduce potential risks instead of using linear weighted score ranking method. </jats:p>",

A transportation network with two transportation modes road and sea is considered. Different scenarios are optimized and compared in terms of cost and CO2 emissions: with/without collaboration and with/without transhipment. The proposed model is applied to a case study with real data from three agri-food companies in short sea shipping context. With this model, the total cost and the total amount of CO2 emissions are reduced by using collaboration and transhipment. An experimental study was conducted to illustrate this positive impact.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> High-intensity resistance exercise (RE) increases aortic stiffness and decreases the index of myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance (Buckberg index, BI); there is a correlation between the changes in these parameters. Central hemodynamics during diastole can explain the correlation. We aimed to investigate whether the aortic diastolic decay index mediates the association between changes in aortic stiffness and BI by high-intensity RE. We evaluated the effect of high-intensity RE on aortic stiffness, BI, aortic decay index, and their associations in 52 young men. Subjects were studied under parallel experimental conditions on two separate days. The order of experiments was randomized between RE (5 sets of 10 repetitions at 75% of 1-repetition maximum) and sham control (seated rest). Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV; index of aortic stiffness), BI, and aortic decay index were measured in all subjects. Aortic decay index was quantified by fitting an exponential curve: P( t) = P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>e<jats:sup>−λ</jats:sup> <jats:sup>t</jats:sup> (where λ is decay index, P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> is end-systolic pressure and t is time from end-systole). Aortic PWV and decay index increased and BI decreased after RE. RE conditions showed that change in the aortic decay index was associated with changes in aortic PWV and changes in aortic PWV were related to changes in BI, although the PWV-BI relationship was not significant after accounting for decay index change. Mediation analysis revealed the mediating effect of the aortic decay index on the relationship between changes in aortic PWV and BI. The present findings suggest that high-intensity RE-induced aortic stiffening worsens myocardial viability by accelerating aortic diastolic exponential decay. </jats:p><jats:p> NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and diastolic decay index increased and Buckberg index (BI) decreased after resistance exercise (RE). Mediation analysis revealed a mediating effect of aortic decay index on the relationship between changes in aortic PWV and BI.

Due to increase in public awareness about environmental criteria, industries have been forced to consider environmental issues in their current production flows. Further, since the automotive industry has a direct impact on the environment, it is very beneficial to study the barriers that prevent this industry from implementing the green concept. Iran has had a considerable growth in the automotive industry in the last few decades and today owns and operates the largest automotive factory in the Middle East. In contrast, Canada as a leader in environmental issues does not have a large automotive industry, but is a country where some localized international companies have located small factories. The differences between these two countries make their comparison more valuable and noteworthy.

In this study, we aim to compare different lateral-transshipment policies for an s, S inventory control problem for a single-echelon supply chain network system. In this work, we consider a supply network with three stocking locations which may perform lateral transshipment among them when backorder takes place. We develop the simulation models of the systems in ARENA 14.5 commercial software and compare the performance of the policies by minimizing the total cost under a pre-defined fill rate constraint by using an optimization tool, OptQuest, integrated in that software. The results show that lateral transshipment works well compared to the scenario when there is no lateral transshipment policy in the network.</jats:p>"

Elevated levels of cyanotoxins in drinking water can lead to acute gastroenteritis, liver diseases, and neurotoxicity. In this study, drinking water samples were collected across the eastern part of Qatar and screened using a rapid assay to detect the presence of microcystins and nodularins. The results showed that the toxin concentrations in all the water samples were below the WHO prescribed limit of 1 μg/L. Considering a worst-case scenario, toxin removal efficiencies were evaluated using ozone and ozone-hydrogen peroxide by spiking drinking water samples with microcystin-LR (MC-LR) at different oxidant dosages, toxin concentrations, water temperatures, and total organic carbon. It was found that peroxone-treated water samples have better MC-LR removal efficiency than molecular ozone at lower oxidant dosages. Nevertheless, at higher oxidant dosages, both ozonation and peroxone oxidation methods showed a similar removal efficiency. The experimental results also clearly indicated that variation in water temperature between 22 °C and 35 °C has minimal effect on the removal efficiency in both the treatment methods. It was also confirmed that the presence of organic carbon has a more profound detrimental impact than water temperature for toxin removal.</jats:p>",

Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the metabolism of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga <jats:italic>Chlorella vulgaris</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>CZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.</jats:p>"

The model was applied to the Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) for floodwater resources utilization risk assessment. The results show that the model can utilize the risk factors of floodwater resources for identification and sorting, and then make a risk evaluation. The risk of floodwater resources utilization in a normal flow year is the lowest and the benefit is remarkable, providing a reasonable control scheme, and reducing unnecessary losses for the risk of floodwater resources utilization.</jats:p>",

Unconventional production is largely driven by drilling new wells, yielding a much larger scale of material and service flows that need to be efficiently planned. This article presents an optimization framework for the design of integrated supply chain networks (SCNs) servicing upstream operations. Novel aspects addressed in this work are the integrated planning of material and service supplies; the economies of scale in operating, transportation and capital expenditures; the concept of waiting cost to quantify production losses; and the reverse flow of materials within closed‐loop supply chains. The merits of the proposed approach are assessed through real‐world case studies from the Argentine O&amp;G industry. Optimal designs yield significant cost savings and confirm that the integrated planning of the SCN is critical for O&amp;G operators after the shale revolution.</jats:p>",

As case study, the authors propose an example in which they evaluate six potential suppliers as alternatives with five attributes. The proposed methodology integrates the nominal group technique (NGT) to weight the attributes and dimensional analysis to estimate an index of similarity to an ideal supplier. This index of similarity is obtained from the best nominal values of the attributes. This methodology can be easily applied; it is intuitive and friendly to inexpert users, since the evaluation can be performed using a traditional spreadsheet. Also, the proposal allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple attributes and can be used by hospital administrators themselves, which prevents hospitals from hiring external services. </jats:p>",

The AgNPs were greenly synthesized using culture filtrate of Bacillus endophyticus. PVA/CS membrane was prepared, integrated with washed and unwashed silver nanoparticles, and their proper integration was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analyzer (PSA) and mechanical properties. The membrane was tested against six pathogenic microbes and showed potent antimicrobial activity especially against Klebsiella pneumoniae. A tap water sample was passed through the filtration system and tested for its microbial content before and after filtration. The obtained results showed that the optical densities of the tap water before the treatment and after the passage through the PVA/CS membrane were 1.397 and 1.214, respectively, with almost 88% of the original microbial content. The optical density of the tap water after passage through PVA/CS–washed AgNPs membrane was close to zero. The repeated observations resulting from the obtained optical densities of treated and untreated water refer to the future applicability of the prepared materials and the designed system for the safe purification of microbe-contaminated water for drinking, industrial or pharmaceutical purposes.</jats:p>",

In young dogs, too high energy supply can accelerate growth and thus lead to developmental orthopaedic diseases. The aim of the present study was to collect the data on ME intake and body weight (BW) development in privately owned growing dogs in order to compare these data with the current recommendations. Our hypothesis was that the actual ME intake of healthy young dogs would be lower than the actual recommendation. The data of 493 privately owned puppies (median age at first consultation 21 weeks, the median expected mature BW 30 kg) on ME intake, actual and expected mature BW were collected and compared with recommendations of the Society of Nutrition Physiology (GfE, Meyer and Zentek and NRC). In 243 dogs, there was a follow‐up. The actual BW did not deviate systematically from the calculated expected BW (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = .929). The ME intake significantly decreased with age (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .05) and significantly increased with expected mature BW (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .05). There was no significant interaction between these two parameters (<jats:italic>p </jats:italic>&gt; .05). Sex had no effect on the ME intake (<jats:italic>p </jats:italic>&gt; .05). The ME intake of young dogs with a history of skeletal problems or of food allergy did not differ systematically from healthy dogs of similar age and expected mature BW. The ME intake was considerably below NRC recommendations, especially in younger puppies (&gt;8–17 weeks: 78%, &gt;17–26 weeks: 83% of NRC recommendation). A predictive linear equation for ME intake was developed: ME intake (MJ) = (1.063 − 0.565 × [actual BW/expected mature BW]) × actual BW<jats:sup>0.75</jats:sup>.</jats:p>",

Resulting in original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to decide between manufacturing in-house and source the either product or component from joint ventures or suppliers. As electrical vehicle differs fundamentally from fuel-based counterparts, OEM must be adaptive with their manufacturing strategies. The value creation in the design is the replacement of engine-gear system with battery. Hence, battery is the critical component to be considered in manufacturing strategy. The decision making in finding less expensive and profitable way of either making the product or buying components from a capable supplier in global competitive environment is a serious discussion.

However, these energy technologies are limited mainly by political and economic constraints of high costs and the lack of subsidy. Carbon-pricing strategies, such as carbon-emission taxes and carbon-emission trading schemes, may reduce this gap between sustainable and unsustainable energy technologies. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze both of these carbon-pricing instruments in the Mexican energy sector to promote upgrading biogas investment and to substitute liquified petroleum gas consumption using an optimization approach. Furthermore, we propose a multi-objective optimization approach to encourage investment in the biogas supply chain supported by an effective use of carbon-pricing schemes. A case study of the central western region of Mexico was made to analyze the performance of the proposed methodologies. The results show that carbon-emission taxes and carbon-emission trading systems stimulate, with some limitations, the investment in biogas projects for fossil fuel substitution. Nevertheless, using the proposed multi-objective optimization formulation leads the discovery of a more efficient use of the above-mentioned carbon-pricing schemes, thus reaching higher economic and environmental benefits than traditional carbon-pricing policies, with a lower cost/price per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.</jats:p>"

The proposed supply modulator has 600‐MHz bandwidth, which is the widest available bandwidth today. The hybrid supply modulator uses envelope tracking (ET) technique to achieve optimal efficiency. This circuit achieves high efficiency with wide bandwidth by combining the linear amplifier (LA) and the switching converter. The optimal size of the LA output stage provides a good tracking ability. The proposed hysteresis window circuit uses the simplified number of MOSFET that reduces the chip area and increases the efficiency of the overall system. This chip has been fabricated in TSMC 90‐nm CMOS processes, and the maximum tracking ability can reach to 600‐MHz sine wave. The output voltage range of the sine wave is from 0.19 to 0.79 V. The maximum load current is 122 mA. The proposed supply modulator is suitable for 5G applications.

On the other hand, farmers rejected a biomass plant if one of the following factors existed: ethical concerns about “burning hay”, satisfaction with their current oven, low availability of feedstock, or a perceived low readiness of technology. Other factors were the existence of procedural justice, trust in coordinating actors, and a demonstration plant.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The discussion shows that the specific results have to be contextualised within the innovation process for sustainable landscape management.

Its full potential as a management tool for complete water supply systems (WSSs) has yet to be recognized at the global level. A framework is developed using the modified CCME WQI to assess spatiotemporal water quality from groundwater source to treatment and distribution networks in smaller systems. The modified index resolves a limitation of the original index by also evaluating the microbiological water quality parameters which have to be completely absent for meeting desired drinking water quality standards. The framework divides the distribution network in different zones, which are further segregated into districts, to improve the decision-making process. Temporal assessment identifies the seasons with higher probabilities of failures, while the spatial assessment provides an insight on the performance (i.e., Excellent to Poor) of each district in a distribution network. In addition to failure probability, risk mapping gives appropriate attention to the number of consumers in different districts. Application of the framework on two smaller WSSs (population less than 50,000) in Qassim region revealed that the remotely located districts from the treatment facility underperform in comparison to the closely situated districts. Managers can effectively apply the proposed framework to identify the locations and periods of water quality failures in each component (i.e., source, treatment, and distribution) of a smaller WSS for effective utilization of their resources in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere with similar conditions.</jats:p>"

Materials and methods. The analysis is carried out on the basis of the results of laboratory studies of water sources of centralized drinking water supply of the population of the Republic of Khakassia, performed by accredited testing laboratories of institutions of the state sanitary and epidemiological service of the Republic for the period from 2001 to 2018, using alpha-beta radiometric, alpha-spectrometric methods with radiochemical preparation of counting samples, gamma-spectrometric method. The control levels of specific total alpha-activity of water samples from the sources of centralized drinking water supply in the Republic of Khakassia were established by the statistical maximum – the sum of the average value with a doubled standard deviation, with the volume of research more than 30, and the maximum value with the volume of research less than 30. Results. About half of the studied water samples from the sources of the centralized drinking water supply of the Republic of Khakassia, annually, are noted with exceeding the control level of specific total alpha-activity (0,2 Bq/kg). The values obtained in the studied samples vary up to 5,57 Bq/kg. During the observation period, samples of water exceeding the reference level of specific total alpha-activity (0.2 Bq/kg) were identified in settlements of the Altai, Askizsky, Beysky, Bogradsky, Ordzhonikidzevsky, Tashtypsky, Ust–Abakansky, Shira districts and the city of Sorsk, smt. Prigorsk (Chernogorsk). In previous studies, it was found that high levels of specific total alpha-activity in the country are mainly due to natural radionuclides uranium-238 (<jats:sup>238</jats:sup>U), uranium-234 (<jats:sup>234</jats:sup>U). In a number of settlements of the Republic, the sum of the ratio of specific activities of natural radionuclides to the corresponding levels of intervention exceeds 1,0. Average annual individual effective doses of internal exposure to natural radionuclides of drinking water, at or above 0,1 mSv/year (values in the range of 0,1-0,2 mSv/year), which does not require urgent radiation protection measures. At the same time, monitoring of indicators of radiation safety of water sources of water supply should be carried out in accordance with the established requirements. In this connection, in order to improve control, for the rapid assessment of the radiation situation and making timely decisions to ensure radiation safety of the population, the calculation of control levels of specific total alpha-activity was carried out. As a result of calculations, specific values of control levels for each of water source were obtained. The calculated values range from 0,2 to 2,6 Bq/kg. Conclusion. The control levels are “site standards” and are calculated for each of the source of water supply. Their excess will be considered as a signal of “negative change” of the radiation situation”, which may be associated with an increase of the specific activities of <jats:sup>234</jats:sup>U, <jats:sup>238</jats:sup>U, or the appearance of highly radiotoxic radionuclides: <jats:sup>226</jats:sup>Ra, <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po, <jats:sup>228</jats:sup>Ra.</jats:p>"

Many ancient examples form prolific hydrocarbon and freshwater reservoirs in the subsurface. One of the best areas in the world to study progradational shallow marine successions is the Campanian Book Cliffs of Utah and Colorado, where the Desert Member to Lower Castlegate Sandstone interval served as a foundational data set for early sequence stratigraphic models. A strongly progradational stack of 17 parasequences comprises the Desert–Castlegate interval. Parasequences are 6·5 to 20·7 m thick. Normally regressive coarsening‐upward successions are abundant, as are flat‐topped, rooted foreshore sandstones. Conformable facies contacts mark the transition between the laterally adjoining nearshore terrestrial and shallow marine deposits which are genetically, temporally and spatially linked. The width of the shoreface to inner shelf facies belts varies from 4·8 to 19·9 km per parasequence, with a mean of 12·6 km. Solitary tongue shoreline trajectories are all very low to low angle ascending regressive, varying from +0·0004° to +0·171°. Stacked shoreline system trajectories are also dominantly low angle ascending regressive, with only two descending regressive trajectories, one of which intersects the depositional slope. The predominance of ascending regressive shoreline trajectories and normal regression, rarity of high frequency sequence boundaries, regressive surfaces of marine erosion and descending regressive shoreline trajectories, and absence of third‐order sequence boundaries, incised valley fill deposits and no prolonged and regionally extensive sediment bypass, all point towards increasing sediment supply as the dominant driver of the Desert–Castlegate stratal architectures, while reduced accommodation (i.e. decreasing tectonic subsidence) played a secondary role.</jats:p>",

The main goal of this study is to analyze the possible alternatives for electricity supply and demand, fuel consumption, and the future structure of the Ecuadorian power generation system to transform the current system based on petroleum fuels into a sustainable system that consumes natural gas, and progressively introduces renewable power generation plants such as solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric until 2040. According to the estimated results through the inclusion of sustainable energy policies, S3 scenario relative to S1 scenario could reduce the average CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions by 11.72%, the average production costs by 9.78%, and the average petroleum fuel consumption by 15.95%.

Power supply devices are an essential component of bioelectronics to ensure their robust performance.

The fact that biological organisms are soft, curvilinear, and have limited accommodation space poses new challenges for power supply systems to minimize the interface mismatch and still offer sufficient power to meet clinical‐grade applications. Here, recent advances in state‐of‐the‐art nonconventional power options for implantable electronics, specifically, miniaturized, flexible, or biodegradable power systems are reviewed. Material strategies and architectural design of a broad array of power devices are discussed, including energy storage systems (batteries and supercapacitors), power devices which harvest sources from the human body (biofuel cells, devices utilizing biopotentials, piezoelectric harvesters, triboelectric devices, and thermoelectric devices), and energy transfer devices which utilize sources in the surrounding environment (ultrasonic energy harvesters, inductive coupling/radiofrequency energy harvesters, and photovoltaic devices).

Since new conditions increasingly point to a limited water supply, the aim of modern irrigation management is to be sure to maximize the crop yield and minimize water use. This study aims to explore the advantages of the traditional agronomic approach, agro-hydrological model and field feedback obtained by spectroscopy, to optimize irrigation water management in the example of a cotton field. The study was conducted for two summer growing seasons in 2015 and 2016 in Kibbutz Hazorea, near Haifa, Israel. The irrigation schedule was developed by farmers using weather forecasts and corrected by the results of field inspections. The Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model was applied to optimize seasonal water distribution based on different criteria (critical soil pressure head and allowable daily stress). A new optimization algorithm for irrigation schedules by weather forecasts and vegetation indices was developed and presented in this paper. A few indices related to physical parameters and plant health (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index 2, and Photochemical Reflectance Index) were considered. Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index proves itself as a suitable parameter for monitoring crop state due to its clear-cut response to irrigation treatments and was introduced in the developed algorithm. The performance of the considered irrigation scheduling approaches was assessed by a simulation model application for cotton fields in 2016. The results show, that the irrigation schedule developed by farmers did not compensate for the absence of precipitation in spring, which led to long-term lack of water during crop development. The optimization developed by SWAP allows determining the minimal amount of water which ensures appropriate yield. However, this approach could not take into account the non-linear effect of the lack of water at specific phenological stages on the yield. The new algorithm uses the minimal sufficient seasonal amount of water obtained from SWAP optimization. The approach designed allows one to prevent critical stress in cotton and distribute water in conformity with agronomic practice.</jats:p>"

The fundamental component of load current is found by employing RT‐EMD, which decomposes the distorted non‐linear sample into a finite number of fine‐scale signals termed as intrinsic mode function (IMF). Each IMF is extracted adopting continuous calculation of upper and lower envelopes using a series pipeline structure which decreases the computational complexity. The proposed control algorithm takes the positive sequence voltage component for generating the desired reference so that the system can operate in non‐sinusoidal grid voltage conditions. The proposed control algorithm adopts carrier‐based modulation scheme for switching of the inverter module.

A robust adaptive immune system requires effector T cells to respond and adapt to fluctuations in environmental nutrient levels imposed by infectious and inflammatory sites in different tissues. Inevitably, such responsiveness and adaptation reflect metabolic plasticity, allowing T cells to elicit immune functions by using a wide range of nutrient substrates. Here, we show that effector T cells utilize inosine, as an alternative substrate, to support cell growth and function in the absence of glucose. T cells metabolize inosine into hypoxanthine and phosphorylated ribose by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Using Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM), we demonstrated that ribose moiety of inosine can enter into central metabolic pathways to provide ATP and biosynthetic precursors. Accordingly, the dependence of T cells on extracellular glucose for growth and effector functions can be relieved by inosine. On the other hand, cancer cells display diverse capacity to utilize inosine as a carbon resource. Moreover, the supplement of inosine enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of immune-checkpoint blockade or adoptive T cell transfer, reflecting the capability of inosine in relieving tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

The heat flux from combustion chamber to glass tank, temperature distribution of glass furnace, and the glass convection flow are presented, which influences the performance of glass furnace. The glass quality is evaluated with the melting index and mixing index, while the efficiencies of batch melting process and fining process are evaluated with the sand dissolution index and fining index, respectively. The results show that the method of increasing fuel supply is appropriate and efficient to increase the production less than 650 t/d. To further increase production about 700 t/d, the method of introducing electric power is preferred on the condition that the glass quality and lifetime of glass furnace are ensured. Optimization of furnace design and electric boosting parameters are required for the production more than 700 t/d. This investigation is expected to guide the optimized design of glass furnace to increase glass production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present food system faces major challenges in terms of sustainable development along social, economic and environmental dimensions. These challenges are often associated with industrialised production processes and longer and less transparent distribution chains. Thus, closer distribution systems through Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) may be considered as a sustainable alternative. This study explores the role of different types of SFSCs and their contribution to sustainability through participants’ (consumers, retailers and producers) views and perceptions. As part of the European H2020 project “Strength2Food” we conducted a cross-case analysis and examined 12 European SFSC cases from six countries: France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland and the UK. We applied a mixed method approach including primary data collection, via in-depth interviews and customer surveys, as well as desk research. The findings suggest that, irrespective of the type of SFSC, a strong agreement among the participants were found on the contribution of SFSCs to social sustainability. However, participants’ views considerably differ regarding the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. These differences relate to the way the SFSCs were organised and to some degrees to regional differences attributed to the significance of SFSC in different parts of Europe. The article concludes that the spatial heterogeneity of SFSCs, including supply chain actor differences, different types and organisational forms of SFSCs as well as regional and territorial characteristics, must be taken into account and further emphasised in future policies aimed at strengthening European food chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

Bejiharjo Village, one of tourism villages in Indonesia, seeks to implement tourism industrialization by improving the village competitive advantages despite the traditional community life. One of the strategies of the tourism village in improving its competitiveness is the implementation of effective Tourism Supply Chain Management (TSCM). Tourism Groups (pokdarwis) of Dewa Bejo have been appointed by Bejiharjo Village Government to manage the village tourism destination by implementing the strategy. However, the implementation faced some obstacles due to the struggle of power involving the tourism groups which compete to obtain control over the management of Goa Pindul Karst Area. The main issues addressed in this research are the way the struggle for power among the groups becomes an obstacle in supply chain management and the possible solutions for such a problem. The ethnographic research employed observations and in-depth interviews with 11 tourism groups and the village government. The findings reveal that the struggle for power among the groups has become the main obstacle in the optimization of tourism supply chain management. The role of the government and the involvement of various parties are needed for addressing and overcoming the struggle for power so that more effective supply chain management can be realized for improving tourism.</jats:p>"

The effects of WIP with nitrogen-reduction on population quality, annual yield and nitrogen use efficiency were studied by a field experiment. WIP could maintain or increase the annual yield of rice production models. The highest annual yield of more-water-saving irrigation practice (WIP150) was 8.42 t hm−2 for the double-season rice production model and 12.71 t hm−2 for the ratoon rice production model, respectively. Compared with non-application of nitrogen, the annual yield of nitrogen-reducing practice (NRP) and farms' fertilizer practice (FFP) increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.01), while a non-significant difference of annual yield between the FFP and NRP was observed; the annual yield of the NRP and FFP was 9.73 and 10.02 t hm−2 of the double-season rice production model, and 12.84 and 14.34 t hm−2 of the ratoon rice production model, respectively. AEN, PEN, PFPN and RUEN of the NRP were higher than those of the FFP. Therefore, observing the change of water layer in the soil layer via a simple self-made PVC indicator tube, reducing about 20% nitrogen quantity was a feasible and simple cultivation technique for water-saving and nitrogen-reduction in the rice production models.</jats:p>",

Since the monthly runoff series during 1956–2016 is a time series with change points, it is necessary to find a new stochastic streamflow series generation approach to preserve the statistical characteristics of the original series and to refine the reliability of water supply risk analysis. This paper improves a known stochastic streamflow simulation method of previous research to better reflect the characteristics of series with change points. And this paper simulates the monthly runoff series with change point of Panjiakou reservoir during 1956–2016 by three different methods, including Thomas–Fiering model, copula function stochastic simulation method, and copula function stochastic simulation method with the mixed distribution model. Among the three methods, the copula function stochastic simulation method with the mixed distribution model which is improved on the basis of copula function stochastic simulation method in this study performs best in simulating the observed monthly runoff series during 1956–2016, and the water supply risk indices including reliability (time-based and volume-based), resilience, vulnerability, drought risk index (DRI), and sustainability index (SUI) are evaluated for Panjiakou reservoir and analyzed by using the stochastic simulation results. By comparing with the previous studies, all indicators are between the corresponding results of 1956–1979 and 1980–2016 with stationary inflows; it can be seen that change point seriously affects the water supply risk of Panjiakou reservoir. These results make it easy to formulate water supply strategies and schemes in changing environment for water resources managers.</jats:p>",

Zebrafish were exposed to three different sub-lethal concentrations of endosulfan and imidacloprid along with control selected for each treatment for 21 days: control treatment (CT), treatment 1 (T1), treatment 2 (T2) and treatment 3 (T3). T1, T2 and T3 groups were exposed to 0.1, 0.5 and 1 μg/L of endosulfan, respectively, while imidacloprid concentration was maintained at 1 ppm in all three treatments. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Comet assay was applied to measure degree of DNA damage. Dose- and time-dependent decrease in SOD and CAT activity was observed after 21 days of exposure while low concentrations of pesticides induced SOD and CAT activities after early exposure to reduce the oxidative stress. MDA content was found to be increased in T3 having high concentrations of pesticides. Substantial increase in DNA damage was noticed after 21 days' exposure to pesticides. Significant morphological changes were observed in gills relative to muscles.</jats:p>",

Inventory constitutes of current assets/ working capital of the organization. Thus, it is very essential to have suitable control over inventories. The purpose of inventory management is to ensure availability of parts in sufficient numbers as and when required and also to minimize the accumulation. The main objective of this paper is to devise an inventory management method for spare parts management system in order to utilize the space effectively and to stabilize FIFO system which would help the company personnel to keep record of spares precisely. A three dimensional approach is performed using sales order line frequency, seasonal frequency and sales value through ABC analysis. In addition to this, four different procurement techniques are adopted viz., one bin, two bins, multi bins and zero bin. Demand variation is measured for a period of last one year and this parameter is included during the calculation of the inventory maintenance. It is evident that a large amount of money is saved without compromising the customer order fulfilment.</jats:p>"

This paper quantifies the adaptability of vehicle fleets to changes in supply route characteristics defined by route distance, threat level, and damage probability. Each characteristic is discretized into three levels, and the adaptability analysis is performed over 27 scenarios with significantly different characteristics. Fleet adaptability is measured in terms of two fleet-level metrics, namely the total fleet mass (which is correlated to the total cost) and the personnel requirements. Results show that modularity improves adaptability in terms of total fleet mass compared with a conventional approach, while providing a comparable adaptability in terms of personnel requirements. A sensitivity analysis is also performed on module characteristics of the modular fleet. This analysis shows that changes in relatively small parts of the system can change the values of performance metrics substantially. </jats:p>",

In this paper, following the game-theoretical approach, we derive an optimal Ramsey pricing scheme to resolve these conflicts. We try to compare traditional supply chain management models with an optimal Ramsey pricing scheme, with an enforcement of coordination among firms. Using simulation techniques, we compute numerical estimates under three regimes: a standard equilibrium decision framework, a coordination decision model and a coordinated Ramsey pricing scheme. Our results show the relative welfare impact of different settings, revealing that the optimal pricing scheme based on the two-part tariff structure cannot only improve social welfare, but also ensure a target profit for participating firms. Lastly, our findings have strong policy implications for the government with profit regulation and the control of water resources.</jats:p>"

In the meantime, according to the downstream furcated estuary water level in different typical years, the diversion flow ratio under different frequencies was calculated by using a mathematical model of the water environment. The results show that the diversion flow ratio of a branch channel increases with the increase of water level difference, and the growth rate decreases gradually. The other branch channel diversion flow ratio decreases with the increase of water level difference, and the decreasing rate decreases gradually. The pollutant concentrations in the bifurcated rivers are equal, but the concentration decreases exponentially with the increase of the upstream flow. Under different rainfall frequencies, the diversion pollutant ratio and diversion flow ratio are equal in different months of different years.</jats:p>",

However, because supply chains are complex systems, strong, competent leaders are needed to drive continuous improvement efforts. This paper documents the learnings from a supply chain leadership intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which aimed to build leadership capacity in a cross-tier group of central/provincial/district-level leaders. The intervention, called the Leadership in Supply Chain Initiative, used an experiential learning curriculum to train 19 ‘champions’ in Equateur Province, DRC. Based on self-assessments and key informant interviews, participants reported that the intervention increased their ability to lead change in the supply chain. In particular, participants and stakeholders noted that empowering district managers as leaders in the supply chain was important to improve supply chain performance, since they oversee service delivery points and are responsible for operationalising changes in the supply chain. Moreover, this intervention adds to evidence that leadership capacity is most effectively gained through experiential learning coupled with mentorship and coaching. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal duration of leadership building interventions and to better understand how supply chain leaders can be supported and mentored within the public health system.</jats:p>",

However, the selection process of supply chain is often inevitably affected by multiperspective factors, e.g., societal and economic properties. Thus, multicriteria decision‐making as an effective method is needed. This article establishes a systematic hierarchical structure of multiperspective indices for SCM of automotive manufacturing industry including economic, environmental, societal, and technical properties. An integrated method that combines gray relational analysis and analytic hierarchy process is applied to select the optimal pattern of supply chain. An empirical case about three types of supply chain for automotive manufacturing industry is applied to test the effectiveness of multicriteria decision‐making method and the hierarchical structure. In addition, a comparison with other methods and a sensitivity analysis are conducted to validate the reliability of this research. The results show this method can be effectively used in the decision‐making process of SCM in the automotive manufacturing industry. © 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Methods: it was conducted an exploratory analysis of data from Sistema de Informações Gerenciais da Execução Orçamentária (Sigeo) and Sistema de Informação de Orçamento Público em Saúde (Siops) from 2010 to 2018. Results: in this period, DTLM in SP exceeded 11 billion of reais, showing a downward trend in global values and percentage share in relation to total health expenditure (from 11.32% in 2010 to 8.95% in 2018). From 2016 to 2018, 17% of DTLM were destined to lawsuits (R$ 679,935,967.31), with a growing trend. Discussion: the representativeness of judicialized drugs in DTLM warns of cost issues, but also for patient safety and sustainability of public health policies, because this list also includes new drugs, which have not been proved superior in effectiveness and safety yet, comparing to available alternatives, and/or off label use. Conclusions: the legal demands for medicines have not led to an increase in the allocation of funds for their purchase, but to competition for resources originally destinated for the pharmaceutical services policy, with a reduction in the percentage participation of medicines from SUS official lists each year.</jats:p>"

The proposed single-ended PA with an internal balanced configuration can achieve a power supply rejection ratio of 9.5 to 65.9 dB at 0.1 to 3.5 GHz, which is around a 12 to 37 dB improvement compared to a conventional single-ended PA with the same power gain. The results show that the proposed PA has a gain of 15.5 dB, an output-referred 1 dB gain compression point of 13 dBm, an output intercept point of 22 dBm with a 5 MHz frequency offset, an output saturated power of 15.4 dBm, and a peak power-added efficiency of 15%. The implemented PA consumes a DC current of 72 mA under 1.8 V supply. The core chip size is 0.65 mm2 without pads.</jats:p>"

In this context, significant PV business and research and development (R&amp;D) efforts shift towards establishing a more sustainable, environmentally friendly and economically viable end‐of‐life (EoL) management for PV modules: including recycling, recovery of raw materials, repair/refurbishment and even re‐use of decommissioned or failed PV modules. In the CIRCUSOL project, PV partners aspire to formalize the repair/refurbish and re‐use value chains in the PV industry and propose a circular business model, based on a <jats:italic>product‐service system</jats:italic> (PSS). Towards these goals, this review study introduces the relevant research groundwork, a status overview and today's R&amp;D and business challenges in PV recycling, repair/refurbishment and re‐certification aspects for second‐life PV modules. The topics and the relevant reported literature are examined from both circular economy and technology perspective. The review indicates a considerable technological and operational know‐how in PV EoL management that already exists and continuously evolves in mature PV markets. On the other hand, R&amp;D in repair/refurbishment of decommissioned and/or failed PV modules remains scarce, and best practices and commercial services for reliability testing/re‐certification and trading of second‐life PV modules are neither standardized nor consolidated into any PSS or business model.</jats:p>",

Knowledge enabled Supply chain process actually increases the efficiency of business processes, as well as communication and collaboration among the employees. Rapid changes in the product and process innovation and customer demands are increasing the requirement for usable knowledge. Learning is very essential for the organizations but not sufficient requirement for improving its performance. Performance can be improved by sharing updated knowledge among the supply chain process and functioning through knowledge management tools. Improved performance also resulted from feeding data into software applications to derive algorithms for better decision making. This research is descriptive. The constructs and the variables were derived from past research and literature review. The question we sought to answer with this study was how to create the best connection between the business environment knowledge base and the SC management processes in order to reach optimal organizational performance. A relationship model has been developed using the PLS SEM tool to clarify that how by enabling knowledge management in the supply chain process facilitates the ability of online businesses to maintain competitiveness and productivity in an ever-changing business environment. A theoretical model was developed within a framework of supply chain learning and the variables were empirically tested by structural equation modelling using a sample of online sales organizations in India the results verified that organizations can enhance performance when they implement a systematic process for acquiring and applying knowledge in the SCM process. It is furthermore suggested that customer involvement should be actively sought through a variety of online promotions and services, and their interaction and feedback should be frequently evaluated.</jats:p>"

This study analyzed and compared the endogenous respiration process in an attached growth membrane bioreactor (aMBR) system and a UV/O3 integrated aMBR system (UV/O3-aMBR) in treating polluted surface water with CODMn around 10 mg/L. The endogenous respiration activity of heterotrophic microbes and autotrophic nitrifiers activity in both systems was analyzed and compared. Results show that heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic nitrifiers enter endogenous respiration at 6 h aeration in an aMBR and 0 h in a UV/O3-aMBR system. Biomass amount on PVA-gel in aMBR was higher than in UV/O3-aMBR in terms of specific respiration rates SOURt, SOURH, and SOURA. Substrate remained on PVA-gel in the aMBR system, but no substrate remained on PVA-gel in the UV/O3-aMBR system. Higher species of microbes, including recoverable and irrecoverable components, existed in the aMBR system as compared to the UV/O3-aMBR system. The UV/O3-aMBR system could make full use of the advanced oxidation process (AOP) and biological process, leading to a higher treatment performance, and has the potential to mitigate total energy demand. Thus, the UV/O3-aMBR system can be used as a new technology for treating polluted surface water with the co-contribution of biological process and AOP treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimization of dry ash flow is an important aspect in the field of dry ash conveying system in power plant. Material pickup and conveying to desired distance at desired rate with minimum conveying medium (air) is a primarily requirement of any pneumatic conveying dry ash system. Though it looks simple task to determine parameters of conveying medium i.e. air flow but significant challenges poses while designing air parameters at Material pickup point and to maintain to convey desired throughput to conveying distance. In today’s prevalent designs / technology for pneumatic dry ash conveying system, it uses valve as controlling device in air supply system. But such system of using valve as controlling device has certain drawbacks like a) Malfunctioning of valve due to moisture &amp; ash accumulation leading to system failure. b) Unstable operation due to high vibration and temperature Compressed air is used for instruments control purpose as well as a conveying medium. Air is a compressible gas which makes controlling difficult when specific parameters needed at certain location depending on the ash collection rate &amp; accordingly distribution piping layout. At such locations, we need a device i.e orifice in place of valve for the same in order to achieve the desired result. In general most of system designed for two stages 1) Air storage to maintain desired air parameters passing through system. 2) In 2nd phase of pneumatic conveying air supply lines, we require fine controlling of air parameters for air supply to multiple points / ash hoppers (108 Nos). Air required in system operation is controlled by valves in prevalent designs but due to drawbacks of valve (malfunction, high initial cost and high maintenance cost of valves), orifice is one of the most commonly used element in flow regulation because of its simple structure, construction, easy installation and reliable performance (as no moving part) the orifice is increasingly adopted in air supply lines of dry ash pneumatic conveying system. The work present experimental investigation of dry ash pneumatic conveying system using multiple hole orifice in conveying air supply line to enhance flow uniformity and mass distribution downstream of manifolds or at pickup point of material as a distributors at Koradi Thermal Power Plant and result where compare with previous data and the study is extended for different parameters like conveying pressure and fluidizing pressure mean in particle size of dry ash, orifice numbers, thickness of orifice and place of orifice mounting along with corresponding loading ratio. A new approach of modeling on similar pipe line configuration since scaling is not required, it has provided better accuracy and approximation when the result was compared with experimental data. This method of online experimentation is aimed to address the partial filling of pipe's cross section by the dune of dry ash which requires high volume conveying air, or sometimes chocking of section occurs due to large volume of dry fly ash. To handle these problems, online experimentation has proved to be a better method than test conducted on test rig setup for representation of the optimum flow conditions, especially such complex mode of dense-phase pneumatic conveying of fine powders like dry fly ash materials.</jats:p>"

Machine learning techniques have recently been introduced for phishing detection. With the recent rapid development of deep learning techniques, many deep-learning-based recognition methods have also been explored to improve classification performance. This paper proposes a light-weight deep learning algorithm to detect the malicious URLs and enable a real-time and energy-saving phishing detection sensor.

In order to make the evaluation of irrigation water use efficiency indicators more comprehensive and scientific, this paper constructs a new optimal model of evaluation indicators. By combining the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model with the Information Significance Difference (ISD) evaluation indicators model, a novel DPSIR-ISD evaluation indicators combination model was constructed. Ten riverside irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain of northeastern China were selected for analysis. The results show that the DPSIR-ISD model was used to reduce the number of indicators from 44 to 14; these 14 indicators reflected 91.88% of the original information. The DPSIR-ISD method proposed in this paper takes into account the completeness and simplicity of the indicators system, and is more in line with the actual situation in the field. These results can provide a simpler and more convenient system for optimizing indicators for the study of evaluation indicators used to analyze irrigation water use efficiency.</jats:p>",

The results challenge the idea that variability of permeability within a landslide is secondary. Consequently, it cannot be assessed through single representative values. It was found that its variability spans two orders of magnitude, a consequence of it being influenced by both morphology and regolith properties. Identification of zones that display comparable behavior can be done through assessment of remote-sensing images collected by drones, as growth patterns of vegetation correspond well with zones that displayed similar permeability coefficients within the landslide body. Furthermore, extensive variability of permeability was caused by a diverse range of seepage mechanisms, namely pipe network flow, interface network seepage and pore water seepage. Thus, the hydraulic behavior of large landslide bodies is remarkably complex.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The pressure fluctuation in the hydraulic pipeline in the electro-hydraulic variable valve mechanism will cause the instability of the oil pressure in the hydraulic chamber, thereby making the valve movement characteristics unpredictable, which can affect the adjustment function of the valve mechanism to the air intake, and further affect the combustion, emission, and fuel consumption of the engine. In this article, a simulation model is established for the working process of a certain type of marine diesel engine’s electro-hydraulic variable valve system, and the simulation and experiment are combined to study the influence of the hydraulic oil supply pressure P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> (10–13 MPa) and the maximum opening d (2.5–4 mm) of the electromagnetic valve on the upstream instantaneous pressure variation of the hydraulic circuit of the electromagnetic valve. The fluctuation curve of instantaneous pressure variation is divided into three stages (I<jats:sub> a–b</jats:sub>, II<jats:sub> b–c–d</jats:sub>, and III<jats:sub> d–e</jats:sub>), and the characteristic values ( P<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>, P<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>, P<jats:sub>c</jats:sub>, P<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>, P<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>) and characteristic phases ( β<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>, β<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>, β<jats:sub>c</jats:sub>, β<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>, β<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>) at the inflection point of the fluctuation curve are selected to describe the influence of the hydraulic oil supply pressure and the maximum opening of the inlet electromagnetic valve on the upstream instantaneous pressure variation of the hydraulic circuit of the electromagnetic valve. The result shows that the decrease in the characteristic parameters P<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> and P<jats:sub>c</jats:sub> values and the increase in the P<jats:sub>b</jats:sub> and P<jats:sub>d</jats:sub> values increase with the increase in the oil supply pressure and the maximum opening. When the maximum opening is constant, the decrease in the characteristic parameter P<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> value increases with the increase in the oil supply pressure; when the oil supply pressure remains unchanged, the difference in the characteristic parameter P<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> value is less than 0.04 MPa at different maximum openings, which is hardly affected by the maximum opening; and the influence of the oil supply pressure and the maximum opening on the characteristic phase β<jats:sub>a-e</jats:sub> is very different. </jats:p>",

From the early dated discoveries of Nikola Tesla, Alessandro Volta to the latest applications of electricity has made it indispensable for our daily life. The wide-ranging applications of power have made ease of living. From greenland to brownland we are dealt with the utilization of the electricity. Power generation, transmission, distribution, and efficient utilization promote the progress of a nation. Power crisis which has been abating. India suffers large deficits which need to be overcome at the earliest. We see a lot of power outages and most of the time we never know the reason behind it. Even in the 21st century, the digital age, we should not be facing this problem. One of the reasons behind the shortfall of a proper power supply is the inefficient power monitoring ensued by breakdowns, repairs and maintenance work of power plants, transformers, and transmission lines. This project is designed as the one-time solution to monitor the outages in real time without the requirement of a meatware. A power monitoring system automatically analyzes and retrieves the power quality events. The monitoring system comprises of smart grids and a centralized workstation. Smart grids contribute towards sending data of power supply status to the workstation continuously. Based on the status drawn by the grids the workstations analyze the data and intimate the electricity boards about the power outages. Thus elimination of manual summoning the designated authorities by automatic monitoring acts as the core of the proposed project. The automatic switching to an alternative resource is done by the automatic phase selector. The smart grids also promote to increase efficiency and energy conservation. The gravity of the paper is power monitoring and shift to a secondary power resource in the absence of the primary. Power monitoring acts as a preventive measure to recover the huge deficits suffered by the power crisis.</jats:p>"

Internet of things has been finding relevance in today’s service sector as a significant impetus to superior service delivery and advanced service proposition to customers. Healthcare sector is also no exception. This study taking data from the Indian healthcare sector attempts to check the relationship between IoT adoption and proposed service delivery gains experienced by healthcare organizations (if any). The study based on the theoretical premises of cybernetic control theory and technology adoption model by Davis, Hypothesized that IoT adoption must positively influence flexibility and agility and in turn, flexibility positively influence readiness. The empirical evidence supports these hypotheses, and all the findings validate the propositions that healthcare organizations and the players and actors involved in healthcare consider IoT adoption as pivotal. Because the survey outcomes establish path analysis linkages through Structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM results highlight the significant positive impact of IoT adoption on flexibility and agility and in turn, even stronger association and effects of flexibility on readiness in the services offered by healthcare organizations. This study outcomes are very vital for hospital managers and upcoming healthcare practitioners as it establishes empirical evidence supporting IoT adoption as a helpful step and prominent success factor for better flexible patient care delivery and agility.</jats:p>"

However, little is known about how this vital ATP transport occurs across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca2+-antagonized mechanism, or CaATiER (Ca2+-Antagonized Transport into ER). Significantly, we show that mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and a SERCA-dependent Ca2+ gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER, through SLC35B1/AXER. We propose that under physiological conditions, increases in cytosolic Ca2+ inhibit ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP uptake from mitochondria into the ER. These findings suggest that ATP usage in the ER may increase mitochondrial OxPhos while decreasing glycolysis, i.e. an ‘anti-Warburg’ effect.</jats:p>"
