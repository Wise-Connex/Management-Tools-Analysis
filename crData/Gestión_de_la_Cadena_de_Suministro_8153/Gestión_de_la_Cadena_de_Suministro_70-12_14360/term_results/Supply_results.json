      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the dry summer 1969 the effect of irrigation and supply of available nitrogen on the production of dry matter and on the N, P, K, Mg, and Ca content of the aerial parts of spring wheat was studied on the basis of samples collected at various stages of development from a field trial. Shoots collected from the irrigated plots (30 mm water on June 9 and 30 mm water on June 17) in the middle and at the end of June had a higher content of all the nutrients studied than those from the nonirrigated plots although at the latter date also the dry matter yield was markedly increased by irrigation. Later, the larger production of dry matter on the irrigated plots decreased this difference and resulted in equal or even somewhat lower contens of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca in the ears and straw, and also in the grains. An improvement in the supply of available nitrogen tended to increase the dry matter yield and the content of K, Mg, and Ca in the vegetative parts of the plant; the N content was increased also in the ears and grains. The positive interaction of water and nitrogen supply was distinct in the production of dry matter and in the uptake of nutrients. The high grain yields produced by irrigation and good or very good nitrogen supply were attributed, at least partly, to the more intensive uptake of nutrients during the period of vigorous growth in June. It was emphasized that the improvement of the efficiency of plant production by irrigation and placement of fertilizers may result in an impoverishment of the soil of other nutrients.</jats:p>"

All solutions contained the essential amino acids in proportions suggested by ROSE (1949)<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>or by SWENDSEID and DUNN (1956)<jats:sup>48</jats:sup>. They also contained 1‐histidine and 1‐arginine. To this basic content were added four or five of the amino acids 1‐alanine, 1‐arginine, 1‐aspartic acid, 1‐glutamic acid, glycine or 1‐proline in different mutual proportions. In the first series of experiments the entire quantity of 1‐amino acids corresponded to 10 g of nitrogen per day for two consecutive days. In the second part of these studies different quantities of one of these solutions were infused.</jats:p><jats:p>In the first series, no significant differences could be detected between the effect of the different solutions. In the second series, the groups receiving 10 and 14 g of amino acid nitrogen per day showed a higher nutritive value than the groups receiving 6 and 8 g per day.</jats:p><jats:p>From the reported results and from results previously published by other investigators and by the present author and co‐workers, it was concluded that the following amino acids should be suitable for parenteral nitrogen nutrition (beside the essential ones): 1‐arginine, 1‐histidine, 1‐alanine, 1‐proline, 1‐aspartic acid and glycine. The highest nitrogen balance was achieved by use of a dose of 10 g of amino acid nitrogen.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG</jats:title><jats:p>An freiwilligen gesunden Versuchspersonen wurde nach intravenoser Infusion verschiedener Aminosauregemische die Wirkung auf die Stickstoffbilanz, der nutritive Wert, sowie die Ausscheidung von Harnstoff‐ und a‐Aminostick‐stofT untersucht.
