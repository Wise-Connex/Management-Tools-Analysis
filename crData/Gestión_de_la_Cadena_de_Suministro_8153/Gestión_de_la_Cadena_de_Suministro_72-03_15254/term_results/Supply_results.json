      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bud growth on isolated rhizomes of Agropyron repens showed a basipetal gradient of decreasing activity and was strongly inhibited at the basal nodes. This evident polarity was correlated with a gradient of decreasing nitrogen content at successively older nodes and with an apparent translocation of nitrogen from the basal to the apical nodes. Isolating the buds from one another reduced growth of the apical buds and prolonged the growth of buds at the basal nodes so that the polarity of bud growth, although still apparent, was much reduced.Supplying nitrogen as NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> through the cut end of rhizomes still attached to the parent plant caused apical buds to develop as shoots instead of rhizomes. Increasing the nitrogen supply to the rooting medium extended this response to buds at older nodes, restricting rhizome production to basal buds whose growth was inhibited in low nitrogen rhizomes.Buds developing as shoots had a considerably higher total nitrogen and moisture content and a lower dry weight than buds developing as rhizomes.The results emphasized the importance of the nitrogen supply not only in determining the polarity of bud growth and the degree of correlative inhibition, but also as a morphogenetic factor controlling bud development. </jats:p>",

Growth of roots, sheaths, and blades was restricted when plants were exposed to rootzone temperatures of 15 or 20 C and P levels of 2 or 9 ppm P, compared to growth at 25 C and 30 ppm P. Concentration of total P in all plant parts was as great at 15 as at 25 C. The harmful effects of low root‐zone temperature were not overcome by the application of higher P rates. Concentration of inorganic P and the fraction of total P that was inorganic P were higher at the lower temperature for shoots and P‐deficient roots. Free sugar levels in roots were lower at 25 than at 15 C at all P levels. Sugar levels in sheaths and blades, however, were lower at the higher temperature only under P‐deficient conditions. Concentrations of aconitate and soluble amino acids were highest at 15 C, irrespective of P supply. Since metabolism of photosynthate to the level of organic and amino acids was not impeded by low root‐zone temperature, it is suggested that low temperature stress was depressing growth by restricting incorporation of amino acids into protein.</jats:p>",
