Each variety was grown with and without irrigation and lodging was controlled with artificial supports.   Under natural rainfall, Mexico 120 yielded more than the standard-height varieties but the late-flowering selection yielded least of all. With irrigation, however, both semi-dwarf varieties showed a yield advantage. Features of the semi-dwarf wheats were shorter culms and longer ears, a larger proportion of car weight at anthesis, more grains set and a greater ratio of grain yield to post-anthesis leaf area. The significance of these and other factors is discussed in relation to wheat improvement in the Australian environment.</jats:p>"

In the first trifoliate leaves the concentration of total isoflavones (formononetin+genistein+ biochanin A) was approximately doubled at low nitrogen supply. Biochanin A was much less affected than the other two isoflavones. The increase in isoflavone contents of nitrogen-deficient leaves was associated with decreased protein synthesis, but not always with increased sugar contents. The supply of carbon substrates for isoflavone synthesis may depend on starch as well as sugar contents. Practical implications of the results are considered briefly.</jats:p>"
