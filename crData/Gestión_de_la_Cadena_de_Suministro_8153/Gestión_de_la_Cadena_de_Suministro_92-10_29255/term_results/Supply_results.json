The supply/demand situation for new petroleum engineering graduates is forecast to worsen in the next two years. Total engineering employment in die upstream sector by large producing companies is expected to decrease by around 15% from 1991 to 1992 and then remain fairly flat through 1994. Employment by the independent and service company sectors is projected to remain flat to slightly increasing, but accounts for a small fraction of total on-campus petroleum engineering hiring. The number of petroleum engineering graduates in 1992–93 is forecast to increase by 30% over 1991–92. during a time when the supply/demand situation is already tightening.</jats:p>",

As we saw in Chapter 2, sections 3 and 4, these articles had a manifold purpose: first they sought to define those hypotheses concerning speculation that, in a competitive market, were necessary in order to validate Keynes’s principle of savings-investment re-equilibrium via changes in income rather than in the rate of interest; secondly, they sought to define the relations that held between the short-term rate of interest and the demand for money and between short- and long-term rates; finally, they sought to define the conditions that must apply if the rate of money interest is to represent the standard to which returns on other assets must conform, and the conditions that must be fulfilled for the rate of money interest to influence the level of activity. It was this latter aspect, the so-called ‘trans mission principle’, that forms the link between these strictly analytical considerations and monetary policy. It is, therefore, a convenient point to start from before we move to analysis of what Kaldor held to be the determinants of the demand for and the supply of money.</jats:p>",

The result is a contradiction between strategy and structures.

The system control is by nature an on‐off type. The optimal scheduling problem can be formulated as dynamical optimal control problems with purely discrete symbols, discrete controls and also with continuous intermediate variables interrelated in a highly non‐linear way. An efficient problem solver is proposed. Its high efficiency is achieved by exploiting, through a suitable decomposition, certain structural properties of the problem. Lagrange relaxation is applied in order to break down the time structure of discrete control variables. The decomposition also enables consideration of mixed integer optimization on purely static grounds. The dynamical optimization constitutes only that part of the solver which deals with entirely continuous variables. There is a duality gap in the problem. However, certain, but not complete, information obtained through solving the dual problem (dual optimal information) is close to that which corresponds to the true (primal) optimal solution. This is an important property of the scheduling problem, which together with the problem structure creates a basis for the solver design.</jats:p>",

Adopting the viewpoint of a policy maker who aims at minimizing the expected cost of security of supply, optimal simultaneous adjustments of oil stocks and electric production capacities to exogenous changes such as economic growth are derived. Against this benchmark, one-dimensional rules such as “oil reserves for 90 days” turn out to be not only suboptimal but also to foster adjustments that exacerbate suboptimality. </jats:p>",

The resulting regenerative outgrowths were mostly rod shaped and consisted of a cartlaginous core, in which the base was ossified, and muscle elongated distally along the cartilage, the whole being covered by connective tissue and skin. The tip of the regenerating muscle reached a point distally about one third of the length of the regenerative outgrowths. When the innervation of forelimb stumps was augmented by surgical diversion of the ipsilateral sciatic nerve, the amputated limbs regenerated mostly as spatula‐shaped outgrowths, which were longer those of normally innervated forelimbs. Such hyperinnervated regenerates exhibited less ossification of cartilage, or sometimes none at all. However, the regeneration of muscle was more extensive. That is, it reached more than half way along the regenerative outgrowth. Furthermore, denervation resulted in the absence of regeneration in all cases examined. Theses results clearly indicate that limb regeneration in <jats:italic>Rana rugosa</jats:italic> is dependent upon the degree of innervation, not only for the early stages of regeneration, but also for the growth and differentiation of the regenerative outgrowth. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A series of psychophysical lifting studies was conducted to establish maximum acceptable weights of lift (MAWL) for three supply items commonly handled in underground coal mines (rock dust bags, ventilation stopping blocks, and crib blocks). Each study utilized 12 subjects, all of whom had considerable experience working in underground coal mines. Effects of lifting in four postures (standing, stooping under a 1.5 m ceiling, stooping under a 1.2 m ceiling, and kneeling) were investigated together with four lifting conditions (combinations of lifting symmetry and lifting height). The frequency of lifting was set at 4 per minute, and the task duration was 15 minutes. Posture significantly affected the MAWL for the rock dust bag (standing MAWL was 7% greater than restricted postures and kneeling MAWL was 6.4% less than stooped); however, posture interacted with lifting conditions for both of the other materials. Physiological costs were found to be significantly greater in the stooped postures compared to kneeling for all materials. Other contrasts (standing versus restricted postures, stooping under 1.5 m ceiling versus stooping under 1.2 m ceiling) did not exhibit significantly different levels of energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was significantly affected by vertical lifting height; however, the plane of lifting had little influence on metabolic cost. Recommended acceptable workloads for the three materials are 20.0 kg for the rock dust bag, 16.5 kg for the ventilation stopping block, and 14.7 kg for the crib block. These results suggest that miners are often required to lift supplies that are substantially heavier than psychophysically acceptable lifting limits. </jats:p>",

Most specimens (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1604) were examined using a corrosion‐cast technique, while the remaining 30 were studied by histological techniques. In 1417 cases the coronary artery pattern was normal, and the interventricular septum was fundamentally supplied by one or rarely two septal arteries arising from the right and/or left coronary arteries. In 72 specimens the right and left coronary arteries were normal, while the septal artery arose from a separate ostium in the aorta, behaving as a third coronary artery. The remaining 145 animals possessed anomalies in the origin of the coronary arteries, and the septum was also principally irrigated by a septal artery. In 5 of these 145 anomalous cases the septal artery originated from a separate ostium in the aorta. In all specimens examined a less important vascularization of the septum was established through thinner penetrating vessels originating from the right and/or left coronary arteries. Existence of one or rarely two septal arteries is the most constant feature of the coronary artery arrangement in rodents with intramyocardial coronary arteries.</jats:p>",
