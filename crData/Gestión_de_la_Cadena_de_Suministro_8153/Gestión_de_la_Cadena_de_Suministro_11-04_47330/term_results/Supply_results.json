The systems' yielding safe drinking-water also receives little attention in literature and policy, relative to public and communal sources. This paper assessed urban self supply wells and argues that self supply is a coping water supply strategy of not only the rural poor, but also of the unserved in the cities. The assessment included inventory and classification of sources, forms of access to sources, types and number of users in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Ninety eight percent of the self supply sources in the study area are hand dug wells. The design and construction features vary from protected, semi-protected to unprotected well structures. Forty five percent of the urban population is found to have access to either a restricted or free access hand dug well. The paper emphasizes the need to see self supply sources as the third angle, which completes the water supply triangle with the public and communal water systems as the other angles.</jats:p>",

In order to meet this goal, it is necessary to use an evaluation model to measure customer satisfaction. This paper proposes an evaluation model for measuring the customer satisfaction level in a water supply domain. Some important criteria such as water quality, water quantity, responsibility of the company, etc. are distinguished and used in the proposed model. To integrate all of these criteria in a unit index, the analytic hierarchy process technique is used. The proposed model integrates customer opinions in a unit index to measure the customer satisfaction level. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, Hamedan Water Company is studied as a case study. The results show that the proposed model can be used as a useful tool for analyzing customer satisfaction levels in water supply domains for other companies. The proposed model also distinguishes company strengths and weaknesses in the field of customer satisfaction.</jats:p>",

Almost all researches mainly concerned with the problem in deterministic, stochastic or fuzzy environments. Different from them, we study the grain supply chain design problem by using uncertainty theory. This paper employs an uncertain programming tool to design the grain supply chain network and a α-cost minimization model is proposed. To solve the model, we design a hybrid intelligent algorithm which integrates 99-method and different evolution algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.</jats:p>"

Here we return to the topic in the light of new data from a range of archaeological deposits, including civilian and military sites dating from the earliest period of Roman occupation. Infestation rates and, potentially, grain loss may have been high throughout Roman Britain, though many infestations may have been in equine feed. Beetle grain pests are not recorded in Britain prior to the Roman invasion, and it appears that they were absent, or extremely rare, in the early medieval period and up to the Norman Conquest. This pattern of occurrence is reviewed and it is suggested that ecological theory offers an explanation which is in accord with supposed socio-economic changes and trade. The role of grain pests is considered in the economic modelling of Romano-British agriculture.</jats:p>",

The biggest challenge in biological treatment is finding an abundant low or no-cost carbon source. This work demonstrated for the first time that leachate from the agricultural byproduct silage can be used in an upflow anaerobic sludge-bed bioreactor to reduce sulfate for on-farm water treatment. The reactor ran continuously for approximately one year with an average silage leachate feed COD concentration of 4,471 ± 857 mg L−1, and sulfate feed concentrations varying from 1,253 to 2,081 mg L−1. The maximum sulfate reduction rate (SRR) of 9.75 ± 0.23 mmol (L day)−1 was achieved at the high sulfate influent concentration and the amount of organics consumed was between 80–90%. Sulfide levels in the UASB bioreactor were consistently high for most of the experiment, averaging 516.6 ± 188.5 mg L−1. Interestingly, during the last month of operation when sulfide concentrations were highest the SRR continued to increase. It was estimated that 36% of the silage leachate carbon was used directly for sulfate reduction.</jats:p>",

The author draws on U.S. Census data from 1960–2000 to examine how the eligibility requirements for Social Security benefits affect immigrants' decisions to leave the labor market as they near retirement age. Because a person needs to have worked in the United States for at least ten years to qualify for benefits, newly arrived immigrants may not yet have accumulated the requisite employment credits to do this and thus have greater employment rates than other comparably aged persons. The probability that an older immigrant is employed falls once the ten-year work rule is satisfied. The implication of this finding is that immigration may affect the increase in retirement benefits that will inevitably occur as the baby boom generation retires. </jats:p>",

A major obstacle to these approaches' adoption is environmental justice – that the risk and burden of resource solutions, as well as their benefits – should be borne equitably, despite differences of income or race. We first consider how debates regarding water supply are often disputes over different notions of environmental justice. We then examine general equity debates over adopting various innovations in one US state at the nexus of water demand and supply innovation: California. We contend that fairly adopting these innovations requires embracing open, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes in which no important constituency is excluded from decisions, and in which different notions of environmental justice are embraced.</jats:p>",

The influence of HS initial concentration, pulse repetition frequency, water flow rate, and the atmosphere composition was evaluated by the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) and color. The PCD treatment reduced TOC by 40 to 50% and the color by up to 97%. The PCD energy efficiency ranged about 20 g kW−1 h−1 in air and 30 g kW−1 h−1 in oxygen for the lowest initial color of about 50 Pt-Co degrees. Ozone contributed about 30% to the color reduction and only 15% to the reduction in TOC, indicating predominant role of OH radicals in mineralization of oxidation by-products.</jats:p>",

Singapore's population has increased from about 1 million people in the 1950s to almost 5 million currently. The city state has invested massively in a sustainable water supply system, and is regarded by many as a role model for future cities with respect to this topic. Solutions like water reuse, desalination and water demand management have already been implemented. However, city dwellers use much more additional water in the form of virtual water. Their actual water footprint is much higher than only domestic water. Water required for the generation of agricultural and industrial products are imported to cities, and can put a heavy burden on water resources in surrounding and even distant (rural) regions. The city state provides a unique opportunity to analyse virtual water consumption for a city, as required statistical data are available through the national Department of Statistics. For other cities such detailed data are rarely available. Mostly these data are only provided on a national level. This analysis provides a quantification of the actual water use of a future city. The paper describes whether the consumption of agricultural products (in the sense of water for food) is also sustainable in Singapore. The agricultural products that contribute largely to the total water footprint of Singapore – wheat, rice, livestock products and cotton–are analysed and discussed in detail. A sustainable city of the future should account for its impacts beyond its borders. Whether the world can provide for the water and food for an increasing population highly depends on consumption patterns within future cities.</jats:p>",

Within each level, a set of activities or processes can be identified. Taken together, the levels allow a comprehensive analysis of a closed-loop supply chain system. This is illustrated building on two case studies in the textile and apparel industry, where closed-loop supply chains have been designed to take specific apparel products back. The case studies are analyzed against all three levels and allow exemplification of related challenges and interrelations among the three levels. The three levels contribute to the further comprehension of the multiple issues having to be taken into account for successfully implementing closed-loop supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today organizations of any magnitude have heavily integrated supply chain. The supply chain management consists of all parties involved, directly or indirectly in fulfilling customer request. There is an immense growth which has expanded from the traditional point of view as not only of physical distribution of materials but also to services. Implementing supply chain risk management has been troubleshooting in many organizations. In practice assessing risk management in supply chain is rather underdeveloped and often dealt with informal and reactive manner. As risk management issues today is subjected to substantial research and the organizations are trying to mitigate the risk issues so as to maintain the smooth operation of supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to identify and prioritize the risk factors in context to supply chain management of Indian manufacturing organizations. The research presented here is specifically targeted to Indian manufacturing organizations which are managing the supply chain operations. This paper deals with the risk issues and thus empirically assesses which risk factors are most influencing one in supply chain operations which must be given careful attention.</jats:p>"

With a simple model of the energy yields of various wastewater treatment technologies it is possible to demonstrate how minor shifts in technology selection can lead the industry from being identified as predominantly energy intensive, to being recognised as a source of energy resources. The future potential energy yield is estimated by applying energy yield factors to alternative use scenarios of the same wastewater loads. The method for identifying the energy potential of wastewater was demonstrated for the New Zealand wastewater sector, but can equally be applied to other countries or regions. The model suggests that by using technologies that maximise the recovery of energy from wastewater, the potential energy yield from this sector would be substantially increased (six fold for New Zealand).</jats:p>",

Among them, the willing is significantly correlated with the firm size, the type of senior management, the awareness of cost control system of logistics, government support policies and cost management techniques as well as its methods of development, while the willing has negative correlation with the nature of corporate, the risk expectations and the expected cost.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, as in many organizations, internal departments often have goals and incentives that seem diametrically opposed to those of other departments or, at the very least, in conflict. Many companies use this approach to balance overall goals, such as sales growth versus profitability. However, a conflict can arise when a decision, on which stakeholders hold differing viewpoints, must be made. In this paper, we discuss a situation in which a supplier has offered to sell HD Supply Facilities Maintenance a product at a discount. Accepting this offer can create a potential overstock situation. Merchandising, whose incentives include growth in gross profit margin dollars, is eager to buy and hold discounted inventory, because it will eventually sell the product at a greater profit level than it could otherwise. Inventory management seeks to keep a minimal amount of inventory on hand to maximize inventory turnover, thus reducing the working capital required to maintain operations. The solution that we developed to maximize value for the enterprise uses a diluted discount approach to assign merit to a forward buy-in deal. Our solution led to a period of debate and education across stakeholder departments and the eventual adoption of an automated, self-service tool that all practitioners can use. </jats:p>",

The results showed that the optimum removal efficiency of 96.5% was achieved at a current density of 0.2 A/dm2, at a pH of 7.0. First- and second-order rate equations, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to study adsorption kinetics. The adsorption process follows second-order kinetics model with good correlation. An equilibrium isotherm was measured experimentally and the results were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Redushkevich model using linearized correlation co-efficient. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm was found to fit the equilibrium data for chromium adsorption. Temperature studies showed that the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous in nature.</jats:p>",

These alternative energy sources inevitably show fluctuations in the amount of output power, frequency, and voltage. The suppression of such fluctuations is a key issue to avoid disturbances in power grids. A similar situation arises as far as the regulation of in-home power flow is concerned. We focus on the quality of supplied and demanded power in particular. In this paper, an in-home power distribution system based on information of power is proposed. The system is developed in order to integrate power dispatch and communication. The experimental results show the feasibility of new flexible and efficient power management approaches.</jats:p>"

The feasibility of using diatomite for advanced treatment of algae-containing surface water and controlling algae removal process through zeta potential was investigated in this study. Results demonstrated that the addition of diatomite is advantageous due to reduction of the polyaluminium chloride (PAC) dose required for satisfactory treatment of Microcystis aeruginosa (MA) and zeta potential which can well reflect the MA removal efficiency. The zeta potential at optimum removal was measured and it was observed that when the zeta potential was reduced to the range of −14.4 mV and +3.53 mV, removal of MA and associated organic material was optimized. Process control using zeta potential is therefore a viable tool for algae removal by enhanced coagulation combining PAC with diatomite.</jats:p>",

Water quality sensors are aimed at revealing contamination intrusions, while hydraulic pressure and flow sensors are utilized for estimating the hydraulic system state. To date optimization models for placing sensors in water distribution systems are targeting separately water quality and hydraulic sensor network goals. Deploying two independent sensor networks within one distribution system is expensive to install and maintain. It might thus be beneficial to consider mutual sensor locations having dual hydraulic and water quality monitoring capabilities (i.e. sensor nodes which collect both hydraulic and water quality data at the same locations). In this study a multi-objective sensor network placement model for conjunctive monitoring of hydraulic and water quality data is developed and demonstrated using the multi-objective non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm NSGA II methodology. Two water distribution systems of increasing complexity are explored showing tradeoffs between hydraulic and water quality sensor location objectives. The proposed method provides a new tool for sensor placements.</jats:p>",

The scenarios are chosen to simulate different locations of sea water desalination plants and to demonstrate the impact of energy demand and energy source, chemical use and longer components' life times on the environment. The results show the dominant impact of energy demand on the overall results for all applied environmental impact assessment methods; transports, material and even chemical use are of negligible impact on the total score. The use of waste heat in case of Memstill offers a great opportunity to reduce the negative environmental impacts related to energy use.

Applying an age-structured optimal-control model, we derive features of the optimal age-specific education rate. Our results show that the relation between the elasticities of substitution of labor across ages plays a crucial role in the way the demographic changes affect (both in the short and in the long run) the optimal educational policy.

In this study a membrane pilot installation (capacity of 6 m3/h) was operated in dead-end configuration to investigate phosphorus removal and fouling behaviour depending on FeCl3 dosage. In parallel, effects of in-line coagulation on the filtration behaviour were investigated in lab-scale filtration experiments. The coagulation leads to the predominant reduction of dissolved organic macromolecular substances which are detected as biopolymer fraction by liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection. Besides the removal of dissolved organic molecules, the resulting filter cake plays a major role for the performance of ultrafiltration. In lab-scale filtration experiments the in-line coagulation results in positive effects on the filtration stability. In contrast, high coagulant doses lead to the loss of filtration performance during the pilot operation. The installed in-line coagulation, however, successfully reduced the orthophosphate concentration in permeate to values below 30 μgP/L when operated at a fixed molar ratio of FeCl3 concentration to influent PO4-P concentration of 6 (ßPO4-P-value).</jats:p>",

We consider a buyer facing multiple potential suppliers, each having an associated (exogenous) reliability that quantifies its risk of supply failure. We design optimal mechanisms that depend on the buyer's level of information regarding the suppliers' cost of production and reliability. When supplier reliability is known, we find that the optimal allocation resembles the allocation under full information, but with inflated production costs. When it is unknown, the same result is true when cost and reliability of a supplier are independent. Furthermore, the buyer does not have to pay any rent for information on suppliers' reliability. Moreover, we assess the benefits of the optimal mechanism compared to traditional auctions that ignore supply risk. </jats:p>",

Their formation in drinking water systems creates potential risks for consumers’ health. Herein we tested biofilm formation on materials commonly used for indoor household drinking water systems (copper, PVC and stainless steel) simulating an average family water usage. Water parameters were determined by standardized methods while biofilm formation was assessed by epifluorescent and laser scanning confocal microscopy, for determining the numbers of attached cells, biofilm thickness, colony size and average colony surface. Results showed a very fast colonization on all materials used, of log 6–7 cm−2 cells disposed on a single layer on copper and PVC. On stainless steel, beginning on the 24th experimental day, there were observed multiple layers of cells and a rapid increase of biofilm thickness. The lowest overall number of attached cells was found on copper. Microorganism colonization and biofilm formation is possible and quite fast on an indoor water system connected to a chlorinated water network. From the tested materials, the greatest risk to consumer health comes from biofilm formation on stainless steel parts which are used in the very large majority of residences.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been used since the Second World War to identify “friend or foe” aircrafts. It has become an enabling wireless technology that is widely used in a number of application areas, such as product tracking through manufacturing and assembly, inventory control, and supply chain management (SCM). By 2006, Wal-Mart used RFID for all of its suppliers. The use of RFID in supply chain networks has allowed Wal-Mart to create value through greater visibility in its networks, higher product velocity, reduce human error and labor cost, and more efficient inventory management, which led to the achievement of Quick Response (QR) and improved Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in the supply chain. However, RFID system challenges and uncertain Return-On-Investment (ROI) must be overcome to fully achieve these objectives. This paper introduces RFID technology and its key components and concepts, and presents an RFID middleware solution called FlexRFID that achieves the maximum benefits of RFID technology independently of the interested backend applications. This paper illustrates how RFID technology is used to solve the main problems in SCM, the advantages and key issues when implementing RFID in SCM networks, and the relationship between RFID and the main SCM processes.</p>",

Singapore has limited conventional water resources and progressively architects its water supply system through acquiring and sustaining multiple (alternative) water resources through innovative technologies. The full rationale and merits of such a policy cannot be properly understood based on traditional project valuation methods alone. This paper provides decision support using a real options approach by evaluating innovative water technologies from multiple perspectives under uncertainty.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper demonstrates that incorporating innovative water technologies into water supply systems can concurrently improve water supply from the financial, political and socioeconomic perspectives. The development of innovative water technologies provides flexibility to the water supply system, and is a fundamental and effective means of risk management. The evaluation of innovative water technologies is based on an integrated real options approach, which provides decision support for architecting water supply systems under uncertainty. The approach gives specific tangible values for the water technologies and complements the general prescriptive Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) framework.</jats:p>",

The body condition of tawny owls was not considerably affected by the annual fluctuations of small voles indicated by regional vole indices and local prey samples. There were some significant relationships with some alternative prey but the variation in the body condition of owls was largely explained by the bird's age, time of the season, and stage of the nestling period. Old birds that bred earlier in the season were in better condition than young ones that bred later. Due to alternative prey, the body condition seemed to be relatively resistant to the effects of variable foraging conditions as expected for a generalist species of southern origin.</jats:p>",

The treated water was mixed with high and low concentrations of bentonite to simulate turbid water. This treated water provides from water treatment plant of Algiers (Boudouaou site) which is supplied by both dams of Keddara and Beni Amrane. The raw water comes directly from these two dams. Chitosan with 85% degree of deacetylation and derived from crab chitin has been used. The performance of coagulation flocculation process has been assessed by measuring the supernatant turbidity for different doses of chitosan, initial turbidity, water quality and pH. The obtained results show that chitosan can be used in a large pH range. Chitosan is effective for coagulation of bentonite suspension and for raw water with high initial turbidity. Otherwise, chitosan is inefficient for raw water with very low initial turbidity. In this case, the use of chitosan as aid coagulant with aluminium sulfate (main coagulant) allows more effectiveness in removing turbidity.</jats:p>",

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply chain structures that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i.e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may have a significant impact on the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply chain structures are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the author presents a maturity model that links metrics for both ‘worlds’ to prescribe the evolution of key practices, IT-services, and people skills. The proposed model can be used to examine the maturity of supplier relationship management of a particular hospital, identifying performance gaps and systematizing improvement initiatives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Barriers to trade come in a variety of forms. This article examines one such barrier, export restrictions, and how it impacts trade and global supply in selected strategic metals and minerals. The metals and minerals examined in the article are of particular interest for a number of reasons: they are generally geographically concentrated in a few countries, many are used in the production of high-technology goods in strategic sectors, and there are few substitutes for these raw materials given the present state of technology. For all these reasons, importing countries are dependent on a reliable supply of these raw materials. Export restrictions may be applied for a number of reasons: protection of the environment, preservation of natural resources, protection of downstream industries, or as a response to a number of different market imperfections. This article examines the motivations for using export restrictions and finds varying impacts on trade and global supply. In one case, the export restrictions put into place did not fulfil their objective of environmental protection. In another, the presence of export restrictions in one country put pressure on other exporters to apply restrictions, suggesting the potential for competitive policy practices in restricting exports. In a third case study, export restrictions were seen to impact investment decisions by potential suppliers worldwide by introducing an added element of risk in the industry. The impact of export restrictions on strategic metals and minerals is exacerbated in many cases because producing countries have a quasi-monopoly on supply. Since these metals and minerals are essential in the production of some high-technology products and are not easily replaceable in the medium term, industry participants in some importing countries are concerned about future access at sustainable prices.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

A simple computer model was implemented to simulate the behaviour of the rainwater harvesting system. In general, the rainwater collector volumes predicted by the daily model had shown a good correlation with the experimental values. The difference between the experimental and the predicted values for the stored volume can be explained by the lack of maintenance of the system that can affect its performance. On the basis of a long-term simulation of 20-year rainfall data, the following parameters were calculated: rainfall, water demand, mains water, rainwater used, over-flow and WSE. The collection of rainwater from roofs, its storage and subsequent use for toilet flushing can save 42 m3 of potable water per year for the studied system. The model was also used to find the optimal size of the tank for the single-family household: a storage capacity of approximately 5 m3 was found to be appropriate. The storage capacity and tank size were distinguished. The importance to take into account the dead volume of the tank for the sizing was indeed highlighted.</jats:p>",

These supplier–supplier relations may constitute a missing link between the traditional analysis of the dyadic and the network level of analysis that are often treated separately. This paper explores the interplay of the supplier–supplier and network of analysis by focusing on the inherent tension between cooperation and competition, using a multiple case study design in the Japanese and German automobile industries. It is argued that the buyer is able to exert influence not only on the coopetition level, so within “horizontal supply chain relations,” but that the coopetitive tension in the overall network can in fact be managed<jats:italic>through</jats:italic>the active establishment and maintenance of such relations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This was done within the context of NHSBT reconfiguring their supply chain and moving towards a consolidated and centralised approach. Time based process mapping was applied to identify value and non‐value adding time in two manufacturing models. A large amount of the non‐value adding time in the apheresis platelet supply chain is due to transportation and waiting for the next process in the manufacturing process to take place.

Suppose each of several retailers observes local demand for a common item and places an order at the supplier, which is immediately filled if the supplier has the item in stock. The supplier can fill retailer orders either from their reserved inventories or from a shareable pool of inventory. Using terminology from cooperative game theory, we say that the supplier and the retailers whose orders are filled from the common pool have formed an inventory-pooling coalition and study the use of Shapley value to allocate the expected excess profit because of pooling. </jats:p><jats:p> We find that under Shapley value allocations the retailers have incentive to join the inventory-pooling coalition, and the supplier carries the level of inventory that is optimal for the coalition. Shapley value allocations might not lie within the core of the game, but the grand coalition of all players is stable in the farsighted sense. And, although the supplier's share of the expected excess profit is largest when all the retailers participate in the inventory-pooling coalition, the allocations to the retailers may diminish as the coalition grows. Colluding against the supplier (by merging and forming larger retailers) may seem like an appealing strategy for the retailers to increase their share of the total supply chain profit, but we find that the total expected after-pooling profits of retailers may instead go down because of collusion. </jats:p>",

A total of 90 water samples were collected during both dry and wet seasons from household based rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs), community based rain water harvesting systems (CRWHSs), pond-sand filters (PSFs) and ponds. The samples were evaluated for faecal coliform, Escherichia coli and Heterotrophic Plate Count, as well as Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Physico-chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, and color) were also examined. In addition, sanitary inspections were conducted to identify faecal contamination sources. All options showed varying degrees of indicator bacterial contamination. The median E. coli concentrations measured for RWHSs, CRWHSs, PSFs, and ponds were 16, 7, 11, and 488 cfu/100 ml during the wet season, respectively. Vibrio cholerae O1/O139, Salmonella and Shigella spp. were not found in any samples. However, Vibrio cholerae Non-O1/Non-O139 and Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 74.4% and 91.1% of the water samples collected during the wet season. A maximum pH of 10.4 was found in CRWHSs. Estimation of the disease burden for all options in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) showed an increased disease burden during the wet season. According to sanitary inspections, poor maintenance and unprotected ponds were responsible for rainwater and PSF water contamination, respectively. The findings of the present study suggest that alternative drinking water supply options available in southwest coastal Bangladesh pose a substantial risk to public health.</jats:p>",

The presented approach uses Constraint Programming and Lagrangean Relaxation methods in order to improve algorithm’s efficiency. The complete problem is decomposed into two separated subproblems, to which the mentioned techniques are applied to obtain a complete solution. With this decomposition, the methodology provides a quick initial feasible solution which is rapidly improved by metaheuristics’ iterative process. Constraint Programming and Lagrangean Relaxation are also embedded within this structure to ensure constraints satisfaction and to reduce the calculation burden. By means of the proposed methodology, promising results have been obtained.

For this reason, the implementation of SSCM often does not result in noticeable benefits. So far, research has failed to offer any explanations for this discrepancy. In view of this fact, our study aims at identifying and analyzing the factors that underlie successful SSCM. Success factors are identified by means of a systematic literature review and are then integrated into an explanatory model. Consequently, the proposed success factor model is tested on the basis of an empirical study focusing on recycling networks of the electrics and electronics industry. We found that signaling, information provision and the adoption of standards are crucial preconditions for strategy commitment, mutual learning, the establishment of ecological cycles and hence for the overall success of SSCM.

Both individual and combined contributions of these foulant components results in different fouling behaviour. The ability to characterize these contributions that lead to reversible and irreversible membrane fouling would be beneficial for the implementation of fouling monitoring and control strategies for membrane-based drinking water treatment operations. A fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and principal component analysis-based approach was able to qualitatively estimate the accumulation of humic substances (HS)-, protein- and colloidal/particulate matter-like foulant components in membranes during the ultrafiltration (UF) of natural river water. A bench-scale flat sheet UF cross-flow set-up and successive permeation and membrane backwashing cycles were used. Analysis of the accumulation of these foulant components revealed that the increased levels of colloidal/particulate matter accumulation in the membranes appeared to have increased the extent of irreversible fouling by HS-like matter whereas lower irreversible fouling by protein-like matter was observed with increased colloidal/particulate matter accumulation. The results also indicate that the combined contributions by these foulants are important in the fouling of membranes during the UF of river water.</jats:p>",

Here we combine sediment grain size, elemental distribution and mineral assemblage data to trace dust and riverine sources at a shallow‐marine sediment depocentre in the vicinity of the Senegal River mouth. The aim is to understand how these terrigenous components reflect climate variability during the late Holocene. Major element contents were measured and mineral identification was performed on three sub‐fractions of our sediment core: (i) fluvial material &lt; 2 µm, (ii) aeolian material of 18–63 µm and (iii) a sub‐fraction of dual‐origin material of 2–18 µm. Results show that more than 80% of the total Al and Fe terrigenous bulk content is present in the fluviogenic fraction. In contrast, Ti, K and Si cannot be considered as proxies for one specific source off Senegal. The Al/Ca ratio, recording the continental river runoff, reveals two dry periods from 3010 to 2750 cal a BP and from 1900 to 1000 cal a BP, and two main humid periods from 2750 to 1900 cal a BP and from 1000 to 700 cal a BP. The match between (i) intervals of low river runoff inferred by low Al/Ca values, (ii) reduced river discharge inferred by integrated palynological data from offshore Senegal and (iii) periods of enhanced dune reactivation in Mali confirms this interpretation.

The economic objective is measured by the total annualized cost, the environmental objective is measured by the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and the social objective is measured by the number of accrued local jobs. A multiobjective mixed‐integer linear programming (mo‐MILP) model is developed that accounts for major characteristics of cellulosic ethanol supply chains, including supply seasonality and geographical diversity, biomass degradation, feedstock density, diverse conversion pathways and byproducts, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, regional economy, and government incentives. Aspen Plus models for biorefineries with different feedstocks and conversion pathways are built to provide detailed techno‐economic and emission analysis results for the mo‐MILP model, which simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production planning, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. The mo‐MILP problem is solved with an ε‐constraint method; and the resulting Pareto‐optimal curves reveal the tradeoff between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of the sustainable biofuel supply chains. The proposed approach is illustrated through two case studies for the state of Illinois. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2012</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A flat-plate tester was used to measure the friction factor behavior for a hole-pattern roughened surface apposed to a smooth surface. The tests were executed to characterize the friction factor behavior of annular seals that use a roughened-surface stator and a smooth rotor. Friction factors were obtained from measurements of the mass flow rate and static pressure measurements along the smooth and roughened surfaces. In addition, dynamic pressure measurements were made at four axial locations at the bottom of individual holes and at facing locations in the smooth plate. The test facility is described, and a procedure for determining the friction factor is reviewed. Three clearances were investigated: 0.635 mm, 0.381 mm, and 0.254 mm. Tests were conducted with air at three different inlet pressures (84 bars, 70 bars, and 55 bars), producing a Reynolds numbers range from 50,000 to 700,000. Three surface configurations were tested, including smooth-on-smooth, smooth-on-hole, and hole-on-hole. The hole-pattern plates are identical with the exception of the hole depth. For the smooth-on-smooth and smooth-on-hole configurations, the friction factor remains largely constant or increases slightly with increasing Reynolds numbers. The friction factor increases as the clearance between the plates increases. The test program was initiated to investigate a friction-factor jump phenomenon cited by Ha et al. (1992, “Friction-Factor Characteristics for Narrow-Channels With Honeycomb Surfaces,” Trans. ASME, J. Tribol., 114, pp. 714–721) in test results from a flat-plate tester where, at elevated values of Reynolds numbers, the friction factor began to increase steadily with increasing Reynolds numbers. They tested apposed honeycomb surfaces. For the present tests, the phenomenon was also observed for tests of apposed roughened surfaces but was not observed for smooth-on-smooth or smooth-on-rough configurations. When the phenomenon was observed, dynamic pressure measurements showed a peak-pressure oscillation at the calculated Helmholtz frequency of the holes.</jats:p>",

Although several national nutrition surveys have been carried out in Ireland since 1990, there is little information on the Irish diet before then. We analysed the FAO food balance sheets for Ireland from 1961 to 2007 in order to characterise the changes in energy and nutrient supply that took place during that period. Food balance sheets were downloaded from the FAOSTAT database and per capita supply of commodities was analysed using dietary analysis software. Energy from carbohydrate as a percentage of total energy fell from 55 % in 1961 to 46 % in 2007, whereas energy from fat increased from 29 % to 34 %; these values are well outside WHO recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease. Energy from alcohol as a percentage of total energy has doubled within the last 20 years. On a nutrient-density basis, vitamins and minerals met or exceeded WHO recommendations, apart from vitamin D, folate, Ca and Fe. Although there are methodological limitations associated with the use of food balance sheets, the present results demonstrate that the current imbalances in the Irish diet were already evident several decades ago. Because they are so long established, they will be difficult to reverse unless major public health nutrition interventions are implemented.</jats:p>",

The cavernous nerve (CN) is a thin ventrocaudal collateral projection of the NVB, and this projection does not strictly follow the NVB course. The CN runs along the lateral surface of the vagina and urethra and penetrates the homolateral clitoral crus. The CN provides adrenergic, cholinergic, and nitrergic innervation to the clitoris, but not sensory innervation. The spongious nerve (SN) is the terminal and main projection of the NVB and provides nitrergic innervation to the vestibular bulbs. The dorsal clitoris nerve (DCN), somatic branche of the pudendal nerve, runs along the superior surface of the clitoral crus and body and has a segmental proerectile nitrergic activity related to communicating branches with the CN.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>“Computer-assisted anatomic dissection” allowed the identification of the precise location and distribution of the autonomic and somatic neural supply to female erectile bodies, providing an anatomical basis for nerve-sparing surgical techniques, and participating to the understanding of neurogenic female sexual dysfunction.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This study takes advantage of a natural experiment in which 15% of the population—the poor and disabled—was exempted from these co‐payments. It used the micro‐level panel data of three large health plans on the physician visits of 50 000 members per plan in 1997–2001. The data indicate that, following introduction of the co‐payment, specialist visits <jats:italic>increased</jats:italic> among non‐exempt members, relative to exempt members, of two health plans that together account for two‐thirds of the population. This paper illustrates how, unlike the Health Insurance Experiment and other US studies of cost sharing, the structure of the co‐payment in Israel may have inadvertently limited the incentive to decrease consumer demand and may have created an incentive for the health plans to increase visit rates, especially among the non‐exempt members. Other countries that have implemented co‐payment systems with exemptions may benefit from the Israeli experience in designing and evaluating their systems.

The Baltimore Healthy Eating Zones (BHEZ) program aimed to increase healthy food access and improve youth dietary behavior by employing multi‐pronged interventions at recreation centers and nearby food retailers. Intervention activities, including point‐of‐purchase interactions, peer mentoring, cooking demos and taste tests, were conducted over a 9 month period and encouraged foods such as low‐fat dairy (skim and 1% milk), cooking spray, low‐sugar beverages, and high‐fiber cereals and breads. Using a paired t‐test, we observed no significant change in total household healthy food supply (n=83) within intervention (mean healthy foods present out of 16: 11.85 baseline, 11.71 post, p=0.784) and control (mean healthy foods out of 16: 11.67 baseline, 11.57 post, p=0.682) zones. Using a McNemer test, supply of 1% / skim milk significantly increased among both populations (control: 26.5% to 52.9%; p=0.035, intervention 18.4% to 57.1%; p&lt;0.001), while supply of 2% milk significantly decreased for the intervention group (control: 50% to 32.4%; p=0.210, intervention: 63.3% to 34.7%; p=0.004). These preliminary data suggest BHEZ had no impact on overall household food supply among low‐income African‐American caregivers, but appears to have led to a small shift toward lower fat milk usage.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold><jats:italic>Grant Funding Source</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:italic>: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Genes and regulatory networks underlying complex traits can subsequently be inferred. Using a recently released genome sequence, we have defined cis- and trans-eQTL and their environmental response to low phosphorus (P) availability within a complex plant genome and found hotspots of trans-eQTL within the genome. Interval mapping, using P supply as a covariate, revealed 18,876 eQTL. trans-eQTL hotspots occurred on chromosomes A06 and A01 within Brassica rapa; these were enriched with P metabolism-related Gene Ontology terms (A06) as well as chloroplast- and photosynthesis-related terms (A01). We have also attributed heritability components to measures of gene expression across environments, allowing the identification of novel gene expression markers and gene expression changes associated with low P availability. Informative gene expression markers were used to map eQTL and P use efficiency-related QTL. Genes responsive to P supply had large environmental and heritable variance components. Regulatory loci and genes associated with P use efficiency identified through eQTL analysis are potential targets for further characterization and may have potential for crop improvement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of cardiac energetics commonly involves the use of isolated muscle preparations (papillary muscles or trabeculae carneae). Their contractile performance has been observed to vary inversely with thickness. This inverse dependence has been attributed, almost without exception, to inadequate diffusion of oxygen into the centers of muscles of large diameter. It is thus commonly hypothesized that the radius-dependent diminution of performance reflects the development of an anoxic core. We tested this hypothesis theoretically by solving a modification of the diffusion equation, in which the rate of oxygen consumption is a sigmoidal function of the partial pressure of oxygen. The model demonstrates that sufficiently thick muscles, operating at sufficiently high rates of oxygen demand or sufficiently low ambient partial pressures of oxygen, will indeed show diminished energetic performance, whether indirectly indexed as stress (force per cross-sectional area) development or as the rate of heat production. However, such simulated behavior requires the adoption of extreme parameter values, often differing by an order of magnitude from their experimental equivalents. We thus conclude that the radius-dependent diminution of muscle performance in vitro cannot be attributed entirely to an insufficient supply of oxygen via diffusion.</jats:p>",
