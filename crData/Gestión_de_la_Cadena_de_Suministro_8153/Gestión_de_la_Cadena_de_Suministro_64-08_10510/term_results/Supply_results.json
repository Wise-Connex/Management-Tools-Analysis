      "abstract": "<jats:p> The isometric developed tension of rat's trabecula carnea was recorded, in vitro. The magnitude of the developed tension was observed to be directly a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the aerating mixture. This activity reached a maximum at pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> values of 700 mm Hg. Fluctuations in the developed tension were noted during the 1st hr of the experiment; insignificant changes with noted exceptions occurred during the 2nd and 3rd hr. The data indicate that the mechanical response of the tissue is a function of both duration of the experiment and aerating gas mixture. The diflusion coefficient ( D') of oxygen through the preparation was calculated. The results indicate that the D' value for heart muscle may be larger than that of skeletal muscle as determined by Krogh. </jats:p>",
