A study was undertaken to assess the currently practiced rainwater harvesting systems located in the south west coastal and arsenic affected areas in the country. A total of 1,000 rainwater-harvesting systems were investigated using structured questionnaires; among them 14.8% were community based and 85.2% were household rainwater harvesting systems. The results of this assessment are presented in this paper. Availability of the harvested rainwater, operation, storage and maintenance of community based rainwater harvesting and ensuring water quality to meet the drinking water standard are the important issues that must be addressed properly. A protocol for the operation and maintenance according to WHO guideline can be adopted for the safe and sustainable rainwater harvesting in the country.</jats:p>",

MIDAS aims to achieve high customer satisfaction by supporting the build-to-order customization model and to reduce inventory carrying costs and logistics administration costs at the manufacturer by supporting the just-in-time manufacturing model. It allows a manufacturer to choose from the MIDAS Registry, suppliers of components, and negotiate based on the prices, availability, and delivery times of those components. The manufacturer can use one of several strategies to aggregate customers’ orders before processing them, and one of several strategies to accumulate suppliers’ quotes before deciding on a particular supplier. The paper presents an evaluation of these strategies in terms of the customer’s satisfaction, as measured by the customer response time, and the manufacturer’s gain, as measured by the number of orders aggregated or the best price ratio.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In this paper, the authors address the distribution of efficiency gains among partially autonomous supply network actors in a manner they will accept as fair and as an incentive to cooperation. The problem is economically significant because it requires substantiating efficiency gains in an understandable manner. Moreover, supply networks suffer from a conflict potential because the partially autonomous actors seek to maximize their own shares of the efficiency gain. The method applied appropriates a model from cooperative game theory involving the t-value. The special nature of the t-value ensures that it seems rational to the actors to cooperate in the supply network. The proposed method for the distribution problem offers a fair distribution of efficiency gains in the supply network and ensures that the distribution results can be communicated easily.</p>",

Data was collected using a survey questionnaire administered online to members of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP). Four proposed hypotheses were partially supported in this study. Both variables, IT infrastructure integration and supply chain process integration, moderate the relationships between three predictor variables, business process modularity, standard electronic business interfaces, and breadth of information exchange and the two dependent variables examined in this study, operational efficiency and market knowledge creation to a considerable extent. This study has clear implications for how decision makers affecting their firm’s supply chains should make a business case for robust IT elements that support both IT infrastructure integration and supply chain process integration.</p>",

Fuel surcharge, transportation cost, and logistics have become house hold words. The rising cost of crude oil creates an increase in fuel cost, and this creates an increase in the cost to transport products from one location to another. Managers, who are responsible for acquiring products and delivering them to customers, are also feeling the impact of higher fuel prices. This article will outline three significant areas where fuel prices are affecting U.S. supply chain decisions. Sourcing decisions, transportation modes, and product design and packaging practices are all currently being influenced by the cost of logistics.</jats:p>"

It is established that drinking water quality has been of a consistently higher standard in England and Wales in comparison with the Republic of Ireland. It is also demonstrated that the associated organisational arrangements in England and Wales have been more successful in tackling certain problematic drinking water quality parameters. The paper concludes by arguing that national governments, and their regulatory agencies, should view the rationalisation of organisations involved in the provision of drinking water as key to ensuring better drinking water quality. It is also suggested that state regulators who are responsible for ensuring the quality of drinking water end their dependency on water providers for quality data. They should instead become capable of directly monitoring drinking water quality via their own sampling regime. It is argued that this organisational arrangement would be representative of a more progressive and robust organisational approach to ensuring the supply of safe high quality drinking water.</jats:p>",

A water turbine can be integrated in a water supply system in high-pressure locations. Recently, new sources of energy production are being researched and applied due to the increase in the price of conventional energy sources and concerns regarding the damage to the environment caused by their pollutants. On the other hand, water supply systems have equipment that consumes a great deal of energy, such as water and wastewater pumping stations and treatment plants. Energy efficiency that is based on multi-criterion optimization of pump-storage/hydro/wind power management methodology has been developed to analyze the economic viability of a pumping drinking water system that may or may not be connected to a wind turbine or a small hydro whenever excess available head is present.</jats:p>",

The study uses measures of concentration like the Herfindahl-Herschman Index (HHI) and the E-Index. The study finds that the traditionally unit banking Illinois has narrowed the mismatch over the study period from 1982 to 2007, whereas the traditionally branch banking New York has expanded such mismatch. The study also finds that while the New York banking industry can be characterized by a more concentrated geographical distribution of bank deposits, the Illinois banking industry still has a dispersed geographical concentration of bank offices, though the Chicago MSA has reversed such a pattern.</p>",

An aromatic polyamide NF-90 membrane was chosen to determine the impacts of solution chemistry. The experimental results revealed that solution flux decline was dependent on solution pH, ionic strength, and type of lead solutions. Solution flux conducted with different types of lead solutions (i.e. PbCl2 and Pb(NO3)2) decreased with increased solution pH. Solutions having high pH exhibited greater flux decline than those having low solution pH, while lead ion rejections were relatively high. Increased ionic strengths resulted in a greater flux decline, while lead ion rejections decreased with decreasing solution pH and increasing ionic strengths. Such results were related to low solution pH, suggesting an increase in fixed charge of proton (H+), decreasing electrical double layer thickness within membrane, thus allowing increased lead concentration passing through the membrane surface. Solution flux and rejection decreased further at higher ionic strengths, which caused a reduced negatively charged membrane, and thus decreased rejections. It was also found that lead ion for PbCl2 solution exhibited higher rejections than that of Pb(NO3)2 solution.</jats:p>",

In this paper a rapid fractionation (RF) technique of NOM developed by Chow et al. was applied to better understand the removal mechanisms of NOM during chemical precipitation and ozonation-biofiltration processes at WTP in Riga, Latvia. Results showed that NOM removal, determined as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constituted from 15.34±3.84 mg/L in raw water to 5.33±1.45 mg/L in drinking water and was mainly due to decrease of very hydrophobic acids (VHA) during coagulation and precipitation processes. Other NOM fractions viz. slightly hydrophobic acids (SHA) and hydrophilic charged acids (CHA) were only slightly removed. During ozonation the fraction of CHA were transformed into hydrophilic neutral (NEU) fractions and removed by biologically activated carbon (BAC) filters. However, this trend was not observed during the cold season. In conclusion, coagulation and precipitation mainly removed humic substances, as indicated by VHA removal, whereas ozonation-BAC filtration was not effective since biologically degradable fractions of NOM were either transformed into other substances (from NEU to VHA) or were not removed (in cold season) due to insufficient biological activity or contact time in BAC filters.</jats:p>",

As a case study, the water distribution network was modelled by EPANET and then two specific studies were carried out. The first study tested corresponding system-wide influences on water age and energy consumption if the peaking factors used at design stage are inconsistent with ones in real situation. The second study inspected the possible relationship between the choice of peaking factors and budgets by comparing several different pipe configurations of the distribution system, obtained according to variety of peaking factors. Given the analysis results, the first study reveals that average water age will increase if peaking factors estimated at design stage are larger than real values in that specific system, and vice versa. In contrast, energy consumption will increase if peaking factors defined for system design are smaller than ones in real case, and vice versa. According to the second study, it might be possible to amplify peaking factors for design dramatically by a slight increase in the investment on this system. However, further study on budget estimation with more factors and detailed information considered should be carried out.</jats:p>",

Lost sales are assumed during the stock out period. The lead time for a reorder is exponentially distributed with parameter(, depending on the size of the ordering quantity. The limiting probability distribution for the joint inventory levels is also evaluated. Various operational characteristics and total expected cost rate are derived.

Advanced Oxidation Processes has a high potential for removal of geosmin and MIB in water and in this study UV/H2O2 and UV/O3 has been tested in pilot scale in real aquaculture process water. First order degradations constants were between 0.6 (UV/O3) and 1.2 (UV/H2O2) h−1 for geosmin and 1.3 (UV/O3)–1.5 (UV/H2O2) h−1 for MIB. This corresponded to average half-lives between 34–69 minutes for geosmin and between 28–32 minutes for MIB. These values were one order of magnitude higher than previously reported for degradation of geosmin and MIB in demineralised and tap-water. The slower degradation rates were caused by competitive and inhibitive processes from the water matrix. The influence of the water matrix also caused increased energy consumption with EEO values 16 to 38 times higher than previously reported for geosmin and MIB removal in tap water. Improved feasibility of removing geosmin and MIB in recirculated aquaculture systems by AOPs requires pre-treatment to minimize the impact of the water matrix on the degradation kinetics.</jats:p>",

An isocratic elution was achieved using a Develosil RP Aqueous AR-5 RP-30 column with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The mobile phase consisted of mixed methanol and water in raito of 90:10, v/v. DAD detector was used to monitor the analytes at 280 nm for triclosan and 265 nm for triclocarban. The time of analysis was 10 min and the retention time for triclosan and triclocarban was 5.81 min and 8.13 min, respectively. The solid phase extraction method was proposed for the preconcentration step. The extraction efficiencies were approximately 97% for triclosan and 87% for triclocarban. The linearity range for triclosan and triclocarban after pre-concentration were between 0.5–20 μg mL−1 and 0.3–20 μg mL−1, respectively. The LOD and LOQ of triclosan and triclocarban in real samples were 0.04 ng mL−1 and 0.11 ng mL−1, 0.17 ng mL−1 and 0.50 ng mL−1, respectively. The method has been sensitive and can be successfully applied to the fast and simultaneous determination of triclosan and triclocarban in surface waters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article analyzes effects of borrower interest rates and student lender subsidies on federally guaranteed student loan volumes from 1988 to 1994 and from 1996 to 2006. Some have argued that lender subsidy cuts would reduce loan supply or cause lenders to exit the student loan market. If lenders get economic rents due to overly generous subsidies, a simple model of the student loan market suggests that small changes in subsidy levels should not affect loan supply. Empirical results based on a variety of generalized method of moments panel estimators suggest that evidence of links between higher special allowance payment margins and higher loan volumes is weak or inconclusive for both the 1988–94 and 1996–2006 periods. Subsidy reductions, according to this analysis, had no discernable effect on student loan volumes. Results also suggest that higher real borrower interest rates reduce student loan volumes for public colleges and universities. Changes in the federal student loan program in the wake of the credit crunch that began in August 2007 are briefly discussed, along with current proposals to shift all new loans to a direct lending program.</jats:p>",

While national‐brand products are designed by the manufacturer and sold by the retailer, the positioning of store‐brand products is under the complete control of the retailer. We consider a scenario where products differ on a performance quality dimension and we analyze how retailer–manufacturer interactions in product positioning are affected by the introduction of a private‐label product. Specifically, we consider a national‐brand manufacturer who determines the quality of its product as well the product's wholesale price charged to the retailer. Given the national‐brand quality and wholesale price, the retailer then decides the quality level of its store brand and sets the retail prices for both products. We find that a manufacturer can derive substantial benefits from considering a retailer's store‐brand introduction when determining the national brand's quality and wholesale price. If the retailer has a significant cost disadvantage in producing high‐quality products, the manufacturer does not need to adjust the quality of the national‐brand product, but he should offer a wholesale price discount to ensure its distribution through the retailer. If the retailer is competitive in providing products of high‐quality, the manufacturer should reduce this wholesale price discount and increase the national‐brand quality to mitigate competition. Interestingly, we find the retailer has incentive to announce a store‐brand introduction to induce the manufacturer's consideration of these plans in determining the national‐brand product quality and wholesale price. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A variety of human and mouse data together suggest that placental capacity to supply nutrient is adaptable in relation to fetal demand. (1) In normal human pregnancy the activity, per mg membrane protein, of the System A amino acid transporter in the microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) of the placental syncytiotrophoblast is inversely related to the birthweight and size of baby. (2) In mice with a deletion of the placental transcript of the insulin‐like growth factor 2 (igf2) gene, placental weight is reduced compared to wild type mice at e16 (term e20) but fetal weight is not reduced at this time, perhaps because System A expression and activity, per g placenta, is higher in the knockout conceptuses. (3) In the same knockout mice fetal calcium accretion is reduced compared to wild type at e17, but returns to normal by e19 apparently through an increased activity/expression of placental calcium transport mechanisms. (4) Most recently, we find apparent adaptations in placental transporter and vascular reactivity in pregnancies complicated by obesity and pre‐eclampsia respectively. The variable nature of the placental transfer adaptations in different situations, as found in these different studies, will variably affect the mix of nutrient transferred and so potentially variably programme fetal homeostatic mechanisms.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wastewater reuse is an attractive option for supplementing available water supplies. Benefits of reuse include pollution abatement due to the reduction of effluent discharge to surface water bodies, the decrease in the use of freshwaters from sensitive ecosystems, replenishment of soil nutrients in agriculture, enhancement of groundwater recharge and delay in the future expansion of water supply infrastructure. This paper presents ongoing research in developing and testing of a decision support system (DSS) for assessing the feasibility of implementing wastewater reuse projects in South Africa. The DSS employs multi-criteria qualitative assessment across technical, environmental, social, institution and water resources. The database of the DSS contains 33 wastewater treatment unit processes with known information on performance, costs and qualitative criteria obtained from literature. The knowledge base on the other hand, consists of a set of rules for combining the treatment units to form treatment trains and contains information on maximum allowable values for different water quality parameters for five end users. The weighted average method was used to aggregate scores obtained from the assessment of the different criteria to generate an indicative value that could form the basis for decision making. Testing of the DSS was applied to the Parow wastewater treatment plant in Cape Town. Results of the analysis shows that only the water resources evaluation score (1.0) is considered excellent for reuse implementation while the institutional evaluation score is weak (0.35) in guaranteeing success. Social evaluation and treatment train technical/environmental have qualitative evaluation scores of 0.76. The desirable score for all the criteria is 1.0 in order to facilitate the successful implementation of any reuse project. The quality of treated effluent from the proposed treatment trains meets the quality requirement in most of the pollutant determined except total phosphorus (2.88). The value is acceptable if the use of the effluent is limited to irrigation. If decision makers give adequate attention to the criteria highlighted in this model, success of a reuse project in South Africa can be better enhanced.</jats:p>",

Development of a tool that models variability of surface raw water quality in order to predict cost of treatment thus makes economic sense. This paper forms the backbone for an on-going doctoral study in South Africa's Upper and Middle Vaal Water Management Areas (U&amp;MVWMAs) of the Vaal River (VR). Specific objectives of the overall research are; to carry out pollutant tracer hydrochemistry of specific reaches of the U&amp;MVWMAs including producing an integrated ecological functionality for the whole study area, and to develop a tool that models the variability of surface raw water quality using surface raw water tariffs and water quality data for years 2003–2008. This paper concluded that downstream water boards (WBs) paid a higher water resources management charge (WRMC) for more polluted raw water than upstream WBs. It was recommended that a quality-cost model be incorporated at tier1 of the cost chain for water services to ensure fairness of service delivery and spread of burden to consumers.</jats:p>",

However, most of the available studies concentrate on export markets and fail to capture spillover effects that modern supply chains may have on local markets. Here, we analyze the case of sweet pepper in Thailand, which was initially introduced as a product innovation in modern supply chains, but which is now widely traded also in more traditional markets. Using survey data from smallholder farmers and econometric techniques, we show that sweet pepper cultivation contributes significantly to higher household incomes. Strikingly, at this stage, participation in modern supply chains does not lead to higher incomes than supplying sweet pepper to traditional markets. However, the results also indicate that missing land titles, weak infrastructure conditions, and limited access to information constituted serious constraints during the early phases of sweet pepper adoption. Such constraints need to be overcome, so that smallholder farmers are better prepared for the prompt reactions needed under rapidly changing market conditions.</jats:p>",

The study utilizes cross‐sectional farm household‐level data collected in 2006 from a randomly selected sample of 439 small‐scale export farmers. We estimate the casual impact by utilizing a two‐stage Poisson regression model, two‐stage standard treatment effect model, as well as by regression based on propensity score, to assess the robustness of the results. Using these techniques, we demonstrate that the pesticide‐ascribed incidence of acute illness symptoms and the associated cost of illness significantly decrease with the adoption of standards. <jats:italic>Ceteris paribus</jats:italic>, farmers who adopt standards experience 70% lesser incidence of acute illness and spent about 50–60% less on restoring their health than nonadopters. Although standards can potentially prevent resource‐poor smallholders from maintaining their position in lucrative export markets, they can also result in positive changes in the health of those farmers who do adopt them, as shown by these results. This implies that, if adopted on a large scale, standards may reduce production externalities, corroborating the view that they may serve as a catalyst to transform production systems in developing countries.</jats:p>",

Based on a benchmark study for the Bratislava automotive cluster, the review covers the specific situation of a cross border setting where top performers (high‐class original equipment manufacturers, “OEMs,” like VW, Peugeot, Porsche, Kia) in a dual economy environment interact with suppliers from a highly developed country and with local logistics service enterprises. The main findings were derived from a benchmarking questionnaire and were corroborated in subsequent interviews, and they can very well be generalized: specific knowledge required for interactions between buyers and sellers cannot be built and utilized effectively if acceptance, adaptation and integration are obstructed by cultural differences. The biggest threats to fully exploiting the opportunities of cross‐border supply chains, are lack of trust and of ability or willingness to cooperate and insufficient power of decision‐making; lack of application skills ranks second.

A difference-in-differences empirical strategy reveals that substitution to bank debt and alternative sources of capital (e.g., equity, cash balances, and trade credit) was limited, leading to an almost one-for-one decline in net investment with the decline in net debt issuances. Despite this sharp change in behavior, corporate leverage ratios remained relatively stable, a result of the contemporaneous decline in debt issuances and investment. Overall, our findings highlight how even large firms with access to public credit markets are susceptible to fluctuations in the supply of capital.</jats:p>",

At a pilot filtration plant, granular activated carbon (GAC), anthracite and sand-based filters were used to treat stormwater from an urban catchment. After 12 weeks operation, sand media filters clogged (hydraulic conductivity declining by 90%) and all filters were destructively sampled. All biofilters had similar levels of polysaccharide in the surface layer, however only the sand columns clogged. This clogging may have been due to a combination of polysaccharide and small particle size, the development of a sand-specific microbial community, or other biogeochemical interactions. DNA fingerprinting was used to show that bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic communities were present in all filter types and at all sampling depths (to 45 cm). The bacterial community was far richer (Margalefs index, d, 1.5–2) than the other groups. This was consistent across filter types and sampling depths. The structure of the bacteria and archaea communities in sand filters differed to those in GAC and anthracite filters (P&amp;lt;0.05). In contrast, eukaryotic communities were similar in surface biofilm layers, irrespective of filter type. As such, physicochemical properties of filters differentially influence the microbial community. Furthermore, we have established that archaea are distributed throughout biofilters; the role of these microorganisms in water treatment and filter function, particularly clogging, requires attention.</jats:p>",

Coliform counts give an indication of the overall bacterial contamination of water and thus its safety for human consumption. However, their presence fails to provide information about the source of fecal contamination which is vital to managing fecal contamination problems in surface waters. This study explored the use of multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indexing as means of differentiating E. coli isolates from different sources. A total of 322 E. coli isolates were obtained from municipal wastewater and from fecal samples from domestic and wild animals. Conventional culture methods and standard chemical and biochemical tests were used for isolation and identification of E. coli. Isolates were assayed against 10 antibiotics using the micro-dilution technique. The results obtained generated antibiotic resistance profiles which were used to statistically group the isolates into different subsets. Correct source classification was obtained for 60% of human-derived and 95% non-human-derived E. coli respectively. These results indicate the validity of the usefulness of MAR indexing as a method of bacterial source tracking.</jats:p>",

This paper evaluates the general potential of decentralized wastewater system solutions to be applied in a selected area of the Lower Jordan Rift Valley in Jordan. For the study area, the connection degree to sewer systems was calculated as 67% (5% in the rural sector and 75% in the urban sector). The annual wastewater production available for DWWT&amp;R in the rural sector of the investigation area was calculated to be nearly 3.8 million m3 at the end of 2007. The future need of wastewater treatment and reuse facilities of the rural sector was estimated to be increasing by 0.11 million m3 year−1, with an overall potential of new treatment capacity of nearly 15,500 population equivalents (pe) year−1. The overall potential for implementing DWWT&amp;R systems in the urban sector was estimated as nearly 25 million m3 of wastewater in 2007. The future need of wastewater treatment and reuse facilities required for the urban sector was estimated to be increasing at a rate of 0.12 million pe year−1. Together with the decision makers and the stakeholders, a potential map with three regions has been defined: Region 1 with existing central wastewater infrastructure, Region 2 with already planned central infrastructure and Region 3 with the highest potential for implementing DWWT&amp;R systems.</jats:p>",

While a great deal has been written about the dissemination of information technology (IT), few empirical investigations address the use of IT in relation to 3PLs in Thailand. In this article, the authors use an empirical study to investigate the profiles of 3PLs in Thailand and their company strategies for providing logistics service and use of IT. Survey results show that Thailand’s 3PL companies must expend more effort to strengthen basic IT and infrastructure to enhance competitiveness. IT capabilities in Thailand are increasing rapidly and its effective adoption has the potential to significantly enhance the competitiveness of small 3PLs. Still many barriers exist to the successful adoption of IT by these providers. Given the importance of such companies in supply chain management, these issues must be fully understood.</p>",

However, the potential of water-borne spores as a source of nosocomial fungal infection is increasingly being recognised. This study into the incidence of microfungal contaminants in a typical Australian municipal water supply was carried out over an 18 month period. Microfungal abundance was estimated by the membrane filtration method with filters incubated on malt extract agar at 25 °C for seven days. Colony forming units were recovered from all parts of the system and these were enumerated and identified to genus level. The most commonly recovered genera were Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Fusarium.Nonparametric multivariate statistical analyses of the data using MDS, PCA, BEST and bubble plots were carried out with PRIMER v6 software. Positive and significant correlations were found between filamentous fungi, yeasts and bacteria. This study has demonstrated that numerous microfungal genera, including those that contain species which are opportunistic human pathogens, populate a typical treated municipal water supply in sub-tropical Australia.</jats:p>"

Chironomid larvae have particular importance in the culture of walleye fingerlings. Concurrent with walleye hatchery operations in nearby plastic-lined production ponds, pools were filled and then fertilized using the same protocols as the production ponds. A 2 × 2 factorial experimental design was used that included screened (1,000-μm mesh over the top of the pools) and nonscreened pools and filtered (75-μm-mesh sock) and nonfiltered water in the pools. Chironomid larvae were sampled twice during the 5-week culture season with Hester–Dendy samplers. At the end of the walleye culture season, there were no significant differences in chironomid density between filtered (108 larvae/m2) and nonfiltered (657 larvae/m2) pools, but nonscreened pools (592 larvae/m2) had larger densities of chironomid larvae than screened pools (174 larvae/m2). These results suggest that airborne movement and egg deposition by chironomid adults, rather than transfer of organisms from the water supply reservoir to the culture facility, constitute the primary method of chironomid colonization in plastic-lined ponds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nutrients are basically transported to the roots by mass flow and diffusion. The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of these two mechanisms to the acquisition of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) and cationic micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) by maize plants as well as xylem exudate volume and composition in response to soil aggregate size and water availability. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with samples of an Oxisol, from under two management systems: a region of natural savanna-like vegetation (Cerradão, CER) and continuous maize under conventional management for over 30 years (CCM). The treatments were arranged in a factorial [2 x (1 + 2) x 2] design, with two management systems (CER and CCM), (1 + 2) soil sifted through a 4 mm sieve and two aggregate classes (&lt; 0.5 mm and 0.5 - 4.0 mm) and two soil matric potentials (-40 and -10 kPa). These were evaluated in a randomized block design with four replications. The experiment was conducted for 70 days after sowing. The influence of soil aggregate size and water potential on the nutrient transport mechanisms was highest in soil samples with higher nutrient concentrations in solution, in the CER system; diffusion became more relevant when water availability was higher and in aggregates &lt; 0.5 mm. The volume of xylem exudate collected from maize plants increased with the decrease in aggregate size and the increased availability of soil water in the CER system. The highest Ca and Mg concentrations in the xylem exudate of plants grown on samples from the CER system were related to the high concentrations of these nutrients in the soil solution of this management system.</jats:p>",

Cholinergic and catecholaminergic DMV neurons, in turn, supply the motor innervation to the gastrointestinal tract, from the lower esophagus to the transverse colon Axons of paraventricular hypothalamic neurons release OXT that modulates DMV neurons via both pre‐ and postsynaptic sites of action. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether OXT inputs directly target DMV or NTS neurons. We used double (TH+OXT) and triple (TH+OXT+ChAT) immunoperoxidase labelling to determine whether OXT axons closely apposed catecholaminergic NTS and/or DMV neurons. We also assessed OXT input to DMV neurons retrogradely labelled with cholera toxin B subunit from the corpus or ileum. OXT axons were most numerous in the caudal DMV and in the lateral aspects of the rostral DMV, but were sparsely distributed in the NTS. Close appositions by OXT axons occurred on TH‐positive NTS neurons and DMV neurons, as well as on DMV neurons projecting to either the ileum or corpus. These results suggest a prominent role of OXT in controlling different subpopulations of neurons in the dorsal vagal complex circuitry that controls gut function.</jats:p><jats:p>Support: NH&amp;MRC of Australia and NIH grant DK55530</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Results for growth of wild-type DOT-T1E on 90 different carbon sources revealed the existence of a number of previously uncharted catabolic pathways for compounds such as salicylate, quinate, phenylethanol, gallate, and hexanoate, among others. Subsequent screening on the subset of compounds on which wild-type DOT-TIE could grow with four knockout strains in the global regulatory genes Δ\n            <jats:italic>crc</jats:italic>\n            , Δ\n            <jats:italic>crp</jats:italic>\n            , Δ\n            <jats:italic>cyoB</jats:italic>\n            , and Δ\n            <jats:italic>ptsN</jats:italic>\n            allowed analysis of the global response to nutrient supply and stress. The data revealed that most global regulator mutants could grow in a wide variety of substrates, indicating that metabolic fluxes are physiologically balanced. It was found that the Crc mutant did not differ much from the wild-type regarding the use of carbon sources. However, certain pathways are under the preferential control of one global regulator, i.e., metabolism of succinate and\n            <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>\n            -fructose is influenced by CyoB, and\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            <jats:italic>-</jats:italic>\n            arginine is influenced by PtsN. Other pathways can be influenced by more than one global regulator; i.e.,\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -valine catabolism can be influenced by CyoB and Crp (cyclic AMP receptor protein) while phenylethylamine is affected by Crp, CyoB, and PtsN. These results emphasize the cross talk required in order to ensure proper growth and survival. With respect to N sources, DOT-T1E can use a wide variety of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources. As with the carbon sources, more than one global regulator affected growth with some nitrogen sources; for instance, growth with nucleotides, dipeptides,\n            <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>\n            -amino acids, and ethanolamine is influenced by Crp, CyoB, and PtsN. A surprising finding was that the Crp mutant was unable to flourish on ammonium. Results for assayed sulfur sources revealed that CyoB controls multiple points in methionine/cysteine catabolism while PtsN and Crc are needed for\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            -acetyl-\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -cysteamine utilization. Growth of global regulator mutants was also influenced by stressors of different types (antibiotics, oxidative agents, and metals). Overall and in combination with results for growth in the presence of various stressors, these phenomics assays provide multifaceted insights into the complex decision-making process involved in nutrient supply, optimization, and survival.\n          </jats:p>",

We have recently demonstrated the usefulness of a PCR-based mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing for the molecular characterization of<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>strains exclusively isolated from AIDS patients. In the present study we extended our analysis, based on eight MIRU-VNTR markers, to a strain collection comprehensively comprising the other<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subspecies, including<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>avium</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>hominissuis</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>silvaticum</jats:italic>, isolated from numerous animal species, HIV-positive and HIV-negative humans, and environmental sources. All strains were fully typeable, with the discriminatory index being 0.885, which is almost equal to that obtained by IS<jats:italic>1311</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing as a reference. In contrast to IS<jats:italic>1311</jats:italic>RFLP typing, MIRU-VNTR typing was able to further discriminate<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>avium</jats:italic>strains. MIRU-VNTR alleles strongly associated with or specific for<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subspecies were detected in several markers. Moreover, the MIRU-VNTR typing-based results were consistent with a scenario of the independent evolution of<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>avium</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>silvaticum</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>from<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>hominissuis</jats:italic>, previously proposed on the basis of multilocus sequence analysis. MIRU-VNTR typing therefore appears to be a convenient typing method capable of distinguishing the three main subspecies and strains of the complex and providing new epidemiological knowledge on MAC.</jats:p>",
