This unbalance in supply/demand of LNG led to huge investments in new liquefaction capacity and in 2009 and 2010 there is 45 and 30 mtpa respectively of new liquefaction capacity that is scheduled to come on stream. Roughly half of these volumes are not yet sold to a specific customer and HLNG expects that the new capacity, combined with the challenging economic environment, will lead to a slight change in the shortage of liquefaction capacity that we have seen these last years. For the liquefaction projects with planned start-up from 2011 and onwards HLNG expects that there will be severe delays because of the increasing construction costs we have seen the last years, the decrease in oil and gas price and difficulties to obtain financing.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The document will present status including technical description and qualification programmes.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Transmitting 65 MW over a distance of 120 km is challenging not only related to voltage and power loss at full load, but also to the voltage stability at number of different load scenarios, such as reactive power production in the cable which is also present in no load situation. The subsea mounted Variable Speed Drive (VSD) dictates stringent requirements to voltage variation and stability of the power supply system.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Limited track record and maturity of components and equipment meant that development and qualification testing would be necessary to ensure sufficient reliability of the subsea power supply system.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>On this basis StatoilHydro decided to include the LSPS system in the pilot testing of the subsea gas compression at Nyhamna west coast of Norway. The LSPS pilot project was kicked off in July 2006. Since then development and testing of LSPS equipment and components has been ongoing. The status of the Long Step-out Power Supply project is that all the qualification programs have been successfully completed together with most of the manufacturing for the pilot LSPS. System test for the LSPS pilot system is scheduled to take place during October 2009. Hook up and mechanical completion at the Nyhamna test site is scheduled for first quarter of 2010.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The purpose of the LSPS pilot system is to test and qualify components and equipment to be used in the LSPS permanent system as far as practical.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Ormen Lange Long Step-out Power Supply (LSPS) system shall provide power and communication over the 120 km step out distance from Nyhamna west coast of Norway to the offshore subsea gas compression station.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The permanent Long Step-out Power Supply system consists of a power cable/umbilical, a subsea transformer and High Voltage dry mate penetrators. The onshore power supply system includes step down transformer, Static VAR Compensation (SVC) and reactor for reactive power compensation.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes the approach for design, testing and verification of the permanent LSPS installation. This involves system design, electrical analysis technical descriptions and the strategy for the pilot LSPS. The pilot LSPS has been carefully defined in order to represent the permanent system as far as possible. The pilot system includes a 20 MVA subsea transformer, a short length of the power cable/umbilical with field splice and high voltage penetrators which provide the dry mate connection between the power cable and the subsea transformer. With this system set up all the main components and equipment from the permanent system are represented.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The LSPS system design and engineering is performed by VetcoGray, the pilot transformer is delivered by ABB, the power umbilical is delivered by Nexans and the High Voltager penetrators are delivered by VetcoGray. A number of different qualification programs have been conducted.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>What is not represented in the pilot test set up is the 125 km power cable. Building a cable simulator which consists of pi equivalents mounted in series has previously been ruled out due to size and complexity and a number of uncertainties. The approach to verify the long step-out power supply system has hence been based on electrical system calculations. The calculations have been done with two sets of independent software simulation programs run by different design teams. Comparing the results shows that there are good correlations between the calculations.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

In particular, I investigate how husbands' health insurance coverage offers affect wives' decisions to enter the labor force and work full-time and how this has changed over time.  I endeavor to correct for potential biases of these effects by 1) using an instrumental variables model to deal with endogeneity and 2) estimating and netting out likely unobserved heterogeneity biases, such as assortative mating or income effects.  Using Current Population Survey data from 1995 to 2005, I find that husbands' employer-provided health insurance coverage has a negative effect on wives' labor supply that has increased (become more negative) over time.</jats:p>",

Economies of scale cannot justify the development of a research body such as the Research Information Network (RIN) in the UK and, while its output is relevant to higher education in Ireland, it is important to remember that its findings must be adapted and scaled to the Irish environment, and that partnerships and collaboration may result in different dynamics from those in a larger polity.

Biocorrosion  has occurred in the water supply pipes at Sarcheshmeh copper mine(Located in South of Iran), and in order to assess the amount of biocorrosion and remove these biological interactions we decided to chemically evaluate the water sample in the water supply pipelines at this mine. In this look, the water sample exist in the water supply pipelines at Sarcheshmeh copper mine was studied, sulfur corrosive bacteria were separated and identified and their biochemical activity was researched and studied and it was found that the target species are in fact Sulfolobus bacteria which have different enzymatic activities. Due to these enzymatic activities, a considerable amount of sulfur is accumulated on the cell surface. Based on various incubation environments, as a result of sulfur accumulation, Sulfolubos bacteria were identified.</jats:p>"

We investigate the possible effects of oil and gas market institutions in North America on natural gas supply. A multi-cycle Hubbert curve with inflection points similar to the Soviet Union’s oil production multi-cycle Hubbert curve is used to determine North American natural gas discovery rates and to analyze how market specific institutions caused the inflection points. In addition, we analyze the latest shale natural gas projections critically. While currently, unconventional resources of natural gas suggest that North American natural gas production will increase without bound, the model here suggests a peak in North American natural gas supplies could happen in 2013.</jats:p>"

The total area of these blocks is 11.617 km 2, where, in the future, after the declaration of the commercial viability of each block, the addition of a significant volume of reserves to Brazil is expected. PETROBRAS, as an operator of eight of these blocks, created an ambitious corporate plan called PLANSAL - Master Plan for the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Pole, considering the principal disciplines involved in order to ensure the development of the production of these blocks in a coordinated and accelerated way (fast track way). Figure 1 shows the manner in which the plan was structured.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Among the various challenges to develop the blocks, the supply of the required goods and services is of utmost importance, considering the limitations and risks inherent to the specialized supplier markets. For such, creative and innovative solutions should be proposed for the various aspects, such as:Contracting procedures that allow the fulfillment of the goals to be established</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This relates to contracting procedures that allow the acquisition of goods and services in advance considering the normal timetable for a new undertaking. PETROBRAS normally anticipates the contracting of complex equipment at the end of the final stage of the Basic Project. This can be considered the normal and standard approach. However, for the Pre-Salt case, the anticipation should be even greater due to the volume of goods and services to be contracted and the challenging schedule of the projects. Forms of contracting covering partnerships, framework-agreements and long term contracts seeking a closer relationship with the suppliers may be practiced. It is also intended to use, to the maximum, standard and minimally customized equipment to speed up the delivery periods and lower the costs of acquisition.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It is noted that the deterioration occurs near the interface, and InN film becomes porous layer during growth. When we supply oxygen in the reactor (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> ratio is 0∼0.018%), atomic hydrogen is reduced by reacting oxygen and the porous layer is decreased. Our study reveals that the porous layer is produced by atomic hydrogen. It is important to reduce the atomic hydrogen in the reactor. The oxygen suppresses the deterioration of the film during growth. The carrier concentration increases with the increase of oxygen supply. However, not only oxygen but also defect density due to oxygen is responsible for a higher carrier concentration. (© 2009 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

Therefore, the locus of value creation has shifted to the chain network. The strategic decision of determining the optimal SC network structure plays a vital role in the later optimization of SC operations. This work focuses on the design and retrofit of SCs. Traditional approaches available in literature addressing this problem usually utilize as departing point a rigid predefined network structure which may restrict the opportunities of adding business value. Instead, a novel flexible formulation approach which translates a recipe representation to the SC environment is proposed to solve the challenging design‐planning problem of SC networks. The resulting mixed integer linear programming model is aimed to achieve the best NPV as key performance metric. The potential of the presented approach is highlighted through illustrative examples of increasing complexity, where results of traditional rigid approaches and those offered by the flexible framework are compared. The implications of exploiting this potential flexibility to improve the SC performance are highlighted and are the subject of our further research work. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009</jats:p>",

The framework suggests that collaborative practice is characterised by three distinct factors: (1) decision synchronisation, (2) information sharing, and (3) incentive alignment, which enable the chain members to effectively match supply with customer demand. An important question is whether or not collaborative practice leads to better operational performance. A survey research was employed to assess the relationship between collaborative practice and operational performance of New Zealand companies. The survey results show significant positive impacts of key factors of collaborative practice on operational performance. The findings suggest that information sharing, decision synchronisation, and incentive alignment are important determinants of operational performance. This study demonstrates that the chain members need to understand the role of different key factors of collaborative practice that can be redesigned to leverage operational performance.</jats:p>"

With the development of fields in ever deeper water, the mechanical loads in flexible risers have been significantly increased and, consequently, very high strength wires are often needed. However, more of the developed fields contain H2S which generally is not compatible with the use of high strength steels due to their sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement. Therefore, understanding the relationship between H2S in the bore and its impact on the wires in the annulus is critical for designing flexible pipes for ultra deep sour service fields.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Today, the approach used to calculate the annulus composition does not address the extremely low rate of H2S entering the annulus by permeation from the bore through the sheath, compared to the ability of the large amount of steel wires in the annulus to consume the H2S. This phenomenon has already been observed in full scale experiments with high level of H2S in the bore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The standard corrosion and SSCC/HIC testing methods, generally use a large flowrate of gas compared to the surface of steel, i.e. H2S partial pressure remains constant and is not influenced by the corrosion reaction. For the specific case of the steel located in a flexible pipe annulus a new programme was initiated in 2007 to study the influence of the very low supply of H2S on the hydrogen embrittlement. The approach is based on using calibrated flowrates of H2S/cm2 steel, the methodology requiring very accurate control and precise measurements of H2S into the solution.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper will present the experimental methodology being used as well as the first results that have been obtained. The initial results indicate that by reducing the flowrate of H2S/cm2 steel by a factor 100 (compared to standard tests), very high strength steels with SMUTS=1200MPa and more could be proposed instead of steels with SMUTS=850MPa which are used today. An example will be presented to illustrate the impact this finding has on the feasibility and competitiveness of flexible risers for sour ultra deepwater developments.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In a flexible pipe, carbon steel armours are not in direct contact with the fluid circulating inside the bore but are located in the annular space. This space is mainly filled with carbon steel wires giving a very high confinement. The acid gas contained in the crude oil environment such as CO2 and H2S and water reach the annular space by permeability through the polymer pressure sheath. This diffusion process is slow and more often the H2S content in the bore is limited (partial pressure below 100 mbar). Consequently the flowrate of H2S in the annulus is extremely low compared to the one applied in standard testing methodologies which are used to characterized the susceptibility of carbon steel wires to hydrogen embrittlement in presence of H2S (SSCC/HIC). This is particularly true if the H2S flowrate is given as a function of the quantity of steel surface available in the annulus (mL of H2S/min/cm2 of steel). Indeed, during a corrosion process in presence of H2S, a part of the H2S or all is consumed to form corrosion products such as iron sulphide.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>After a short description of the flexible pipe structure, this paper will present in a first part, the methodology used to calculate the annulus composition. In particular, flowrate of H2S in the annulus (mL of H2S/min/cm2 of steel) will be given for different projects and compared with flowrate of H2S in small scale and full scale tests.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In a second part, we will present the experimental procedure we have used to study the influence of the very low supply of H2S on the hydrogen embrittlement for two high strength carbon steel wires. The effect of H2S flowrate on the saturation of the solution and on the presence of HIC cracks in the carbon steel wires will be presented and discussed.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

I used multiple regression to explain variation in congressional travel, looking at 15,825 trips, both domestic and overseas, taken by House and Senate members and their staff between 2001 and 2004. I found that both supply‐side and demand‐side factors influence congressional travel. Electoral vulnerability corresponds with reduced trip‐taking, and institutional power is associated with greater trip‐taking, although not to the extent that rent‐seeking theory might predict. Members' racial or ethnic minority status also corresponds with greater trip‐taking in the House. Pending retirement also influences trip‐taking, but in the opposite direction from what some “shirking” theories would predict.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Résumé Depuis quelques années, les entreprises multinationales socialement responsables assument de plus en plus de fonctions publiques, particulièrement dans les régions ou les acteurs étatiques n’ont pas la volonté ou les moyens de faire respecter les droits les plus élémentaires. Agissant selon le principe de la Responsabilité Sociale des Entreprises (RSE), les sociétés multinationales ont réussi à combler des lacunes dans la réglementation du marché du travail à travers la mise en place de codes de conduite ou l’offre volontaire de prestations de bénéfices sociaux. Dans cet article, notre argumentation soutient que les entreprises multinationales doivent s’engager dans la mise en vigueur du droit du travail tout en reconnaissant qu’elles ne sont pas vraiment aptes à fournir des biens publics si ce n’est lorsqu’elles agissent en partenariat avec les parties prenantes-clé. Nous argumentons également que les « audits de conformité » - l’outil le plus largement utilisé pour contrôler les conditions de travail dans les chaînes de production – sont en fait un moyen inadéquat pour assurer le respect durable du droit du travail, notamment du fait du manque d’intégration des principes de partenariat et de dialogue dans cette méthode. Ce qui fait également défaut avec l’audit de conformité, c’est la légitimité requise lorsque des acteurs privés tentent de fournir des biens publics. Nous concluons donc avec l’argument que les entreprises multinationales doivent s’associer avec des institutions locales et s’engager dans un processus d’acquisition des savoirs afin de pouvoir assurer la légitimité et la durabilité de leurs programmes de RSE. Enfin, nous pensons que les processus de relations industrielles tels que les conventions collectives sont indispensables dans ce contexte. Fair Labor Association (FLA), une initiative engageant plusieurs parties prenantes, offre une plateforme aux entreprises socialement responsables pour s’associer avec des ONG, des universités et même des organismes gouvernementaux nationaux et internationaux. Par ce partenariat, FLA peut assurer la légitimité de ces acteurs tout en offrant plus de transparence et la mise en place de mécanismes de redevabilité.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. An upgraded version of the biogeochemical model SWAMCO is coupled to the ocean-sea-ice model NEMO-LIM to explore processes governing the spatial distribution of the iron supply to phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. The 3-D NEMO-LIM-SWAMCO model is implemented in the ocean domain south of latitude 30° S and runs are performed over September 1989–December 2000. Model scenarios include potential iron sources (atmospheric deposition, iceberg calving and continental sediments) as well as iron storage within sea ice, all formulated based on a literature review. When all these processes are included, the simulated iron profiles and phytoplankton bloom distributions show satisfactory agreement with observations. Analysis of simulations points to the key role played by continental sediments as a primary source for iron. Iceberg calving and melting contribute by up to 25% of Chl a simulated in areas under influence of icebergs while atmospheric deposition has little effect at high latitudes. Activating sea ice-ocean iron exchanges redistribute iron geographically. Stored in the ice during winter formation, iron is then transported due to ice motion and is released and made available to phytoplankton during summer melt, in the vicinity of the marginal ice zones. Transient iron storage and transport associated with sea ice dynamics stimulate summer phytoplankton blooming (up to 3 mg Chl a m−3) in the Weddell Sea and off East Antarctica but not in the Ross, Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas. This contrasted feature results from the simulated variable content of iron in sea ice and release of melting ice showing higher ice-ocean iron fluxes in the continental shelves of the Weddell and Ross Seas than in the Eastern Weddell Sea and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Seas. This study confirms that iron sources and transport in the Southern Ocean likely provide important mechanisms in the geographical development of phytoplankton blooms and associated ecosystems.\n                        </jats:p>"

The initial forest inventory is compiled from data sets of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis Unit, various GIS data, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery, and simplified assumptions about the spatial distribution of different forest cover types. We determined the parameters of the model from published and unpublished literature and from interviews with experts in the area of forest management in the southeastern United States. The sensitivity analyses reveal the impacts of the individual factors of the rotation age, intensive management practices, and harvesting limits and of the interaction of these factors on the sustainability of the forest resources. The results of the analyses suggest that the current timberland in Georgia can easily sustain the current level of harvesting with the current level of intensive management practices for different choices of the rotation ages. The volume available for harvesting would increase with an increasing rate of transition to intensively managed plantations (IMPs) regardless of the level of harvesting limits and rotation age. To ensure sustainability of forest resources under an increasing harvest scenario, part of new plantations would be required to convert to intensive management. The higher the harvesting limit, the more intensively managed plantations needed. The patterns of the changes in the volume available for harvesting by species groups were different for cases of keeping current harvesting limits and IMP levels versus applying increasing harvesting limits and an increasing transition rate to IMPs. Harvestable volumes are significantly different among each level of the three analyzed factors: transition rate to IMPs, rotation age, and harvesting limits. The study informs land use and policy decisionmakers about potential sensitivities of Georgia forest resource productivities to changes in forest practices-related rules and regulations.</jats:p>",

We then quantified vertical turbulent nutrient fluxes through the base of the euphotic zone (defined as the 1% light level), the base of the density transition zone, maximum nutrient gradients (the nutriclines), and the depth of maximum stratification (the pycnocline).

Vertical nutrient fluxes were maximal at the 1% light level and decreased by 2 orders of magnitude as they moved upward through the water column to the depth of the pycnocline. Nutrient fluxes were enhanced shoreward of the front because of high mixing rates and nutrient gradients at the depth of the 1% light level. Nitrate fluxes there averaged about 6 × 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> mmol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, sufficient to support a net community productivity of 30 mmol C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

In health care, the single largest cost after labor is materials, and it has been documented that health care facilities can reduce the environmental impacts of the products and services they consume before regulatory problems arise or waste disposal costs increase by focusing on their upstream activities. Health care systems around the country consume significant quantities and varieties of products within the health delivery processes. Solving these environmental problems requires a much broader view involving collaborative efforts of professionals from different areas of health care to meet these challenges. The purchasing function bridges the gaps by providing a healthy dialogue on key environmental attributes within the health care supply chain. The concept of bundling new with refurbished products is gaining a lot of attention in the health care supply chain. This research describes a health care purchasing problem for bundling new and refurbished products of the type facing a growing number of large health care providers, and then proposes a methodology for evaluating the complex tradeoffs involved in bundling decisions for refurbished health care products. By exploiting some useful properties of the problem structure, our results provide buyers with useful insights for examining and selecting suppliers who are willing to offer bundles of new and refurbished products.</jats:p>",

A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the critical timing of N supply on the growth, N uptake, and partitioning. Plants grown in plastic pots were subjected to five N fertilization regimes: (i) control, N supply from seedling to physiological maturity (PM); (ii) N supply from seedling to flag leaf; (iii) N supply from flag leaf to PM; (iv) N supply from seedling to heading; and (v) N supply from heading to PM. Leaf chlorophyll content, plant dry matter (DM), and N uptake and accumulation were measured. Total plant DM was 21% greater for naked ‘VAO‐2’ than for covered ‘Prescott’, while both genotypes produced similar grain yields. Varietal differences in total plant N were significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) with average of 18% higher N content for VAO‐2, but most of its accumulated N was in the vegetative components. For both varieties, N supply was more critical before heading than thereafter. Compared with the control, restriction of N supply from seedling to flag leaf stage significantly reduced spikelet number (28%) and grain yield (26%). Withholding N supply until heading reduced yield by up to 65% and N uptake by 75%. No yield reduction occurred when N was withheld from flag leaf or heading to PM. Although naked VAO‐2 accumulated more N than Prescott under the same conditions, partitioning of N to the grain in VAO‐2 was less efficient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation focuses on the life‐cycle environmental performance of products and has significant implications for management theory and practice. In this paper, we examine the influence of EPR policy parameters on product design and coordination incentives in a durable product supply chain. We model a manufacturer supplying a remanufacturable product to a customer over multiple periods. The manufacturer invests in two design attributes of the product that impact costs incurred by the supply chain— performance, which affects the environmental impact of the product during use, and remanufacturability, which affects the environmental impact post‐use. Consistent with the goals of EPR policies, the manufacturer and the customer are required to share the environmental costs incurred over the product's life cycle. The customer has a continuing need for the services of the product and optimizes between the costs of product replacement and the costs incurred during use. We demonstrate how charges during use and post‐use can be used as levers to encourage environmentally favorable product design. We analyze the impact of supply chain coordination on design choices and profit and discuss contracts that can be used to achieve coordination, both under symmetric and asymmetric information about customer attributes. </jats:p>",

The significance of this problem is heightened when the economy is in recession. In an attempt to address the problem, in this article, first, we conceptualize care as a bundle of goods, services, and experiences—including diet and exercise, drugs, devices, invasive procedures, new biologics, travel and lodging, and payment and reimbursement. We then adopt a macro, end‐to‐end, supply chain–centric view of the health care sector to link the development of care with the delivery of care. This macro, supply chain–centric view sheds light on the interdependencies between key industries from the upstream to the downstream of the health care supply chain. We propose a framework, the 3A‐framework, that is founded on three constructs—affordability, access, and awareness—to inform the design of supply chain for the health care sector. We present an illustrative example of the framework toward designing the supply chain for implantable device–based care for cardiovascular diseases in developing countries. Specifically, the framework provides a lens for identifying an integrated system of continuous improvement and innovation initiatives relevant to bridging the gap between the demand and supply for high‐quality, cost‐effective, and timely care. Finally, we delineate directions of future research that are anchored in and follow from the developments documented in the article.</jats:p>",

Shortages, created when demand grows faster than supply, have been exacerbated by relatively slow growth of certified organic farmland (in comparison to growth in retail sales) over the past decade. Organic intermediaries, referred to as handlers in the US national organic standards, work with farmers and other handlers in moving organic products along the supply chain, and are often the first to feel the effects of tight supplies at the farm level. These firms have a variety of mechanisms available to procure needed ingredients when organic products are in short supply: contracts with suppliers, encouraging suppliers to transition to organic, working with suppliers to increase their output, working with new suppliers, providing technical assistance with organic standards and production methods, and making less than load shipment arrangements with suppliers. Survey data collected from certified organic handlers are used to identify characteristics that make it more likely that an organic handler will undertake activities with suppliers to affect the supply of organic products. Handlers most likely to work with their suppliers had been in business for longer periods of time, bought from growers or grower cooperatives, and were more likely to be wholesalers. Handlers who consider price as important were less likely to undertake activities with their supplies to increase the supply or flow of organic products.</jats:p>",

Equations determine deviations in endogenous variables from observed supply and demand values. The analysis assumes 11 million US hogs are destroyed. Live swine and pork exports are stopped during the outbreak, with full recovery. Pork demand by US consumers is assumed to fall by 1% during the outbreaks, with a gradual recovery. Hog growers adjust expectations of future prices on the basis of current market conditions. One potential CSF outbreak reflects losses in the hog population skewed towards grower and finisher swine, while another outbreak has stronger effects on breeding inventory and the pig crop. The largest effects occur in pork and swine. Effects on other sectors are small. Over 20 quarters, the pork industry returns lose $4 billion. Losses for hogs, including the value of animals destroyed, range from $2.6 billion to $4.1 billion. An assumption of unchanged hog-grower expectations for returns is compared to that when expectations adjust. Unchanged expectations alter the pattern of slaughter and prices because breeding inventory falls less, thus more hogs are available for sale after Quarter 7.</jats:p>",

The field trials were conducted on a silty loam Entisol soil, poor in organic matter and rich in potassium on the fields of the Atatürk Soil and Water Resources Research Institute in Kırklareli. A randomised complete block design with three replications was applied and K‐326 Virginia tobacco cultivar was used in the experiment. Three known stages of the plant, vegetative (V), yield formation (F) and ripening (R), were considered and a total of 14 (including rain‐fed) irrigation treatments were applied. All the experimental treatments were irrigated on the same day in each growth stage with the amount of water required to fill the 0–90 cm soil depth to field capacity, and three levels of water amount reductions (0, 40 and 60%) were applied at each development stage. A single irrigation was applied during the second part of the vegetative stage, while subsequent water applications were at the 50 and 70% depletion level during the yield formation and ripening stages, respectively. Results of the 3‐year study show that either total irrigation water amounts and number of applications, or leaf yields are closely related to precipitation rate and distribution during the growing year. While the seasonal irrigation amounts applied in the adequate irrigation treatment (VFR) were greater (945 and 815 mm respectively in the drier experimental years of 2000 and 2001), they were much lower (587 mm) during the rainy year of 2003. The highest leaf yields in the range of 5170–6050 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> were obtained from the fully irrigated programme (VFR), from treatments with 40% reduction in irrigation water amount at any stage (V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>FR; VF<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>R, VFR<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and irrigation programme (FR) including omitted irrigation at vegetative stage and fully irrigated during the next two stages. It was also determined that close linear relationships exist between seasonal evapotranspiration rate and leaf yield, and seasonal evapotranspiration deficit and relative yield reduction, during each of the experimental years.

The study objective was to assess the effect of an ALA‐enriched food supply on cardiovascular risk factors in healthy males. A dietary intervention (single‐blind field trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements) was performed with 59 healthy males in a Belgian prison. Over a period of 12 weeks they were supplied with an n‐3 enriched diet (containing 6.5 g n‐3 PUFA/day compared to 4 g n‐3 PUFA/day in the standard diet) that was substituted for their regular diet, increasing mainly the α‐linolenic acid intake (from 2.8 to around 5 g/day). The results indicated no impact on subjects waist circumference, weight and BMI or systolic blood pressure. In contrast, the diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased during the intervention period (from 74.6 ± 8.2 to 71.7 ± 10.1 mmHg; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.02).

In summary, the study demonstrated that enrichment of commonly eaten food items with n‐3 fatty acids provides the opportunity to increase the n‐3 fatty acid intake and to decrease the n‐6/n‐3 ratio which results in a decreasing diastolic blood pressure and an increase of HDL‐cholesterol (in non‐smokers).</jats:p>",

We measured the uptake of tritiated leucine, as a proxy for bacterial production, in both low and high marsh habitats in four salt marshes, two of which were enriched with nutrients. We hypothesized that adding nitrogen in these detritus‐rich systems would directly stimulate bacterial decomposition of marsh peat. Contrary to our expectations, we found no response to added nutrients in high marsh habitats, where there is a significant supply of organic matter from marsh vegetation. Bacterial production did increase in the low marsh habitats, where fertilization increased the standing stock of benthic chlorophyll. Fertilization did not directly increase bacterial production by providing added nutrients that could be used to decompose organic matter derived from nutrient‐poor marsh grasses. Rather, bacterial productivity was indirectly stimulated by the concomitant increase in labile benthic microalgae in low marsh habitats. Decomposition of salt marshes may therefore have a greater resilience to the threat of chronic eutrophication than has been previously recognized.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study were to check the applicability of the soil supply and nutrient demand (SSAND) model to predict N, P and K uptake by hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides × Populus × petrowskyana var. Walker) grown with and without competition with dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and quackgrass (Elymus repens) in a controlled environment, and to determine if incorporating N mineralization into the model would improve N uptake predictions. Simulation results showed that N uptake was underestimated for hybrid poplar by 58 to 73%, depending upon soil type and weed treatment. Incorporation of N mineralization as a model input improved the hybrid poplar N uptake predictions by 24 and 67% in the pasture and alfalfa soil, respectively, when grown without weeds. The SSAND model underestimated P uptake by 84 to 89% and overestimated K uptake by 28 to 59% for hybrid poplar depending upon the soil type and weed treatment. Results from this study illustrate that modeling competition between two species in a controlled environment study is a complex process and that further work is required to understand the underlying processes controlling nutrient supply and uptake in these systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the results of a research project aimed at the conceptual development of an identification system\nfor emerging mycotoxins in European feed and food supply chains of wheat. Basic requirements for such a system\nwere addressed, including the selection of indicators, locating information sources, development of underlying\nmodel, and investigation of stakeholders' needs. The selection and ranking of key indicators for identifying emerging\nmycotoxins was based on a literature review, followed by a structured expert judgment study. The expert study\nwas based on the Delphi technique and used a panel of 43 European experts. The Delphi procedure resulted in\na selected set of 12 key indicators for each of three relevant stages of the wheat chain (cultivation; transport and\nstorage; processing). For wheat cultivation, these were: relative humidity/rainfall, crop rotation, temperature, tillage\npractice, water activity in the kernels, crop variety, harvest conditions, changes in fungal populations, fungicide\nuse, plant health, regional infection pressure and food safety awareness. For the majority of the selected indicators,\ninformation sources were identified in specific European countries. However, most sources are not readily accessible\nand particular data is lacking. A theoretical concept for a model underlying the envisioned emerging mycotoxin\nidentification system has been developed. The model links the key indicators and their information sources to aid\nand promote identification of emerging mycotoxins. It manages different types of information sources and levels of\navailable information. The needs of various stakeholder groups regarding the system were investigated by means of\ntwo empirical elicitation sessions. The results showed that all stakeholders considered that such a system would be\nbeneficial. One major challenge expected in establishing the system is stakeholder commitment to sharing data and\ninformation. This requires great efforts in improving communication and interaction between the key stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the temperature window for the self-limiting process of the ALD-grown ZnO films was also observed ranging from 290 to 310 °. The transmission and absorption spectra of the ZnO films prepared in the self-limiting regime show good optical characteristics with tramsmittance being more than 80% in the visible light region.

Daily snow water equivalent and water year‐to‐date precipitation data from multiple SNOTEL stations are combined using a statistical forecasting technique (“<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>‐Score Regression”) to predict seasonal streamflow volume. The skill of these forecasts <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic>. lead‐time is comparable to the official published outlooks. The new product matches the intra‐monthly trends in the official forecasts until the target period is partly in the past, when the official forecasts begin to use information about observed streamflows to date. Geographically, the patterns of skill also match the official outlooks, with highest skill in Idaho and southern Colorado and lowest skill in the Colorado Front Range, eastern New Mexico, and eastern Montana. The direct and frequent delivery of objective guidance to users is a significant new development in the operational hydrologic seasonal forecasting community.</jats:p>",

In a previous study, we evaluated total metabolizable protein using a TDN‐based model‐NRC‐2001 which is popular in North America. However, the TDN‐based NRC model is not accepted universally. The objectives of this study were to use a complex non‐TDN based model, the DVE/OEB system, to evaluate potential nutrient supply to ruminants from the SuperOat in comparison with two normal varieties of oats (CDC Dancer and Derby) in western Canada. The quantitative predictions were made in terms of: (i) truly absorbed rumen synthesized microbial proteins in the small intestine; (ii) truly absorbed rumen undegraded feed protein in the small intestine; (iii) endogenous protein in the digestive tract; (iv) total truly absorbed protein in the small intestine; and (v) protein degraded balance. Results showed that using the DVE/OEB system to predict the potential nutrient supply, it was found that the SuperOat had similar truly absorbed rumen synthesized microbial protein levels (61, 63, 59 g/kg DM, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05, for SuperOat, CDC Dancer and Derby, respectively), higher truly absorbed rumen undegraded feed protein than CDC Dancer (22 vs. 17 g/kg DM <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05, for SuperOat, CDC Dancer, respectively), but similar to Derby (22 vs. 21 g/kg DM; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05), and similar endogenous protein (16, 16, 18 g/kg DM; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05). Total truly absorbed protein in the small intestine is only numerically higher in the SuperOat (67 vs. 65, 62 g/kg DM, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05, for CDC Dancer and Derby, respectively). However, the protein degraded balance was significantly different (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) with a positive value for the SuperOat (7.0 g/kg DM) and negative values for two normal varieties (−1.5, −6.8 g/kg DM for CDC Dancer and Derby, respectively). In conclusion, the model predicted significantly different protein degradation balance. The SuperOat had positive degradation balance but other two normal varieties had negative protein degraded balance However, the SuperOat had similar total absorbed protein value to the two normal varieties of oats.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>MCT2 is the major neuronal monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) that allows the supply of alternative energy substrates such as lactate to neurons. Recent evidence obtained by electron microscopy has demonstrated that MCT2, like α‐amino‐3‐hydroxyl‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole‐propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, is localized in dendritic spines of glutamatergic synapses. Using immunofluorescence, we show in this study that MCT2 colocalizes extensively with GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors in neurons from various mouse brain regions as well as in cultured neurons. It also colocalizes with GluR2/3‐interacting proteins, such as C‐kinase‐interacting protein 1, glutamate receptor‐interacting protein 1 and clathrin adaptor protein. Coimmunoprecipitation of MCT2 with GluR2/3 and C‐kinase‐interacting protein 1 suggests their close interaction within spines. Parallel changes in the localization of both MCT2 and GluR2/3 subunits at and beneath the plasma membrane upon various stimulation paradigms were unraveled using an original immunocytochemical and transfection approach combined with three‐dimensional image reconstruction. Cell culture incubation with AMPA or insulin triggered a marked intracellular accumulation of both MCT2 and GluR2/3, whereas both tumor necrosis factor α and glycine (with glutamate) increased their cell surface immunolabeling. Similar results were obtained using Western blots performed on membrane or cytoplasm‐enriched cell fractions. Finally, an enhanced lactate flux into neurons was demonstrated after MCT2 translocation on the cell surface. These observations provide unequivocal evidence that MCT2 is linked to AMPA receptor GluR2/3 subunits and undergoes a similar translocation process in neurons upon activation. MCT2 emerges as a novel component of the synaptic machinery putatively linking neuroenergetics to synaptic transmission.</jats:p>",
