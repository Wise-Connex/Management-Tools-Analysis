Any factor that limits this supply of Fe could cause poor growth and would require management practices to eliminate these factors to insure good seedlings. Phosphate and Fe‐stress response were the variables used to test the availability of seed iron in the seedlings. Phosphate competes with the plant for Fe, and Fe‐stress response is an adaptive mechanism that accentuates the transport of iron. ‘PI‐54619‐5‐1’ (PI) soybean has an inefficient Fe‐stress response mechanism and ‘Hawkeye’ (HA) has a very efficient Fe‐stress response mechanism. Our objective was to determine how these factors affected the utlization of Fe from the soybean seeds as compared to Fe supplied externally.</jats:p><jats:p>Soybean seeds of these two lines were produced by plants treated from anthesis to seed maturity with <jats:sup>59</jats:sup>Fe supplied as ferric ethylenediaminedi(o‐hydroxyphenylacetate). Seedling plants, from labeled <jats:sup>59</jats:sup>Fe seeds, were subsequently studied to determine the effect of Fe‐stress response and to determine the effect of varied nutrient P on the translocation and utilization of <jats:sup>59</jats:sup>Fe from the cotyledons of Fe‐inefficient and Fe‐efficient soybeans. Cotyledonary Fe, of both lines in the seedling stage, appeared available for translocation and utilization and was not affected by Fe stress or varied nutrient P. It was concluded that Fe should not be a limiting factor in establishing a good stand of soybeans in the field because of the readily available source of Fe from the seed.</jats:p>",

The arteries of the myometrium contained no elastic lamina between the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of the media. Intraluminal trophoblast cells are present within the spiral arteries of the decidua and in areas also form an intimal lining of the vessels. Within the media of the decidual spiral arteries in early and late pregnancy trophoblast cells are also present and together with amorphous material largely replace the smooth muscle cells of the media. The electron dense material surrounding the trophoblast in the media was identified as fibrin. In late pregnancy mural thrombi were found in both myometrial and decidual spiral arteries. The removal of the elastic lamina will reduce the compliance and variation of pressure in the arterial blood flow to the placenta. The type of structural modification of the media of the arteries supplying the placenta will facilitate the expansion of these vessels to provide increased blood flow as pregnancy advances and their occlusion and collapse after parturition.</jats:p>",
