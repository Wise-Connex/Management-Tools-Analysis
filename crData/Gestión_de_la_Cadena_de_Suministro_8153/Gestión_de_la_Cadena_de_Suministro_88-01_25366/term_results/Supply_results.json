      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the role of BLDSC's Translations Section as a focal point in the national and international availability of translations. BLDSC's collection of translations into English is amongst the largest in the world (the Translations Index has over half a million entries) and the Centre is the principal source both of translations and of information about them in the UK. Translations are acquired from all over the world, covering most languages, with the main source languages emerging as Russian, German, French and Japanese. On average, 40,000 requests are received by the Translations Section each year, the majority treating BLDSC as the first and only resort. 11% of these requests are from overseas. The Centre also publishes several major bibliographical tools in this field, and has close links with other national and international translations centres. It acts not only as a document supplier but also as an information provider in this specialized area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The review begins by looking at the current debate in Australia over charges for interlending. Apart from the practical issue of raising money, the debate has broadened into a political one about charging for publicly funded services. One solution suggested is that the public library sector operates one system and the academic another. The problem of cancellations and resource sharing is examined in Belgium, where it has been planned; Australia, where it has not; and Hungary, where plans are urgently sought. A recent ICSTI report highlights the role of serials in document delivery and attempts to provide a methodology by which data on use can be monitored without involving high expenditure. A detailed study of interlending in Southern Africa emphasizes the amount of interdependence in the region and provides data not available previously on patterns of traffic. The origins of ILL requests can provide useful data for collection development but their diversity is emphasized by a little survey from the USA. Actually moving documents about is a matter given little attention, but a study of the UK system provides a valuable insight into how this is done in a compact geographical area, whereas in France the chaotic postal regulations cause numerous problems. The application of a theory from population studies to ILL looks attractive but is largely untested and founded on doubtful premises. The involvement of state agencies in the USA when setting up ILL systems varies and a contrast is drawn between the situation in Massachusetts, where the Library Board have taken the lead, and a more general study of state involvement which sees that role as largely to encourage and provide a suitable ‘atmosphere’ in which co‐operation can develop. The study of Southern Africa leads to the development of the idea that the national bookstock should be built up in response to demand rather than availability, a theory supported by the reported growth in international demand from Bulgaria as it expands its economy. Finally, for those feeling depressed by the type of work they do or their status, there is encouragement in a paper dealing with just these problems and concluding that the ILL librarian is a vital part of the whole information network.</jats:p>",

A model was used to separate the confounded effects on growth of light interception, temperature, nitrogen and water supplies, and maintenance respiration. Water supply for growth was expressed as a function of both the soil water content and evaporative demand (potential evapotranspiration). The growth of kikuyu was very sensitive to water supply. On a wet soil (soil water potential &gt; -20 kPa), an evaporative demand above 3.2 mm day-1 slowed growth. With optimum temperatures and a sward yield which gave the best balance between light interception and rate of maintenance respiration, a low evaporative demand of 2 mm day-1 reduced growth rates only when the soil water potential was less than - 134 kPa. However, with a medium-high evaporative demand of 5 mm day-1, growth was reduced by 39% on a wet soil, and ceased at a soil water potential of - 101 kPa.</jats:p>"

Taking the National Health Service libraries as a basis, the author discusses regional co‐operation from the organizational, service and economic viewpoints. Interlibrary resource sharing is valuable not only for its tangible benefits, but also (provided it is reliable and economically sound) because it provides a basis for the sharing of specialist subject knowledge, searching skills and ideas, and it also permits more general professional interaction, thus frequently bearing unexpected fruit. Several ideas have been put forward for the extension of inter‐regional co‐operation, but the importance of cost‐benefit analysis when evaluating any such scheme cannot be over‐stressed. The true cost of staff time is an item often overlooked: an appendix here gives a method of calculating the economic benefit of a resource sharing scheme by comparing the cost of co‐operative interlibrary photocopying using a union list of serials with that of using prepaid BLDSC forms.</jats:p>",

The model has been developed to overcome the problems that the conventional approaches to irreversible supply modelling face when used with a partial adjustment framework. The results indicate that the supply response to price changes under excess capacity is less than a third of that under non‐excess capacity, but that the long‐run response is symmetric, as required by the underlying theory. Furthermore, the long‐run elasticity from a conventional, symmetric, partial‐adjustment model is some 40% larger than that of the asymmetric model, implying that the importance of the asymmetric specification extends beyond an interest in the short‐run adjustment path.</jats:p>",

A model, incorporating the effects of light interception, temperature and nitrogen supply, was used to account for variation in canopy development and temperature under field conditions. The model predicted a peak growth rate of 234 kg DM ha-1 day-1 by a well-fertilized kikuyu sward with a yield of 3590 kg DM ha-1 (LAI = 5.4), and grown at maximum/minimum temperatures of 32.0/23.9�C. Growth was not limited by the nitrogen supply, provided that the nitrogen concentration of recently grown foliage exceeded 3.5%. However, at lower concentrations, assimilation (net growth plus an allowance for maintenance respiration) declined by 36% per unit decline in nitrogen concentration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The funnel-web spider Coelotes terrestris (Agelenidae) displays extended maternal care, especially characterized by a progressive provisioning of the young during a four-eight week gregarious phase. As they grow up, the spiderlings are provided with a increasing amount of prey, which is captured on the web and carried by the mother into the silk tube that represents the nest. This paper is aimed to determine the mechanism that could regulate, throughout the gregarious phase, this food-supply activity. Eleven females were observed, at different times, from one week before egg-laying till one week after the progeny's dispersal. Females' feeding behaviour noticeably changed from the young's emergence onwards. In particular, the prey was less and less handled and the overall time during which the mother kept her prey for herself-Prey Handling Time (PHT)-steadily decreased. Meanwhile, the spiderlings reacted more and more rapidly to the mother's prey catching and carrying, and they stimulated her more and more actively. The mother's prey-supply behaviour was experimentally shown to be modifiable within a short delay. Separating the mother from her brood made her shift her \"Prey Handling Time\" from a few minutes to more than two hours (i. e. about the level of the pre-emergence PHT). Conversely, reuniting the mother with her brood lead to an equivalent decrease of the PHT. This phenomenon was obtained at four different periods during the gregarious phase. The present study shows that, in this invertebrates species, the maternal provisioning activity is essentially regulated by exogenous factors: i. e. stimulations (that qualitatively and quantitatively variate in the course of time) emanating from the developing progeny.</jats:p>"

It serves both foreign and domestic copyright owners and the users of their work. Over the past ten years CCC has developed its major services. The Annual Authorizations Service (AAS) provides annual blanket licences to permit major companies to photocopy copyright material. Various statistical sampling methods are used to establish the level of use and thus the cost of the licences. In 1986 700,000 photocopies were made under this scheme. The Transactional Reporting Service (TRS) is the original scheme whereby users voluntarily report and pay copying fees for CCC‐registered publications on a per‐copy basis. At present some 2,400 users have established accounts with CCC under this scheme: approximately 3.3 million photocopies have been reported through the service since its inception in 1978, 600,000 of these in 1986. Despite the growing popularity of the AAS, this service is still showing a pattern of consistent growth. Reciprocal bilateral agreements with foreign Reproduction Rights Organizations are becoming increasingly significant to the work of CCC, since greater international co‐operation in the collection and distribution of photocopy royalties will be a vital factor in the development of international document delivery in the future.</jats:p>",

Our findings are in harmony with those which have determined M. puborectalis to be the caudal component of the levator ani and to have superior and inferior laminae. The inferior lamina contributes significantly to the mass of the puborectalis, forming the major part of its so‐called sling component that angulates the anorectal junction. The more superficial of the anterior fibers of both the M. pubococcygeus and M. puborectalis insert prerectally and contribute to what is called M. levator prostatae (pubovaginalis). Their fused borders bound the levator (urogenital) hiatus. The deeper fibers insert into the posterolateral wall of the vagina in the female. Both M. pubococcygeus and M. puborectalis also insert between the Ms. sphincter ani externus and internus, and both contribute to the postanal levator plate. The nerve supply of M. puborectalis is from the nerve to the levator ani (S 3,4) on its superior aspect, but it frequently receives an auxiliary supply from the inferior rectal and perineal branches of the pudendal nerve on its inferior aspect. The surgical significance of M. levator ani is commented on.</jats:p>",

Water was ponded for 5-12 days on swards of white clover and paspalum at full cover and on others that had been defoliated to a height of 50 mm. Photosynthetic rate was monitored each day and compared with a non-ponded control. In all cases there was little response in photosynthetic rate to ponding either with or without supplemental nitrogen fertiliser. Photosynthesis of full swards of white clover and paspalum was monitored during a drying cycle following irrigation and compared with the photosynthesis of a well-watered control. Soil water deficit was expressed in terms of cumulative evaporation minus rainfall (mm E - R) after irrigation. Water deficit stress reduced the maximum photosynthetic rate of white clover by 50% (from 0.8 mg CO2/m2.s at 25 mm E - R to 0.4 mg CO2/m2.s at 75 mm E - R), but the photosynthetic rate of paspalum did not decline until 70 mm E - R. At high irradiance, temperatures between 24 and 33�C had little effect on the photosynthetic rate of well-watered white clover, whereas the rate in paspalum was higher at temperatures between 29 and 38�C than at temperatures of 24-29�C. The slow surface drainage and subsequent rapid drying of the root-zone of flood irrigated soils, combined with the high temperatures experienced in northern Victoria during summer, favour paspalum and severely limit the productivity of white clover.</jats:p>"

The link between the U.S. money supply and exchange rates is empirically weak. Moreover, U.S. feedgrain prices and exports respond little to exchange rate changes because of a relatively high U.S. export supply price elasticity and a low price responsiveness of highly protected foreign markets. Thus, money supply changes may have only a limited effect on the U.S. feedgrain market.</jats:p>",

Its significant features include the supply of oxygen, homogeneous distribution of microcarrier suspensions and process control. Media with high protein contents, required for mammalian cell cultures tend to generate foam. This causes the flotation of solid particles. The reactor was equipped with a system of porous hydrophobic Accurel hollow fibre membranes in order to prevent the formation of bubbles. The membrane is coiled in the form of a basket, or fixed on several carriers. If the liquid pressure is higher than that of the gas phase inside the membrane, a bubble ‐ free oxygen supply to the culture broth can be achieved. The problem of axial mixing of microcarier suspensions was solved by the use of a spiral agitator, attached underneath the aeration system at the bottom of the reactor. The combined aeration and mixing system, which is driven by an eccentric motor, undergoes a tumbling motion. Sufficiently homogeneous suspensions are produced in this system at low membrane velocities, i.e. in presence of low shear forces.</jats:p>",

The radiation incident to the plant during the period from flag leaf to 10 days after flowering was varied from the control by either shading or temporarily restraining leaves of neighbouring plants. The effects of these changes in assimilate supply, and of the presence of the male inflorescence, on the immediate dry weight of various plant parts and grain sink size, and consequential on dry matter production and grain yield was investigated. The radiation treatments effected small but significant changes in crop growth rate. Shading reduced the dry weight of the ear, and husk of the female inflorescence and male inflorescence (tassel). There were increases due to enhanced radiation. While removal of tassels also enhanced the dry weight of the female inflorescence, there was no evidence that the male inflorescence was a preferred sink for assimilates during this stage of growth.In the temperate cultivars, grain number m-2 was associated with ear dry weight at 10 days after anthesis (r = 0.95**). However, only in the tropical cultivar did the larger grain sink result in an increase in grain yield. Shading reduced grain yield in all cultivars probably because of a reduction in the supply of labile assimilates for grain filling.</jats:p>"

Nitrogen shortage resulted in reduced shoot and root growth throughout the experiment, but root growth was less affected than the shoot PGR treatments drastically reduced shoot biomass production. Root growth was promoted. Both reduced nitrogen supply and application of a triazole plant growth regulator (BAS 111. W) increased the proportion of roots relative to the shoot.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Soil P supply to plant roots increases after addition of P fertilizer due to both the increase in soil solution P (<jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic>) and adsorbed P (<jats:italic>P<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>) that equilibrates rapidly with <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic>. Little information is available on the effect of added P on the concurrent increase in <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>. The objective of this research was to investigate the relation between P added and increase in <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> of 33 soils. Surface soils collected from the U. S. and Canada were equilibrated moist for three weeks with seven rates of P ranging from 0 to 655 mg P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. High rates of application occur where P is placed in a small fraction of the soil. Values for <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic> were obtained from P analysis of displaced soil solution and values for <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> from a 24‐h extraction with anion exchange resin. For all soils relation of <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic>, curvilinear with P addition, <jats:italic>x</jats:italic>, was described by <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic> = <jats:italic>ax<jats:sup>c</jats:sup></jats:italic> + <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>. Values for <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>, the curvilinearity, varied from 1.03 to 3.15. There was a negative correlation between <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> and exchangeable Ca (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.65*, significant at the 0.05 probability level) and soil solution P concentration before P addition, <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>li</jats:sub></jats:italic>, (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.61*). Adsorbed P increased linearly with P addition for all soils, the slope of the relation varying from 0.35 to 0.86. The slope indicates the fraction of added P extracted with the anion‐exchange resin. There was a positive correlation between the slopes and the effective diffusion coefficients, <jats:italic>D<jats:sub>e</jats:sub></jats:italic>, for P in the soils (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.47*). There was no significant correlation between <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> and the adsorption line slope. Development of methods for predicting the effect of added P on <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>l</jats:sub></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> will be useful in quantifying their increase in soil resulting from P addition.</jats:p>",
