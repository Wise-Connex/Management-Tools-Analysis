      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Australia rainwater tanks are used in cities to reduce demand of mains water and increase the resilience of cities to drought. Rainwater is collected in a tank and supplied to a dwelling through a small pump. Typically the energy footprint for rainwater supply (in kWh/kL) is higher than for centralised water supply, but it can also vary markedly from dwelling to dwelling (0.4–11 kWh/kL). This study aimed to understand how the design of the rainwater supply system from the collection tank to the household can reduce the energy consumption of pumping. We examined the operation of a range of system components for rainwater supply, such as pumps, switches and pressure vessels, in a controlled residential environment (a model house) to understand their impact on the energy required for rainwater supply in urban dwellings. Results show that urban rainwater applications have flow and volume requirements which cause pumps to operate at high energy for rainwater delivery. Matching pump sizes to end use requirements and adoption of ancillary devices (pressure vessels and header tanks) have the potential to lower the energy footprint for rainwater supply. However, the energy savings can be constrained by dwelling characteristics, appliances and system design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The management of a supply chain is both an offensive and defensive weapon that organisations can use to increase their competitive edge and capture a larger share of the market. In management science and supply chain management, multi-criteria decision making techniques have been used to solve a range of real-world problems. The problem is that many, if not most, companies in South Africa either do not have the required skills to use these decision-making techniques to improve or re-configure their supply chain, or they do not have a complete data set with which to model it effectively. In order to manage supply chains effectively, organisations at the very least need feedback on the performance of their entire supply chain. In this article, generic supply chain performance measures were used and a theoretical or empirical model was developed for the performance measurement of a national egg producer’s supply chain. It focused on a managerial program for the identification and management of their supply chain with recommendations for applying a measurement model. The overall performance of the supply chain as well as the five different performance attributes was presented to management in a dashboard format. This article could be used as a basis for future studies of supply chain performance measurement and the model could be used as a foundation for developing an improved version, not only for the egg industry, but for other industries as well. </jats:p>"

Rainwater followed the course that was prescribed for its storage from the flat rooftops to underground cisterns. The water on the roof of the temple of Apollo Karneios followed a comparable route, the study of which answered many questions regarding a false – as it turned out – reconstruction of the temple plan.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The city of Istanbul has important water system remnants from old civilizations among which water line systems begun with Byzantine period and continued during Ottoman era, including Kırkçeşme water supply system. The original gallery structure within the Kırkçeşme system has been altered with time at some places as a result of necessary planning activities, restoration and repair works. All these activities helped to keep almost the system originality. Since its first opening in 1564, its discharge increased steadily as a result of additional drainage feeding line connections to the main gallery. However, through time only a couple of the 570 additional lines have remained in operation. Although other similar establishments have perished in time without leaving even traces, the Kırkçeşme system is its vivid and harmonious appearance in front of eyes even today. Four dams were constructed at the most convenient locations along the water supply lines from 1620 to 1818. The water from the streams was collected during the rainy season and discharged to the city at times of need with increasing capacity. In general, the Kırkçeşme system has two branches: one extends towards the east, which seemed to have more water, due to its feedback from the Kirazlı, Topuz and Paşa tributaries of the Kağıthane stream; the other branch is westwards which is fed by the Ayvad Deresi, Orta Dere and Bakraç Dere tributaries of the Kağıthane stream. All the water are brought together at Başhavuz (main pool) south of Kemerburgaz, where they collectively enter the main supply line crossing the Alibey Stream over the Mağlova Aqueduct, and then joining a branch from the Cebeciköy Stream and finally flow in towards the south. In a historical document called Tezkiret'ül Bünyan, (The Book of Structures) the author states that Sinan pledged to the Sultan about the existence of some old waterways. However, the Roman waterway still remains in the vicinity of Cebeciköy, which is located at a higher elevation than the Kırkçeşme water supply line but ran parallel to it. The water supply system should have integrated perspective for operation and maintenances. On the other hand, standing structures give to humanity the impression that the stability and design carry not only water, but also valuable cultural heritage. Moreover, they connect many civilizations with each other and also past as well as future.</jats:p>",

The automotive industry is perceived to be the most advanced in supply chain management practices in South Africa. It has embraced technology and management practices that have transformed the manufacturing environment by using cutting-edge design and visualisation tools. However, the industry has fragilities and faces new and emerging supply chain challenges. A survey research design was employed and  the  data  was  collected  through  face-to-face  semi-structured  interview  questionnaires based on the purposive sampling technique. Data analysis and interpretation was based on descriptive  statistics  using  SPSS  software.  The  findings  revealed  that  there  are  challenges hindering  best  supply  chain  practices  of  local  vehicle  manufacturers.  The  research  also revealed that there is a perceived difference in supply chain challenges between the different manufacturers of different origins in South Africa. Asian manufacturers felt much stronger about the adequacy of their information systems compared to the European manufacturers. Asian  manufacturers  tended  to  agree  more  than  their  European  counterparts  that  labour problems were a challenge. European manufacturers, on the other hand, tended to agree more that rail transport is unreliable. This article contributes to the body of knowledge on supply chain practices in South Africa. </jats:p>"

However, research about the investigation of the role of information technology resources in fostering collaborative communication, network governance and relationship longevity in the small and medium enterprise sector has remained scant. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the influence of information technology on collaborative communication, network governance and relationship longevity in Zimbabwe’s SME sector. Five research hypotheses were posited and sample data from 162 small and medium enterprise suppliers were collected and used to empirically test the hypotheses. The results of this study showed that information technology resources positively influenced small and medium enterprise suppliers’ collaborative communication, network governance and consequential relationship longevity with their buyers in a significant way. Overall, the current study findings provided tentative support to the proposition that information technology resources, collaborative communication and network governance should be recognised as significant antecedents for improved relationship longevity between suppliers and their buyers in the SME setting. Therefore, managers in the small and medium enterprise sector and small and medium enterprise owners need to pay attention to both collaborative communication and network governance in order to optimise information technology resource impact on their relationship longevity with their business counterparts. Limitations and future research directions were also indicated.</jats:p>"

Efficient, unrestricted information flow is needed in supply chains to function properly. Information flow is thus an element of supply chain management that needs to be managed. Yet, no indication could be found in supply chain management literature of the measurement of information flow efficiency. Hence, the aim of this article is to explore the measurement of information flow efficiency in supply chain management (SCM) and exploratively develop possible measures (indicators and associated metrics) to measure the efficiency of information flow.In this research the theory of information and related concepts, the basic notions of information systems and the models of business performance measurement were explored. Based on information flow theory and information flow characteristics a research instrument was developed. It was used in a survey to seek inputs from supply chain managers as to the usefulness of characteristics as indicators and metrics for the measurement of information flow efficiency in a supply chain. The main contribution of the study is the development of a conceptual framework of indicators and metrics that may be used to evaluate the efficiency of information flows in supply chains. The results of this study can be used as a basis for further studies to validate the instrument for measuring information flow efficiency and to develop scales to actually measure information flow efficiency.</jats:p>"

We model the first two strategies as single-period Stackelberg games, and we model the last strategy as a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental—the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental—the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer. </jats:p>",

The city is one of the oldest cities and has hosted many civilizations throughout the centuries, beginning from 11500 BC. The acquired archaeological heritage shows that the city had important water supply practices. Many water structures, which can be categorized as the structures of the pre-Islamic Period (Roman Period) and post-Islamic Period (Ottoman Period), were constructed in the city. Charity structures and cisterns, Turkish baths, aqueducts and dams, water balance facilities, maksems, bridges, wells, fountains and karliks are among these structures. Roman influence is observed in the water architecture of the Ottoman Empire. The influence is best observed in the hayrats of the city, built in the pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Period. During the history of the city, the settled communities have destroyed many of the cultural structures of previous civilizations; however they have protected and developed water structure systems. This situation has meant that water structures have lasted to the present and it is interesting to note that most of these systems are still in use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Restaurants, in general, utilise numerous suppliers. Normally they deliver on different days in the week and at different times during the day, logistically not an optimum approach. Not only does the current practice cause frequent interruptions, but by segregating the food supply chain unnecessary traffic is generated. This article investigated the need for developing a third party supplier hub, the best positioning of that hub and the most economical routes to the customers. With the aim of providing non-franchised restaurants with the necessary leverage to become market leaders, the hub is planned to only service the restaurants within the vicinity of the Stellenbosch area. In such a hub-configured supply chain, the suppliers would be delivering to the proposed hub, from where once-off deliveries to all the restaurants may be made on days and/or times determined by them. In order to investigate the benefits of providing such a hub structure, a systematic implementation approach was used. The first step was to do market research in order to establish the need for such a hub. That is, the viability of the hub from a restaurant’s perspective was established. The next step entailed the investigation of the design criteria needed in determining a favourable hub location. Four possible hub locations were identified. The Clark and Wright’s savings algorithm was then used to determine the optimal hub location and the feasibility of the results was verified with the aid of a global positioning system (GPS) device. The last steps followed involved the determination of an effective hub floor plan that may be utilised, possible products that can be supplied to the restaurants and the necessary assets needed to provide the hub’s service. Finally, by incorporating all these facets, a cost analysis was done to determine the hub’s profitability.</jats:p>"

Criteria for purity have become more complex, more rigid, and more quantitative over time; however, the principles, methods, and material for purifying water have remained remarkably similar from the earliest recorded information of 2000 BC. The scope of this paper is to present a brief history of water filtration and sedimentation practices for potable water management extending from the ancient times to the 19th century. It is not an exhaustive presentation, but instead presents some of the most important advances in water supply since the beginning of human's quest for pure water. M. N. Baker and M. J. Taras in 1981 presented an excellent overview of this quest, especially during the 17th to the 20th century.</jats:p>",

Research into the history of water from an automation point of view has led to some unknown or hidden facts. Starting from the ancient Greek period before the prophet Christ and after about the 12th century, many researchers tried to make use of water power for working some simple but effective devices for the service of mankind. Among these are the haulage of water from a lower level to a higher elevation by water wheels in order to irrigate agricultural land. Hero during the Hellenistic period and Vitruvius of the Roman Empire were among the first who tried to make use of water power for use in different human activities, such as water haulage, watermills, water clocks, etc. The highlights of these works were achieved by a 12th century Muslim researcher, Abou-l Iz Al-Jazari, who lived in the southeastern part of modern day Turkey. He reviewed all the previous work from different civilizations and then suggested his own designs and devices for the use of water power in automation of excellent types. He even combined animals and water power through early designs of valves, pistons, cylinders and crank mills, as will be explained in this paper. His works were revealed by German historians and engineers in the first quarter of the 19th century. Later, an English engineer translated his book from Arabic into English, revealing the guidelines for modern automation and robotic designs originating from the 12th century. This paper gives a brief summary of the early workers' devices and Abou-l Iz Al-Jazari's much more developed designs with his original hand-drawn pictures.</jats:p>",

Based on the bargaining power of supplier, the profit coordination with and without incentives are respectively explored. For the total cost minimizations of buyer and supplier separately, two stage stackelberg leader-follower game models, in which buyer is the leader and supplier is the follower, are established. Supplier applies JIT delivery to reduce buyer’s cost and the total cost of the supply chain via dividing buyer’s order per batch into some batches to deliver. Finally, a numerical example and a simulation analysis are given and the impact of the variation of relative parameters on the total cost saving of buyer, supplier and system is discussed. In addition, the efficiency of game decision on the basis of JIT lot-splitting is proved.</jats:p>"

In Europe, the largest share of cargo is transported by road transport, where empty running accounts for about 27%. The statistical result reflects the inefficient use of transportation resources. Today it may be difficult to imagine the whole distribution chain of automobiles manufactured in Europe that would integrate all manufacturers. Nevertheless, in an effort to diminish the shortcomings of transport operations, automotive manufacturers and Logistics Service Providers (LSP) should pay more attention to logistics cooperation. The article presents the specific features of distribution networks of vehicles manufactured in Europe, also providing a scenario of integrating finished vehicle output of different vehicle manufacturers in a single distribution network. The demand for transport resources and efficiency of use of the resources was established according to the scenario. This article is a contribution and a fresh look at the variety of the solutions of transportation problems in modern European automotive industry.</jats:p>",

This is even more apparent in the case of maintenance inventories for production equipment, which impact directly on production equipment efficiency. This is a typical inventory management issue for a cement manufacturer that faces the problem of managing its maintenance inventories optimally when certain maintenance items have exceptionally long lead times (100 weeks) and values in excess of R500 000. An assessment of the cement manufacturer’s approach to managing its maintenance inventories indicated various shortcomings, which have resulted in a significant level of obsolescence. One approach to managing maintenance inventories efficiently is to implement a classification of the inventory items in terms of their criticality to the cement production process. The critical nature of a component could be established through a risk-based approach (minimisation of the risk of production loss) and taking into account the type of maintenance (planned vs unplanned) that the component is required for. A risk-based approach should form the basis of the maintenance inventory management of the cement manufacturer as this would allow the cement manufacturer to utilise other inventory management methods effectively. In addition, it is important to ensure that employees are well versed in the different inventory management approaches utilised and that high levels of integration between departments are pursued.</jats:p>"

Successful water management was one of the key dynamic factors in the city's development. As a result of the location of Kunming City, in its early age it was in a narrow area between the north bank of Dian Chi lake and the mountains, therefore the water management in the history of Kunming City mainly focused on two key projects, one being the Song Hua Ba Dam with the function to control flooding from Pang Long Jiang river, and the other the Hai Kou He river dredging project to control the drainage from Dian Chi lake, therefore shaping a water supply system for the city in the upper basin of the Yangtze River. Pang Long Jiang river is only one large river from the mountains flowing across the city into Dian Chi lake. Therefore the city's development from its early age (11th century) mainly depended on irrigation and flood control of Pan Long Jiang river basin and the basic water system for the city was formed before the 17th century (Ming Dynasty), the most important period of the city's water history.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>From about 1650 until 1200 BC Hattuša (pronounced Hattusha) was the capital of the Hittite Empire in central Asia Minor. On the steep terrain of today's ruined city lived and worked thousands of people whose homes, cattle, tools and places of worship had to be supplied with water. The question arose regarding how water was conveyed into the large-scale ponds in the urban area. The silted East Ponds (36,000 m3) and South Ponds (20,000 m3) have been excavated since the 1980s. A supply of the large volumes of water by a long pipeline from outside the city was repeatedly discussed. Due to the topographic, hydraulic and geo-hydrological conditions however, a long distance supply would have been uneconomic and also unnecessary. Still today, many willow fountains in the region are fed by artesian groundwater. It was therefore assumed that the ponds were cut into the slope aquifers and filled during the wet season. To verify this hypothesis, groundwater monitoring stations were installed in the autumn of 2009 directly uphill of the pond banks. Observed groundwater levels 2009–2011 are low in summer but rise above the former pond surfaces during winter. The Hittites used exfiltrating groundwater also in other reservoirs avoiding hefty and strongly varying surface inflows.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, it is uncertain what the understanding of logistics is for key stakeholders in the country. This article reports on a project; the objectives were to address some of these issues and to lay the foundation for a more thorough investigation in the future. The findings of the initial project were disseminated in 2012 by: a conference paper showing the challenges and opportunities facing logistics in Namibia in 2012; a report; and through a Logistics and Transport Workshop held in Walvis Bay, Namibia in September 2012. These reports, additional interviews and subsequent discussions highlighted some potential opportunities and problems. This article summarises the project to date, showing the methodology and findings as updated by subsequent feedback and further interviews. The findings from key stakeholders of the logistics industry in Namibia include: universal agreement on the importance of logistics to Namibia; the variety in the understanding of the term logistics; the strength of the continuing influence of South Africa as the dominant economic power in southern Africa; and contrasting views on the main factors limiting logistics development, including infrastructure, attitude, government, customs, training, railways, corruption and driver shortage.</jats:p>"

The scope of this study is the presentation of the most characteristic examples of extant hydraulic works and related hydro-technologies in Minoan Crete. During Minoan times the focus of water management was on sustainable, small-scale safe, cost-efficient and environmentally-friendly practices which might be relevant today, as the water supply and wastewater management problems of modern societies are not very different from those faced by Minoans.</jats:p>",

The wealth of data available enables a segmented analysis of future freight transportation demand in order to assist with the prioritisation of transportation investments, the development of transport policy and the growth of the logistics service provider industry. In 2011, economic demand for commodities in South Africa’s competitive surface-freight transport market amounted to 622 million tons and is predicted to increase to 1834m tons by 2041, which is a compound annual growth rate of 3.67%. Fifty percent of corridor freight constitutes break bulk; intermodal solutions are therefore critical in South Africa. Scenario analysis indicates that 80%of corridor break-bulk tons can by serviced by four intermodal facilities – in Gauteng, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. This would allow for the development of an investment planning hierarchy, enable industry targeting (through commodity visibility), ensure capacity development ahead of demand and lower the cost of logistics in South Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A large ensemble of 24 bias-corrected and uncorrected regional climate model (RCM) simulations is used to investigate climate change impacts on water supply patterns over Germany using the seasonal winter and summer Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on 6-month precipitation sums. The climate change signal is studied comparing SPI characteristics for the reference period 1971–2000 with those of the \"near\" (2036–2065) and the \"far\" (2071–2100) future. The spread of the climate change signal within the simulation ensemble of bias-corrected versus non-corrected data is discussed. Ensemble scenarios are evaluated against available observation-based data over the reference period 1971–2000. After correcting the model biases, the model ensemble underestimates the variability of the precipitation climatology in the reference period, but replicates the mean characteristics. Projections of water supply patterns based on the SPI for the time periods 2036–2065 and 2071–2100 show wetter winter months during both future time periods. As a result soil drying may be delayed to late spring extending into the summer period, which could have an important effect on sensible heat fluxes. While projections indicate wetting in summer during 2036–2065, drier summers are estimated towards the south-west of Germany for the end of the 21st century. The use of the bias correction intensifies the signal to wetter conditions for both seasons and time periods. The spread in the projection of future water supply patterns between the ensemble members is explored, resulting in high spatial differences that suggest a higher uncertainty of the climate change signal in the southern part of Germany. It is shown that the spread of the climate change signals between SPIs based on single ensemble members is twice as large as the difference between the mean climate change signal of SPIs based on bias-corrected and uncorrected precipitation. This implies that the sensitivity of the SPI to the modelled precipitation bias is small compared to the range of the climate change signals within our ensemble. Therefore, the SPI is a very useful tool for climate change studies allowing us to avoid the additional uncertainties caused by bias corrections.\n                    </jats:p>"

This study attempted to gain a better understanding of reverse logistics and the costs associated with it. A literature study was conducted to identify the cost problems in reverse logistics and possible practices to overcome them. Following that, a survey was conducted to determine whether the practices identified in literature are perceived to be important in South Africa and if they are viable to implement. This was done by means of a gap and opportunity analysis. Results indicated that most practices are important, but some may be difficult to implement. The framework developed in this study provides a guideline for organisations to consider, adapt and adopt the most important implementable practices to overcome cost problems in reverse logistics. The limitation of this study is that only ten respondents participated in the survey. The approach followed in this study can be used as a foundation for future studies in reverse logistics.</jats:p>"

Starting from a benchmark equilibrium which reflects the current German family policy regime we introduce various reforms of the tax and child benefit system and quantify the consequences for birth rates and female labor supply. Our simulations indicate three central results: First, higher transfers to families (either direct, in-kind or via family splitting) may increase birth rates significantly, but they may come at the cost of lower female employment. Second, the introduction of individual taxation (instead of joint taxation of couples) would increase female employment but might further reduce current birth rates in Germany. Third, it is possible to increase birth rates and female employment rates simultaneously if the government invests in child care facilities for children of all ages.</jats:p>",

The results tentatively confirmed that the more successful company, in a turbulent market, sees distribution activities as less important than other aspects of the marketing mix, but uses them to stabilise customer relationships and to maintain distribution processes. These findings can benefit marketers by emphasising a new way to consider place activities. How marketers can be assisted, and suggestions for further research, are provided.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>South Africa has two major rail operators that constitute the rail transport industry. These are Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), which operates freight and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA). Although the Railway Safety Regulator (2011:29) reported the year on year declining trend of collisions, the main concern is that the costs incurred for each year’s incidents is escalating. This article is concerned with the declining safety standards of these operators as evidenced by 742 collisions recorded during the 2011/2012 financial year for both operators. The focus is mainly on collisions during the movement of rolling stock within the PRASA environment. The analysis of the occurrences is narrowed down, with the emphasis on the province of Gauteng. In the analysis of the causes of these collisions, the problems that led to the root causes of these collisions is reported. Of critical importance is that every transport operator is faced with the challenges of how to effectively respond to the basic transport needs and requirements of the travelling public. The transport users’ need is to travel between the two geographical points. During the journey between these geographical points, the operator has safety and security requirements and must provide a reliable, accessible and affordable transport system. As the travelling public becomes more affluent, the transport needs become open ended and require much more rational public choices. The rail transport system remains a vital or indispensable business sector of the economy. By investing in new technology, rolling stock and infrastructure, we woud see an increase in innovation, competitiveness, and an elevated standard of living.</jats:p>"

Remains of several fullonicae have been documented at Pompeii and Herculaneum (Campania, Southern Italy), Ostia and Rome (Latium region, Central Italy), Florence (Tuscany, Central Italy), etc. The common academic perception of Roman fullonicae is significantly influenced by the fullonica of Stephanus (I 6, 7) in Pompeii, which is assumed to be a paradigmatic case study in this paper. The use of urine as an alkaline chemical agent in the soaping phase of the filling treatment process was overstated, with there also being no evidence of the fact that fullers collected their urine by means of vessels in front of their workshops, as usually reported. Thus, it is not clear how the Roman fullers collected and transported the urine they used in the fulleries. Finally, the rinsing phase can be considered a clear example of water reuse.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Attention to ‘sustainability’ and energy efficiency rating schemes in the commercial property sector has increased rapidly during the past decade. In the UK, commercial properties have been certified under the BREEAM rating scheme since 1999, offering fertile ground to investigate the economic dynamics of ‘green’ certification in the commercial property market. This paper documents that, over the 2000–09 period, the expanding supply of green buildings within a given London neighbourhood had a positive impact on average rents and prices, but reduced rents and prices for environmentally certified real estate. The results suggest that there is a gentrification effect from green buildings. However, each additional “green” building decreases the marginal effect of certification in the rental and transaction markets by 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In addition, controlling for lease contract features, like contract length and the rent-free period, modifies the impact of environmental certification on rental prices. </jats:p>",

The main focus of this study was to determine the logistics opportunity costs of using road transport within a mining firm. A case study approach was followed, as the investigation aimed to analyse a complex problem experienced by one company and present it in an easily understandable format. From the results of this study, it was apparent that the logistics opportunity costs associated with the mode of transport was substantial. This highlighted the need for firms to revise their choice of transport mode on a regular basis, as it has a major impact not only on their transportation costs, but also on their inventory holding and carbon emissions. The results also have implications for South Africa’s only freight railway, Transnet Freight Rail, which should not only focus on expanding its existing capacity, but also on improving its customer service delivery whilst containing tariff increases.</jats:p>"

This lead to more limited social-contact opportunities with other students, which are vital for the enhancement of their learning and development. It also resulted in off-campus students spending a considerable amount of time travelling to and from university. This study aimed to investigate the travel patterns, characteristics and challenges faced by University of Johannesburg off-campus students by ascertaining inter alia: the means of transport used; travel time; the views of students in regard to the challenges they face; and possible improvements thereto. A quantitative approach was predominantly used to collect data from students by means of a questionnaire and this was supplemented with focus group discussions on two campuses. The study results revealed that off-campus students experience considerable challenges accessing campuses.</jats:p>"

More and more space and time are needed to store and process such huge amounts of RFID data, and there is an increasing realization that the existing approaches cannot satisfy the requirements of RFID data management. In this paper, we present a split-path schema-based RFID data storage model. With a data separation mechanism, the massive RFID data produced in supply chain management systems can be stored and processed more efficiently. Then a tree structure-based path splitting approach is proposed to intelligently and automatically split the movement paths of products . Furthermore, based on the proposed new storage model, we design the relational schema to store the path information and time information of tags, and some typical query templates and SQL statements are defined. Finally, we conduct various experiments to measure the effect and performance of our model and demonstrate that it performs significantly better than the baseline approach in both the data expression and path-oriented RFID data query performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The North American and South African logistics cost calculation-time series are the two longest-running statistical series available worldwide. These calculations indicate that transportation’s contribution to logistics costs is rising, as the key cost driver (oil price) is increasing exponentially. This is exacerbated by volatile oil prices and the inclusion of externality charges to reduce the logistics environmental footprint. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a new paradigm where material logistics requirements are reduced through localisation and consumption reduction. This, in turn, implies the consideration of new indicators for the future measurement of logistics costs. Because this article asks questions about the suitability of GDP as the primary (and often only) measurement of economic output, new measurements are required. If this position changes, the comparison of logistics costs with GDP alone will become questionable.</jats:p>"

An annual survey of 1000 South Africans is conducted to gauge opinion on transport related matters. The purpose of this article was to compare the current public transport policies (as stated above) and the public opinion on public transport (as gauged by the survey) in order to determine the extent to which these are aligned. The results  show  that  current  public  transport  policy  is  relatively  strongly  aligned  with  the public transport needs of the South African population, however, concerns regarding public transport such as mobility, accessibility, affordability and safety have not yet to be addressed satisfactorily.</jats:p>"

The city is a unique and historic settlement that hosts very beautiful examples of traditional Turkish architecture. The city attracts both national and international tourists. In this paper, firstly the Ottoman period water supply structures of Safranbolu are described. Incekaya Aqueduct and water transmission system, also known as the Pasha Water Supply System or Spring System are discussed. The Incekaya Aqueduct delivers drinking water from the spring at Danaköy Village to Safranbolu enabling the transfer over the Tokatlı Canyon via gravity. This aqueduct, a very historic and aesthetically pleasing water structure, was commissioned as a city asset by Ottoman Grand Vizier Izzet Mehmet Pasha in the period of 1794–98. The paper secondly discusses the pool rooms that serve as an example of the spatial usage of water features in traditional residential architecture of the Ottoman period in Safranbolu. The pool rooms were constructed either within or separate from the traditional Safranbolu mansions. Asmazlar Mansion in Safranbolu and Deligözler House in the Bağlar District have been evaluated as examples of pool rooms within the house, and two garden pools in the Bağlar and central districts are assessed as examples of outside pools, known as pavilion mansions with a garden pool.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The public sector is recognised as being one of the most important customer groups for many suppliers and service providers because of the volume of public expenditure. Supplier relationship management (SRM) is a necessary tool on which businesses in the public and private sectors rely. However, in the South African public sector, despite the intention to boost service delivery through efficient and effective supplier-management processes, the development of sound supplier relationships is a challenge. The purpose of this article is to provide insight into supplier-relationship challenges and to suggest a framework for implementing SRM in the South African public sector. The research presented is based on a survey using both descriptive and exploratory research. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with 15 participants at eight institutions in KwaZulu-Natal. Purposive sampling techniques were used. The findings reveal that the main supplier-related challenges that handicap procurement practices in the province are a lack of experience, a lack of affirmable suppliers, threats and bribes, a lack of integrity, an inability to meet delivery deadlines and quality issues. The findings further reveal that supplier relationships in the public sector are of a transactional nature. A five-stage framework is therefore recommended for implementing SRM in the South African public sector and in order to assist government procurement officials to reap the benefits of SRM whilst supporting the requirements of public-sector procurement.</jats:p>"

The objective is to determine a feasible production plan, which minimizes production, holding, and setup costs. As the LP relaxation of a model formulation based on the well-known CLSP leads to very poor lower bounds, we propose a column-generation approach to determine tighter bounds. The lower bound obtained by column generation can be easily transferred into a feasible solution by a truncated branch-and-bound approach using CPLEX. The results of an extensive numerical study show the high solution quality of the proposed solution approach.</jats:p>",

In order to prevent the recurrence of such disasters, in 525, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian had built a huge wall of stone (Justinian wall) to the northwest of the city that conducted the river to the north and east walls of the city. He also constructed an artificial channel and three bridges which are known as the Justinian system. This system has been used by the many civilizations that have occupied the city, since the 6th century. Each civilization added some new water structures to the system and carried out some renovations to it. The system, being still in use, defended the city against moderate size floods and survived for 1,500 years. In this paper, the Justinian system is evaluated from the hydraulic point of view together with its ongoing functionality. It is interesting that although the cultural structures of the civilizations settled in the city do not have the same characteristics, the water structures have similar features in terms of hydraulic and architectural perspectives.</jats:p>",

In South Africa, deregulation has had wide-reaching effects on the domestic market. The purpose of this article was to investigate the current domestic air transport market. A literature review was performed to examine the effects of deregulation in other domestic air transport markets around the world. This was followed by a review of the South African domestic air transport market prior to deregulation in order to determine the changes that were made following deregulation. The ten-year period immediately following deregulation was also examined; this period was characterised by relatively large numbers of market entries and exits. A database was obtained from the Airports Company South Africa; air traffic movements, passenger numbers and load factors were evaluated. The study showed that the market is still characterised by regular market entries and exits. Also that the entry of the low-cost carriers has stimulated the market, resulting in increased air traffic movements, higher passenger numbers, higher load factors in general and the opening of a secondary airport in Gauteng, Lanseria International. Deregulation and, more specifically, the entry of the low-cost carriers has resulted in structural changes in the market and more choice for passengers.</jats:p>"

The IPQC circuit uses a Cuk buck-boost converter to operate it in a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) using the voltage follower technique for the mitigation of harmonic contents present in the AC mains current. Subsequently, reduction in harmonic contents results in improving the power quality indices at the AC mains. Single-stage single switch converter topology is used, which has less component count, size and cost as compared to the two-stage converter topology. DCM operation has an advantage that only output voltage control loop is required as compared to three control loops required in the continuous conduction mode operation. An 18-W LED driver is designed, modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software for 220 V, 50 Hz AC mains. The performance of the proposed LED driver is observed in terms of total harmonic distortion of the input current (THDi), input power factor (PF) and crest factor (CF) taking into account the strict international standard of IEC 61000-3-2 for class C equipments.</jats:p>",

But, we cannot confirm a Mediterranean influence on wastewater management, because of the previous development of several techniques in the region.

This poses difficulties for many households across the country, especially in the dry season when stored rainwater – a common source for many – becomes difficult to obtain, necessitating a switch to sources unsafe for consumption. This study evaluates the effect of seasonal climate on bottled water as an alternative solution to accessing safe drinking water. A study of 240 households in the Battambang province, Cambodia correlated seasonal uptake of bottled water with household wealth, quality of road access and access to alternatives. This was supported by historical data on bottled water uptake from three communities. The results suggest that substantial seasonal change in uptake occurs in rural Cambodia; most noticeably in households of low wealth. As one of the first studies on bottled water in Cambodia, these are important findings; particularly given the recent increase in rural bottled water distribution. The study finds bottled water is not an appropriate means for Non-Governmental Organisations targeting the poorest strata of the community; however there is potential for the private sector to supply more affluent households.</jats:p>",

Approximately 1 × 108cell/mL of E. coli were spiked into water samples contaminated with 500 ppb of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and benzene. Water samples were then treated in a bench-scale photoreactor using 15 W low pressure (LP) and 150 W medium pressure (MP) UV lamps. Hydrogen peroxide at 20, 50 and 100 ppm and ozone at 1, 2 and 5 ppm were used along with the UV irradiation to generate the hydroxyl radicals (.OH) needed to degrade organic contaminants such as MTBE and benzene and most likely destroy bacteria. The results of the study showed that, under the study conditions, no effect of benzene or MTBE was observed on the inactivation rate of the bacteria. Moreover, results showed that the combined effect of the LP 15 W UV lamp with 2 ppm O3 or with 50 ppm H2O2 showed the highest inactivation rate of bacteria within 5 min. The H2O2/O3 process showed high disinfection capability at high dosages of peroxide (50 ppm) and O3 (2 and 5 ppm).</jats:p>",

Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1325 to 1370, price elasticities of supply are estimated for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate price elasticities of supply for wheat, barley, and oats were rarely statistically significant and when significant were very low compared with elasticities estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The low levels of agricultural supply response in fourteenth‐century England suggest that commercialization was not as dominant in the medieval economy as has been argued. Thus, structural changes in the economy, such as the leasing of demesnes, the growth of wage labour, and the end of villeinage, may have been more important than price fluctuations in driving long‐run economic change after the Black Death. Likewise, a shift from low price responsiveness to higher price responsiveness could have been an important part of the capitalist transformation of agriculture in the early modern period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a pilot scale study consisting of pre-treatment with a granular activated carbon (GAC) filter followed by membrane filtration. Detailed characterisation of rainwater tanks has highlighted that turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and heavy metals, in particular lead, were not compliant with the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG). Further, organic matter present in the water causes membrane fouling and leads to carcinogenic compounds upon chlorination. A GAC filter was used as a first step to remove dissolved organic matter (measured in terms of DOC) in particular and also to reduce the concentration, of turbidity and lead. Membrane filtration can remove any remaining solids reducing the concentrations of turbidity and microorganisms. In this study a pilot scale rainwater treatment system consisting of a gravity fed GAC filter and membrane filter (Ultra Flo) was operated for a period of 120 days. The performance of this system was assessed in terms of membrane flux and improvement in water quality measured against the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. Determination of the flux especially in the later stages of membrane operation was important to be able to size the filters in a manner that meets the expected demand. The treatment system of GAC filter and membrane filter was effective in reducing the turbidity, DOC and heavy metals. The system reduced the turbidity to levels of 0.3–0.4 NTU, below the ADWG limit of 1 NTU. The concentration of DOC was reduced to below the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines limit of 0.2 mg/L. The concentration of lead was reduced to less than 0.005 mg/L, and below the ADWD limit of 0.01 mg/L. The concentrations of all other heavy metals were well within the ADWG limits. Further, the GAC filter removed a majority of the organic substances from raw rainwater collected from the roof. After the initial flux decline, the stable flux achieved was 0.47 L/m2/h consistently over the final 60 days of the experiment.</jats:p>",

We find that even a flexible water pricing cannot guarantee higher adoption of efficient irrigation technology in all cases. Results of the paper indicate that if a farmer invests in water storage capacity, then the value of efficient usage of water increases, and the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation technology will be higher. It establishes a complementarity relationship between investments in storage capacity and adoption of efficient irrigation technology. The relationship becomes stronger with increasing variance in water supply. In a situation without any option to store water at the farm level, we find a negative relationship between investment in efficient irrigation technology and water variability. However, numerical analysis results suggest that a risk averse farmer may invest more in efficient irrigation only if the variance in water supply is very high.</jats:p>",

Microorganisms often tend to lose their culturability after disinfection, but could remain viable to proliferate under optimum conditions. Estimation of bacterial counts using culture-based methods pose limitations in differentiating viable, non-viable, and viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells. Presence of viable and VBNC state cells in disinfected water could pose a potential health risk and accurate estimation of these cells through a molecular method is critical. Assessment of live/dead states of an indicator waterborne pathogen, Escherichia coli (ATCC®10798) after disinfection was conducted using flow cytometry. Photocatalysis was carried out under low pressure ultraviolet (LP UV) radiation alone and at four titanium dioxide (TiO2) concentrations (1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.1 g/L). During the repair period, flow cytometry showed 4–5 log10 higher cell counts than the culture-based method. Photocatalysis using 0.1 g/L TiO2 resulted in 50% cells with intact cell membrane during the repair period and lowered the repair rate of the ATCC®10798, E. coli after disinfection.</jats:p>",

The breakthrough time was 1.5–2.6, 2.5–5.5, and 6.2–12.2 h for a superficial velocity of 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 cm/s, respectively, for the nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater to satisfy the safe standard for drinking of 10 mg/L (as per the Ministry of Environment in Korea's 2011 Management of Drinking Water Act); the slower the superficial velocity, the longer is the breakthrough time. The ion exchange amount was a maximum of 28.37 mg/g for a superficial velocity of 2.0 cm/s, and the ion exchange amount decreased with slower or faster superficial velocities. The ratio of adsorbent used shows a linear relationship with the column diameter to length ratio and an inverse one with the superficial velocity. It is a maximum of 79% for a superficial velocity of 0.5 cm/s and a column diameter to length ratio of 1:10. Multiple regression analysis with the superficial velocity, nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater, and column diameter to length ratio showed that the initial nitrate nitrogen concentration has the strongest influence on the ion exchange amount. A 10% NaCl regenerant solution of 20 times the reactor volume is required to accomplish &amp;gt;99% of ion exchange bed regeneration in a groundwater treatment facility when applied to a packed column filled with PP-g-AA-Am.</jats:p>",

Anthropogenic eutrophication is an environmental problem of special concern because it can restrict water use due to aquatic systems deterioration. Therefore, trophic state prediction is an important tool for the rapid detection of water quality decrease and the identification of priority areas where action is needed. Within this context, the aim of this research was to assess the role of TVS (total volatile solids) in predicting the trophic status of subtropical reservoirs. To achieve this goal, four stations in the Itupararanga Reservoir (São Paulo State, Brazil) were sampled during dry, intermediate and rainy periods to determine total suspended solids concentrations in different depths of the water column, in addition to other variables (e.g. phosphorus, nitrogen, chlorophyll-a). Through a linear regression between TSI (trophic state index) and the TVS concentrations, an equation relating these two variables was generated (R2 = 0.67). New TSI values (named TSIcalc) were calculated and analyzed against the observed ones (TSIobs, determined through the total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations). The results suggested that TVS may be considered an interesting variable to predict the trophic state of subtropical reservoirs.</jats:p>",

We contrast the contracting outcome of a Stackelberg game, in which the manufacturers offer take‐it‐or‐leave‐it contracts to the retailers, with that of a bargaining game, in which the firms bilaterally negotiate contract terms via a process of alternating offers. The manufacturers in the Stackelberg game possess a Stackelberg‐leader advantage in that the retailers are not entitled to make counteroffers. Our analysis suggests that whether this advantage would benefit the manufacturers depends on the contractual form. With simple contracts such as wholesale‐price contracts, which generally do not allow one party to fully extract the trade surplus, the Stackelberg game replicates the boundary case of the bargaining game with the manufacturers possessing all the bargaining power. In contrast, with sophisticated contracts such as two‐part tariffs, which enable full surplus extraction, the two games lead to distinct outcomes. We further show that the game structure being Stackelberg or bargaining critically affects firms' preferences over contract types and thus their equilibrium contract choices. These observations suggest that the Stackelberg game may not be a sufficient device to predict contracting behaviors in reality where bargaining is commonly observed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Until the late 19th and early 20th century, public fountains (in Turkish, ‘çeşme’) in Anatolia and Ottoman lands had an important place in everyday life. The water that was collected from various water sources and brought to the city centres through waterlines was supplied to people from the architectural stone structures which we call ‘fountains’. These fountains were constructed in squares and streets as needed; to supply water to an area or to pay for the building of a fountain was considered the greatest deed. An inseparable part of the public fountains, many of which are architectural monuments, is the faucets which are generally made of metal and through which the water would run. The faucets were also named as ‘lüles’ (meaning ‘pipes’) which indicated the flow rate of water. Faucets were paid great attention in the construction of public fountains. This work examines the Seljuq and Ottoman era faucets registered in the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum as historic artefacts and are a part of the Adell Armature Collection. Within this scope, the alloys and metals of which faucets are made; their size and measurements, their design features, on and off mechanisms, wall-mount features, the patterns and decorations on the faucets were also compared. While Seljuq era faucets have stylised dragon heads and other powerful animals depicted in their metal work, Ottoman era faucets usually have floral patterns and not animal figures. This subject draws much attention.</jats:p>",

One way to deal with this uncertainty is to provide a legal right to price adjustment; another is to include contractual terms to the same effect. Both mechanisms are present in German law related to gas supply, and both mechanisms have given rise to large-scale litigation triggered by massive price increases in the past years. This article focuses on the judicial control of unilateral price determination by the gas supplier. It shows that courts mainly exercise procedural control, looking at the transparency of the conditions for price increases, whereas they do not enter into the calculation of the adequate or fair price.</jats:p> <jats:p> <jats:bold>Résumé:</jats:bold> Dans les contrats à long terme, il est difficile pour les parties contractantes de prévoir et d'intégrer les développements futurs dans le contrat. Une façon de faire face à cette incertitude est de prévoir un droit légal à l'ajustement de prix, une autre façon consiste à inclure des clauses contractuelles ayant le même effet. Ces deux mécanismes existent en droit allemand en matière de fourniture de gaz et ces deux mécanismes ont donné lieu à un accroissement du nombre de litiges dû aux fréquentes augmentations de prix durant ces dernières années. Le présent article analyse le contrôle judiciaire de la fixation unilatérale du prix par le fournisseur de gaz.

Beide Mechanismen finden wir im deutschen Recht der Gasversorgungsverträge, und beide Mechanismen waren wegen der erheblichen Gaspreiserhöhungen der vergangenen Jahre Gegenstand einer Vielzahl gerichtlicher Verfahren. Dieser Aufsatz befasst sich mit der gerichtlichen Überprüfung einseitiger Preisbestimmungen durch den Gasversorger.

These challenges include environmental disasters and hazards to human health caused by toxic materials, resource exhaustion (water, energy, raw materials), and social impacts caused by delocalization, counterfeiting and other elements. In order to develop the industry in a sustainable and optimal way when producing new textile products, industrial companies need to optimize their production organization by minimizing risks not only at levels of materials and processes but also in the whole international textile supply chain. In this paper, a method is proposed for developing a sustainable textile supply chain by selecting the most relevant materials and suppliers. The criteria of sustainable development include environment protection, recycling capacity, energy saving, human health and safety, and social impacts. Some evaluation criteria have been normalized by recognized international organizations. The method of data aggregation with multiple fuzzy criteria is applied in order to select the most appropriate textile material and its supplier. A new method combining expert knowledge of enterprise strategy and sensitivity criteria is used for determining the linguistic weights of these fuzzy criteria. In the proposed method, the aggregated evaluation index takes into account the criteria of sustainable development and the specific application context as well as company strategies for management of supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An integrated approach for the identification and assessment of the most critical chemical contaminant(s) at a drinking water intake has been developed. It involves the determination of a threshold or critical raw water concentration (CRWC) for target contaminants using the observed overall removal efficiency of a specific water treatment plant (WTP) and regulated drinking water concentrations for the target contaminants. The exceedance probability relative to the CRWC based on historical raw water quality monitoring data is then calculated. Finally, the integration of the raw water quality data and the overall efficiency of a particular WTP sequence allows for identification of the most critical contaminant(s) as well as an advance indication of which contaminants are most likely to challenge a plant. The proactive nature of this approach gives a utility the impetus and time to assess current treatment processes and potential alternatives. In addition, it was found that three- or four-parameter theoretical distributions are more appropriate than two-parameter probability distributions for the fitting of raw water quality data. This study reveals that the reliance on raw and/or treated water contaminant concentrations in isolation or on theoretical removals through treatment processes can, in some circumstances, be misguided.</jats:p>",

The city blueprint comprises a set of 24 dedicated indicators divided over eight categories, i.e. water security, water quality, drinking water, sanitation, infrastructure, climate robustness, biodiversity and attractiveness and governance including public participation. The city blueprint can be used as a first step or quick-scan to benchmark the SWC in cities and may help: (1) to communicate a city's SWC performance and exchange experiences, (2) to select appropriate water supply and sanitation strategies, (3) to develop technological and non-technological options as future alternatives for the water cycle, where several possible changes in the use of technology, space and socio-economic scenarios can be introduced. This should finally lead to: (4) a selection of measures, including an evaluation of their costs and benefits under different development scenarios, and how to integrate these in long-term planning on urban investments. So far, a city blueprint has been made for the city of Rotterdam.

Orca Basin, an intraslope basin on the Texas-Louisiana continental slope, hosts a hypersaline, anoxic brine in its lowermost 200 m in which limited microbial activity has been reported. This brine contains a large reservoir of reduced and aged carbon, and appears to be stable at decadal time scales: concentrations and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) are similar to measurements made in the 1970s. Both DIC and DOC are more \"aged\" within the brine pool than in overlying water, and the isotopic contrast between brine carbon and seawater carbon is much greater for DIC than DOC. While the stable carbon isotopic composition of brine DIC points towards a combination of methane and organic carbon remineralization as its source, radiocarbon and box model results point to the brine interface as the major source region for DIC, allowing for only limited oxidation of methane diffusing upwards from sediments. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies that identify the seawater–brine interface as the focus of microbial activity associated with Orca Basin brine. Isotopic similarities between DIC and DOC suggest a different relationship between these two carbon reservoirs than is typically observed in deep ocean basins. Radiocarbon values implicate the seawater–brine interface region as the likely source region for DOC to the brine as well as DIC.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Subsurface dams and aqueducts have been used for many years as important sources of water in different parts of the world. Nowadays, little attention is paid to aqueducts. On the other hand, there is a great tendency for constructing and using subsurface dams in many arid and semiarid parts of the world such as Iran. A combination of these two structures was established in ancient Iran including Qanat Vazvan in Isfahan. Nowadays, new methods and techniques such as the Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing have been developed to process site selection of subsurface dams with high accuracy and in a short time. Study and research of the Qanat Vazvan structure emphasizes the idea that these two structures have been combined in a new way. Considering some main criteria and sub-criteria for subsurface dam site selection, with the existence of aqueduct, some suitable locations with a combination of aqueduct and subsurface dam in Pishkoh basin, Taft, Yazd province have been delineated. Some of the advantages of underground dams are their local use, being close to the demand sites and their capacity for gathering water in each season. These positive points when combined with reclamation of aqueducts (qanats) cause a renewable situation for qanats and their efficiency as a water resource management process. Underground dams can be built in a qanat's shaft by constructing some hatches inside the dam's wall. Hence, water can be stored during cold rainy seasons. The main and basic weaknesses of qanats can be covered through this combination. Hence, it causes a strong and optimum usage of qanat water.</jats:p>",

However, the role of justice in improving performance in supply chain relationships is an under‐investigated subject in the literature. In studying the joint impact of justice dimensions, the traditional assumption is that the three forms of justice interact with each other in a multiplicative manner. However, this assumption creates a managerial problem as discussed in this paper. We outline a different view of how the justice dimensions interact with one another utilizing the constraining factor model (CFM). We show that the CFM resolves some of the problems arising from the choice of multiplicative interaction of justice measures on performance. Specifically, we demonstrate that an increase in procedural, distributive or interactional justice results in a significant and positive improvement in performance only if the specific justice dimension is the constraining factor in the relationship. Overall, our analysis suggests that all three dimensions are important and a high level of one of the justice elements will not compensate for a low level of another, a view that is put forward by a number of past research studies in justice. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Closed‐loop supply chain management is a major contributor to implementing sustainable operations. An essential prerequisite for successful realization is the expertise and cooperation of representatives from engineering, management and natural sciences as well as practice. We identify a need for transdisciplinary collaboration within two steps. First, a literature review points out that various research disciplines as well as practice mostly operate in isolation. Second, we develop a framework that highlights the benefits of collaboration between these research areas. This paper provides an overview to better understand current trends in this complex field, which is a rich area for research that is still in its infancy.

Raw water was collected from the Red River (Manitoba, Canada). This source water has a DOC concentration ranging from 8 to 12 mg L−1 and total hardness of about 400 mg L−1 CaCO3, which represents a typical surface water quality of the Canadian Prairie. Four coagulants were tested at different pH levels: alum, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride and titanium sulfate. Coagulation effectiveness was evaluated by removal of DOC, DOC fractions, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the coagulated water. The water DOC was separated into six fractions based on hydrophobicity and acid base functionality: hydrophobic acid (HPOA), hydrophobic base (HPOB), hydrophobic neutral (HPON), hydrophilic acid (HPIA), hydrophilic base (HPIB), and hydrophilic neutral (HPIN). Results showed that ferric sulfate had the highest total DOC removal of 66% while ferric chloride had the lowest DOC reduction of 54%. Although the THMFP was found to be lowered significantly with all four coagulants the ferric chloride showed the greatest THMFP reduction. Fractionation results found a significant reduction in the HPOA fraction for all coagulants with 91% for ferric chloride as the highest removal value. Poor removal of hydrophilic fractions was found for all coagulants. The result of this study showed that total DOC reduction cannot guarantee THMFP reduction and coagulation should be optimized to remove DOC fractions which form most THMs.</jats:p>",

Despite increasing global urbanization a significant percentage of people inhabiting inland areas need critical infrastructure service including water supply systems. The fountain system under consideration in this paper is a good example of a sustainable use of the local territory, which is desirable for modern development of infrastructure. In terms of capital investment and management costs, it is better to try and solve supply issues locally in inland areas rather than to construct mega hydraulic works. During the late Roman Republic, some small inland villagers were obliged to think as well as to act locally. The Roman system investigated here highlights the use of local building elements (and traditional construction techniques) in a sort of ‘zero kilometre’ philosophy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ports-of-entry are critical components of the modern international supply chain infrastructure, particularly container seaports and airfreight hubs. The potential operational and economic impact resulting from their temporary closure is unknown but is widely believed to be very significant. This paper investigates one aspect of this potential impact, focusing specifically on the use of supply chain inventory as a risk mitigation strategy for a one supplier, one customer system in which goods are transported through a port-of-entry subject to temporary closures. Closure likelihood and duration are modeled using a completely observed, exogenous Markov chain. Order lead times are dependent on the status of the port-of-entry, including potential congestion backlogs of unprocessed work. An infinite-horizon, periodic-review inventory control model is developed to determine the optimal average cost ordering policies under linear ordering costs with backlogged demand. When congestion is negligible, the optimal policy is state invariant. In the more complex case of nonnegligible congestion, this result no longer holds. For studied scenarios, numerical results indicate that operating margins may decrease 10% for reasonable-length port-of-entry closures, that margins may be eliminated completely without contingency plans, and that expected holding and penalty costs may increase 20% for anticipated increases in port-of-entry utilization. </jats:p>",

The process control was implemented in the context of two multiplex real-time PCR assays. The first multiplex targeted the ctxA, hlyA and gfp genes, while the second targeted the gfp, O1-rfb, and O139-rfb loci. The detection limits for both the multiplex real-time PCR assays were 20 CFU (colony forming units) per reaction. This method was evaluated using spiked and unspiked Alkaline Peptone Water (APW) enrichments of sewage, dam, catchment and tap water. The internal process control showed no substantial inhibition in the APW enriched water samples, assuring the integrity of negative results.

International organizations have urged the implementation of “zero-coca” growing policies in those countries, although without tangible results. Supply-side harm reduction strategies are currently being implemented in Bolivia, which rely on social control to limit, although not totally abolish coca growing. In this article, the different motivations for traditional coca growing are extensively reviewed, and the data from a survey conducted with 496 farmers in an indigenous community is examined, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the coca-growing problem and to evaluate if social control could potentially influence the scale of coca growing in Peru. The results suggest that social control variables, such as attachment, involvement, and beliefs, seem to limit coca-growing areas. Those factors have been largely overlooked and may offer an opportunity to reduce coca areas if explicitly considered in anti-drug policy design.CITE AS:García-Yi, J. (2014).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the choice of pricing policy (posted pricing or negotiation) toward end customers in a supply chain. Many retailers actively decide whether or not to encourage negotiation on the shop floor. Of course, the retailer's pricing policy influences not only the retailer's profit, but also the profits of the manufacturers who sell through the retailer. However, little is known about the forces that shape the pricing policy when two self‐interested parties interact in a supply chain. We consider two alternative models depending on who has the power to decide the pricing policy: the manufacturer or the retailer. We find that an increase in the wholesale price weakens the retailer's ability to price discriminate through negotiation. Therefore, the retailer prefers negotiation at lower wholesale prices and posted pricing at higher wholesale prices. We also find that whenever the retailer prefers negotiation, the manufacturer does too. Therefore, the retailer's discretion over the pricing policy causes friction only when the retailer wants to use posted pricing, while the manufacturer wishes the retailer to use negotiation. We show that such friction arises only when product availability or the cost of negotiation is moderate. In this case, we show that the manufacturer may offer a substantial discount to persuade the retailer to negotiate. Surprisingly, in this region of friction, a decrease in the supply chain's capacity or an increase in negotiation costs (both of which are typically considered as worsening the retailer's business environment) translates into higher profit for the retailer. </jats:p>",

Sharing stock-on-hand information is valuable with stationary demand. Customer forecast and planned order information are valuable with non-stationary demand.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Sign restrictions have become increasingly popular for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. So far there are no techniques for validating the shocks identified via such restrictions. Although in an ideal setting the sign restrictions specify shocks of interest, sign restrictions may be invalidated by measurement errors, data adjustments or omitted variables. We model changes in the volatility of the shocks via a Markov switching (MS) mechanism and use this device to give the data a chance to object to sign restrictions. The approach is illustrated by considering a small model for the market of crude oil. Earlier findings that oil supply shocks explain only a very small fraction of movements in the price of oil are confirmed and it is found that the importance of aggregate demand shocks for oil price movements has declined since the mid 1980s.

To meet the above objective there were compared some data concerning the volume of domestic cereal production and its cereal species structure, foreign trade balance, domestic consumption and purchase price levels. The formation of the above mentioned items was analyzed for two periods. The first one covered the years 1995-2003 whereas the second one was from 2004 to 2012. This allowed us to make some interesting comparisons through the prism of Poland’s accession to the EU. Additionally, long time series increased their reliability. To study supply and demand correlations, there were applied various statistical methods including dynamic indexes, trend models, analyses of correlation and various regression. A comprehensive analysis of the gathered research material allowed us to answer the question about some quantitative and qualitative changes which took place on the cereal market after Poland’s accession to the EU.</jats:p>"

The effectiveness of non-government organizations as part of a network of control finds support both in the radical criminological literature as well as those explicitly advocating for a networked regulatory approach. This case study of the Indonesian sport shoe industry demonstrates that networked regulation has had a positive short- to medium-term impact on respect for trade union rights among some manufacturers producing for western MNCs. However, inconsistent approaches by the MNCs and ongoing resistance by manufacturers has made this influence difficult to sustain. Critically, the Indonesian state apparatus emerges as a powerful and primarily—but far from completely—complicit set of actors: applying criminal sanctions for trade union rights violations but failing to enforce them, and influencing networked regulation in complex, contingent ways. This case study suggests both that advocates and practitioners of networked regulation need to find more effective ways to respond to the corporate drive to maximize profit and that networked regulation’s long-term usefulness will likely depend on the extent to which it draws from and operates to strengthen progressive regulatory elements within Asian states. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of electric vehicles power electronics system control comprising of DC-AC inverters and DC-DC converters takes a great interest of researchers in the modern industry. A DC-AC inverter supplies the high power electric vehicle motors torques of the propulsion system and utility loads, whereas a DC-DC converter supplies conventional low-power, low-voltage loads. However, the need for high power bidirectional DC-DC converters in future electric vehicles has led to the development of many new topologies of DC-DC converters. Nonlinear control of power converters is an active area of research in the fields of power electronics. This paper focuses on a fuzzy sliding mode strategy (FSMS) as a control strategy for boost DC-DC converter power supply for electric vehicle. The proposed fuzzy controller specifies changes in the control signal based on the surface and the surface change knowledge to satisfy the sliding mode stability and attraction conditions. The performances of the proposed fuzzy sliding controller are compared to those obtained by a classical sliding mode controller. The satisfactory simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed control law which reduces the chattering phenomenon. Moreover, the obtained results prove the robustness of the proposed control law against variation of the load resistance and the input voltage of the studied converter.</jats:p>",

Magnetic iron oxide and calcined Mg-Al LDH powders were synthesized in the laboratory. The magnetic composites were prepared through immobilization of synthetic magnetic iron oxide and calcined Mg-Al LDH powders into an alginate matrix. The magnetic composites had a particle size of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm and showed magnetic properties under an external magnetic field. Results demonstrated that the magnetic composites were effective in the removal of Cr(VI). In the magnetic composites, calcined Mg-Al LDH played a major role in the sorption of Cr(VI), whereas magnetic iron oxide provided the magnetic property along with a minor role in Cr(VI) sorption. Kinetic tests showed that Cr(VI) sorption to the magnetic composites reached equilibrium at 24 h. The maximum Cr(VI) removal capacity was 11.15 mg/g. Results also indicated that Cr(VI) removal was not sensitive to solution pH between 4.1 and 9.5. This study demonstrated the potential applications of magnetic alginate–LDH composites for chromate removal from aqueous solution in combination with magnetic separation.</jats:p>",

Relatively little is known about hydrograph (shape, peak flow) influence or the relative importance of chronic and episodic hillslope inputs on channel conditions. To better understand these external drivers, we calculated sediment routing through a gravel‐bedded river network using a one‐dimensional (1D) bedload transport model. We calculated changes in grain sizes and estimated Chinook salmon habitat suitability caused by a dry year and an extreme flood hydrograph, and chronic (diffusive, overland flow) or pulse (landslide, debris flow) hillslope sediment supplies. To obtain accurate channel conditions, a relatively high reference Shields stress, representative of steep mountain streams, was needed. An extreme event flood without any hillslope sediment inputs caused widespread bed coarsening and a decrease in aquatic habitat. Chronic sediment input combined with this hydrograph eliminated any changes in grain size and habitat, although when combined with a dry year flow, caused systematic bed fining. The influence of a given hydrograph therefore highly depends on the hillslope sediment supply. Regardless of the flow hydrograph or sediment pulse timing, grain size distribution or location, pulse sediment inputs did not cause widespread grain size changes despite being 100 times the total chronic input volume. Widespread and continuous hillslope sediment inputs may influence channel grain sizes and aquatic habitat more than a single discrete sediment pulse. Depending on the magnitudes of flow hydrograph and sediment supply alterations, climate change may induce no differences in grain sizes or very dramatic changes with significant consequences for long‐term sustainability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the important objectives of supply chain S&amp;OP (Sales and Operations Planning) is the profitable alignment of customer demand with supply chain capabilities through the coordinated planning of sales, production, distribution, and procurement. In the make‐to‐order manufacturing context considered in this paper, sales plans cover both contract and spot sales, and procurement plans require the selection of supplier contracts. S&amp;OP decisions also involve the allocation of capacity to support sales plans. This article studies the coordinated contract selection and capacity allocation problem, in a three‐tier manufacturing supply chain, with the objective to maximize the manufacturer's profitability. Using a modeling approach based on stochastic programming with recourse, we show how these S&amp;OP decisions can be made taking into account economic, market, supply, and system uncertainties. The research is based on a real business case in the Oriented Strand Board (OSB) industry. The computational results show that the proposed approach provides realistic and robust solutions. For the case considered, the planning method elaborated yields significant performance improvements over the solutions obtained from the mixed integer programming model previously suggested for S&amp;OP. </jats:p>",

In later times, the Almone River lost its sacrality and its flowing water got a new useful and hydraulic meaning. So it deeply characterised the local area and human settlements, enhancing their artisanal potential, especially in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and in part until the 20th century. The river area has records of water mills and ‘valche’ (from the Longobard word walkan, rolling), i.e. wool-fulling mills. One of the latter (converted into a paper mill in the early 20th century) has been restored and is now used as the headquarters and visitors' centre of the Appian Way Regional Park, of which the Almone is one of the key attractions for its tourist, natural, historical and cultural value.</jats:p>",

Lateral growth was found to be wider when precursors were supplied from the [0001] direction than from the [0001̄] direction. The (0001̄) face formed on the supply side suppressing lateral growth when the precursors were supplied from the [0001̄] direction, while lateral growth was enlarged by the intersurface diffusion of adatoms from the side to the top when supplied from the [0001] direction. A smaller cross-section of lateral growth was experimentally observed when the (0001̄) face appeared on the supply side, which suggests that the chemical character of the side also affects lateral growth. The offset angle of the opening is another important factor for determining the lateral growth, which largely affects the formation of facets on the sides and, consequently, the grown shape. \n  </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Stratigraphy contains the most complete record of information necessary to quantitatively reconstruct paleolandscape dynamics, but this record contains significant gaps over a range of time and space scales. These gaps result from stasis on geomorphic surfaces and erosional events that remove previously deposited sediment. Building on earlier statistical studies, we examine stratigraphic completeness in three laboratory experiments where the topography of aggrading deltas was monitored at high temporal and spatial scales. The three experiments cover unique combinations in the absolute magnitudes of sediment and water discharge in addition to generation of accommodation space through base‐level rise. This analysis centers on three time scales: (1) the time at which a record is discretized (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>), (2) the time necessary to build a deposit with mean thickness equivalent to the maximum roughness on a surface (<jats:italic>T<jats:sub>c</jats:sub></jats:italic>), and (3) the time necessary for channelized flow to migrate over all locations in a basin (<jats:italic>T<jats:sub>ch</jats:sub></jats:italic>). These time scales incorporate information pertaining to the time‐variant topography of actively changing surfaces, kinematics by which the surfaces are changing, and net deposition rate. We find that stratigraphic completeness increases as a function of <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>T<jats:sub>c</jats:sub></jats:italic> but decreases as a function of <jats:italic>T<jats:sub>c</jats:sub></jats:italic>/<jats:italic>T<jats:sub>ch</jats:sub></jats:italic> over the parameter space covered in the experiments.

Nondimensionalizing <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> by <jats:italic>T<jats:sub>c</jats:sub></jats:italic>, however, shows that preservation of information characterizing system morphodynamics is best preserved in stratigraphy constructed by systems with low water to sediment flux ratios.</jats:p>",

Trenutni centralizirani sistem za oskrbo z uniformo v SV ni učinkovit. V prispevku predstavljamo rezultate raziskave o vzrokih za njegovo neučinkovitost. Čeprav je vzrokov več, menimo, da sta dva bistvena: nezadostna finančna sredstva za nabavo potrebnih količin uniform in zapletenost postopkov javnega naročanja. Težave  ne bi rešilo ponovno uvajanje intendantskih servisov    v vojašnice SV. Centraliziran sistem oskrbe z uniformami v SV je edina racional- na rešitev in odgovor na ekonomske izzive. Prispevek ponuja ukrepe za odpravo ugotovljenih pomanjkljivosti in izboljšavo učinkovitosti sistema. Predlagamo tudi uvedbo točkovnega sistema dodeljevanja uniforme (že uveden v policijo in kaže pozitivne rezultate), oblikovanje mobilnega (potujočega) intendantskega servisa, nakup 3D-telesnega snemalnika ter vzpostavitev delovanja trgovine oziroma trgovin z vojaško opremo. Prispevek je namenjen širši javnosti, odgovornim osebam v SV pa ponuja izhodišče za odločanje o prenovi sistema oskrbe z uniformami v SV.\n\nIn the past, the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) used different methods of providing uniforms and sports equipment. The existing centralized uniform supply system, however, is not effective. The present paper presents the results of research, which focused on the causes for the inefficiency of the existing system. Despite a larger number of causes, we believe that there are two crucial ones: insufficient financial resources to purchase the necessary quantities of uniforms, and problems with the implementation of public procurement procedures. The reintroduction of commissa- ry services in the barracks would not solve the problem. Centralized uniform supply system in the SAF is the only rational solution and answer to the economic challen- ges. This article provides appropriate steps for the renovation of the uniform supply system in the SAF. The authors recommend the measures necessary to abolish the identified shortcomings and improve its effectiveness. We thus propose the introduc- tion of a debit points system for uniform allocation (already introduced in the police and showing positive results), the establishment of a mobile commissary service, the purchase of a 3D body scanner and the establishment of store or a chain of stores selling uniforms and military equipment. The article is mainly intended for the general public, but it provides the responsible authorities in the SAF with a starting point for the decision-making on the reform of the uniform-supply system.</jats:p>",

Those pupils in schools that received only the HP&amp;WT showed similar results. Pupils in ‘water-scarce’ schools that received a water-supply improvement, HP&amp;WT and sanitation showed a reduction in diarrhoea incidence and days of illness.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Environmental monitoring is becoming increasingly sophisticated with the widespread adoption of data loggers, sensor arrays and remote sensing, leading to larger scale, higher resolution and superior quality data. However, interpreting monitoring data and deciding when and how to apply environmental management remains a subjective and underdeveloped area of research. Control charts, developed in industrial settings to identify when manufacturing processes were beyond the acceptable bounds of production quality, represent one solution. Despite their potential utility, control charts have rarely been adopted in environmental monitoring. In theory, they are able to identify undesirable trends early and provide transparent and broadly consensual criteria for defining when management action should take place, that is action is triggered when parameter values are observed beyond the agreed control limits of the process. Once triggered, a predetermined management action is implemented. Possible actions are many and varied, and range from investigation and increased monitoring to intervention in the system. Here, the utility of control charts in monitoring water supply in south‐western Australia from 1911 to 2010 is examined, and their ability to provide an early, transparent and easily understandable means of triggering management action is assessed. Two control chart types are applied: the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">X</jats:styled-content>‐bar chart and the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CUSUM</jats:styled-content> chart. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">X</jats:styled-content>‐bar charts varied widely in their ability to trigger action and were insensitive to many traditional threshold criteria (of which there are many to choose from). In contrast, standard <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CUSUM</jats:styled-content> charts are specifically designed to detect subtler shifts away from a mean trend and hence provided a more consistent warning of the decline in water supply. While managers were aware of the decline in water supply from an early stage, we believe that control charts could have clearly communicated this earlier, enabling consensus among decision makers to be reached more rapidly.</jats:p>",
