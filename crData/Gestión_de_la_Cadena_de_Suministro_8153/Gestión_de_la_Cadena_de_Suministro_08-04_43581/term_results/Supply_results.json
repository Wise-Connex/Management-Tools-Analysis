      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines outsourcing from the transaction cost economics (TCE) perspective. The transaction is made the basic unit of analysis and the procurement decision, as between make and buy, is made (principally) with reference to a transaction cost economizing purpose. As sketched herein, the ease of contracting varies with the attributes of the transaction, with special emphasis on whether preserving continuity between a particular buyer–seller pair is the source of added value. The basic regularity is this: as bilateral dependency builds up, the efficient governance of contractual relations progressively moves from simple market exchange to hybrid contracting (with credibility supports) to hierarchy. This last corresponds to the “make” decision, which, as viewed from the TCE perspective, is viewed as the organization form of last resort. The article successively describes the lens of contract approach to economic organization, the operationalization of TCE, different styles of outsourcing, qualifications to the foregoing and the main lessons of TCE for the supply chain literature.</jats:p>",

In this article, we investigate the value of demand-forecast information sharing in a manufacturer-e-retailer supply chain. The value of market information depends not only on its accuracy, but also on the e-retailer’s market power and the product’s Web compatibility. We develop a theoretical approach to examine the value of information sharing for the manufacturer and the e-retailer first, and then we further check to see how information sharing is moderated by the e-retailer’s market share and the product’s e-market-base demand. Our results suggest that under some conditions, both the manufacturer and the e-retailer can be better off from information sharing. Especially when the e-retailer’s market share is larger and the product’s e-market-base demand is higher, information sharing is more valuable for the supply chain players. Using our analysis findings, we indicate marketing strategies that the manufacturer and the e-retailer may want to adopt.</p>",

A second paper will examine the continued evolution of supply management from 1940 until the present. The 1830–1940 period in North America was one of tremendous development for purchasing. It started with occasional reference in management texts and, particularly after 1900, saw the evolution of a host of ideas representing the foundation of today's perspective on supply management. At no time did purchasing practitioners and academics see the function as a narrow buying activity. Clearly, our predecessors were well aware of the benefits of integration and would have been comfortable with today's supply chain management precepts. They also recognized value, cost and price analysis, value analysis, purchasing research, talent management, outsourcing the supply function, supplier relationships, strategy and the need for performance measurement. They strived to contribute effectively to organizational goals and strategies, well aware of the potential impact of their actions on organizational success. An understanding of supply's evolution may not only assist today's supply management practitioners and academics in placing current practices and theories in context but also in charting our future.</jats:p>",

Our review revealed that the focus of academic researchers on types of value being extracted from buyer–supplier relationships changed between 1986 and 2005, as did their interest in the buyer mechanisms implemented to create value in these relationships. Although emphasis has changed over time, we found that scholars have primarily investigated four types of value derived from buyer–suppler relationships: operational performance improvements, integration‐based improvements, supplier capability‐based improvements and financial performance outcomes. The review also noted that researchers considered more buyer–supplier mutual efforts since 1996 than the earlier decade, but the number of studies investigating buyer practices has declined as a percentage of total publications. We conclude with a discussion of the review's implications for future research and practice.</jats:p>",

The utility of a potential complementary resource to each Web-based application for a supply chain task is evaluated to determine the relative value of the resource to the Webbased application. A matrix is then developed to show the degree to which a particular complementary resource is utilized to implement Web-based applications.

Central to the efficient operation of the OpenURL is the knowledge base, which consists of data supplied by content providers including publishers. The report found that a lack of awareness on the part of many publishers of the OpenURL's capabilities and requirements is impacting the quality and timeliness of the data they provide to populate knowledge bases, and thus undermining the potential of this sophisticated technology. A programme of education and advocacy, particularly among smaller publishers, will be key to improving the efficacy with which OpenURL is currently implemented. The study's findings and suggestions will be taken forward by the KBART (Knowledge Bases And Related Tools) working group co‐chaired by UKSG and NISO; this article reviews the initial report and summarizes the planned remit and expected outcomes of the working group.</jats:p>",

Tol  The goal of this Chapter is to study the complex interaction between agriculture, economic growth and the environment, given future uncertainties. We combine economic concepts and biophysical constraints in one consistent modeling framework to be able to quantify and analyze the long-term socio-economic and environmental consequences of different scenarios. Here, we present the innovative methodology of coupling an economic and a biophysical model to combine state of the art knowledge from economic and biophysical sources. First, a comprehensive representation of the agricultural and land markets is required in the economic model. Therefore we included a land demand structure to reflect the degree of substitutability of types of land-use types and we included a land supply curve to include the process of land conversion and land abandonment. Secondly, the adapted economic model (LEITAP) is linked to the biophysical-based integrated assessment model IMAGE allowing to feed back spatially and temporarily varying land productivity to the economic framework. Thirdly, the land supply curves in the economic model are parameterized by using the heterogeneous information of land productivity from IMAGE. This link between an economic and biophysical model benefits from the strengths of both models. The economic model captures features of the global food market, including relations between world regions, whereas the bio-physical model adds geographical explicit information on crop growth within each world region. An illustrative baseline analyses shows the environmental consequences of the default baseline and a sensitivity analyses is performed with regard to the land supply curve. Results indicate that economic and environmental consequences are very dependent on whether a country is land scarce or land abundant.</jats:p>"

Protein, humic substance and polysaccharide solutions were used as the model for foulants occurring in the water sources for drinking water as well as in wastewater effluents. The results show that the modified membranes exhibited a much higher fouling resistance for all foulants than the unmodified membranes.

This fact is the central theme of a new white paper from SPE's R&amp;D Advisory Committee titled \"The R&amp;D Challenges to Secure Energy Supply for the Third Trillion Barrels and Beyond.\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The third trillion refers to a US Geological Survey estimate that there are more than 3 trillion bbl of recoverable conventional oil worldwide, with one-third already consumed and the remaining two-thirds largely in the possession of national oil companies (NOCs). As worldwide energy demand grows by more than 50% by 2030 [according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2006], the oil and gas industry will need to rely heavily on R&amp;D advances, according to Vikram Rao, SPE, Chairman of the R&amp;D Advisory Committee and Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for Halliburton.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\"The 12-member R&amp;D Advisory Committee has raised a number of initiatives since its inception in 2002, all designed to raise the profile of R&amp;D in the energy industry,\" Rao said. \"The committee's new white paper was written with one initiative in mind, to promote awareness of R&amp;D challenges impacting the industry to an audience outside of the petroleum community.\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\"The white paper is mainly concentrated on demographics of what the next 1 to 2 trillion bbl will look like,\" said Arnis Judzis, SPE, one of the paper's main committee coauthors and Vice President of Schlumberger Data and Consulting Services. \"We wanted to relate the myriad challenges associated with producing the unconventional and alternative energy sources that will be needed.\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Rao agreed, adding that, \"It was intended to be a manifesto, a way to shed light on the imperatives for the industry, and to begin a dialog on the areas of endeavor that are fruitful for R&amp;D.\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Before the industry can bear the fruits of an increased energy offering, a significant increase in oil and gas R&amp;D spending will be needed. According to 2007 estimates by the IEA, this investment will need to be on the order of USD 8.2 trillion over the next 25 years. Over the past 25 years, energy R&amp;D investment as a percentage of total R&amp;D declined from 10% to roughly 2% in the US alone. The IEA reports similar declines on a global scale over the same time period.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Major R&amp;D investments over the past 15 to 20 years have focused on technologies designed to find and produce more conventional hydrocarbons, including advances in 3D and 4D seismic, directional drilling, and production in frontier areas such as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. \"These technologies will not meet our future needs, and we will need to collaborate on new technical innovations and diversify our energy supply going forward,\" said Rao.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Therefore, wastewater reclamation and reuse has been paid more and more attention. Reclaimed water used as scenic water such as to supplement city moats, lakes etc. is considered. In this paper, some experiments were done to investigate whether constructed wetlands can reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration further in order to avoid the eutrophication of water bodies through use of reclaimed water for scenic environment. As we know, phosphorus is an important factor to cause algae bloom directly in water bodies. So investigation on phosphorus elimination is a key object for this study, which is composed of two main parts. The first part is laboratory scale testing to select the appropriate substrates of constructed wetlands among some materials. The second part is pilot scale experiments to find out optimal operational condition of different kinds of constructed wetlands. Based on the lab tests, we found that foamy-brick could provide a good condition for plants and microorganisms. According to the pilot scale experiments, it could be concluded that under optimal operational conditions, horizontal flow wetlands could work well. The results of the experiments also showed that integrated vertical flow wetlands are not suitable for phosphorus elimination of reclaimed water.</jats:p>",

This paper presents preliminary results on the relationship between water supply, neighbourhood characteristics, and household strategies in response to dissatisfaction with water provision as reported by 389 respondents in 10 neighbourhoods in Lagos and Benin City, Nigeria between October 2007 and February 2008. In this paper, a conceptual model of consumer demand for water is used, based upon Hirschman’s exit, voice and loyalty (EVL) framework. The model explicitly factors in the quality of water provision and variables at the household and neighbourhood levels that could affect perceptions about quality and the strategies that households use to cope with inadequate public services. Preliminary results show that reported household strategies to secure water are affected by community-level factors such as the range, cost, and quality of water supply alternatives, as well as neighbourhood composition. Furthermore, the percentage of urban migrants and households that live in rented flats in a neighbourhood seems to be associated with the use of exit strategies (as opposed to voice) in response to problems with their primary water supply.</jats:p>"

The value of collision frequency factor β in the PSD log-log model can represent the particles' dynamic behavior, and can provide a foundation to choose a more suitable coagulation mode in accelerating particles aggregation. At the same time, we deduced the relationship ln V=bK+C between the value of parameter K and the total particles volume V. Lots of experiments proved the conclusion's validity.

The two supply chains are identical, except they may have different investment costs for information sharing. The problem is studied using a two-stage game. In the first stage, the manufacturers decide whether to invest in information sharing. In the second stage, given the information structure created in the first stage, the manufacturers offer contracts to their retailers and the retailers engage in Cournot competition. We analyze the game for two different contract types. For the case of contract menus, a supply chain that does not have information sharing will lower its selling quantities because of the negative quantity distortions in the contract menus, thus creating a strategic disadvantage in Cournot competition. The value of information sharing to a supply chain is positive, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is to invest in information sharing when the investment costs are low. We fully characterize the equilibrium information sharing decisions under different investment costs. For the case of linear price contracts, the value of information sharing to a supply chain becomes negative, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is not to invest in information sharing regardless of investment costs. Our results highlight the importance of contract type as a driver of the value of information sharing and the role of information sharing capability as a source of competitive advantage under supply chain competition. </jats:p>",

Selecting a high flux reduces capex by minimizing the membrane area required, but increases operating costs due to the increased chemical cleaning frequency, higher waste disposal volumes, and higher operating pressure. Most commercial systems are designed to run at fluxes significantly above the critical flux, so a degree of fouling and a reliance on chemical cleaning is inherent to the design.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper examines the relationship between flux and membrane fouling rate through a review of experimental field data. The analysis shows that fouling rate increases exponentially with flux, with a function dependent upon the characteristics of the feed.

In contrast, feeds with higher fouling propensity, and medium or large plant sizes have a TWC optimum close to 1 CIP/month, and should use a lower design flux. It is suggested that the flux corresponding to the TWC optimum should be designated the sustainable flux.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of supply chains as a mechanism for value creation is largely dependent on continuous flow of real time accurate information from the customer back upstream to the manufacturer. This ideal is often unachievable when disruptions in the flow of information and materials are known to regularly occur in some manufacturing supply chains. This paper focuses on quantifying the potential lost sales revenue attributed to information and material delays in a supply chain using discrete event simulation of the Beer Distribution Game. Results indicate a direct relationship between lost sales revenue and delay times. When exposed to several levels of delay such disruptions will cause loss of sales revenue. Interestingly, data collected suggests that information delays play a larger role than material delays as a contributor to lost sales revenue. This study provides a solid platform to further justify the implementation of technology such as RFID in an effort to decrease the level of lost sales revenue in manufacturing supply chains. The implementation of technologies that will increase the speed of information flow throughout a supply chain as well as increasing visibility of inventory in the supply chain can assist to minimise lost sales.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, radio frequency identification (RFID) is being explored as a technology to be used in supply chain management. The use of RFID in the supply chain is an emerging technology that has attracted a lot of attention in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Major retailers in various continents have given mandates to their suppliers to adopt the technology in order to continue business with them. As a result, there appears to be a shift in power dependency in the supply chain. This has had an impact on how the suppliers adopt RFID to embrace the mandates. The impact is likely to have a long term effect on current business models. Our study into the existing literature reveals three tiers of the effects of mandates. The effects are best examined by separating out the suppliers into two groups: suppliers adopting the technology under the mandates and suppliers not affected by the mandates and adopted a wait-and-see tactic. Moore’s Technology Adoption Life Cycle is used to highlight the chasm between these groups and the early adopters. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to show managers the effects RFID/SC may have on their business models, and (2) to identify possible research areas within the RFID field.</jats:p>"

A Pearson's correlation matrix supported that significant flux decline over a short time frame (low delivered DOC) is highly correlated with high molecular weight (MW) components of NOM. Simulations of flux decline by model equations were close to the experimental results revealing that low pressure membrane fouling is dominantly affected by NOM characteristics and membrane properties. One source water, exhibiting the highest flux decline, showed mostly cake formation as a fouling mechanism. The results indicate that significant flux decline is caused by high MW components leading to formation of a cake layer. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that high MW polysaccharides are the most important NOM component affecting significant membrane fouling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Experimental studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of backwashing and air-scouring to prevent cake-layer formation on the membranes in a hybrid PAC-MF process. The membrane filtration chamber used in this study was separated into two zones; namely, the PAC adsorption zone (PAZ) and the membrane filtration zone (MFZ). In MFZ tubular ceramic membranes were installed, and powdered activated carbon (PAC) was suspended in PAZ at a concentration of 20 g/L by aeration. Air-scouring and backwashing rates were gradually increased to see if these physical cleaning measures can reduce or maintain the filtration resistance due to formation of PAC cake layer on the membrane. Two types of saw-dust PAC having different sizes were used to find the difference of the effects of air-scouring and backwashing. A smaller PAC (Shirasagi C1, Japan EnviroChemicals, Co.) showed a slower increasing rate of filtration resistance than the larger PAC (Shirasagi S-10, Japan EnviroChemicals, Co.). It was found that air-scouring didn't reduce the rate of cake fouling formation of PAC S-10, but can quite effectively reduce the rate of PAC C-1 attachment to the membrane. On the contrary, backwashing was not effective for PAC C-1, but quite effective for PAC S-10. PAC C1 formed a porous cake with low specific resistance, which can be easily removed by air-scouring, but cannot be removed by backwashing. On the other hand, PAC S-10 formed a tight cake layer because suspended particles get in to the void space between the PAC S-10. A dynamic model was proposed to explain the effect of air-scouring and backwashing to removal cake layer from the membranes.</jats:p>",

We assume that a firm can execute each job either at its own shop or by outsourcing it. The model calculates the unit cost of each product while taking into account the shop floor rough-cut capacity planning, and by determining what to produce in the firm’s shop and what to outsource. In order to reduce run times, a greedy heuristic algorithm was developed. Comparison of the proposed model with a model that takes into account precedence between operations and with a traditional costing approach was conducted. The article gives insight on the affect of shop workload, machine loading, and outsourcing decisions on the product unit cost estimation.</p>",

An attempt was made to predict heavy precipitation (≥50 mm d−1) on a daily basis using the analyzed relations between surface temperature and GPS-PWV. Several features were revealed that were associated with the daily heavy precipitation at the study area. An index was made to predict heavy precipitation on a daily basis. Applying the index to observations, we obtained acceptable results of the prediction. It is suggested that GPS is useful for predicting heavy precipitation events.</jats:p>",

Electrical coils were embedded into the pressure vessels to produce electromagnetic field for fouling mitigation. Computational fluid dynamics results had verified that feed water was more evenly distributed at membrane inlet with the new flow distributor, compared to the commonly used anti-telescoping device. The operating data collected from the two demonstration RO systems over a period of 1,200 operating hours showed the excellent performance of the Super-Flux RO system regardless of the type of feed water. Both demonstration RO systems produced high quality permeate water and did not show any signs of membrane fouling, i.e., feed pressure, salt rejection and average permeate flux were consistent in the test periods. The average permeate flux of the Super-Flux demonstration RO system for water reclamation was about 2.6 times the value of the existing conventional 8-inch full-scale RO system.</jats:p>",

Unsatisfied demand at each stage is fully backordered. This class of supply chains includes assembly, distribution, tree, and two-level general networks as special cases. We characterize the stockout delay for each unit of demand at each stage of the supply chain by developing an exact and unified approach that applies to various network topologies. We also present tractable approximations and decompositions that facilitate efficient evaluation and optimization (up to the approximations) of the base-stock policies in industry-size problems with a tree structure.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The life cycle of new products is becoming shorter and shorter in all markets. For electronic products, life cycles are measured in units of months, with 6- to 12-month life cycles being common. Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the provision of occupational as well as private pensions has to be enhanced. However, there seems to be an undersupply of occupational pension provision particularly in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Using survey data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the German SAVE survey, the present paper studies econometrically the determinants of occupational pension provision in Germany. It shows that occupational pensions depend not only on supply-side factors such as firm size and industry, but also on demand-side factors such as individual sociodemo-graphic attributes and people's savings motives.</jats:p>",

The novelty of the approach is to consider the outsourced function as involving resources consistent with the resource‐based view of the firm. From a bargaining perspective, we characterize a downstream firm's decision whether to outsource to an independent or to an established upstream firm. In so doing, the downstream firm faces a trade‐off between lower input costs afforded by independent competition, and higher resource value associated with those who can consolidate upstream capabilities. We show that this trade‐off is resolved in favor of outsourcing to an established firm. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Achieving this goal will require the exploitation of both conventional and unconventional reservoirs of oil and gas in an environmentally acceptable manner. Such efforts will, in turn, require advancements in materials science, particularly in the development of materials that can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature, and high-stress conditions.</jats:p>",

Improved irrigation management and reduced bare‐soil evaporation have highest priority to increase agronomic water‐use efficiency (WUE). Compared to these technical (irrigation) and basic (crop production) management options, effects of nutrient management on WUE were less frequently considered. Twenty‐nine publications on nitrogen (N) effects on biomass WUE of container‐grown plants are considered in this review. Most of them indicate positive N effects on WUE, and relevance of N effects on intrinsic WUE and unproductive water and carbon loss is discussed. A plot of 90 published data of percent decreases of WUE and dry mass under variable N supply is presented. Extrapolation of biomass WUE from leaf measurements of intrinsic WUE is critically reviewed. The positive correlation between WUE and dry‐mass formation suggests that physiological rather than stomatal effects are more important in order to explain positive N effects on WUE.</jats:p>",

However, we suggest that a more relevant conversation should be about addressing the large gap between the demand for effective reviewers and the supply of individuals who are both successful authors and effective reviewers. We encourage a two-pronged approach involving reducing the demand for reviews on one hand and increasing the supply of effective reviewers on the other hand. We offer several procedural and structural alternatives to initiate a conversation that might help to move us toward some norms to encourage and reward effective reviewing in our field. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With ever‐increasing competitive pressures, growing numbers of firms use electronic procurement (e‐procurement) in an attempt to reduce costs and increase profitability. Academicians and practitioners alike agree that one of the most important benefits of e‐procurement is its ability to facilitate integration within the firm and across the supply chain. However, there is much to be discovered about the prevalence of actual implementation of e‐procurement. The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the extent to which firms operating in diverse industries use nine different e‐procurement tools that differ in their ability to facilitate supply chain integration. The survey data were provided by a sample of 142 members of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Factor analysis revealed that the group of nine e‐procurement tools could be categorized into two types: basic, single‐process tools and integrative tools. A t‐test of the mean differences between each type of e‐procurement tool revealed that firms used basic, single‐process tools to a greater extent than they used integrative forms of e‐procurement. To further explore firms’ use of e‐procurement, we attempted to ascertain whether the industry in which a firm operates impacts use. Logistic regression revealed that firm sector has an effect on the use of integrative eprocurement tools, with firms operating in the petroleum and the transportation equipment sectors being less likely to use them than their manufacturing counterparts. These findings are important, as previous research indicates that effective supply chain integration is associated with improvements in production planning, inventory management, distribution, and overall supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The interest is even stronger in the retail industry where firms such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Tesco, Target and Metro AG are capitalizing on the potential of these technologies. Based on a field study conducted in a three-layer retail supply chain, this paper tests several scenarios integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and the EPC network and evaluates, in a laboratory setting, their potential as enablers of information flow within a retail supply chain. Using an “openloop” adoption strategy, our preliminary results indicate that RFID technology and the EPC network (i) hold some potential that can be grasped through Business Process Management (BPM), (ii) enable the synchronization of information flow with product flow in a given supply chain, and thus, (iii) provide a better level of information integration between supply chain members. The results suggest that these “new waves” of information technology (IT) could in fact provide end-to-end information flow between supply chain members.</jats:p>"

At present, in Germany perfluorinated organic compounds are heavily discussed. When it comes to trace organics removal, reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are alternatives to conventional bank filtrate treatment technologies like ozonation and activated carbon adsorption. However, the trace organics removal capabilities of dense membranes are still under investigation. Questions about concentrate disposal strategies are still open. The paper presents results from lab-scale and pilot studies which were conducted for the project planning of a 1,100 m3/h NF plant treating river Rhine bank filtrate. Membranes from loose NF to dense RO were investigated spiking the raw waters with trace organic substances which usually pass the soil passage and to some extent even the conventional treatment process. The results showed high retention capabilities of the more dense membranes, even under ageing conditions.</jats:p>",

The data collection resulted in 181 responses, representing a 38.2% response rate. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the research model and test the research hypotheses. The research findings support that strategic sourcing has a significant and positive effect on business performance, and supplier selection has a significant and positive effect on the firm's ability to gain competitive advantages.

With these baseline characteristics determined, we moved two of the four tags through a real world environment in three dimensions using an industrial robotic system to determine the effect of asset position in relation to the reader on tag readability. Combining the data collected over these two studies, we provide a rich analysis of the feasibility of asset tracking in a real world supply chain, where there would likely be multiple tag types.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We use bathymetry, gravimetry, and basalt composition to examine the relationship between spreading rate, spreading obliquity, and the melt supply at the ultraslow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). We find that at regional scales (more than 200 km), melt supply reflects variations in mantle melting that are primarily controlled by large‐scale heterogeneities in mantle temperature and/or composition. Focusing on adjacent SWIR regions with contrasted obliquity, we find that the effect of obliquity on melt production is significant (about 1.5 km less melt produced for a decrease of 7 mm/a to 4 mm/a in effective spreading rates, ESR) but not enough to produce near‐amagmatic spreading in the most oblique regions of the ridge, unless associated with an anomalously cold and/or depleted mantle source. Our observations lead us to support models in which mantle upwelling beneath slow and ultraslow ridges is somewhat focused and accelerated, thereby reducing the effect of spreading rate and obliquity on upper mantle cooling and melt supply. To explain why very oblique SWIR regions nonetheless have large outcrops of mantle‐derived ultramafic rocks and, in many cases, no evidence for axial volcanism (Cannat et al., 2006; Dick et al., 2003), we develop a model which combines melt migration along axis to more volcanically robust areas, melt trapping in the lithospheric mantle, and melt transport in dikes that may only form where enough melt has gathered to build sufficient overpressure. These dikes would open perpendicularly to the direction of the least compressive stress and favor the formation of orthogonal ridge sections.

However, current knowledge regarding the nutrient requirements of safflower as compared to similar oil crops is limited. It was thus the aim of this study to determine the growth and yield response of safflower (<jats:italic>Carthamus tinctorius</jats:italic> L.) as compared to sunflower (<jats:italic>Helianthus annuus</jats:italic> L.) with respect to potassium (K) supply. Three safflower and two sunflower plants were cultivated in 5 L Mitscherlich pots. Both species responded strongly to increasing K supply with respect to plant growth and yield. Growth and yield of safflower increased up to 1 g K per pot, while the optimum for sunflower was 3.0 g K per pot. Safflower out‐yielded sunflower at low K supply, while at high K level, the opposite was observed. Supply of K affected virtually all yield components in both species, though to different degree. The number of capitula in safflower was only slightly affected, and the number of achenes per capitulum was only reduced under severe K deficiency, while single‐achene mass increased with increasing K supply. In sunflower, the number of achenes per capitulum strongly responded to the K supply, as did the single‐achene mass. Oil yield in safflower was affected by K deficiency mainly due to reduced achene yield, not oil concentration. However, oil yield in sunflower was severely affected by low K supply due to both reduced achene yield and lowered oil concentration. Multiple‐regression analyses indicate that in sunflower, the stem dry matter (DM) and the total amount of K accumulated in the aboveground biomass were most important, while in safflower the total amount of K and N accumulated had the highest impact. It is concluded that sunflower is more sensitive to inadequate K supply than safflower.</jats:p>",

Pulse power system has been widely used for plasma applications. The operational principle of the pulse power system is that the energy from the input source is stored in the capacitor bank device through a dc-dc converter. Then, when a discharging signal is given, the stored energy is released to the load. The new family of ZCS converters is suitable for high-power applications using insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs).  The power converter can achieve zero switching with the aid of high-frequency transformer. The device is capable of charging a 0.1 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math>F capacitor up to 5 kV which accounts for a charging power of 5 kJ/s. The novel control algorithm is achieved which eminently considers the nonlinear control characteristics of impulse power supply. The required charging voltage, together with the constraint on the charging time, translates into a required maximum power of 10 kW reduced in this initial version to 5 kW. The difficulty to reliably control such a power at the high-voltage side practically forbids any approach featuring a more or less stabilized DC high-voltage to be generated from a conventional 50 Hz transformer through rectification.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the effects of increasing metabolizable protein (MP) supply beyond the NRC (2001) recommendations for mid lactating dairy cows grazing elephant grass pasture (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Napier) managed with high stocking rates. Three concentrates (6.3 kg DM-1 cow-1 day-1) were evaluated: control (17%CP) was adjusted in relation to MP according to the NRC (2001); the other two contained extra soybean meal, to increase the CP content to 21.2% (CP) and 25.0% (CP). Twelve multiparous Holstein cows, averaging 150 days of milk production at a rate of 19.5 kg of milk day-1, were used in a 3 × 3 latin square design, replicated four times. Forage consumption was 11,270 kg DM ha-1 with 34% of green leaves and 12% CP. Milk production, corrected to 3.5% fat, milk fat, protein, lactose and total solids contents were not affected by treatments (P &gt; 0.05). Milk urea nitrogen and plasma urea nitrogen increased linearly (P &lt; 0.05) as the MP supply increased. Treatments did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) body weight gain, body condition score, grazing time, ruminating time, resting time, rectal temperature and respiratory rate. Crude protein content in the concentrate formulated according to NRC (2001) is adequate for mid lactating cows grazing tropical pastures.</jats:p>",

In order to overcome the ‘bottleneck’, the Chinese government has explored the mechanism of the build–operation–transfer (BOT) model to encourage infrastructure provisions from the private sector. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, this paper constructs a three-level hierarchy for identifying the critical risk factors for water supply BOT projects in China. By comparing the 28 risk factors, the critical risk factors were short-listed and found to include ‘change of taxation policy’, ‘fluctuation of loan interest rate’, ‘variation of water resources price’, ‘fluctuation of foreign exchange rates’, ‘competitors’ and so on. Finally, strategies of risk management were proposed, including risk minimisation, risk transfer, risk allocation and risk retention. </jats:p>",

So far, this optimized system has been assessed in a single, 1-year population-based study performed in Germany (M. C. Oelemann, R. Diel, V. Vatin, W. Haas, S. Rusch-Gerdes, C. Locht, S. Niemann, and P. Supply, J. Clin. Microbiol.<jats:bold>45:</jats:bold>691-697, 2007). Here, we evaluated these optimized formats in a much larger population-based study conducted during 39 months in the Brussels capital region of Belgium. Isolates from 807 patients were genotyped. The resolution power, cluster, and lineage identification by the standardized MIRU-VNTR sets were compared to those obtained using standardized IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), spoligotyping, and a previous 12-MIRU-VNTR-locus set. On a subset representing 77% of the cases during a 16-month period, a high concordance was observed between unique isolates or strain clusters as defined by standardized MIRU-VNTR and IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-RFLP (i.e., more than five IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>bands). When extended to the entire population-based collection, the discriminatory subset of 15 loci decreased the strain-clustering rate by almost twofold compared to that of the old 12-locus set. The addition of the nine ancillary MIRU-VNTR loci and/or spoligotyping only slightly further decreased this strain-clustering rate. Familial, social, and/or geographic proximity links were found in 48% of the clusters identified, and well-known risk factors for tuberculosis transmission were identified. Finally, an excellent correspondence was determined between our MIRU-VNTR-spoligotyping strain identifications and external reference strain lineages included in the MIRU-VNTR<jats:italic>plus</jats:italic>database and identified by, e.g., large sequence polymorphisms. Our results reinforce the proposal of standardized MIRU-VNTR typing as a new reference genotyping method for the epidemiological and phylogenetic screening of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>strains.</jats:p>",

Lava compositions along the ridge axis show considerable major and minor element diversity (MgO 9.2–4.4%, K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O 0.04–0.36%) for lavas erupted in close proximity. Although they form a near‐continuum in the higher MgO range, the samples can be separated into two groups; one is typical N‐type mid‐ocean ridge basalt (MORB) (K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 0.09), and the other is a more enriched T‐MORB (K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &gt; 0.09).

Lavas erupted in the past, before the present‐day deep axial valley formed on this part of the ridge, were more uniform N‐MORB, generated by larger degrees of melting when magma supply was greater. Basalts from the adjoining southern Juan de Fuca Ridge segment, with comparable spreading rate but distinctly different ridge morphology, are also all LREE‐depleted N‐MORB, but the narrow range of evolved compositions of the sheet flows covering the broad, U‐shaped valley suggests shallower, more steady state magma reservoirs underlying this ridge segment. Basalts from Escanaba, the slowest spreading segment of Gorda Ridge, include N‐, T‐, and E‐MORB that were erupted from isolated volcanic centers. The pattern of incompatible element enrichment, especially in LREE, K, Ba, and <jats:sup>87</jats:sup>Sr/<jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Sr, with decreasing spreading rate and magma supply is even more pronounced at the ultraslow spreading Arctic ridges where most lavas are E‐MORB (Zr/Nb &lt; 10, (Ce/Yb)<jats:sub>N</jats:sub> &gt;1.0–3.0). Arctic E‐MORB compositions lie along a common mixing trend with those from North Gorda. As the magma budget and/or partial melting decreases, a similar enriched component, especially in K, Ba, and LREE, widely present in the oceanic mantle is apparently incorporated to a greater degree. At North Gorda, morphology and chemical characteristics appear to evolve with time toward that of ultraslow spreading ridges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The overall objective of this study was to determine whether growing season, water supply, and their interaction influence glucosinolate (GSL) concentration and composition in turnip roots (<jats:italic>Brassica rapa</jats:italic> ssp. <jats:italic>rapifera</jats:italic> L.). Field experiments on a loamy soil in Großbeeren, Germany, were conducted in the spring‐summer (SS), summer‐autumn (SA), and autumn‐winter (AW) growing seasons. Each experiment included three water‐supply treatments with 25%, 50%, and 75% of available soil water (ASW) as lower thresholds. We found that the total GSL concentration in turnip roots was 1774–3221 μmol (kg fresh matter [FM])<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and the dominant GSL was aromatic gluconasturtiin (GST) with concentrations of 1004–1628 μmol (kg FM)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> in turnip roots. Total, aliphatic, and some specific individual GSLs in turnip roots were significantly influenced by water supply, growing season, and their interaction, due to the variations of the root sulfur (S) concentration, climatic conditions, or both. The influence of water supply on GSL concentration was modified by growing season, which in turn influenced S concentration in turnips. In the SS season, the 25%‐ASW water treatment enhanced concentrations of total GSLs by 52% and 47%, aliphatic GSLs by 60% and 131%, and aromatic GSLs by 47% and 21% when compared to the 50%‐ and 75%‐ASW water treatments, respectively. No reduction of root yield was observed, although the shoot yield was reduced by limited water supply. In SA and AW, total GSL concentration did not change under different water‐supply levels, but concentration of individual aliphatic and indole GSLs did. Based on these results, growers can adjust their irrigation and S‐fertilization practices to growing season in order to optimize turnip quality in terms of GSL concentration and composition, while still obtaining higher root yield and enabling better resource utilization.</jats:p>",

This paper is mainly concerned with how to capture designers’ demands for information in a collaborative team. From a workflow perspective, designers’ information demand is modelled considering three aspects: members’, roles’, and tasks’ requirements for information. Based on a static model of information demand and information filtering technologies, a dynamic model is proposed so that the designers’ information demand could be derived automatically. In addition, the appropriate volume of information for designers’ needs could also be determined intelligently. With the information demand model, an information supply system could be developed to realize the following objective: the delivery of an appropriate volume of information within an appropriate domain, delivered to the appropriate user in the collaborative team. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2003–2005, systematic studies in four contrasting hydrogeologic settings were undertaken to improve understanding of source and transport controls on nitrate movement to public supply wells (PSW) in principal aquifers of the United States. Chemical, isotopic, and age tracer data show that agricultural fertilizers and urban septic leachate were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Modesto, California (Central Valley aquifer system) and York, Nebraska (High Plains aquifer). Urban septic leachate and fertilizer (possibly nonfarm) were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Woodbury, Connecticut (glacial aquifer system), and Tampa, Florida (Floridan aquifer system), respectively. Nitrate fluxes to the water table were larger in agricultural settings than urban settings, indicating that it would be beneficial to reduce PSW capture zone areas in agricultural regions. Mixing calculations indicate that about 50 to 85% of the nitrate in water from the PSW could be from those modern anthropogenic sources, with the remainder coming from sources in old (&gt;50 years) recharge or sources in young recharge in undisturbed settings such as forests. Excess N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations and age tracers showed that denitrification at Modesto occurred gradually (first‐order rate constant of 0.02/a) in a thick reaction zone following a ∼30‐year lag time after recharge. Denitrification generally was not an important nitrate sink at Woodbury. At York and Tampa, denitrification occurred rapidly (0.5 to 6/a) in thin reaction zones in fine‐grained sediments that separated the anoxic PSW producing zones from overlying oxic, high‐nitrate ground water. Particle tracking showed that a major pathway by which anthropogenic nitrate reached the York and Tampa PSW was by movement through long well screens crossing multiple hydrogeologic units (York) and by movement through karst features (Tampa), processes which reduced ground water residence times in the denitrifying zones. These results illustrate how PSW vulnerability to nitrate contamination depends on complex variations and interactions between contaminant sources, reaction rates, transit times, mixing, and perturbation of ground water flow in contrasting hydrogeologic settings.</jats:p>",
