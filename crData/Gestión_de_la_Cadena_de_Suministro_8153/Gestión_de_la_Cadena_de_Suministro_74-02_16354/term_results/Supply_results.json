The method takes care of the vital fact that although it is firm water that is demanded or sold, it is reservoir capacity at a particular site that is costed, and the two are not simply related, nor is the relationship independent of previously constructed reservoirs and the stream‐reservoir configuration. A feature of this method is a simple firm water determination concept that is applicable to any steam‐reservoir configuration and that uses rational and reasonable operating rules at each basic time period for the calculations of reservoir storage changes resulting from excess or deficit streamflows relative to demand in those periods. Details of interchanges of water between reservoirs are not relevant to this concept. Streamflows are taken to be the subnormal flow hydrographs that would correspond to a critical period analysis method, but no advantage is taken of any supposed knowledge about future flows.</jats:p>",

Either the internal carotid or vertebral artery or both may fail to carry blood to the brains of these animals. In pig, ox and sheep the proximal segment of the internal carotid artery is absent. Instead, branches of the internal maxillary and/or the external carotid artery feed into an arterial <jats:italic>rete mirabile caroticum</jats:italic>. A distal segment of the internal carotid artery is reconstituted from the rete mirabile which divides into a rostral and a caudal division. In the ox the rete mirabile receives additional branches at its caudal end from the vertebral and occipital arteries. In these three animals the basilar artery is fed from its rostral end through the caudal divisions of the internal carotid arteries of either side.</jats:p><jats:p>The horse has no rete mirabile. The internal carotid artery has a long course through its neck and forms an S‐shaped curve in the cavernous sinus before piercing the dura mater. It then divides into a rostral and a caudal division. The basilar artery in the horse is formed at its caudal end by the union of cerebral rami of the occipital arteries.</jats:p><jats:p>The patterns of the superficial cerebral arteries in all the ungulates studied have distinct submammalian characteristics.
