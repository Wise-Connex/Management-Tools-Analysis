It discusses a new approach to managing the supply chains and distribution in line with effective management of risk, trade-offs, and strategic relationships. Moreover, the chapter notes country and industry characteristics as factors affecting global supply chain decisions in line with international supply chain strategy. It looks at types of buyer–supplier relationships and their scope of collaboration. The chapter then explores developing market-responsive supply chain strategies such as information sharing and global sourcing. The management of an effective supply chain requires the coordination of a wide range of activities such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and customer service.</p>",

As a corporate strategy and a supply chain governance strategy, vertical integration relates to organisational economics and strategic supply chain management. Numerous explanations have been created for vertical integration, and transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a theoretical basis to help understand the process. However, the current popularity of vertical integration seems inspired by something more than altering industry structure and minimising cost, which are the traditionally accepted explanations for vertical integration This paper aims to explore the driving forces for vertical integration, particularly downstream integration of distribution, and the consequences of vertical integration in a manufacturer‐distributor‐reseller chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This study adopted an exploratory case study approach to examine a Swedish‐based timber manufacturer that vertically integrated a distribution centre in the UK, which made it a direct supplier to DIY retailers and builders' merchants.

By solving and the analysis of applications, we know that the two order parameters of supply chain collaboration and profitability determine the self-organized evolution of the system. If the supply chain collaboration has not reached the critical region, the deviation caused by random fluctuations will continue to decay until it disappears, and finally return to the original state. When the system parameters meet to the conditions of non-stability, random fluctuations will lead to the changes of the orderly structure of the system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces a first level of the SCOR based Food Supply Chain’s Sustainable Performance Evaluation Model and a case study. The model connects environmental performance to the part of the supply chain performance. The aim of the model is to consider ecologic issues as a part of the strategic supply chain decisions and in that way to develop supply chain management more sustainable. The food supply chain’s sustainable performance model consists of the ecological, social, and environmental metrics. It bases e.g. on the level 1 SCOR-metrics. The developed method is used in the case study as a method. The results of the case study shows e.g. that if one production plant would be replaced with two plants the delivery time and delivery costs, waste and carbon dioxide emissions would decrease and production costs and investment costs would increase. The results of the case study show that individual measures of the environmental or economical performance are not enough when optimizing supply chains sustainable performance. Also optimizing production cost or delivery performance may differ from supply chain overall performance. More holistic way to measure overall sustainable performance are needed. The sustainable performance evaluation model seems to be useful way to improve sustainable supply chain management but more studies are needed.</jats:p>"

The study was performed indoors at 22 °C in the dark and outdoors at a maximum temperature of 45 °C under sunlight. The leached antimony concentration increased with contact time for all of the studied brands except one. The antimony concentration reached 5.5 μg/L after 544 days of contact time with PET packaging. Small bottles with large contact surface area had higher antimony concentration. However, outdoor storage under sunlight at temperatures below 45 °C did not reveal a significant effect on antimony release. Among some physico-chemical parameters studied (pH, calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate), only calcium concentration showed a significant effect on antimony release. The rate of antimony leaching, normalized to the surface to volume ratio of the water bottle, fits the exponential model Sb/(S/V) = 0.562e0.0041t, with R2 = 0.87. Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis of the different PET packaging material showed an antimony concentration between 80.6 and 352.7 mg Sb/kg PET.</jats:p>",

At the international marketing level, firms must target their promotional mix more effectively and efficiently toward relevant buyers from around the world. International trade shows have long been considered a cost-efficient and quick way to promote exports or gain valuable market information for entry. China is now the world's largest furniture producer and exporter and the leading importer of US hardwoods. As such, it is important to better understand mechanisms for cost-effective participation in this huge hardwood market. This study was conducted to increase awareness of the importance of US–Chinese hardwood trade and knowledge of Chinese international furniture supply trade shows (IFS-TSs). In 2011, US hardwood lumber exports to China totaled US$506 million or two-thirds of the US$775 million worth of all hardwood product exports that year. A total of 27 Chinese IFS-TSs were identified through a two-part process: a review of secondary sources and personal communication with key trade show informants in China. This article also profiles the largest and most influential Chinese IFS-TSs (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 9) in terms of the number of attendees and exhibitors, and other relevant factors. A better understanding of these trade shows will help US hardwood manufactures make show participation decisions.</jats:p>",

Coppola, SPE, and Ryan C. Chachula, SPE, Encana Corporation, prepared for the 2011 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, 30 October-2 November. The paper has not been peer reviewed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One challenge of the Horn River shale play in British Columbia, Canada, has been the increasing number of fracture stimulations required per horizontal wellbore. Critically important is the massive volume of water required to supply the continuous fracturing operations in the development. To eliminate reliance on surface water, it was decided to produce high volumes of sour water from a relatively unknown underpressurized saline aquifer. The challenge was designing an appropriate lift system capable of producing volumes up to 8500 m3/d per well while addressing unknown fluid inflows, fluid transmissibility and recharge, and reservoir-fluid-chemistry characteristics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Horn River basin is in northeastern British Columbia, approximately 1600 km northwest of Calgary, Alberta (Fig.  1). The primary-target horizons are the Muskwa, Otter Park, and Evie formations, which are predominantly organic and silica-rich shale. Since 2005, slickwater fracture treatments have grown from 400 m3 of water with 10 t of proppant in a vertical well to 29 staged fracture treatments per horizontal well, with each treatment consisting of 5000 m3 of water with 200 t of proppant. As the volume and number of treatments have grown, so has the demand for fracture-treatment water. At 5000 m3/stage, approximately 150 000 m3 of water is required for one horizontal-well completion with 30 fractures. The Debolt formation was identified as a potential water source that could supply the required fracture-treatment water. A test well was drilled to determine reservoir properties and the compatibility of the water with the Horn River fracturing program. Subsequent testing of the Debolt water revealed 21 000 mg/L total dissolved solids, 60 ppm H2S concentration in the water phase, and approximately 5000 ppm of H2S in the vapor phase. The Debolt formation was determined to be underpressured, with a pressure gradient of 7.2 kPa/m.</jats:p>",

The model, which can be rapidly applied to potentially any location in Australia, has been verified by measured monthly external water demand at Adelaide, Bundaberg, Emerald, Fraser Coast, Gold Coast, Mackay, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Toowoomba. The survey data represents demands in periods prior to, during and after the millennium drought of 2001–2005 by discontinuously spanning 25 years from 1985 to 2010. The model avoids local calibration through a national regression of parameters. A demand index is produced that predicts daily proportions of annual demand. Results show that the model is capable of identifying 90% of the spatial and temporal variability in water demand, based on daily index summations by month. This research is useful for reliability estimates of intermittent water supplies, such as rainwater harvesting.</jats:p>",

Building of ice cover can be substantially different even for neighbouring lakes as a result of different individual features such as, for example, morphometric parameters. In this study the variation in the thickness of ice cover on Lake Samołęskie (29 ha) localised in western Poland, is analysed. According to measurements performed the differences in the thickness of ice cover was significant as it varied from 20 to 33 cm. A characteristic feature was that along the west bank of the lake the ice cover was thinner and its thickness increased towards the east. Analysis of the hydrogeological data revealed that this phenomenon is related to the supply of water to the lake basin by efficient water-carrying formations. The influx of water affects the bottom layer of the ice cover. This effect is aggravated by the fact that the water is supplied under elevated pressure as evidenced by the presence of a polynia of about 10 m in diameter, over the deepest (over 20 metres deep) site in the lake. The polynia is never frozen, even during the coldest winters. The specific features of the lake illustrate the influence of local geological conditions on the character of processes taking place in lakes in general.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study is to measure and confirm the relation of horizontal information integration within a company's cross functional integration to vertical information integration of the company with their customers and suppliers, and how that affects customer satisfaction and financial performance. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate supplier and customer integration strategies using a sample of 90 manufacturing, distribution, and retail companies in Indonesia. The respondents from each company were limited to senior managers with functional areas of expertise and responsibility. The research was conducted through a survey questionnaire. The results of the study show 1) a positive direct relationship between integrated information and customer satisfaction, 2) a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and financial performance, and 3) a positive relationship from integrated information through to financial performance. The holistic implementation of information integration strategies in other developing countries can help companies to excel and gain measurable financial performances</jats:p>"

During this investigation, temporal and spatial variations in the invertebrate composition occurring throughout a conventional Drinking Water Purification Plant (DWPP) and the abiotic drivers responsible for their occurrence were investigated. Samples destined for invertebrate and water quality analyses were collected and multivariate statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained. Copepoda, Rotatoria, Cladocera, Ostracoda and Diptera were the dominant groups found in the source water and occurred throughout the purification process. A higher total biomass occurred throughout the purification process, in particular after sedimentation and filtration, compared with the total biomass entering the DWPP. The water quality variables measured were within the optimum ranges of invertebrates. The present study proved the theory that purification plants are an important source of invertebrates occurring in the drinking water distribution network. Strategies should be implemented to improve coagulation (by using coagulants/flocculants to increase the pH above 10.5), flocculation, sedimentation (by removing sludge and algae) and filtration (by optimizing filter bed maintenance) and general filter house ‘housekeeping’.</jats:p>",

Comparison against the commonly used synthetic flocculant, aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) demonstrated the high efficiency of the cactus to eliminate turbidity. The mucilage extract increased particulate settling rates 330% compared with aluminium sulfate, at dosage concentrations of 3 mg L−1, while its performance was equivalent at doses 0.3% of the required Al2(SO4)3 concentration. The cactus mucilage, which consists of complex carbohydrates and sugars, has unique surface activity characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for enhancing dispersion properties, creating emulsifications, and for reducing the surface tension of high polarity liquids. These results indicated that the Nopal cactus mucilage has the potential to be the basis for a new ‘green’ technology, which is environmentally benign and cost-effective.</jats:p>",

Previous research is expanded to include multi-period and multi-product cooperative supply chain with possibility of holding inventory in a multi-stage, multi-member setup. A Cooperative Supply Optimizer System (CSOS), a software-based coordination mechanism, is developed for large chains. It gathers operational information from members of the supply chain, and then guides them on ordering decisions for a minimum cost of the entire supply chain. Simulation results indicate an approximately 26% reduction in total supply chain costs, utilizing this formulation over a competitive setup. As the holding costs increase, the problem decomposes into single period (Just-in-time) again. The disturbing bullwhip effect disappears in cooperative supply chains.</jats:p>"

Therefore, to stabilize the electrical power supply, a steady input impedance of the transmission circuit is preferable such that the influence of load resistance fluctuations is minimized.

There has consequently been a debate for many years about whether the solution to water scarcity must be considered in terms of efficiency or equity, the role that the public sector must play and the role that market-based instruments should play in water management. The aim of this paper is to analyse the advantages and disadvantages associated with different policy instruments, from both a supply and a demand viewpoint, which can be applied to water management in Catalonia. For this purpose, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, in which we introduce an ecological sector that allows us to analyse the environmental and economic impact of the alternative policies simulated. The calibration of the exogenous variables of the CGE model is performed by using a social accounting matrix (SAM) for the Catalan economy with 2001 data. The results suggest that taking into account the principle of sustainability of the resource, the policy debate between supply and demand in water policies is obsolete and a new combination of policies is required to respect the different values associated with water.</jats:p>",

The Norwegian Drinking Water Regulations stipulate that supplied water should comply with over 50 quality criteria. Abiding by the regulations and improving the water quality has its costs – economically and environmentally. Quality improvement entails, inter alia, the consumption of more chemicals, both in terms of quantity and variety, and a rise in energy consumption. In order to determine the environmental impacts of the consumption of chemicals and energy, an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out. It was observed that the impacts of chemicals have increased dramatically after 2007, courtesy of a process upgrading at one of the WTPs. Except in the years 2004 and 2007, the impacts attributable to chemicals consumption have exceeded those due to energy consumption. Global warming is the key impact in both cases, though in the case of energy consumption, abiotic depletion and acidification are also significant.</jats:p>",

We postulate hypotheses on supply and demand factors that could impact the amount of daily viewing time. Although the general assumption is that supply and demand often correlate, we see that for television this is only marginally the case. Especially diversity of program supply, often deemed very important in media markets, does not affect (positively or negatively) television viewing behavior. Most variation in television viewing can be attributed to habit and to regular events (e. g. weekends, Christmas) and to unexpected events (e. g. the 9/11 WTC attack). We also find that weather conditions interact with program types, so that, for example, in winter times people favor entertainment programs even more, suggesting that people use television for mood management.</jats:p>",

In order to increase knowledge of the effect of water treatment on waterborne fungi, the dose–response effect of four commonly used drinking water disinfection methods was tested on selected fungal species: Aspergillus calidoustus, Penicillium spinulosum, Trichoderma viride and Fusarium solani. These species are all common in Norwegian drinking water, and are regarded as emerging pathogens, toxigenic and/or food contaminants. Spore suspensions were treated with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, ozone, chlorine and chloramine. Three different doses were tested for each disinfectant and all doses were repeated three times. Bacillus subtilis was included as a control for the disinfection processes and to compare the resistance. P. spinulosum and T. viride were resistant to chlorine and chloramine. They were also very tolerant to UV-irradiation and ozone, although the highest doses of ozone had a small inactivation effect, especially on T. viride. Ozone was found to be most effective against fungi in general. It is apparent that fungal species may have very different properties when it comes to tolerance to water disinfection, and the inactivation of B. subtilis spores cannot be used as an indicator of fungal spore inactivation after water treatment.</jats:p>",

We study the period 1976–2005. The analysis is based on duality applied to the production theory. The output supplies and conditioned input demands are estimated from a translog multi‐output, multi‐input restricted profit function, where the total production credit is used as proxy of the total expenditure. Farmer expectations with respect to crop prices are incorporated to the estimation based on the quasi‐rational expectation model. The output and input responses to the total expenditure are positive and statistically significant except for cotton, wheat, fertilizer, and pesticides. The short‐run output supply response to own prices is inelastic, except for wheat, which presents elastic response to its price. Acreage has a positive impact on the output supply and it is influenced by land productivity. The main conclusion is that farmers face budget restrictions to purchase inputs, and a government credit program might increase the agricultural supply.</jats:p>",

After three relatively flat years in 2007 to 2009, final figures indicate total MEMS sales jumped some 25% in 2010, to $8.6 billion, thanks largely to the surprisingly fast recovery of the automotive industry and its inventory restocking, as well as the boom in smart phones and tablets with motion sensing.  But stronger than anticipated sales of optical MEMS for both telecommunications and consumer applications, and of inertial and RF devices for industrial applications also contributed to the outsize growth.  Though growth will now settle down to more sustainable post-recovery rates, we now expect continued stronger demand across these multiple sectors  to drive 14% compound annual growth for the MEMS industry for the next five years, to reach a $19.5 billion market by 2016.</jats:p>",

Soil nutrients can enhance flowering, and thus, populations on nutrient‐rich soils may require less‐favorable growing temperatures to flower. We tested this hypothesis by predicting the probability of flowering in response to air temperature for five species of alpine <jats:italic>Chionochloa</jats:italic> grasses in South Island, New Zealand, over 37 years and relating our predictions to soil N supply (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>). Summer air temperatures better predicted flowering than spring air temperatures, which were correlated with soil N mineralization. Species on N‐rich soils required lower mean temperatures to induce flowering and/or responded more consistently across a gradient of air temperatures, contributing to the higher probability of their tillers and tussocks flowering at low summer temperatures. Our results suggest that flowering primarily occurs in response to warm summer temperatures, but species on N‐rich soils require less favorable growing conditions because they invest relatively less N in seeds. Thus, predicting masting requires a consideration of the interactions among climate, the internal resources of plants, and mineral nutrient uptake.</jats:p>",

The increase in cadmium concentration was greater in the presence of zinc than in its absence. This suggests that the effect of soilapplied Zn is reflected in the enhancement of the Cd content in plants. Thus, zinc application cannot offset the toxic effect of Cd.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In real residual chlorine management practices, a simple criterion is required for evaluating chlorine consumption by inner wall surfaces of water distribution pipes. The amount of chlorine consumed by 1 m2 of the inner wall surface of a pipe per hour (J-value) can be used for this purpose. To estimate the J-value for a pipe, a zero-order rate equation was adopted for chlorine reduction caused by a pipe wall, based on laboratory experimental results. The J-value was closely related to characteristics of the pipe material. The J-value for old unlined metallic pipes was extremely large (J &amp;gt; 18 mg m−2 h−1), whereas that for plastic polymer pipes was very small (J &amp;lt; 0.08 mg m−2 h−1). The J-value for cement mortar lined pipes increased exponentially with increasing water temperature. This paper proposes an effective method on the basis of J-value for residual chlorine management practices. First, this method is used to identify those pipes which consume relatively more chlorine than other pipes. Maximum allowable residence time (MART), within which the required minimum chlorine concentration can be maintained, can also be estimated by this method. MART is useful to determine necessary and sufficient measures for shortening water residence time in identified pipes.</jats:p>",

Instead, Oil Majors effectively pass their pressure through ship managers down to seafarers and force them to silently comply. Among the consequences are work intensification and fatigue leading to a skewed impact on seafarers’ health and safety. This article suggests that supply chain pressure cannot be an adequate substitute for what an organized workforce can achieve through effective participation in the management of workplace health and safety. </jats:p>",

Reference‐dependence therefore may imply the perpetuation of disadvantage: people who do not expect an opportunity may be less likely to “seize the day” if one unexpectedly arrives. We find evidence of this possibility in labor supply decision‐making in two datasets about a high‐unemployment part of Cape Town, South Africa, including a panel. People with low expectations for finding a job — that is, people who expect to be unemployed — are less likely to report accepting several hypothetical job offers. This result is robust to a range of respecifications, including adding a range of control variables for desire and ability to work, including reservation wages. The finding appears to arise according to the theorized mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of reference‐dependent labor supply in a developing country, where especially low expectations could have particularly important consequences.</jats:p>",

Specific 16S rRNA probes were designed for 14 previously identified but non-cultured bacterial species (Ferribacterium limneticum, Hydrogenophaga sp., Methylotenera sp., Janthinobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Rhizobium selenireducens, Rhodoferax sp., Nitrosomonadaceae bacterium, Thauera sp. and five strains which could not be identified to species level). With fluorescence in situ hybridization the titer of these species was determined. Total bacterial counts were 4.3 × 104 cells/mL (April) and 4.0 × 104cells/mL (December). The highest relative counts were observed for Methylotenera sp. (4.6–21.7%), F. limneticum (6.1–10.2%), Janthinobacterium sp. (6.1–7.1%), strain K-S10-Sep02 (5.8–5.9%) and Nitrosomonadaceae bacterium (4.8–5.9%). These organisms accounted for 50% (April) and 29% (December) of the total counts. Finally, single water production wells that supply drinking water were studied for the counts of Methylotenera sp., F. limneticum and Janthinobacterium sp.

A total of 3425 units were collected in 3 days and thousands of donors were turned away. An error delayed processing of 1000 units and they were used as stored whole blood. Apheresis platelets were donated by protesters who were particularly motivated to donate for two victims with liver injury. The usual positive rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody in Egyptian donors is 3.8%. However, the positive rate of HCV markers in the collected units was only 1.6%.

The buyer allocates demand to the suppliers using a score function with an exponential form, which specifies the relative importance of price vs. service, in order to minimize his costs, while the suppliers choose their prices and fill rates to maximize their profits. For the case of dual‐sourcing, we characterize the optimal parameter of the exponential score function, considering the impact of the buyer's decisions on the suppliers, and considering how the suppliers compete against each other to earn a portion of the buyer's demand. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium and characterize the equilibrium behavior of the system. We then consider a general number of suppliers and show that the equilibrium prices and fill rates, and the buyer's cost, are increasing in the number of suppliers. We compare these results to a model of single‐sourcing, in which the buyer is the Stackelberg leader and extracts all profits from the supplier. We find that the buyer always prefers single‐sourcing to multisourcing. Finally, we study a centralized system and use the results to develop a coordinating contract for the decentralized system. </jats:p>",

Research reporting high failure rates for collaborative alliances with supply chain partners makes formation of global supply chains a high-risk venture. This study examines the influence of strategic enterprise risk management (ERM) processes on improving supply chain capability while mitigating risks. ERM has become a major strategic management focus, and researchers suggest this momentum arises from the need for governance mechanisms that counter the ineffectiveness of government intervention and cooperation in cross-border relationships. We survey 207 organizations on their perceptions of their own ERM processes and a specific supply chain partner's absorptive capacity, B2B e-commerce business risk, and the global business risk associated with that partner relationship. The results support theorized relationships positing that stronger ERM promotes higher levels of partner absorptive capacity, lower B2B risk, and lower associated global business risk. Results further show that associated global business risk is reduced through managing and controlling partner absorptive capacity and B2B risk. Additional analyses show that stronger ERM is associated with partners being from countries with cultural traits conducive to strong supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

From the PCA, it is possible to weigh up the values from each individual model in order to obtain a linear combination which represents all characteristics of valid models for each supplier. As an example, the FC method proposed was applied in the industrial sector of the three largest electric power suppliers in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning to mitigate the impacts of a disaster can be an important activity for both private companies and public agencies. In this article, the authors consider a supply system that provides needed goods or services to a region that may be the subject of some type of disaster, such as an attack by a terrorist or the result of a natural event or accident. The supply system is represented by a set of existing capacitated facilities. The authors assume that the loss of one or more facilities to a disaster will tighten available supply and increase the distances over which the service or good must be delivered, thereby increasing operation costs and reducing service. Such a disaster may even reduce the capacity of the supply/storage to the extent that the goods must be rationed as remaining supply may be outstripped by demand. The authors consider the case where resources may be available to mitigate some of the impacts of a possible disaster by the advanced protection of one or more facilities. The authors show how this problem can be formulated as a “tri-level” optimization model and propose a solution approach based on a tree search strategy. The authors demonstrate the policy implications of this model using a hypothetical planning problem. Through this example, the authors show how the results of our model can be used to inform planners and policy makers in disaster mitigation planning. </jats:p>",

Multivariate analysis tests these factors on a community agency's ability to engage more students, particularly service learners. The findings are generally optimistic about agency willingness to involve students, suggesting widespread community benefits from their involvement. While organizational size and capacity predict current student engagement, an agency's past experience with students and its perceptions of student benefits have the greatest impact on its willingness to take on future students.</jats:p>",

In our developed stylized model, a retailer sources from a supplier with uncertain lead‐time to meet his stable and known demand, and the supply lead‐time is composed of two random duration stages. At the completion time of the first stage, the retailer has the option to expedite a portion of the replenishment order via an alternative faster supply mode. We characterize the optimal expediting policy in terms of if and how much of the order to expedite and explore comparative statics on the optimal policy to better understand the effects of changes in the cost parameters and lead‐time properties. We also study how the expediting option affects the retailer's decisions on the replenishment order (time and size of order placement). We observe that with the expediting option the retailer places larger orders closer to the start of the selling season, thus having this option serve as a substitute for the safety lead‐time and allowing him to take increased advantages of economies of scale. Finally we extend the basic model by looking at correlated lead‐time stages and more than two random lead‐time stages. </jats:p>",

We hypothesize that, over a wide range of temperature, growth is the minimum of the supply of carbohydrate from photosynthesis, and the demand of carbohydrate to synthesize new tissue. Biosynthetic demand limits growth at cool temperatures and increases exponentially with temperature. Photosynthesis limits growth at warm temperatures and decreases with temperature. Observations of tomato seedlings were used to calibrate a model based on this hypothesis. Model predictions were tested with published data for growth and carbohydrate content of sunflower and wheat. The model qualitatively fitted the response of growth of tomato and sunflower to both cool and warm temperatures. The transition between demand and supply limitation occurred at warmer temperatures under higher light and faster photosynthesis. Modifications were required to predict the observed non‐structural carbohydrate (NSC). Some NSC was observed at warm temperatures, where demand should exceed supply. It was defined as a required reserve. Less NSC was found at cool temperatures than predicted from the difference between supply and demand. This was explained for tomato and sunflower, by feedback inhibition of NSC on photosynthesis. This inhibition was much less in winter wheat.</jats:p>",

In this study, we asked whether ameliorating mitochondrial functions in cancer cells might limit their proliferative capacity. Specifically, we increased mitochondrial metabolism in a murine cellular model of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer by ectopically expressing the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. As predicted, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed an increased level of mitochondrial metabolism and reduced proliferative capacity in vitro, compared with controls. In contrast, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α formed larger tumors in vivo. These tumors exhibited increased concentrations of glucose and the angiogenic factor VEGF as well as higher expression of ErbB2/Neu compared with controls. We discovered that ErbB2/Neu levels were sensitive to nutrient availability, such that reduced glucose concentrations resulted in diminished ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Therefore, our data indicate that PGC-1α prevents the nutrient-mediated downregulation of ErbB2/Neu in tumors by increasing glucose supply. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the regulation of ErbB2/Neu levels by glucose was mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). Incubation of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer cells in limited glucose concentrations or with drugs that activate the UPR led to significant reductions in ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Also, ErbB2/Neu–induced tumors ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed lowered UPR activation compared with controls. Together, our findings uncover an unexpected link between PGC-1α–mediated nutrient availability, UPR, and ErbB2/Neu levels. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1538–46. ©2012 AACR.</jats:p>",

Interactive effects on stress responses have been clearly established, but results are inconsistent and variably indicate antagonistic or synergistic interactions even within the same plant species. In this study, five differently B‐ and salt‐resistant wheat genotypes were grown hydroponically at low and high B supply. The effect of increasing NaCl salinity on plant growth, boron uptake rates, shoot B concentrations, and transpiration was determined under both B regimes. The interactive effect of salt and B was different under low and high B supply. Boron‐uptake rates were reduced with increasing salt concentration only under high B supply, and reductions correlated significantly with decreases in leaf area and shoot B concentrations. Under low B supply, however, salt‐induced effects on B‐uptake rates were variable and not significantly correlated with leaf‐area reductions. These results suggest that under high B supply, when B uptake is predominantly passive by diffusion or channel‐mediated <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> aquaporins, transpiration‐driven water flow is the dominant factor for B accumulation in arial plant parts. Under low B supply, when a significant portion of B can be taken up <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> active pathways, transpiration is not the decisive factor for B accumulation. Under these conditions, the salt sensitivity of a genotype is a modifying factor of salt–B interactions, because salt‐induced growth inhibition can result in a concentration effect, offset the reduction of B‐uptake rates, and result in increased shoot B concentrations. Contradictory reports on the nature of salt–B interactions might in part be related to low levels of B supply chosen as control treatments and concomittant differences in predominant B‐uptake pathways.</jats:p>",

Evaporation ponds are shallow basins that expose their contents to the environment, reducing liquid volume by means of evaporation. As they resemble traditional salt works that customarily use seawater, evaporation ponds were analyzed for their use for brine desalination management. In order to numerically evaluate this modification, a comparative study of the evaporation rate achieved in both traditional salt works and in evaporation ponds was carried out. Two equations were obtained for each estimation. The numerical expressions are specific for high salinity water as opposed to those available for low salinity water. These equations show the influence of fluid nature, the effect of wind and the lower brine evaporation capacity. It was observed in this study that the difference in brine evaporation capacity through the use of seawater is low enough to indicate that the use of brine in traditional salt works allows an increase in salt production without necessarily multiplying the surface required for evaporation.</jats:p>",

However, extensive pancreatic resections are typically performed open and are associated with a substantial amount of postoperative pain, wound complications and long recovery time. Minimally invasive surgery offers an avenue to improve results; however, current limitations of laparoscopic surgery render its application in the setting of chronic pancreatitis technically demanding. Additionally, pancreatic resections are associated with a high incidence of diabetes. Transplantation of islets isolated from the resected pancreas portion offers a way to prevent post-surgical diabetes; however, preservation of the vascular supply during pancreatic resection, which determines islet cell viability, is technically difficult using current laparoscopic approaches. With recent advances in the surgical field, robotic surgery now provides a means to overcome these obstacles to achieve the end goals of pain relief and preserved endocrine function. We present the first report of a novel, minimally invasive robotic approach for resection of the pancreatic head that preserves vascular supply and enables the isolation of a high yield of viable islets for transplantation.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Case presentation</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>A 35-year old Caucasian woman presented with intractable chronic abdominal pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis, with a stricture of her main pancreatic duct at the level of the ampulla of Vater and distal dilatation. She was offered a robotic-assisted pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy and subsequent islet transplantation, to both provide pain relief and preserve insulin-secretory reserves.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We present a novel, minimally invasive robotic approach for resection of the pancreatic head with complete preservation of the vascular supply, minimal warm ischemia time (less than three minutes) and excellent islet recovery (134,727 islet equivalent). Our patient is currently pain-free with normal glycemic control. Robot-assisted pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy and autologous islet transplantation can be safely performed and has the potential to minimize operative traumas as well as to partially preserve endocrine function. Results from this case report suggest that this dual procedure should be considered as a treatment option for patients with chronic pancreatitis at earlier stages of the disease, before irreversible islet loss occurs.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

The urban water supply pipeline network in the city of Oslo is an example. Even as it faces increasing operational, maintenance, and management challenges, it needs to better its environmental performance by reducing, for instance, the associated greenhouse gas emissions. In this article the authors examine the environmental life cycle performance of Oslo's water supply pipelines by analyzing annual resource consumption and emissions as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) impact potentials over a period of 16 years, taking into account the production/manufacture, installation, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and retirement of pipelines. It is seen that the water supply pipeline network of Oslo has already reached a state of saturation on a per capita basis, that is, it is not expanding any more relative to the population it serves, and the stock is now rapidly aging. This article is part of a total urban water cycle system analysis for Oslo, and analyzes more specifically the environmental impacts from the material flows in the water distribution network, examining six environmental impact categories using the SimaPro (version 7.1.8) software, Ecoinvent database, and the CML 2001 (version 2.04) methodology. The long‐term management of stocks calls for a strong focus on cost optimization, energy efficiency, and environmental friendliness. Global warming and abiotic depletion emerge as the major impact categories from the water pipeline system, and the largest contribution is from the production and installation phases and the medium‐size pipelines in the network.</jats:p>",

We find that an expansion of biofuel production to meet the existing or even higher targets in various countries would slightly reduce GDP at the global level but with mixed effects across countries or regions. Significant land re‐allocation would take place with notable decreases in forest and pasture lands in a few countries. The expansion of biofuels would cause a moderate decrease in world food supply and more significant decreases in developing countries like India and Sub‐Saharan Africa. Feedstock commodities (sugar, corn and oil seeds) would experience significant increases in their prices in 2020, but other price changes are small.</jats:p>",

The current literature lacks research that describes the transition to an SCO from a supply chain manager’s perspective. Our objective is to fill this gap by delving into the minds of operations managers, who must carry out an interpretation process to set goals, process information, perceive their environment, and actively solve problems when confronted with the organization’s decision to implement supply chain initiatives. We adopt an interpretivist ontology through utilizing <jats:italic>grounded theory</jats:italic> to provide an in‐depth analysis of interviews from seven manufacturing organizations and 121 supply chain managers to provide a rich description of those managers’ perceptions and challenges throughout the transition.

We previously demonstrated that direct oxygenation through a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane increases the oxygen supply to cell cultures and improves hepatocyte functions. In this study, we removed limits on oxygen supply to fetal rat liver cells through the use of direct oxygenation through a PDMS membrane to investigate in vitro growth and maturation. We chose fetal liver cells because they are considered a feasible source of liver progenitor cells for regenerative medicine therapy due to their highly efficient maturation and proliferation. Cells from 17-day-old pregnant rats were cultured under 5% and 21% oxygen atmospheres. Some cells were first cultured under 5% oxygen, and then switched to a 21% oxygen atmosphere. When oxygen supply was enhanced by a PDMS membrane, the rat fetal liver cells organized into a complex tissue composed of an epithelium of hepatocytes above a mesenchyme-like tissue. The thickness of this supportive tissue was directly correlated to oxygen concentration and was thicker under 5% oxygen. When cultures were switched from 5% to 21% oxygen, lumen-containing structures were formed in the thick mesenchymal-like tissue and the albumin secretion rate increased. In addition, cells adapted their glycolytic activity to the oxygen concentrations. This system promoted the formation of a functional and organized thick tissue suitable for use in regenerative medicine. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the closed-loop supply chain that supports the availability of spare parts experiences variability in its processes as a result of endogenous and exogenous variables that make matching the recovery process with the demand process difficult. Understanding the effect of the variables on the variability outcome and the emergence of the variability can help to guide the development of future mathematical models for the management of spare parts.

We determined the major and trace element composition of 40 samples from this core. Our results show that the incompatible element ratios, such as Zr/Nb, which are correlated with Pb isotopic ratios, are more variable in the lower 408 m of Mauna Kea shield lavas than in the overlying 2855 m (∼450 ka). We argue that this geochemical diversity was present in the mantle source of Mauna Kea shield lavas and does not require the inter‐fingering of lavas from adjacent volcanoes. Because of uncertainties in Ni partitioning between olivine and melt and the wide range of Ni contents in peridotites, we show that all Mauna Kea lavas may have been derived from a peridotite source. We also obtained major and trace element compositions for 24 whole‐rock clasts and hyaloclastites and 7 glasses from HSDP Phase‐1 core between 1767 and 1808 mbs. These enigmatic lavas, previously recognized by the distinctive high CaO and K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O contents of their glasses, are also relatively enriched in highly incompatible trace elements. We show that this group of lavas have affinities with post‐shield lavas and argue that they are a consequence of lower degrees of melting (∼a factor of two) than other Mauna Kea shield lavas, thereby providing evidence that magma supply varied significantly during the growth of the Mauna Kea shield.</jats:p>",

Therefore, we organized the first multicenter proficiency study on 24-locus VNTR typing. Sets of 30 DNAs of MTBC strains, including 10 duplicate DNA samples, were distributed among 37 participating laboratories in 30 different countries worldwide. Twenty-four laboratories used an in-house-adapted method with fragment sizing by gel electrophoresis or an automated DNA analyzer, nine laboratories used a commercially available kit, and four laboratories used other methods. The intra- and interlaboratory reproducibilities of VNTR typing varied from 0% to 100%, with averages of 72% and 60%, respectively. Twenty of the 37 laboratories failed to amplify particular VNTR loci; if these missing results were ignored, the number of laboratories with 100% interlaboratory reproducibility increased from 1 to 5. The average interlaboratory reproducibility of VNTR typing using a commercial kit was better (88%) than that of in-house-adapted methods using a DNA analyzer (70%) or gel electrophoresis (50%). Eleven laboratories using in-house-adapted manual typing or automated typing scored inter- and intralaboratory reproducibilities of 80% or higher, which suggests that these approaches can be used in a reliable way. In conclusion, this first multicenter study has documented the worldwide quality of VNTR typing of MTBC strains and highlights the importance of international quality control to improve genotyping in the future.\n          </jats:p>",

For this purpose, the reflections from participant observation and literature on the subject are validated. Some of the ways these churches mediate themselves and are part of a context of spectacle and commoditization are also pointed out. The religious market has adequate to the symbolic capital and to the cultural framework of the participants of the churches. Because of that it is possible to identify the ideological and economic investment in the manufacturing and delivery of their strategies, discourses and products. This article aims to highlight some of the ways in which neo-Pentecostal churches convey the goods they produce and the speeches that reflect them, relating them to a mass culture and a society of the spectacle. Finally, the article wants to encourage the debate on the ways these churches apply the marketing of Jesus in order to co-opt their members and flatten their unitsKeywords: Holy War’s marketing.

The identified stimulus–response experiment was a modest 50% shift‐up in glucose uptake rate (<jats:italic>q</jats:italic>GLC) that unexpectedly resulted in a disproportionate transient metabolic response. The 50% shift‐up in <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>GLC in the Biocurve resulted in a near tripling of the online measured oxygen uptake (<jats:italic>q</jats:italic>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and carbon dioxide production (<jats:italic>q</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) rates, suggesting a considerable mobilization of glycogen and trehalose. The 50% shift‐up in <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>GLC was subsequently studied in detail in a conventional bioreactor (4 l working volume), which confirmed the results obtained with the Biocurve. Especially relevant is the observation that the 50% increase in glucose uptake rate led to a three‐fold increase in glycolytic flux, due to mobilization of storage materials. This explains the unexpected ethanol and acetate secretion after the shift‐up, in spite of the fact that after the shift‐up the <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>GLC was far less than the critical value. Moreover, these results show that the correct <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> fluxes in glucose pulse experiments cannot be obtained from the uptake and secretion rates only. Instead, the storage fluxes must also be accurately quantified. Finally, we speculate on the possible role that the transient increase in dissolved CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> immediately after the 50% shift‐up in <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>GLC could have played a part in triggering glycogen and trehalose mobilization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new uranium supply and usage analysis takes into account growth in physical demand for electricity, both before and after decarbonization. It also models the economic willingness of investors to build the required reactors as a profit-maximizing decision. The analysis computes the optimum path of investment and disinvestment in one or more uranium-based fuel cycles as dynamic profit maximization under physical constraints, and the resulting economic decisions are compared with physical decarbonization goals. Investor decisions prove to be insensitive to the electricity price (and hence to higher carbon tax) above a low threshold. Above that price threshold, their decisions on reactor investment are dominated by the total supply of uranium and the speed at which reactors can be built. In order to pay for the very large generating capacity needed, profit-maximizing investors seem to need of the order of 36 M tons of uranium reserves to use (some seven times the world's presently identified reserves). Even given this supply, they will limit their maximum investment in capacity if the build rate of reactors is too slow. If the world does choose to decarbonize, it will be necessary to manage uranium prospecting, and reactor building, purchase and operation as an interdependent system, and there will be a steep task of uranium exploration over the next decade or two. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The use of suitable plants that can accumulate excess phosphorus (P) from contaminated soil may serve as an attractive method for phytoremediation. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of P incorporation on P accumulation and physiological mechanisms of <jats:italic>Polygonum hydropiper</jats:italic> in a mining ecotype (ME) and nonmining ecotype (NME) from a phosphorus mining and a noncontaminated agricultural area, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ME of <jats:italic>P. hydropiper</jats:italic> growing in soil supplied with 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 mg P (kg soil)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> showed a significantly higher biomass compared to the NME. Phosphorus accumulation of the ME was positively correlated with the soil P concentration. APase activity in roots of the ME significantly increased at 1600 mg P (kg soil)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and phytase activity of the ME increased with increasing P supply. APase activity of the ME was more than twice that of the NME on average. A significant increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed compared with the NME at all supplied P levels. Peroxidase (POD) activity of the ME was significantly higher at 200 and 400 mg P (kg soil)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. No statistical differences in the catalase (CAT) activity of the ME were observed compared with the control. Activity of CAT in the NME was obviously induced after exposure to 100–800 mg P (kg soil)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in leaves of the ME decreased with increasing P supply to reach a minimum at 400 mg P (kg soil)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. In the NME, an increase in MDA concentration compared to the control was observed at higher P levels. The APase and phytase induction and antioxidative defense allowed for the high P accumulation of the ME.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Islet transplantation is a feasible therapeutic alternative for metabolically labile patients with type 1 diabetes. The primary therapeutic target is stable glycemic control and prevention of complications associated with diabetes by reconstitution of endogenous insulin secretion. However, critical shortage of donor organs, gradual loss in graft function over time, and chronic need for immunosuppression limit the indication for islet transplantation to a small group of patients. Here we present a promising approach to address these limitations by utilization of a macrochamber specially engineered for islet transplantation. The s.c. implantable device allows for controlled and adequate oxygen supply and provides immunological protection of donor islets against the host immune system. The minimally invasive implantable chamber normalized blood glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodents for up to 3 mo. Sufficient graft function depended on oxygen supply. Pretreatment with the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) agonist, JI-36, significantly enhanced graft function by improving glucose tolerance and increasing β-cell insulin reserve in rats thereby allowing for a reduction of the islet mass required for metabolic control. As a result of hypervascularization of the tissue surrounding the device, no relevant delay in insulin response to glucose changes has been observed. Consequently, this system opens up a fundamental strategy for therapy of diabetes and may provide a promising avenue for future approaches to xenotransplantation.</jats:p>",
