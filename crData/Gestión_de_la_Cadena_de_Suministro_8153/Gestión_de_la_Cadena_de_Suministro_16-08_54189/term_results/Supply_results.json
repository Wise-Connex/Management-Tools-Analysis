We derive a conceptual model combining the contingent natural resource‐based view (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NRBV</jats:styled-content>) with stakeholder theory. The resulting hypotheses are tested using cross‐industry data of 284 firms utilizing primary and secondary data. Findings reveal a phenomenon we term the<jats:italic>Supply Chain Position Paradox</jats:italic>: The closer a company is located toward the end consumer, the higher its<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content>practice levels. Conversely, performance gains decrease with company proximity to the end consumer.

It concludes by reviewing existing data sets and analyses and gauges the potential for network analysis to inform the study of arms transfer networks. Given the general import of these networks for both security studies and policy, there should be a renaissance in the study of arms supply and proliferation networks.</p>",

Despite the substantial resources invested to provide safe water, there is a significant number of water points that are non-functional. Knowledge of the degree of sustainability and the contributing factors for rural water supply projects is limited. This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes.</jats:p>",

Since the humanitarian logistics literature focuses primarily on emergencies and sees longer term and regular operations as being conducted in relatively stable and predictable environments, agile practices are usually not associated with humanitarian protracted operations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At the global level, efforts to measure and monitor financial inclusion indicators have been increasing. However, there is still a substantial lack of sexdisaggregated data, particularly from the supply side; that is, data compiled from information provided by financial institutions. Among the countries of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean (LAC), there is a systematic lack of sexdisaggregated data at both the public and private sector levels. This impacts negatively on efforts to improve financial inclusion, as it hampers the design of strategies with actions and objectives that are more appropriate for men and women and makes it impossible to evaluate public intervention or measure progress. This paper seeks to help close the supply-side data gap and proposes a set of sex-disaggregated supply-side data indicators, based on both international data-gathering initiatives and those undertaken at the national level in LAC. It suggests that financial regulators in LAC should collect supply-side data gradually to build a database that is harmonized and comparable among the region’s countries. Such data would facilitate the study, monitoring, and comparison of progress on financial inclusion for men and women. It would also facilitate the design of appropriate policies and reforms.</jats:p>"

We focus on a simple two-echelon supply chain involving one retailer and two suppliers, and study the retailer’s decision on allocating orders between the suppliers. Three specific settings of information sharing by the suppliers are investigated: (i) no information shared; (ii) information partially shared; and (iii) information completely shared. After establishing corresponding ordering policy under each setting, we conduct extensive numerical analysis to simulate shocks to suppliers’ manufacturing capacity and calculate the resulting extra cost as measure of the effectiveness of information sharing. Simulation results show that with more information shared by suppliers, the retailer is able to make response to disruptions more accurately and timely, the negative impact of which thus can be reduced by larger extent, even though not completely eliminated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Introduction: </jats:bold>There exist several barriers to maternal health service utilization in developing<jats:bold> </jats:bold>countries. Most of the previous studies conducted in India have focused on demand-side barriers, while only a few have touched upon supply-side barriers. None of the previous studies in India have investigated the factors that affect maternal health care utilization at Health Sub-Centers (HSC) in India, despite the fact that these institutions, as the nearest available public healthcare facilities in rural areas, play a significant role in providing affordable maternal health care. Therefore, this study aims to examine the supply-side determinants of maternal service utilization at HSCs in rural India.</jats:p>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Data and Methods: </jats:bold>This study uses health facility data from the nationally representative<jats:bold> </jats:bold>District-Level Household Survey, which was collected in 2007–2008 to examine the effect of supply-side variables on the utilization of maternal healthcare services across HSCs in rural India. Since the dependent variables (the number of antenatal registrations, in-facility deliveries, and postnatal care services) are count variables with considerable dispersion, the data has been analyzed using negative binomial regression instead of Poisson regression.</jats:p>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The results show that those HSCs run by a contractual auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) are likely to offer a lower volume of services when compared to those run by a permanent ANM. The availability of obstetric drugs, weighing scale, blood pressure equipment is associated with the increased utilization of antenatal and postnatal services. The unavailability of labor/examination table and bed screen is associated with a reduction in the number of safe deliveries and postnatal services. The utilization of services is expected to increase if essential facilities, such as water, telephone, toilet, and electricity, are available at HSCs. Monitoring of an ANM’s work by the Village Health and Sanitation Committee (VHSC) and the in-service training of ANMs appear to have a positive impact on the utilization of services. The distance of an ANM’s actual residence from the sub-center village where she works is negatively associated with the utilization of delivery and postnatal services. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several demand-side factors.</jats:p>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> To improve maternal healthcare utilization at sub-centers, the government should<jats:bold> </jats:bold>ensure the availability of basic infrastructure, drugs, and equipment at all sub-centers. Monitoring of ANMs’ work by VHSCs could play an important role in improving healthcare utilization at the HSCs; therefore, it is important to establish VHSCs in each sub-center village. The issue of the relatively low utilization of maternity services in the HSCs that are run solely by contractual ANMs needs to be investigated further.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the frequency of supply chain disruptions rises, businesses are increasingly realizing the value of supply chain resilience. A number of efforts has been devoted to define supply chain resilience or to develop risk mitigation strategies in order to maximize supply chain resilience. However, very few scholarly work has attempted to address how supply chain resilience should be quantified. This paper is dedicated to fill this gap by proposing a general framework for evaluating supply chain resilience. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. In addition to risks, the framework also relates resilience to the supply chain’s risk prognosis capabilities, recover agility and recover time tolerance. Two example applications are used to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain design.</jats:p>",

This is achieved by having 1) a structurally fail-safe topology against rare but high magnitude stochastic events called disruptions and 2) an operationally fail-safe flow dynamic against frequent but low magnitude stochastic events called variations. A structurally fail-safe network should be robust and resilient against disruptions. Robustness and resilience respectively determine how well and how quickly disruptions are handled by the SN. Flow planning must be reliable in an operationally fail-safe supply network against variations to provide the most profitable service level to customers. We formulate the problem of designing/redesigning fail-safe supply networks as a compromise Decision Support Problem. We analyze the correlations among robustness, resilience, and profit for supply networks and propose a method for supply network managers to use when they need to find a compromise among robustness, resilience, and profit.</jats:p>",

Four scenarios of access to information on final demand for different members of the chain were developed over a system dynamics model. For each of these scenarios delivery delay times and type of demand were changed and four indicators were used to measure the supply chain performance: return on assets, accumulated income, accumulated value of inventory and service level. The results show that the location (echelon) of the access to information is critical to the performance and in contrast to previous studies, this effect is independent of the type of demand. Moreover, the results are consistent with previous studies on the positive effect of the reduction in delays on the overall performance of the chain, regardless of the type of demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In typical towing situations, all of the power needed to move the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle (trailer) is supplied by the towing vehicle. This dictates that a person who wishes to tow a trailer must have a vehicle capable of providing enough power to move both the vehicle and the trailer; if they only occasionally tow a trailer, then they either need to rent an appropriately sized vehicle or buy a larger vehicle than is dictated by their everyday needs, which has both financial and environmental consequences. However, if the trailer can provide sufficient power itself to move, then the demands on the towing vehicle are reduced. Such a trailer would be guided by the towing vehicle, but the vehicle would provide very little power to the trailer, and therefore a small car could be used for the towing task, removing the requirement to buy or rent a larger vehicle for occasional towing. This concept has been previously explored theoretically, and was found to be feasible based on dynamic models of the trailer, with the trailer powered by a DC motor; in this paper, it is investigated experimentally, on a small scale. The experiment was conducted on a 1:18 scale remote controlled (RC) car and similarly scaled powered trailer that was constructed for it. The project included the design of an appropriate trailer, integration of a load cell into the trailer hitch, and the design of an appropriate controller. The controller was implemented using National Instruments’ LabVIEW software, running on the NI myRIO controller. The LabVIEW program also saved data from the force sensor and two accelerometers, as well as the controller output to the system, for later analysis. The car was driven around with the assistance of the trailer while data was collected by the affixed sensors. The tests were conducted with different drivers, with the car driven on varying paths that included both straight driving and turns, all on a standard hard indoor floor surface. The goal of this project was to prove out the concept on a small scale, after its feasibility had been shown through modeling and theoretical calculations. The results showed that the concept is feasible and will work in practice on this small scale, although some challenges were seen. Some of these challenges were caused by the limitations of the test setup, such as limited battery capacity and limited space to mount sensors. The success of this test setup, despite these limitations, suggests that a larger-scale model should be constructed and tested, and that in practice the concept will be feasible.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer produces a basic and a premium product. If desired, a bundle of the two products might also be produced at a unit bundling cost. We allow either the manufacturer or the retailer to produce the bundle from the component products. All products, however, must be sold exclusively through the retailer. Using game theoretic models, we compare and contrast the equilibrium outcomes under retailer bundling and manufacturer bundling scenarios. We show that under manufacturer bundling, the manufacturer never offers the full product line composed of the basic product, the premium product, and the bundle, at equilibrium; while the same does not hold under retailer bundling. We show that total supply chain profit under retailer bundling weakly dominates that under manufacturer bundling and characterize the region in the parameter space where this domination is strict. We explore an extension where there is a capacity constraint in producing one or both of the component products and characterize the equilibrium outcomes. We show that unlike the infinite capacity case, offering the full product line is an equilibrium outcome under manufacturer bundling when the capacity of the premium good is limited.</jats:p>",

The first experiment was the formulation of three SBBD with similar nutrient content but differed in synchronization indexes (namely 0.36; 0.50 and 0.63). The in sacco nutrient degradability coefficient was used to calculate the synchronization index of each feedstuff. The second experiment was determination of post feeding ruminal pH, ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in sheep fed on experimental SBBD. The third experiment was determination of feed digestibility and estimation of microbial nitrogen synthesis (MNP) on the basis of excreted urinary allantoin. The alteration of dietary synchronization index did not change nutrient intake, but the digestibilities of DM, OM and CP were increased (P&lt;0.05). The post feeding ruminal pH was decreased (P&lt;0.05) but concentrations of post feeding ruminal TVFA and NH3-N, and level of BUN were increased (P&lt;0.05) by the treatment of dietary synchronization index. The treatment of dietary synchronization index improved MNP (P&lt;0.05), although dietary synchronization index at 0.63 lowered the MNP (P&lt;0.05). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study contract design and coordination of a supply chain with one supplier and one retailer, both of which are capital constrained and in need of short-term financing for their operations. Competitively priced bank loans are available, and the failure of loan repayment leads to bankruptcy, where default costs may include variable (proportional to the firm’s sales) and fixed costs. Without default costs, it is known that simple contracts (e.g., revenue-sharing, buyback, and quantity discount) can coordinate and allocate profits arbitrarily in the chain. With only variable default costs, buyback contracts remain coordinating and equivalent to revenue-sharing contracts but are Pareto dominated by revenue-sharing contracts when fixed default costs are present. Thus, for general bankruptcy costs, contracts without buyback terms are of most interest. Quantity discount contracts fail to coordinate the supply chain, since a necessary condition for coordination is to proportionally reallocate debt obligations within the channel. With only variable default costs and with high fixed default costs exhibiting substantial economies-of-scale, revenue-sharing contracts with working capital coordination continue to coordinate the chain. Unexpectedly, for fixed default costs with small economies-of-scale effects, the two-firm system under a revenue-sharing contract with working capital coordination might have higher expected profit than the one-firm system. Our results provide support for the use of revenue-sharing contracts with working capital coordination for decentralized management of supply chains when there are bankruptcy risks and default costs. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable food supply chain is required to mitigate supply chain risks, reinforce long-term supplier relationships and build stakeholder and customer trusts. It has a significant role in social welfare, political stability, and economic growth. In this research, we treated beef as a commodity, based on consideration that the demand of this commodity continues to increase in line with population growth and the needs of processed food industries. On the other hand, the supply of this commodity tends to decline. Currently beef production in Indonesia covers only about 60% of the need, i.e. the rest is imported. The beef supply chain is too long, and the demand surges during Eid festivities causing shortages of beef in the market. There is a need to design a program that is strategic and systematic to anticipate shortages of beef production as importing beef product is unable to resolve the issue. One of the problem-solving efforts that can be done is to improve supply chain management. There is a need to plan, build, and integrate aspects of \"production-distribution-consumption” at the national level by identifying the stakeholders including regions and distribution channels.  By considering the aforementioned problems, the beef supply chain can be improved with the support of simulation model to assess the existing system and to develop some scenarios to improve the system performance. We utilized system dynamics model to accommodate several key variables or parameters that have significant contribution to strategic sustainable development of food supply chain, such as changes and uncertainties in supply (caused by climate change), demand, distribution, as well as internal and external business factors. The research results show that national demand can be fulfilled through several strategic initiatives.</jats:p>"

This type of method was found to be efficient, economic and non-intrusive for pipeline condition assessment and diagnosis, but its applications so far are mainly limited to single and simple pipeline systems. This paper aims to extend the TFR-based leak detection method to relatively more complex pipeline connection situations. The branched and looped pipe junctions are firstly investigated for their influences to the system TFR, so that their effects can be characterized and separated from the effect of other components and potential leakage defects in the system. The leak-induced patterns of transient responses are derived analytically using the transfer matrix method for systems with different pipe junctions, which thereafter are used for the analysis of pipe leakage conditions in the system. The developed method is validated through different numerical experiments in this study. Based on the analytical analysis and numerical results, the applicability and accuracy as well as the limitations of the developed TFR-based leak detection method are discussed for practical applications in the paper.</jats:p>",

For each unit (e.g., truckload, shipping container) in the chain, one must decide at which speed it should be moved downstream, given the state of the system, to minimize total supply chain costs. We decompose the problem into a set of one-dimensional subproblems that can be easily solved and characterize the optimal variable speed policy: under some assumptions, we show that it is optimal to set a speed that is first increasing in the distance to the market, and then decreasing. As a result, at optimality a given unit will experience an accelerating speed and then it will be slowed down, unless a demand occurs, in which case, the speed will be adjusted upward. We finally provide a transportation case study where we estimate the benefits of a variable-speed compared to a fixed-speed policy and show them to be significant both financially and from a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-emissions perspective. </jats:p>",

More importantly, this research divides business uncertainty into four dimensions and SCI into three dimensions to examine the role of each dimension. In addition, it investigates the moderating effects of manufacturing approaches, such as push and pull, in the relationship between SCI and performance. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Through a structured survey, this study collected 259 responses from supply executives, and supply and purchasing managers of US manufacturing firms.

Among the four dimensions of business uncertainty, dynamism and hostility significantly affect implementation of internal integration, integration with suppliers, and integration with customers. In addition, manufacturing approaches, such as push and pull, have a moderating effect on the relationship between SCI and performance. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study collected survey responses from a manufacturing firm in the supply chain to assist managers to find a solution while dealing with business uncertainty through the implementation of SCI. It also emphasizes manufacturing approaches, such as push and pull, in implementing SCI to improve performance. Thus, supply and purchasing managers should consider the business uncertainty that they are dealing with while developing their supply chain strategy. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to provide meaningful insights on the effects of SCI toward dealing with business uncertainty. More importantly, by dividing the dimensions of business uncertainty and SCI, this study presents empirical evidence of the significant role of supply chain practices in uncertain business conditions. In addition, this study addresses the gap in extant literature and shows that managers need to consider their manufacturing approach in SCI to improve business performance.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Metal supply chains involves another peculiarity as most of the companies involved are bothered more about the sales volumes rather than giving attention to the improving their supply chains. Companies in this sector often tend to give more importance to product rather than customer aspirations. In order to stay competitive a business has to strengthen its supply chain so that it adds more and more value in its offerings to the customers. This is even more important as customers are increasingly demanding more value in the product they buy. This has led the businesses to make their supply chains flexible and responsive.</jats:p>"

A coordination and optimization model is built by using the downside-risk function, Cournot model and government subsidy excitation function. The effect of risk characteristics, government subsidy and Cournot competition on supply chain is analyzed, and the impact of revenue-and-expense sharing contract is studied in the channel, which shows that the contract cannot coordinate and optimize the closed-loop supply chain. Also, risk sharing contract and expense sharing contract are designed, which can offer the desired downside protection to the retailer, provide more profits to the agents, and accomplish channel coordination and optimization. Moreover, an application example is given for testing the effectiveness and feasibility of the contract, and the bound and rule of the contract parameters are given. Finally, by the analysis of numerical simulation and sensitivity of the model based on the contract, the validity and practicability of the model are verified, and the relationship between government subsidy, risk characteristics, competitive characteristics with the supply chain is obtained. This study provides decision support and decision-making reference for the development of remanufacturing industry.</jats:p>",

Moreover, they are mostly concerned with the economic dimension and, in most cases, tend to disregard the impact that water-energy loss may have on the quality of service, communication with the consumers, social awareness, water quality and environment. This paper focuses on the application of the developed and tested AWARE-P infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology to improve water-energy loss management in water supply systems, while demonstrating the main benefits from implementing an integrated approach for water losses and related energy assessment. Results show that indeed the participating iPerdas utilities were able to define tactical measures leading to a more efficient and sustainable service.</jats:p>",

An unsteady three-dimensional (3D) non-hydrostatic model is used in the present study to predict the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics in the forebay and intakes of the New Fengman Dam. The numerical model is validated using hydrodynamic data collected from a 1:120 entire physical model and 1:30 local model in the present paper. The numerical and experimental results indicate that the Stop Log Gate has no effect on warm-water withdrawal. After dam reconstruction, the reservoir release temperatures can be increased from 4.0 °C to 6.0 °C to improve the habitat of native fishes. The cancellation of the Stop Log Gate program is recommended; the old dam meets the performance objectives for temperature increase.</jats:p>",

The extraction and reuse of greywater might affect the water and sewer pipe networks by changing flow characteristics. Therefore, the research question is how much greywater can be reused without affecting the existing water and sewer pipe networks? A residential complex located in Al Ain, UAE, was investigated in this regard. Water pipe network, water consumption and sewer flow data were collected and scenario modelling was conducted using the EPANET software. It was found that 100% capture and reuse of greywater has no impact on the upstream water distribution network, but reduces the recommended design flow in the downstream sewer network. The modelling results show that about 50% of generated greywater (about 95 litres per capita per day) can be harvested without affecting the upstream and downstream water and sewer flow characteristics, respectively.</jats:p>",

The correlation predictions obtained in this study are simpler, as the effect of membrane characteristics, water recovery, and membrane washing processes on UF membrane fouling were expressed using a single parameter: the membrane blocking coefficient. Membrane filtration tests were conducted using diluted paper industry wastewater in a constant-pressure and constant-current operational mode. The effects of different operating conditions, such as water recovery and cleaning methods, and membrane characteristics, on the membrane blocking coefficient were evaluated. The predictive capability of the proposed model was excellent, according to a comparison of the experimental results and model simulations.</jats:p>",

However, there are still several problems in the construction of a WRS, such as ambiguity in the definition of water rights, weakness in the infrastructure of water rights and imperfect WRS legislation. Moreover, water rights allocation (WRA) and water rights trading (WRT), which are two core components of water rights, still have some problems that remain to be solved. The ‘Three Red Lines’, which make up the core of the SWRM, are expounded upon, and the relationship between the WRS and the SWRM is analyzed. Finally, some appropriate recommendations based on the ‘Three Red Lines’ are provided to perfect the WRS so that it is suitable for the SWRM. In this paper, we conclude that the WRS is a type of water resource management that can effectively solve the current water issues in China. Significant efforts have been made in the construction of the WRS, which has achieved remarkable success in a period of exploration and practice in China. The construction of the WRS supports sustainable social and economic development and results in harmonious relationships between humans and nature.</jats:p>",

In this study, the sap flow method was adopted to measure transpiration (T) characteristics of maize. In order to calibrate the sap flow gauge, the sap flow rate was compared to the leaf T determined by the weighing method. The sap flow value was measured per hour for 3 days and the mean of the hourly values for each day was taken as the daily value to avoid the influence of hydraulic capacitance. There was a significant linear relationship between leaf T and sap flow rate. The slope and intercept of linear regression were 0.764 and 4.944, with an R2 of 0.97 (p &amp;lt; 0.01). We also analyzed the T and ET of maize under field conditions. The T/ET of maize was 63.3% from July to September 2012. The T/ET and leaf area index had a good linear relationship. Partitioning of ET into soil evaporation (E) and T may have important implications for analyzing crop water use efficiency, evaluating the crop production potential of precipitation and optimizing field water management.</jats:p>",

This paper presents preliminary results from a machine-learning approach for using satellite imagery of nighttime lights to develop estimates of electricity reliability for western India at a finer spatial scale. We use data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) satellite together with newly-available data from networked household voltage meters. Our results point to the possibilities of this approach as well as areas for refinement. With currently available training data, we find a limited ability to detect individual outages identified by household-level measurements of electricity voltage. This is likely due to the relatively small number of individual outages observed in our preliminary data. However, we find that the approach can estimate electricity reliability rates for individual locations fairly well, with the predicted versus actual regression yielding an R2 &gt; 0.5. We also find that, despite the after midnight overpass time of the SNPP satellite, the reliability estimates derived are representative of daytime reliability.</jats:p>"

Four main characteristics of ASPs are identified: they are part of a portfolio of relationships to balance the rigidities of long-term strategic partnerships; they have project-like features; they are developed from a network of pre-qualified suppliers; they are recurring and intermittent rather than continuous or isolated one-off short-term partnerships. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The research has been carried out in the context of an Italian footwear district.

Firstly, the multi-objective simulation optimization model of reservoir operation for three scenarios, including no connection, virtual connection, and pipeline connection, are set up considering the compensation role of hydrology and the storage capacity of relevant reservoirs. Secondly, the Pareto-optimal solutions and the selected operation solutions for the three scenarios are analyzed to evaluate the benefits of the transfer project. And visual analytics is used to show and analyze the relation of the three scenarios’ Pareto-optimal solutions intuitively. Lastly, the results show building a pipeline can attain more benefits in reducing the amount of diverted water and water spills for the water supply system, but with some issues such as additional engineering cost and low utilization rate of the diversion pipeline. This study demonstrates that conducting a holistic multi-objective analysis for water transfer options can reveal the full trade-offs between competing objectives, show the relation of different scenarios’ Pareto-optimal solutions and provide support for informed decision-making on water diversion project planning.</jats:p>",

We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.</jats:p>",

Solution-processed OTFTs based on the popular polymeric semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) have been developed to rectify the 115 V AC voltage. A diode-configured OTFT was used as a half-wave rectifier. The single OTFT current supply was demonstrated to charge a 220 mF supercapacitor to 1 V directly using 115 V AC voltage as the input. This work paves the road towards all-printable supercapacitor energy-storage systems with integrated chargers, which enable direct charging from a power outlet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regulation of breathing is critical to our capacity to accommodate deficits in oxygen availability and demand during, for example, sleep and ascent to altitude. It is generally accepted that a fall in arterial oxygen increases afferent discharge from the carotid bodies to the brainstem and thus delivers increased ventilatory drive, which restores oxygen supply and protects against hypoventilation and apnoea. However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. We recently identified as critical to this process the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is key to the cell-autonomous regulation of metabolic homoeostasis. This observation is significant for many reasons, not least because recent studies suggest that the gene for the AMPK-α1 catalytic subunit has been subjected to natural selection in high-altitude populations. It would appear, therefore, that evolutionary pressures have led to AMPK being utilized to regulate oxygen delivery and thus energy supply to the body in the short, medium and longer term. Contrary to current consensus, however, our findings suggest that AMPK regulates ventilation at the level of the caudal brainstem, even when afferent input responses from the carotid body are normal. We therefore hypothesize that AMPK integrates local hypoxic stress at defined loci within the brainstem respiratory network with an index of peripheral hypoxic status, namely afferent chemosensory inputs. Allied to this, AMPK is critical to the control of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus ventilation–perfusion matching at the lungs and may also determine oxygen supply to the foetus by, for example, modulating utero-placental blood flow.</jats:p>",

Due to local and international legislation, managers are highly encouraged to seek out sustainable innovations and strategies to reduce the negative impacts of their business activities. An array of academic and practical activities has been formed around the greening of the supply chain (SC). This paper attempts to review and classify green supply chain management (GSCM) disciplines and best practices from a practical point of view. The authors also investigate the different areas of application and review the GSCM practices in some well-known companies. On this basis, the paper disclose the superiority of Apple company over the other studied cases in applying green practices, particularly in the manufacturing and design areas, while the parcel delivery company has been quite active in the green transportation and green marketing. It is also shown that all of the reviewed cases have been successful in implementing green logistics initiatives thus far.</jats:p>",

Adsorbed Parathion was then desorbed with different eluents and determined by gas chromatography (GC)/flame ionization detection. Greater selectivity, resolution, and sensitivity have been seen by GC compared with other methods. Parameters that might influence the extraction efficiency, such as the eluent type and its volume, adsorbent amount, sample volume, sample pH and sample flow rate, were optimized. Under the optimized extraction conditions with toluene as the eluent, the experimental results showed the excellent linearity of Parathion (R2 &amp;gt; 0.99) over the range of 0.01–0.8 μg/mL, and the relative standard deviation was 6.3% (n = 5). The detection limit of the proposed method could reach 0.024 ng/mL based on the ratio of chromatographic signal to base line noise (S/N = 3). Recovery of 93% was achieved with spiked water samples. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of surface water samples.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in Australia, the largest artesian basin in the world, is rich in groundwater resources. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the GAB for 2003–2014 using satellite (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE) data, hydrological models’ outputs, and in situ data. A slight increase in TWS was observed for the study period. However, there was a rapid increase in TWS in 2010 and 2011 due to two strong La Nina events. Long-term mean monthly TWS changes showed remarkable agreements with net precipitation. Both GRACE derived and in situ groundwater disclosed similar trend patterns. Groundwater estimated from the PCR-GLOBWB model contributes 26.8% (26.4% from GRACE) to the total TWS variation in the entire basin and even more than 50% in the northern regions. Surface water contributes only 3% to the whole basin but more than 60% to Lake Eyre and the Cooper River. Groundwater, especially deeper than 50 meters, was insensitive to climate factors (i.e., rainfall). Similarly, the groundwater in the northern Cape York Peninsula was influenced by some other factors rather than precipitation. The time-lagged correlation analysis between sea surface height and groundwater storage indicated certain correlations between groundwater and sea level changes.</jats:p>",

The “values” associated with these foods may be that they are locally produced, by small or mid-scale farms, or use production practices that enhance the environment. Wholesale channels that provide marketing options for small and mid-scale producers and support these values are referred to as “values-based supply chains” (VBSCs). Goals of VBSCs are to: (1) provide greater economic stability for producers and others along the supply chain; and (2) provide high quality, regional food to consumers. After a brief overview of VBSCs, we then describe three cases—a specialty food manufacturer, a natural food cooperative and a regional “food hub”—representing different entry points along the food supply chain. We analyze them regarding the common benefits of VBSCs: transparency, fair prices to farmers and ease of purchasing from small and mid-scale producers. We conclude with common themes that emerge for VBSCs of the future and what it will take to strengthen them within regional food systems.</jats:p>"

This article provides insight into sources and quantification of risk, which can restrict food operations and supply chain performance. Certainly, risks imposed by today's constantly changing global environment makes it imperative for food and agribusiness firms to develop purposeful proactive and predictive risk management for their global supply chains. We proposed the analytic hierarchy process (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AHP</jats:styled-content>) model to analyze sources of risks attached to the focal firm's global food operations and supply chain. The identified risks were from a review of relevant literature, expert opinions from the focal firm supply chain C‐level executive, and consultants in the food industry. We grouped the identified risks into seven categories and discussed the risk mitigation strategies. We validated the proposed model using a case study involving a focal food and agribusiness firm with global presence. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Literature acknowledges its contribution to the development of sustainable cities. The dimension and extent of this contribution depends significantly on the particular form and function of urban agriculture. However, the complexity of interests and dimensions is insufficiently covered by theory. This paper proposes a typology for urban agriculture, supporting both theory building and practical decision processes. We reviewed and mapped the diversity of the types of agriculture found along three beneficial dimensions (self-supply, socio-cultural, commercial) for product distribution scale and actors. We distinguish between ideal types, subtypes and mixed types. Our intention is to include a dynamic perspective in the typology of urban agricultural land use because transition processes between types are observable due to the existence of complex motivations and influences. In a pilot study of 52 urban agriculture initiatives in Germany, we tested the validity of the typology and discussed it with stakeholders, proving novelty and relevance for profiling discussions.</jats:p>"

In particular product acquisition processes are characterised by poor value appropriation and provide a limited service to households. This is supported by the householder survey that finds poor satisfaction levels with most recycling channels. PLS path modelling tested hypotheses that each of the four constructs (attitudes, subjective norm, perceived control and sense of duty) are significant determinants of “intention to plan to recycle”. Having tested for various possible meditating effects, sense of duty was found to act as a precursor to attitude. In this model all other constructs were significant determinants of intention to recycle garments. Thus the study highlights the role of “sense of duty” in attitude formation, a key determinant of intention to recycle garments. This highlights the importance of adherence to sustainable practices and the need for associated governance and regulation. Subjective norm points to the impact of a range of people, including experts.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Developing biomass-based power generation is helpful for China to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and to release the targets of carbon emission peak. The decentralized farming method leads to Chinese farmers’ weak willingness to collect and sell crop residues to biomass-based power plants. The purpose of this paper is to solve the issue by proposing a novel biomass feedstock supply model with China’s rural official organization—villagers’ committee, which has great influence on villagers’ decision making. Introducing it into the biomass-based power supply chain is beneficial to motivating farmers’ supplying enthusiasm. A combined game theory and agent-based simulation approach is applied to study the effectiveness of this new supply model. Multiple simulation scenarios are built to study impacts of different simulation parameters, and results show that farmers tend to supply more biomass material for electricity production in the proposed villagers’ committee model, compared with the two conventional supply models, direct-deal and broker models. The supply model incorporating the rural official organization can ensure the feedstock sufficiency for plants. A proper model design depends on the feed-in tariff subsidy for biomass-based electricity, feedstock shipping distance, performance appraisal system of the villagers’ committee, as well as farmers’ utility weights on net income and public service improvement.</jats:p>"

This is the first part of a two-part article discussing labour standards in China. Although some private rule-making institutions have increased their governance role in a cross-border regulatory scenario, a more viable governance regime is still arguably perceived as a national rather than a global phenomenon. Given the ineffective enforcement of labour standards in China, some authoritative standards, like the United Nations Tri-Pillar Framework, hold the keys to an emerging internationally recognized regime for global labour governance. It remains a challenge to strike a balance between hard law and soft law, so as to ensure multinational companies’ (MNCs’) profit maximization and the protection of human rights. With an examination of counter-conventional approaches to legal pluralism and globalized supply chains, it is proposed that more multipronged forms of governance may incentivize foreign MNCs to improve labour practices across various governance levels. MNCs will need to operate beyond merely abiding by Chinese law, and contribute more by self-regulation along with other stakeholders in the implementation of human rights standards.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Some of the highest power amplifier efficiency figures are reported by envelope tracking (ET) amplifiers. These amplifiers can generate strong higher-order harmonics, which can lead to interference with receivers operating at the harmonic frequencies. Using non-linear interference cancellation, we can help to remove the interference being caused in those receivers. This paper looks at the problem of modeling the third and second-order harmonic emission from an ET amplifier. It derives the non-linear kernel for estimating such interference. This kernel has been rigorously expanded to show its correlation with the various harmonics and its effectiveness in predicting the harmonic content. We then set up an envelope amplifier test-bench to capture harmonic signal content and cancel it using the derived kernel model. The experiment yields excellent agreement with theory and provides a validation of the system and concept.</jats:p>",

A comprehensive consideration of the social, economic and environmental benefits of water was made in the evaluation index system of WUE and the projection pursuit model combined with chaotic particle swarm optimization was adopted to calculate the comprehensive indicator of WUE. The Huai River Basin (HRB) was selected as a case study area. The temporal change of WUE showed that the annual WUE of the HRB from 2007 to 2013 increased obviously because of the enhanced emphasis on environmental protection by the government. The spatial results showed that the spatial WUE of each province in 2013 was significantly higher than in 2007. In 2013, Anhui with the lowest WUE was selected as representative to reveal the problems of water use in the HRB. The main reasons were that the government paid more attention to the high water consumption industries and ignored the small-scale water users, and wastewater treatment was still weak in the HRB. The research can provide the foundation for improving WUE and solving the problem of water shortages.</jats:p>",

We propose an approach to assess the value of component commonality by simultaneously optimizing product design (i.e., component commonality) and supply chain decisions including supplier selection (replenishment lead time) and inventory policy. The proposed approach is illustrated in motor commonality decisions for electric bicycles. The optimum component commonality and supply chain decisions are investigated under various conditions including different demand variabilities, component costs, inventory tracking costs, and inventory ordering costs.</jats:p>",

We then review the practices, and evaluate the effectiveness, of countries and international bodies that have already implemented such SC management and planning systems to assist in their defence activities’ decisions. Then, we illustrate the literature review with specific modern day examples of military deployment. Although many countries have invested in IT systems which may provide up to date information and cost-effectiveness suggestions, nevertheless, the utility of these systems in the defence sector, seems to be often surrounded by emotions and private or vested interests. Our research thus far suggests that there are substantial benefits to be gained by adopting a relevant decision framework to be implemented among military activities.

To do so, this paper investigates the value addition relationships of different supply chain players from farm to retail level. Based on extensive literature review and deep discussions with supply chain practitioners as well as academicians, a conceptual framework is developed to assist those players in identifying the importance of adding value, defining a common definition of value addition practices, and getting motivation for superior value addition improvement. Value addition practices of five stages at the food supply chain, namely, farmer, supplier, processor, distributor and retailer, are conceptualized and formulated to tests the relationship among these stages. The study mainly focuses on the value addition of farm products in Indian scenario. The findings affirmed that the farmer's value addition is positively related to supplier's value addition, processor's value addition, and distributor's value addition. Moreover, supplier's value addition is positively related to processor's value addition, and processor's value addition is positively related to distributor's value addition. Besides, distributor's value addition is positively related to retailer's value addition. [JEL Classification: M210].</jats:p>",

Reservoirs are anthropogenically-dominated ecosystems because hydropower operations induce artificial water level fluctuations (WLF) that exceed natural fluctuations in frequency and amplitude. These WLF have detrimental ecological effects, which can be quantified as losses to ecosystem primary production due to lake bottoms that fall dry. To allow for a sustainable development of hydropower, these “ecological costs” of WLF need to be weighed against the “economic benefits” of hydropower that can balance and store intermittent renewable energy. We designed an economic hydropower operation model to derive WLF in large and small reservoirs for three different future energy market scenarios and quantified the according losses in ecosystem primary production in semi-natural outdoor experiments. Our results show that variations in market conditions affect WLF differently in small and large hydropower reservoirs and that increasing price volatility magnified WLF and reduced primary production. Our model allows an assessment of the trade-off between the objectives of preserving environmental resources and economic development, which lies at the core of emerging sustainability issues.</jats:p>"

In his classic ethnography, Bronislaw Malinowski (1922) describes how the two most highly ranked valuables were exchanged. In 1915–18, these valuables were Conus armshells and shell bead necklaces, but in 1855 this was not the case. When prehistory merged into history on Woodlark Island, it was circular boar's tusks rather than Conus armshells that were exchanged for shell necklaces. To understand how one prime valuable replaced another, it was necessary to look more broadly at changes in kula valuables since 1855. The study covers circular boar's tusks, Conus armshells, shell bead necklaces and ceremonial stone axes. Assemblages of these artefacts were assembled from examples in museum collections, historical photographs and documents. While Malinowski's ethnography captured the kula as it operated in 1915–18, this study demonstrates that it has been a constantly evolving exchange system.</jats:p>",

In this study, the effects of UV and persulfate separately and also in combination were investigated on B. subtilis spore inactivation. Central composite design and response surface methodology were used to optimize target microorganism reduction. Contact time, initial pH, and persulfate dosage were considered as input experimental variables. Based on the design of the experiments, first and second order response surface models have been developed to correspond to the output response of B. subtilis spore reduction. It can be concluded that microbial reduction by UV alone was more effective than persulfate, while the combined UV/persulfate process demonstrated the highest log reduction (4.1) under the following optimal conditions: 60 min contact time, pH = 7.8, and persulfate dosage of 30 mM. On the other hand, the optimal condition for UV treatment was a contact time of 60 min at a pH of 5.0, which led to a 3.19 log spore inactivation. Consequently, the UV/persulfate system can be introduced as an alternative disinfectant for the inactivation of B. subtilis spores.</jats:p>",

This temporal and locational flexibility of work (TLF) is often seen as a means to facilitate the combination of work and private life. As such it has been recommended as a policy to increase the average number of working hours of part-time workers. To the best of our knowledge, the effectiveness of this policy instrument has not been tested empirically yet. We therefore analyse whether flexi-time and telehomework arrangements increase the number of actual, contracted, and preferred working hours. Based on Dutch household panel data, our results indicate that the link between TLF and working hours is quite weak. Telehomework is associated with moderate increases in actual hours, but not in contracted or preferred hours. Flexi-time generally does not seem to be associated with an increase in hours worked. Despite positive effects on job satisfaction and working time fit, we do not find any convincing evidence of a positive effect of TLF on labour supply.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>JEL classification:</jats:bold> J22, J32, M52, M54</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates whether money supply cycles in Canada, United Kingdom, and United States affect tourism demand cycles for Aruba and Barbados. Money supply data are, generally, more easily available than business cycle data (gross domestic product) and have the potential to influence tourism demand cycles. The study contributes to the literature by presenting an economically detailed and sophisticated approach for further understanding the dynamics of tourism demand, using money supply cycles as the explanatory factor. In addition, the study advances the theory through new propositions. The methodology involves data decomposition together with unit root, cointegration, and causality testing. The results show that money supply cycles can impact the cyclical movements of tourism demand and that the impacts are asymmetric, depending on the stage of development of the cycles. These findings implicate the need for adequate policies to counter expected tourism performances below their trend. </jats:p>",

This research was motivated by the need to map the landscape of research themes, identify potential overlapping areas and interactions, and provide guidelines on areas of focus for researchers to pursue. We conducted a three‐phase research study, beginning with an open‐ended collection of opinions on research themes collected from 102 supply chain management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCM</jats:styled-content>) researchers, followed by an evaluation of a consolidated list of themes by 141 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCM</jats:styled-content> researchers. These results were then reviewed by 10 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCM</jats:styled-content> scholars.

This study was carried in Rungwe District, Mbeya region in Tanzania, to determine trends, extent and drivers of adoption of SRC; identify various sources of household energy and assess the contribution of SRC to the total household fuelwood needs, and trees and shrub species used as sources of fuelwood. Data were collected using reconnaissance, field and social surveys and was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results revealed that, 97.5% of local community adopted the SRC technology since 1960s. Eucalyptus spp. are mostly planted in woodlots and field boundaries while Persea americana and Leucaena leucocephala are intercropped in farmlands. The survey indicated that out of 176 tons of fuelwood used annually, 73% comes from SRC technology, 25% from non-SRC technology, and only 2% is purchased to supplement household fuelwood shortage. Local communities depend heavily on biomass energy from woodlots and farmlands where tree species like Eucalyptus spp. plays a key role in meeting the energy demand. This study demonstrates that SRC technologies like woodlots, boundary planting, and intercropping in farmland hold high promise to meet the household energy demand. If promoted and backed with strong policies and supportive land tenure, these technologies may reduce the harvesting pressure on native forests for energy demand and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.Int.

Yet, these communities do not seem to receive the same attention as those building new systems. The purpose of this article is to reveal and diagnose the determinant factors of service failures and to propose mitigation measures to the rural water supply in Ethiopia. The study is conducted through a literature review and field discussions with experts ( n = 48) and artisans ( n = 35), who have been involved in the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the systems. Moreover, failed schemes ( n = 20) were visited, and discussions were held with village elders of each water point. The findings indicate that lack of uniformity of implementation approaches, and institutional and organizational incapability of the local government aggravate the service failures. The further capacity building, institutionalization, and improving remuneration of employees are likely to reduce the problems substantially. </jats:p>",

The result showed that 25.5% of As(III) was removed using diatomite only but more than 95% of As(III) was removed using nZVI-D, at the same contact time of 60 min and pH 6. The experimental isotherm data for As(III) adsorption at different initial concentrations were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich equations. Among these three, the equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm. The kinetic adsorption was also studied using the pseudo-first, second-order, and intraparticle diffusion equations. The data were well explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. From the results of kinetic adsorption and the adsorption isotherm, it can be concluded that arsenite adsorption was controlled by the mass transfer and adsorption process.</jats:p>",

In view of the increasing significance of market disruptions in industries, in this paper, we review a selection of related papers that focus on market disruptions in the supply chain. We classify the literature into three aspects, namely, demand disruption, supply disruption, and supply chain disruption risk. We review the representative operational models in each aspect. We derive insights into the current state of knowledge in each area. We suggest three future research directions: (a) Can supply chain structure help reduce disruption risk? (b) How does information asymmetry influence the supply chain in the presence of disruption? (c) How does social welfare vary in the presence of disruption? In conclusion, this paper provides up‐to‐date information to both researchers and practitioners to better identify, manage, and control market disruptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the industrial background of dual-channel, volatility in demand of consumers, we use the theory of bifurcations and numerical simulation tools to investigate the dynamic pricing game in a dual-channel supply chain with risk-averse behavior and incomplete information. Due to volatility of demand of consumers, we consider all the players in the supply chain are risk-averse. We assume there exist Bertrand game and Manufacturers’ Stackelberg in the chain which are closer to reality. The main objective of the paper is to investigate the complex influence of the decision parameters such as wholesale price adjustment speed, risk preference and service value on stability of the risk-averse supply chain and average utilities of all the players. We lay emphasis on the influence of chaos on average utilities of all the players which did not appear in previous studies. The dynamic phenomena, such as the bifurcation, chaos and sensitivity to initial values are analyzed by 2D bifurcation phase portraits, Double Largest Lyapunov exponent, basins of attraction and so on. The study shows that the manufacturers should slow down their wholesale price adjustment speed to get more utilities, if the manufacturers are willing to take on more risk, they will get more profits, but they must keep their wholesale prices in a certain range in order to maintain the market stability.</jats:p>",

Biomass represents a promising renewable resource for bioenergy, since it has the potential to reduce GHG emissions from various industry sectors. In spite of the potential benefits, biomass is limited due to logistical challenges of collection and transport to bio-refineries. This study proposes a forest biomass-to-bio-oil mixed supply chain network to reduce the GHG emissions compared to a conventional bioenergy supply chain. The mixed supply chain includes mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation. Life cycle assessment is conducted for a case study in the Pacific Northwest with the assistance of available life cycle inventory data for biomass-to-bio-oil supply chain. Impact assessment, on a global warming potential (GWP) basis, is conducted with the assistance of databases within SimaPro 8 software. Sensitivity analysis for the case investigated indicates that using the mixed supply chain can reduce GHG emissions by 2–5% compared to the traditional supply chain.</jats:p>",

Small hibernators such as dormice have ∼50% higher maximum longevity than non-hibernators. Increased longevity could theoretically be due to prolonged torpor directly slowing cellular damage and RTL shortening. However, although mitosis is arrested in mammals at low body temperatures, recent evidence points to accelerated RTL shortening during periodic re-warming (arousal) from torpor. Therefore, we hypothesized that these arousals during hibernation should have a negative effect on RTL. Here, we show that RTL was shortened in all animals over the course of ∼1 year, during which dormice hibernated for 7.5–11.4 months. The rate of periodic arousals, rather than the time spent euthermic during the hibernation season, was the best predictor of RTL shortening. This finding points to negative effects on RTL of the transition from low torpor to high euthermic body temperature and metabolic rate during arousals, possibly because of increased oxidative stress. The animals were, however, able to elongate their telomeres during the active season, when food availability was increased by supplemental feeding in a year of low natural food abundance. We conclude that in addition to their energetic costs, periodic arousals also lead to accelerated cellular damage in terms of RTL shortening. Although dormice are able to counteract and even over-compensate for the negative effects of hibernation, restoration of RTL appears to be energetically costly.</jats:p>",

Within urban networks, local decentralized micro-hydropower plants (MHPs) may be inserted in the regional electricity grid or used for self-consumption at the local grid level. Nevertheless, such networks are complex and the quantification of the potential for micro-hydropower other than that achieved by replacing pressure reducing valves (PRVs) is difficult. In this work, a methodology to quantify the potential for hydropower based on the excess energy in a network is proposed and applied to a real case. A constructive solution is presented based on the use of a novel micro-turbine for energy conversion, the five blade tubular propeller (5BTP). The location of the MHP within the network is defined with an optimization algorithm that maximizes the net present value after 20 years of operation. These concepts are tested for the WSS in the city of Fribourg, Switzerland. The proposed solution captures 10% of the city’s energy potential and represents an economic interest. The results confirm the location of PRVs as potential sites for energy recovery and stress the need for careful sensitivity analysis of the consumption. Finally, an expedited method is derived to estimate the costs and energy that one 5BTP can produce in a given network.</jats:p>"

Desalinated seawater and wastewater are relatively reliable but expensive. Water from natural resources like reservoirs is generally cheaper but climate sensitive. We propose combining the operation of a reservoir and seawater and wastewater desalination plants for an overall system that is less vulnerable to scarcity and uncertainty, while constraining total cost. The joint system is modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem with the double objectives of minimizing risk and vulnerability, subject to a minimum limit on resilience. The joint model is applied to two cases, one based on the climate and demands of a location in India and the other of a location in California. The results for the Indian case indicate that it is possible for the joint system to reduce risk and vulnerability to zero given a budget increase of 20–120% under current climate conditions and 30–150% under projected future conditions. For the Californian case, this would require budget increases of 20–80% and 30–140% under current and future conditions, respectively. Further, our analysis shows a two‐way interaction between the reservoir and desalination plants where the optimal operation of the former is just as much affected by the latter as the latter by the former. This highlights the importance of an integrated management approach. This study contributes to a greater quantitative understanding of desalination as a redundancy measure for adapting water supply infrastructures for a future of greater scarcity and uncertainty.</jats:p>",

However, with growing populations, global warming and contamination due to human activity, it is one that is increasingly under threat. It is hoped that nature can inspire the creation of materials to aid in the supply and management of water, from water collection and purification to water source clean-up and rehabilitation from oil contamination. Many species thrive in even the driest places, with some surviving on water harvested from fog. By studying these species, new materials can be developed to provide a source of fresh water from fog for communities across the globe. The vast majority of water on the Earth is in the oceans. However, current desalination processes are energy-intensive. Systems in our own bodies have evolved to transport water efficiently while blocking other molecules and ions. Inspiration can be taken from such to improve the efficiency of desalination and help purify water containing other contaminants. Finally, oil contamination of water from spills or the fracking technique can be a devastating environmental disaster. By studying how natural surfaces interact with liquids, new techniques can be developed to clean up oil spills and further protect our most precious resource.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the themed issue ‘Bioinspired hierarchically structured surfaces for green science’.</jats:p>",

To ensure the consumer’s health and safety, it is essential to develop an efficient system which can address these critical social issues in the food distribution networks. This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the agricultural food to prevent the distribution of hazardous and adulterated food products. The different aspects regarding implementation of the proposed system in food chains are analyzed and a feasible integrated solution is proposed. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated and finally, a comprehensive analysis of the proposed ePedigree system’s impact on the social sustainability in terms of consumer health and safety is presented.</jats:p>"

These scales, including calcium and ferric oxide precipitations, can cause heat transfer problems. A non-phosphorus water treatment agent APES/AA/AMPS was synthesized by acrylic acid (AA), ammonium allylpolyethoxy sulphate (APES) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) with the solution of ammonium persulfate as an initiator. The properties of scale inhibition and dispersion of water treatment agent APES/AA/AMPS were studied by using the commonly used standard test methods. The results showed that APES/AA/AMPS had excellent scale inhibition and dispersion performance. The performance of APES/AA/AMPS on strontium sulfate was 93.3% at the dosage of 9 mg·L−1. When the concentration was 4 mg·L−1, the dispersion of iron oxide was optimal according to the solution transmittance of 13.7%. The morphology and crystallinity changes of strontium sulfate in scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction showed that the mechanism of the inhibition on strontium sulfate is adsorption.</jats:p>",

This study analyzed and predicted their resources base and potential, development and utilization and their world's and China's supply and demand situation in the future 20 years.</jats:p><jats:p>The supply and demand of these six bulk mineral products are generally balanced, with a slight surplus, which will guarantee the stability of the international mineral commodity market supply. The six mineral resources (especially iron ores and copper ores) are abundant and have a great potential, and their development and utilization scale will gradually increase. Till the end of 2014, the reserve‐production ratio of iron, copper, bauxite, lead, zinc ores and potassium salt was 95 years, 42 years, 100 years, 17 years, 37 years and 170 years, respectively. Except lead ores, the other five types all have reserve‐production ratio exceeding 20 years, indicative of a high resources guarantee degree. If the utilization of recycled metals is counted in, the supply of the world's six mineral products will exceed the demand in the future twenty years. In 2015–2035, the supply of iron ores, refined copper, primary aluminum, refined lead, zinc and potassium salt will exceed their demand by 0.4–0.7 billion tons (Gt), 5.0–6.0 million tons (Mt), 1.1–8.9 Mt, 1.0–2.0 Mt, 1.2–2.0 Mt and 4.8–5.6 Mt, respectively. It is predicted that there is no problem with the supply side of bulk mineral products such as iron ores, but local or structural shortage may occur because of geopolitics, monopoly control, resources nationalism and trade friction.</jats:p><jats:p>Affected by China's compressed industrialized development model, the demand of iron ores (crude steel), potassium salt, refined lead, refined copper, bauxite (primary aluminum) and zinc will gradually reach their peak in advance. The demand peak of iron ores (crude steel) will reach around 2015, 2016 for potassium salt, 2020 for refined lead, 2021 for bauxite (primary aluminum), 2022 for refined copper and 2023 for zinc. China's demand for iron ores (crude steel), bauxite (primary aluminum) and zinc in the future 20 years will decline among the world's demand, while that for refined copper, refined lead and potassium salt will slightly increase. The demand for bulk mineral products still remains high. In 2015–2035, China's accumulative demand for iron ores (crude steel) will be 20.313 Gt (13.429 Gt), 0.304 Gt for refined copper, 2.466 Gt (0.616 Gt) of bauxite (primary aluminum), 0.102 Gt of refined lead, 0.138 Gt of zinc and 0.157 Gt of potassium salt, and they account for the world's YOY (YOY) accumulative demand of 35.17%, 51.09%, 48.47%, 46.62%, 43.95% and 21.84%, respectively. This proportion is 49.40%, 102.52%, 87.44%, 105.65%, 93.62% and 106.49% of that in 2014, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>From the supply side of China's bulk mineral resources, it is forecasted that the accumulative supply of primary (mine) mineral products in 2015–2035 is 4.046 Gt of iron ores, 0.591 Gt of copper, 1.129 Gt of bauxite, 63.661 Mt of (mine) lead, 0.109 Gt of (mine) zinc and 0.128 Gt of potassium salt, which accounts for 8.82%, 13.92%, 26.67%, 47.09%, 33.04% and 15.56% of the world's predicted YOY production, respectively. With the rapid increase in the smelting capacity of iron and steel and alumina, the rate of capacity utilization for crude steel, refined copper, alumina, primary aluminum and refined lead in 2014 was 72.13%, 83.63%, 74.45%, 70.76% and 72.22%, respectively. During 2000–2014, the rate of capacity utilization for China's crude steel and refined copper showed a generally fluctuating decrease, which leads to an insufficient supply of primary mineral products. It is forecasted that the supply insufficiency of iron ores in 2015–2035 is 17.44 Gt, 0.245 Gt of copper in copper concentrates, 1.337 Gt of bauxite, 38.44 Mt of lead in lead concentrates and 29.19 Mt of zinc in zinc concentrates. China has gradually raised the utilization of recycled metals, which has mitigated the insufficient supply of primary metal products to some extent. It is forecasted that in 2015–2035 the accumulative utilization amount of steel scrap (iron ores) is 3.27 Gt (5.08 Gt), 70.312 Mt of recycled copper, 0.2 Gt of recycled aluminum, 48 Mt of recycled lead and 7.7 Mt of recycled zinc.</jats:p><jats:p>The analysis on the supply and demand situation of China's bulk mineral resources in 2015–2035 suggests that the supply‐demand contradiction for these six types of mineral products will decrease, indicative of a generally declining external dependency. If the use of recycled metal amount is counted in, the external dependency of China's iron, copper, bauxite, lead, zinc and potassium salt will be 79%, 65%, 26%, 8%, 16% and 18% in 2014, respectively. It is predicted that this external dependency will decrease to 62%, 64%, 20%, −0.93%, 16% and 14% in 2020, respectively, showing an overall decreasing trend.</jats:p><jats:p>We propose the following suggestions correspondingly. (1) The demand peak of China's crude steel and potassium salt will reach during 2015–2023 in succession. Mining transformation should be planned and deployed in advance to deal with the arrival of this demand peak. (2) The supply‐demand contradiction of China's bulk mineral resources will mitigate in the future 20 years, and the external dependency will decrease accordingly. It is suggested to adjust the mineral resources management policies according to different minerals and regions, and regulate the exploration and development activities. (3) China should further establish and improve the forced mechanism of resolving the smelting overcapacity of steel, refined copper, primary aluminum, lead and zinc to really achieve the goal of “reducing excess production capacity”. (4) In accordance with the national strategic deployment of “One Belt One Road”, China should encourage the excess capacity of steel, copper, alumina and primary aluminum enterprises to transfer to those countries or areas with abundant resources, high energy matching degree and relatively excellent infrastructure. Based on the national conditions, mining condition and geopolitics of the resources countries, we will gradually build steel, copper, aluminum and lead‐zinc smelting bases, and potash processing and production bases, which will promote the excess capacity to transfer to the overseas orderly. (5) It is proposed to strengthen the planning and management of renewable resources recycling and to construct industrial base of renewable metal recycling. (6) China should promote the comprehensive development and utilization of paragenetic and associated mineral species to further improve the comprehensive utilization of bulk mineral resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The supply of nitrate to surface waters plays a crucial role in maintaining marine life. Physical processes at the mesoscale (~10–100 km) and smaller scale have been advocated to provide a major fraction of the global supply. While observational studies have focused on well‐defined features, such as isolated eddies, the vertical circulation and nutrient supply in a typical 100–200 km square of ocean will involve a turbulent spectrum of interacting, evolving, and decaying features. A crucial step in closing the ocean nitrogen budget is to be able to rank the importance of mesoscale fluxes against other sources of nitrate for surface waters for a representative area of open ocean. While this has been done using models, the vital observational equivalent is still lacking. To illustrate the difficulties that prevent us from putting a global estimate on the significance of the mesoscale observationally, we use data from a cruise in the Iceland Basin where vertical velocity and nitrate observations were made simultaneously at the same high spatial resolution. Local mesoscale nitrate flux is found to be an order of magnitude greater than that due to small‐scale vertical mixing and exceeds coincident nitrate uptake rates and estimates of nitrate supply due to winter convection. However, a nonzero net vertical velocity for the region introduces a significant bias in regional estimates of the mesoscale vertical nitrate transport. The need for synopticity means that a more accurate estimate cannot be simply found by using a larger survey area. It is argued that time series, rather than spatial surveys, may be the best means to quantify the contribution of mesoscale processes to the nitrate budget of the surface ocean.</jats:p>",

To achieve a better performance, the base current of BJT is injected to a small segment of resistor string to flatten the temperature variation, and a pre-regulator of the power supply is implemented to improve the PSRR. The circuits, designed in 0.18[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m BCD technology, exhibit an average voltage of 1.212[Formula: see text]V with temperature coefficient of 2.0[Formula: see text]ppm/[Formula: see text] in the range from [Formula: see text] to 110[Formula: see text] at typical condition, and a power supply rejection ratio of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB at low frequency. After 4-bit trimming, Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed design gets an accuracy of 0.29%, with a variation of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]mV. The active design area is 160[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m, and the power supply current is about 8.2[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]A. </jats:p>",

The purpose is to give supply chain managers a tool for decision making that is not only based on reducing costs (maximizing profit) but also focuses on environmental protection and social responsibility. Using the weighted-sum approach with weights setting by the analytic hierarchy process, the model is solved by normalization of the minima of the three objectives. A numerical example is presented to test the model. This article has developed a multi-objective model for multi-modes of production facilities. The results show that the developed model for optimizing supply chain improved supply chain sustainability. A new multi-dimension perspective for optimizing supply chain will help experts improve their insights, ideas to have a sustainable supply chain. </jats:p>",

Soil samples were collected every 30 days for 120 days to characterize the trace elements Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu and Ni. There was leaching of Pb, Cd and Ni in the Ultisol, while the T2 treatment was the most recommended to prevent contamination of groundwater.</jats:p>",

Objetivo: analizar antecedentes en perspectiva de la gestión integral del suministro de los medicamentos antirretrovirales, con el in de contribuir a mejorar la calidad de vida del paciente. Materiales y Métodos: estudio cualitativo retrospectivo con enfoque hermenéutico, en una institución prestadora de salud de la ciudad de Medellín en el año 2013. Se realizó una revisión y análisis de los protocolos del sistema de gestión de la calidad de la institución en estudio, conforme a la normatividad vigente. A su vez, se hizo un diario de campo junto con observación no participante a los procesos que se ejecutan en las categorías de Inspección, Vigilancia y Control. Principalmente, se llevó a cabo un análisis estadístico del seguimiento fármaco-terapéutico mediante el coeiciente de Spearman. Resultados: se encontró que la gestión del suministro de los antirretrovirales en general se cumple conforme a las normas. No obstante, se halló que el seguimiento fármaco-terapéutico a cada uno de los pacientes que asisten a la institución es deiciente. Se evidenció que en el primer trimestre del año 2013 97,5% de los pacientes tratados con antirretrovirales, no le hicieron seguimiento fármaco-terapéutico en conformidad a la normatividad vigente y a lo establecido por los protocolos. Conclusión: se requiere mejorar y fortalecer el servicio de atención farmacéutico, liderado por profesionales suicientes y capacitados, que implementen otro seguimiento fármaco-terapéutico holístico, sistemático y permanente.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article integrates the company operations decisions (i.e. location, production, inventory, distribution, and transportation) and finance decisions (i.e. cash, accounts payable and receivable, debt, securities, payment delays, and discounts) in which the demands and return rate are uncertain, defined by a set of scenarios. The cash flow and budgeting model will be coupled with supply chain network design using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The article evaluates two financial criteria, that is, the change in equity and the profit as objective functions. The results indicate that objective functions are partially interdependent, that is, they conflict in certain parts. This fact illustrates the inadequacy of treating process operations and finances in isolated environments and pursuing objective myopic performance indicators such as profit or cost. Due to the importance of the supply chain network design problem, a multi-objective robust optimization with the max–min version is extended to cope with the uncertainty. A solution approach integrating Benders’ decomposition method with the scenario relaxation algorithm is also proposed in this research. The improved algorithm has been applied to solve a number of numerical experiments. All results illustrate significant improvement in computation time of the improved algorithm over existing approaches. For a problem, the proposed algorithm shows a significant reduction in computational time compared with the Benders’ decomposition and scenario relaxation that shows the efficiency of the proposed solution method. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As new markets, technologies and economies evolve in the low carbon bioeconomy, forest logging residue, a largely untapped renewable resource will play a vital role. The feedstock can however be variable depending on plant species and plant part component. This heterogeneity can influence the physical, chemical and thermochemical properties of the material, and thus the final yield and quality of products. Although it is challenging to control compositional variability of a batch of feedstock, it is feasible to monitor this heterogeneity and make the necessary changes in process parameters. Such a system will be a first step towards optimization, quality assurance and cost-effectiveness of processes in the emerging biofuel/chemical industry. The objective of this study was therefore to qualitatively classify forest logging residue made up of different plant parts using both near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) together with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Forest logging residue harvested from several Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) plantations in Alabama, USA, were classified into three plant part components: clean wood, wood and bark and slash (i.e., limbs and foliage). Five-fold cross-validated linear discriminant functions had classification accuracies of over 96% for both NIRS and FTIRS based models. An extra factor/principal component (PC) was however needed to achieve this in FTIRS modeling. Analysis of factor loadings of both NIR and FTIR spectra showed that, the statistically different amount of cellulose in the three plant part components of logging residue contributed to their initial separation. This study demonstrated that NIR or FTIR spectroscopy coupled with PCA and LDA has the potential to be used as a high throughput tool in classifying the plant part makeup of a batch of forest logging residue feedstock. Thus, NIR/FTIR could be employed as a tool to rapidly probe/monitor the variability of forest biomass so that the appropriate online adjustments to parameters can be made in time to ensure process optimization and product quality.</jats:p>"

To assess regional water supply security under changing water supply and demand condition in strongly human-impacted area, an integrated water resources management model that fully incorporates water demand prediction, optimal water resources allocation and water supply risk analysis is proposed and applied in the mid-lower reach of Hanjiang River basin. The model is run under three scenarios considering increasing water demand and expanding water diversion projects, and then spatial and temporal distributions of water supply reliability and vulnerability are evaluated. Results show that water supply risk in the mid-lower reach of Hanjiang River basin, especially units that take water directly from the mainstream, will be gradually enlarged in the future due to the expansions of both water demand and inter-basin water diversion capacity. The proposed method provides a practical approach towards more robust decision-making of long-term water resources planning and management under changing environment.</jats:p>"

Continually upgraded and expanded geodetic technology has been used to record the 1978 Asal rifting event and postdiking deformation. In light of recent results obtained for the Manda Hararo‐Dabbahu rifting event (2005–2010), we propose that the horizontal and vertical geodetic data can be modeled with a double source, involving a dike‐like inflation component aligned along the rift axis and a spherical pressure source located at midsegment below the Fieale caldera. By revisiting the codiking data, we propose that the reservoir below Fieale could have fed, at least partially, the 1978 injection and the contemporaneous Ardoukôba eruption and potentially induced local subsidence due to magma draining out of the central reservoir. As an alternative to previously proposed viscoelastic relaxation models, we reinterpret postdiking observations using a purely elastic rheology. We determine the relative contribution of a midsegment reservoir inflation and a dike‐like opening component, together with their respective time evolutions. Our results suggest that interactions between steadily accumulating tectonic strain and temporal variations in melt supply to the shallow magma plumbing system below the AG Rift may entirely explain the geodetic observations and that viscoelastic deformation processes played a minor role in the 30 years following the 1978 rifting event.</jats:p>",

While sustainably managing marine ecosystems contributes to building climate resilience, these solutions require transformation of ocean governance. Recent studies and international initiatives suggest that conserving high seas biodiversity and fish stocks will have ecological and economic benefits; however, implications for seafood security under climate change have not been examined. Here, we apply global‐scale mechanistic species distribution models to 30 major straddling fish stocks to show that transforming high seas fisheries governance could increase resilience to climate change impacts. By closing the high seas to fishing or cooperatively managing its fisheries, we project that catches in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">exclusive economic zones (EEZ</jats:styled-content>s) would likely increase by around 10% by 2050 relative to 2000 under climate change (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5), compensating for the expected losses (around −6%) from ‘business‐as‐usual’. Specifically, high seas closure increases the resilience of fish stocks, as indicated by a mean species abundance index, by 30% in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EEZ</jats:styled-content>s. We suggest that improving high seas fisheries governance would increase the resilience of coastal countries to climate change.</jats:p>",

At several sensory synapses, rapid vesicle supply is achieved via highly mobile vesicles and specialized ribbon structures, but how this is achieved at central synapses without ribbons is unclear. Here we examine vesicle mobility at excitatory cerebellar mossy fibre synapses which sustain transmission over a broad frequency bandwidth. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching in slices from VGLUT1Venus knock-in mice reveal 75% of VGLUT1-containing vesicles have a high mobility, comparable to that at ribbon synapses. Experimentally constrained models establish hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions are major determinants of vesicle mobility in crowded presynaptic terminals. Moreover, models incorporating 3D reconstructions of vesicle clouds near active zones (AZs) predict the measured releasable pool size and replenishment rate from the reserve pool. They also show that while vesicle reloading at AZs is not diffusion-limited at the onset of release, diffusion limits vesicle reloading during sustained high-frequency signalling.</jats:p>"

It has been suggested that in such systems certain plant species may act as “keystone” resources for animals, but the importance of presumed keystone resources for populations has not been quantified experimentally. Using complementary seed removal and seed‐addition experiments, we determined how the supply of a presumed keystone resource, seeds of <jats:italic>Araucaria angustifolia</jats:italic>, affects short‐term demography of their main consumer group (small rodents) in a biodiversity hotspot, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We hypothesized that (i) the harvest of <jats:italic>A. angustifolia</jats:italic> seeds by human populations has negative impacts on rodents, and (ii) these seeds are a limiting resource for rodent populations. To test these hypotheses, we monitored populations of two species of numerically dominant rodents (<jats:italic>Delomys dorsalis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Akodon montensis</jats:italic>) within replicated control‐experimental plots. Manipulations of seed supply over 2 years had little effect on population size, body condition, survival, or reproduction of the two rodents, suggesting that, in the short‐term (within one generation), their populations are not food limited in <jats:italic>Araucaria</jats:italic> forests. Despite apparently having all the characteristics of a keystone resource, as currently defined in the literature, the seeds of <jats:italic>A. angustifolia</jats:italic> had limited influence on the short‐term demography of their main consumer group. In situations where purported keystone resources are seasonally abundant, their actual importance may be lower than generally assumed<jats:italic>,</jats:italic> and these resources then may have only localized and temporary effects on consumer populations.</jats:p>",

To explore the mechanisms behind this spectacular evolutionary trajectory toward pathogenicity, we have experimentally investigated the faculty of different tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria in conducting horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our studies identified unique chromosomal DNA transfer between strains of the\n            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium canettii</jats:italic>\n            clade, which resemble most closely the putative common ancestor of the\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            complex. This outstanding feature suggests that during the evolution of\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            , HGT might have represented the major mechanism for acquisition of genes that helped these mycobacteria to increasingly resist host defenses and become major pathogens.\n          </jats:p>",
