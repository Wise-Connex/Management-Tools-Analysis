The impact of recent legislation covering copyright, legal deposit and electronic signatures on RDS is discussed as is the effect of electronic journals deals. Changes at BLDSC are noted, particularly the introduction of a secure electronic delivery service. But BLDSC will have to operate in a changing environment as envisaged in a new interlending scheme, BLDSC Plus. The central importance of BLDSC however is underlined by two important studies. The future prospects of a number of RDS systems are mentioned, but the reliance on an unreliable transport scheme for the delivery of returnables threatens to undo much of the good work. The conclusion is that RDS and related activities are in a transitional phase.</jats:p>",

It argues that libraries have now entered the era of the ‘post‐modern’ collection, and suggests the impact this might have on document supply activity, particularly between consortium members. It concludes with a study of the consortium activities of one academic library, at Murdoch University in Western Australia, in order to illustrate these points.</jats:p>",

This paper develops a conceptual model that captures the salient issues from an internal or purchaser's standpoint, as well as from an external or seller's standpoint. The model assists purchasers in pinpointing improvement initiatives that provide the best returns. Moreover, it illustrates that different purchasing firms perceive supplier value differently because of the relative amount of competition in a respective supply market and because of the value offered by various products within the purchasing firm's business. Case studies were conducted to highlight methods of strategically enhancing the supplier/customer relationship to develop exemplary supply chains. Results indicated ineffective measurement criteria as a key impediment to supplier development. Additionally, results indicated that many purchasers are in transition regarding embracing bold and substantive supplier development initiatives.</jats:p>",

Underpinning the strategy are a suite of scenario based forecasts developed to explore the impact of key drivers of demand within different sectors of water use across England and Wales. This paper explains the approach used to produce these forecasts, summarises how the individual components of demand were considered and highlights opportunities for future application and development of this approach. Using the premise that total water demand can mask conflicting trends between sectors, it is essential to consider each sector and its micro-components independently to understand the specific drivers of demand and consequently determine how these might best be managed. Four scenarios reflecting different possible futures of socio-economic and governmental structure were created to test “how”, “why” and “where” these water demands may change by 2025. Such an approach provides an opportunity to test the implications of macro drivers of demand, such as, economic growth and regulatory reform, on the micro-components of water use, linking disparate sectors to a common set of assumptions about the future.</jats:p>",

Lack of precipitation, inadequate infrastructure for collection, storage and recycling of water and above all, lack of public awareness regarding such issues as standard consumption patterns, force all countries like Iran to adopt strategic management policies and techniques toward such issues as water resources, maintaining and upgrading water quality, recharging of water resources and also other concepts, such as, “defined consumption”.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although Tehran province enjoys having various surface and underground water resources, and also so-called scattered and undirected water resources such as Qanats, springs, treated waste water, etc., adding all these resources together, it still cannot quench its thirst. Average annual temperature and rainfall, and also explosive rate of population migration to the province, are main reasons of existing and widening gap between supply and demand. It seems the only alternative left is to capitalize and utilize various techniques to reduce consumption, otherwise Tehran will face a continuous and uninterrupted water crisis. Proposed strategic management viewpoint should also cover other areas such as supply, transfer, treatment, storage and also distribution and consumption. For each of above topics, special operational management should be considered and executed. Although, there were many reasons behind the recent water crisis, one of the main reasons was uncoordination among various management divisions which ended up in rationing. Tehran's water crisis was handled successfully by utilizing various strategic management techniques, but in order to prevent such crisis repeating itself, we must adopt long-term strategic policies and demand management, also various techniques of efficient use of water.</jats:p>",

This model has been developed and used to project the demand for water in Sydney over the next 20 years under business as usual scenario, as well as allow the projection of a number of scenarios which include major investment in water efficiency and effluent reuse programs as well as regulatory options to improve the efficiency of water using appliances in stalled in new buildings. Key features of the Sydney Water End Use Model include the fact that it takes into account the fact that the efficiency of toilets in Australia has a much larger range than (say) the US, in that the dual flush toilet was introduced in (to date) three stages. The model also accounts for projections of demographic and land use change which has been particularly dramatic in Sydney, particularly the movement to smaller occupancy rates in dwellings, and towards multi-family residential dwellings.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The second case study will demonstrate the linkages between end use modeling of energy using and water using appliances. A model of residential energy use in Australia has been developed as part of a research project to develop greenhouse abatement scenarios for Australia, and many of the appliances modeled overlap with the water end use model, including clothes washing machines, dishwashers, showerheads and taps. This more recent modeling exercise has revealed the importance of key assumptions in standard stock modeling techniques, and highlighted the need for earlier starting dates for stock modeling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The process and results of these two case studies will be presented, and conclusions drawn about further improvements in end use analysis for both water and energy use.

The project attempted to assess the effectiveness of a water efficiency campaign in a residential area of 8000 properties. The results showed that the campaign had no significant effect on water demand both at the individual property level and the total flow into the area. Responses to direct questions about the campaign indicated that at most 5% had noticed it despite the fact that 25% claimed to read the local newspaper and listen to the local radio station used for the campaign, and the fact that a leaflet was sent to all households. The market research provided some clues as to why the customer response to this campaign was so disappointing, principally because the public regard water as low priority compared to other environmental issues. Other research is reviewed that provide additional reasons for the unwillingness of the public to engage on this issue. This paper reviews “success stories” from Phoenix, Arizona and Singapore and identifies the main learning points from these programs. Article 14 of the Water Framework Directive calls for active involvement in water policy. An assessment is made of what this might mean for public participation in water conservation programs.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the Electronic Service Center (ESC), a successful, pan‐European chain co‐ordinator based in The Netherlands, is studied. The ESC acts as a central and neutral supply chain co‐ordinator and aims at co‐ordinating the flow of information between customers, logistics carriers, warehouses, forwarders and suppliers. This paper provides a general overview of the roles of supply chain co‐ordinators and provides a short review of factors responsible for failure. It investigates the ESC, describes the supply chain and the various roles of the supply chain co‐ordinator, and discusses the various trade‐offs made by the organisations involved in the supply chain.

These were investigated as part of Thames Water's “Watercycle” project at the Millennium Dome, where a range of water efficient devices, such as infra-red controlled taps, waterless urinals and dual-flush toilets, were installed in the washrooms and compared to standard appliances. As well as monitoring actual metered water usage, to help understand how users interacted with the range of appliances, the work also involved a survey conducted by interview and an observational study of water using behaviour in the washrooms. The results highlighted significant differences between males and females, for example females were more likely to wash their hands following toilet use. With respect to “novel” dual flush toilets and waterless urinals, both fairly unusual in the UK, they were well received by users. In contrast, the infra-red controlled taps were found difficult to use and least likely to be accepted for use in the home. Relevant signage and labelling was found to have a positive effect on conservation and user opinions.</jats:p>",

Considering probabilistic nature of demands, this paper combines the extended period simulation of water distribution networks with the head driven simulation based reliability analysis that presents the nodal and system reliabilities more realistically than conventional demand driven simulation based analysis. A sample network with possibility of one link failure is examined and diurnal profile of reliability values due to mechanical and hydraulic failures and known probabilities of demands is presented. It is seen that considering the probabilistic nature of demands the severity of mechanical and hydraulic failures on the hydraulic performance of the system are illustrated properly and realistically, especially at the critical times or nodes, in comparison with the deterministic values.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary. </jats:bold> The survival and well‐being of people with haemophilia depends on the supply of safe therapeutic products. Safety and supply are entirely intertwined principles; in the absence of adequate amounts of coagulation products, safety measures may be compromised in order to enhance supply, leading to risks which may result in morbidity and mortality. As haemophilia therapy has emerged through the development of blood transfusion and plasma fractionation, the safety of the blood supply in general has had a strong effect on haemophilia care. Despite the gradual detachment of haemophilia care from blood transfusion through the use of recombinant products, the majority of the world's population with haemophilia in the developing world will be reliant on blood products for the foreseeable future. It is, therefore, important to continue efforts for a safe and sufficient blood supply worldwide. As such a blood supply develops, possibly in tandem with an independent plasma fractionation industry, the level of haemophilia care should improve with the gradual introduction of concentrates for the ultimate goal of covering all aspects of care. Constant vigilance for the threat of blood‐borne pathogens should be linked to considerations of how these products are to be manufactured. This should be governed entirely by considerations of safety and pharmaceutical competence. Of equal importance is a governmental capacity to oversee the entry and maintenance of these products on the market. While it is not possible for all countries to have a regulatory authority of the same status as that of the developed countries, it is perfectly feasible to develop a set of basic principles which allow an assessment of basic product safety, quality and efficacy to be made.</jats:p>",

Demand in almost every industrial sector seems to be more volatile than was the case in the past. Product and technology life‐cycles have shortened significantly and competitive product introductions make life‐cycle demand difficult to predict. At the same time the vulnerability of supply chains to disturbance or disruption has increased. It is not only the effect of external events such as wars, strikes or terrorist attacks, but also the impact of changes in business strategy. Many companies have experienced a change in their supply chain risk profile as a result of changes in their business models, for example the adoption of “lean” practices, the move to outsourcing and a general tendency to reduce the size of the supplier base. This paper suggests that one key element in any strategy designed to mitigate supply chain risk is improved “end‐to‐end” visibility. It is argued that supply chain “confidence” will increase in proportion to the quality of supply chain information.</jats:p>",

This paper examines the big deal in the light of fundamental market conditions and suggests alternative models for procuring electronic resources. The roles and strengths of the players in the information supply chain are defined and traditional hard‐copy procurement is analysed in terms of these roles and the concepts of authority, branding and monopoly. The fundamentals of procuring electronic resources and prevalent purchasing models are discussed in terms of the same roles and concepts. The advantages of the big deal are laid out ‐ access to resources, low unit costs etc. The dangers are also discussed. These arise mainly from the publishers’ position as monopolists. The possible long‐term effects, on library budgets and academic publishing, of dealing with monopoly suppliers are examined. Means of avoiding or minimising these dangers – consortia, alternative publishing methods, new economic models to promote competition – are examined.</jats:p>",

However, supply chain management software is not providing organizations with all its potential benefits. This study looks at three information technologies (i.e. group decision support systems, EDI and e‐commerce) that can be used to improve information flows and the factors that affect their adoption and use. These factors are divided into those related to the information technology itself and those related to maintaining the relationships that are important in managing supply chain linkages. Factors related to the technology fit such as return on investment, fit with users' needs, affordability of the technology and ability to secure the technology were found to be important in the use of these tools. The ability to secure SCM technologies currently appears to substitute for some level of trust from an information systems perspective. In the case of the most mature technology (i.e. EDI), the results show that trust is related to fit with user needs. The implications of these findings for managers who wish to adopt and implement these SCM tools are discussed. Further study of these factors is suggested, particularly as SCM tools become increasingly more collaborative.</jats:p>",

Pharmacy staff had little awareness or understanding of the term EBP and no specific evidence was used in the majority of consultations. Pharmacists' attitudes towards EBP varied. Personal experience or feedback from customers were cited as evidence upon which treatment recommendations were based. Many barriers and problems were associated with the supply of NPMs. These included: lack of evidence; MCAs' self-perception of their role; questioning and communication skills; safety; and training needs. There was a gap between pharmacists' and MCAs' perceptions of who should be referred to the pharmacist. Many staff used the WWHAM mnemonic for questioning customers, but this was often used as a matter of rote rather than as a framework to engage the customer in a relevant and constructive consultation. The development of adequate communication skills to allow core information to be obtained to support decision making needs to be addressed.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>An increased awareness of EBP and its role in quality care needs to be promoted to community pharmacists and MCAs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Tauber Manufacturing Institute (TMI) is a partnership between the engineering and business schools at the University of Michigan. In the summer of 1999, a TMI team spent 14 weeks at Dell Inc. in Austin, Texas, and developed an inventory model to identify inventory drivers and quantify target levels for inventory in the final stage of Dell's supply chain, the revolvers or supplier logistics centers (SLC). With the information and analysis provided by this model, Dell's regional materials organizations could tactically manage revolver inventory while Dell's worldwide commodity management could partner with suppliers in improvement projects to identify inventory drivers and to reduce inventory. Dell also initiated a pilot program for procurement of XDX (a disguised name for one of the major components of personal computers (PCs)) in the United States to institutionalize the model and promote partnership with suppliers. Based on the model predictions, Dell launched e-commerce and manufacturing initiatives with its suppliers to lower supply-chain-inventory costs by reducing revolver inventory by 40 percent. This reduction would raise the corresponding inventory turns by 67 percent. Net Present Value (NPV) calculations for XDX alone suggest $43 million in potential savings. To ensure project longevity, Dell formed the supply-chain-optimization team and charged it with incorporating the model into a strategic redesign of Dell's business practices and supervising improvement projects the model identified. </jats:p>",

Therefore, it is very crucial for the Palestinians to achieve proper planning and management of their water resources to ensure proper usage of their water in the different sectors. Moreover, many of the Palestinian localities still lack the existence of water networks while many others suffer from the poor conditions and high losses in their networks that reach up to 50% of the input into the supply system. The paper will present a method to determine water losses from distribution networks and procedures of reducing it in a practical way. The method is based on three main steps: (1) tracing leaks of the supply districts or pipe sections by means of tightness tests and measuring minimum night flow; (2) pinpointing the leaks using the electro-acoustic techniques by DF Junior device and (3) repairing leaks. Consequently, the amount of leakage for the study area was largely reduced (from 5.6 L/sec to 0.16 L/sec).</jats:p>",

Although there have been several failures in the e‐business arena, whether it is business‐to‐business (B2B) or business‐to‐consumer (B2C) e‐commerce, there is no doubt that the Internet has changed the way that business is done in several ways. It has been shown that electronic commerce can fundamentally change the inter‐organizational processes involving buyer‐supplier relationships. It reshapes these buyer‐supplier relationships, improves a business's core processes, and helps reach new markets or segments through the electronic medium. This paper discusses the opportunities and challenges facing e‐marketplaces today, and also the concerns facing potential participants in these e‐marketplaces who are trying to weigh the risks presented by such participation and the possible benefits that can be reaped by streamlining supply chain processes.

The empirical analysis in the article features a model that controls for the possibility of an endogenous relationship between women's involvement in paid work and the risk of divorce. Results show a significant positive relationship between the risk of divorce and the probability that a woman will be involved in full‐time work.</jats:p>",

The main thrust of this article is to describe how Ericsson, after a fire at a sub‐supplier, with a huge impact on Ericsson, has implemented a new organization, and new processes and tools for SCRM. The approach described tries to analyze, assess and manage risk sources along the supply chain, partly by working close with suppliers but also by placing formal requirements on them. This explorative study also indicates that insurance companies might be a driving force for improved SCRM, as they now start to understand the vulnerability of modern supply chains. The article concludes with a discussion of risk related to traditional logistics concepts (time, cost, quality, agility and leanness) by arguing that supply chain risks should also be put into the trade‐off analysis when evaluating new logistics solutions – not with the purpose to minimize risks, however, but to find the efficient level of risk and prevention.</jats:p>",

And the task is tackled using a new meta-heuristic algorithm, Harmony Search, for solving a large optimization problem to which conventional optimization techniques are poorly suited.

In the EU, agricultural and environmental policies are seeking to converge progressively toward mutually compatible objectives and, in this context, the recently reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU Water Framework Directive constitute the policy framework in which irrigated agriculture and hence water use will evolve. In fact, one of the measures of the European Water Directive is to establish a water pricing policy for improving water use and attaining a more efficient water allocation. The aim of this research is to investigate the irrigators' responses to these changing policy developments in a self‐managed irrigation district in southern Spain. A stochastic programming model has been developed to estimate farmers' response to the application of water pricing policies in different agricultural policy scenarios when water availability is subject to varying climate conditions and water storage capacity in the district's reservoir. Results show that irrigators are price‐responsive, but a similar water‐pricing policy in different agricultural policy options could have distinct effects on water use, farmers' income, and collected revenue by the water authority. Water availability is a critical factor, and pricing policies are less effective for reducing water consumption in drought years. Thus there is a need to integrate the objectives of water policies within the objectives of the CAP programs to avoid distortion effects and to seek synergy between these two policies.</jats:p>",

Following numerous rounds of discussion with key business partners in the Asia Pacific region, some progress had been made. Nagase &amp; Co., Ltd. of Japan had agreed to adopt ISS connections with Eastman, but had some reservations regarding the extent of integration. Although the benefits of integration were proven, suppliers, customers, distributors and other interested parties were faced with numerous limitations and considerations that would have significant implications on their established business processes and even the shaping of their corporate strategy. Adoption was not a simple choice. Craig understood these shortcomings and was making every effort to ease the adoption process by identifying the longer-term benefits to Nagase and other business partners of applying XML technology to their businesses. </jats:p>",

We take up this issue and begin with defining a coordinating contract as one that results in a Pareto‐optimal solution acceptable to each agent. Our definition generalizes the standard one in the risk‐neutral case. We then develop coordinating contracts in three specific cases: (i) the supplier is risk neutral and the retailer maximizes his expected profit subject to a downside risk constraint; (ii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own mean‐variance trade‐off; and (iii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own expected utility. Moreover, in case (iii), we show that our contract yields the Nash Bargaining solution. In each case, we show how we can find the set of Pareto‐optimal solutions, and then design a contract to achieve the solutions. We also exhibit a case in which we obtain Pareto‐optimal sharing rules explicitly, and outline a procedure to obtain Pareto‐optimal solutions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>1. Persistence of zebra mussel populations in river systems probably depends upon the presence of upriver sites capable of hosting self‐recruiting adult populations that act as sources of larvae. In this paper we examine the importance of Lake Pepin, a natural riverine lake in the Upper Mississippi River, as an upriver source of larvae to the downstream populations of zebra mussels.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Field studies and modelling suggest that Lake Pepin plays a major role in maintaining zebra mussel populations in the Upper Mississippi River. Long water residence times in Lake Pepin allow for self‐recruitment under the right hydraulic conditions. Larval abundance was low to absent upstream of the lake but increased dramatically downriver in all 3 years of the study. Travel time estimates in the Upper Mississippi River show that newly fertilised larvae drifting out of Lake Pepin can contribute substantially to the major downstream peak in larval abundance. In contrast, backwater and other off‐channel sites are unlikely to drive main‐channel abundance patterns. Larval abundances in off‐channel sites were less than or equal to those in the main channel.</jats:p><jats:p>3. A key factor in assessing the importance of Lake Pepin as a source population was the abundance of early stage, unshelled larvae. Studies that consider only abundances of older shelled stages (visible by cross polarised lighting) may yield misleading results. Results of this study suggest that efforts to control zebra mussels in the Upper Mississippi River should focus on controlling adult populations within Lake Pepin and reducing or eliminating larvae exiting the lake.</jats:p>",

In particular, we analysed the objectives these companies are trying to achieve by using Supply Chain Management Software and evaluated to what extent these objectives have been accomplished. Our results show that the companies have been able to reduce both their costs and lead times and to improve their service levels. The survey also reveals, however, that until now, the cooperative potential of Supply Chain Management Software has not been utilized effectively.</jats:p>",

Almost all outlets stocked antipyretics/painkillers. One‐third of general retailers stocking drugs had antimalarials, usually chloroquine alone. Almost all drug shops stocked antimalarials (98%): nearly all had chloroquine, 42% stocked quinine, 37% sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine and 30% amodiaquine. A large number of antimalarial brands were available. Population ratios indicate the relative accessibility of retail drug providers compared with health facilities. Drug shop staff generally travelled long distances to buy from drugs wholesalers or pharmacies. General retailers bought mainly from local general wholesalers, with a few general wholesalers accounting for a high proportion of all sources cited.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> Drugs were widely available from a large number of retail outlets. Potential negative implications include provision of ineffective drugs, confusion over brand names, uncontrolled use of antimalarials, and the availability of components of potential combination therapy regimens as monotherapies. On the other hand, this active and highly accessible retail market provides opportunities for improving the coverage of effective antimalarial treatment. Interventions targeted at all drug retailers are likely to be costly to deliver and difficult to sustain, but two promising points for targeted intervention are drug shops and selected general wholesalers. Retail quality may also be improved through consumer education, and modification of the chemical quality, packaging and price of products entering the retail distribution chain.</jats:p>",

Individual particle analysis provides combined elemental and morphologic characterizations. Results are presented in terms of particle projected area per unit volume (PAV), consistent with optical impacts, and partitioned into seven generic particle types according to composition. Minerals of terrigenous origins, particularly clay minerals, dominated the inorganic particle populations of all the study systems except one downstream reservoir. Higher PAV levels were observed in the Catskill system. Particle dynamics represented by PAV were driven primarily by runoff, while the reservoirs were also greatly influenced by the timing of sediment resuspension promoted by drawdown of the surface and fall mixing. The benefit of the serial configuration of the reservoirs in decreasing inorganic particles with progression downstream towards the city is demonstrated. The patterns in PAV levels among the study systems generally tracked those of more common metrics of impacts of suspensoids, including mass concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Secchi disc transparency.</jats:p>",

However, the blood flow in SOL was unaltered and capillary density was maintained in CHF rats.

In addition, absence of changes in high‐energy phosphates and metabolites indicate that the oxidative metabolism of SOL is intact in rats with CHF.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> \n  The self-organized GaN dot structure is successfully grown on a slightly lattice-mismatched Al<jats:sub>0.11</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>0.89</jats:sub>N epilayer using flow-rate modulation epitaxy (FME) growth technique. From the variation of dot density with growth temperature, we can observe that the GaN dot growth is controlled predominately by the surface diffusion of Ga adatoms at substrate temperatures below 915°C and by re-evaporation at higher temperatures. Because of the special alternating gas supply feature in FME, during the Ga source step, it is the Ga metal that is deposited on the underlying Al<jats:sub>0.11</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>0.89</jats:sub>N layer. This is because of the large lattice mismatch of 41.8% between the Ga metal (4.51 Å) and Al<jats:sub>0.11</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>0.89</jats:sub>N (3.18 Å). We consider that the GaN dot growth in our study is mainly through the Volmer-Weber growth mode, not the commonly used Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. \n  </jats:p>",
