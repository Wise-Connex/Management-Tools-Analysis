Yet scholars from ecological economics question this assumption due to ever increasing evidence showing how hard it is to decouple growth from negative environmental and social externalities. In response, pressure from social movements is mounting, and the agendas of several countries already consider alternatives to growth. Therefore, this article presents a critical thought experiment for the supply chain management discipline: What are the implications of moving from the current endless growth paradigm to a post‐growth paradigm for businesses and their supply chains? Using the umbrella term “post‐growth,” this article identifies three key post‐growth principles—(i) <jats:italic>socio‐ecological wellbeing</jats:italic>, (ii) <jats:italic>selective downscaling</jats:italic>, and (iii) <jats:italic>systems thinking</jats:italic>—and then examines their implications for supply chain management research and practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply chain operations rely upon various supply chain software systems, centred around the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Traditional and still widely utilised and relied-upon audit techniques have addressed the issue of finding problems — particularly fraud — typically too late after they have happened. Inasmuch as the ERP system is considered the business system of record, it may not be the system of origination for every supply chain transaction, meaning that fraud examination needs to look beyond the ERP system and notably before the ERP general ledger. The closer to a transaction’s point of origin the unusual behaviour can be detected, the sooner the outlier issue can be fixed, and ideally averted in the future with the right corrective actions taken then and there. This all helps to prevent the problem — the bad data, the offending transaction, and possibly the incorrect goods — from travelling through the supply chain and manifesting into something worse. Ramifications can include knock-on effects to data analysis, impacts to decisions, passing bad information to supply chain partners, conveying the wrong goods and material effects on financial statements. This paper presents a supply chain perspective that reveals just how much control an enterprise really does have over its supply chain transactions, showcases how reactive fraud discovery methodologies remain firmly in place, and offers a more proactive business model that leverages what most companies already have to improve internal controls and decrease incidences of fraud.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a supply chain system consisting of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs) and contract manufacturers (CMs), a multi-party Bowan model based on competition and cooperation is constructed considering upstream supply risks and equilibrium decisions are obtained. The impact of economies of scale and brand advantages on supply chain management strategies is further explored. The results show that even if CMs have supply risks, they will squeeze ODMs' profits, while OEMs can increase their profits through upstream competition. After CM supply is interrupted, when OEMs have a small brand advantage, ODMs choose to participate in terminal market competition to further increase their profits. When the brand advantage is large, ODMs focus on upstream supply to ease terminal competition. However, economies of scale have heterogeneous effects on ODM and OEM profits, and manufacturers should be wary of the possible negative effects of economies of scale. It is worth noting that the decisions of ODMs and OEMs are always in a \"lose-lose\" state. As a \"follower\", OEMs can only rely on brand advantages and other measures to ensure their own profits, while ODM decisions and social welfare can achieve a \"win-win\" situation. This study not only deeply deconstructs the impact of supply risk on diversified procurement, but also explores the impact of supply disruptions on manufacturers' decision-making, provides strategic guidance for manufacturers on how to make decisions in the face of risky operating environments, and provides theoretical analysis for policy management departments to deal with supply risks and improve social welfare.</jats:p>"

Regarding the moderating role of proactive and reactive corporate sustainability strategies, there is a notable interaction effect between supply chain leadership and proactive sustainability strategies concerning sustainability performance (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). This confirms the positive relationship between supply chain leadership and sustainability performance when proactive sustainability strategies are at a high level (β = 0.844, SE = 0.0010, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01), supporting <jats:italic>H4</jats:italic> that this relationship strengthens with higher levels of proactive sustainability strategies. Conversely, for Hypothesis <jats:italic>H5</jats:italic>, the interaction effect of reactive sustainability strategies with supply chain leadership changes the relationship from significantly positive to significantly negative (β = −0.068, SE = 0.0009, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01).

Few studies have focused on developing countries where chronic, small‐scale disruptions are common and resource scarcity means advanced digital technologies are rarely adopted. This research explores how traceability is achieved across upstream actors in two Ghanaian agri‐food supply chains and how this affects global SCRes. Social characteristics are shown to influence the risks inherent in supply chains, while traceability is both a direct and indirect SCRes enabler. Informed by the relational view, the roles of relation‐specific assets and governance mechanisms in maintaining traceability are explored. Supply chain‐wide relation‐specific assets are prioritized over dyadic relation‐specific assets. This original finding is explained by the importance of maintaining social ties over short‐term economic gains in a collectivist culture, leading to greater relational rents in the long term. A novel, informal third‐party governance mechanism that reduces formal contracting costs and provides flexibility and continuity to interfirm relationships is also identified, further facilitating the attainment of relational rents. The findings are explained in light of sub‐Saharan Africa's collectivist culture, encapsulated in the philosophy of <jats:italic>ubuntu</jats:italic>. Overall, the research theorizes on achieving supply chain traceability and thus enhancing global SCRes as a sociotechnical system incorporating technological and nontechnological systems that are socially embedded in the local context.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The events of recent years, ranging from geopolitical tensions and global health events to labour shortages and economic crises, have highlighted significant vulnerabilities within global supply chains and emphasised the need for agility and resilience. Recent studies referenced in this paper, including the ‘Global Business Optimism Insights’ report, underscore that while large businesses tend to prioritise strengthening their supply chains, smaller businesses are often more focused on customer base expansion, potentially risking operational robustness. This approach could jeopardise customer satisfaction due to failures in meeting on-time, in-full (OTIF) delivery metrics, leading to potential financial penalties and customer dissatisfaction. With that in mind, this paper aims to help supply chain organisations understand how they can obtain the agility and resilience needed to weather ongoing disruption and futureproof their operations. It provides recommendations on how this can be achieved, pointing to access to trusted, real-time data across the supply chain network as a critical component. The paper also identifies, however, that many supply chain businesses struggle to obtain this access to data for rapid and informed decision making. Research from InterSystems finds that this data challenge is further complicated by a lack of end-to-end supply chain visibility, which is often exacerbated by data silos created by disparate systems and manual processes. These visibility challenges negatively affect key performance indicators such as OTIF metrics and restrict an organisation’s ability to adapt to disruptions swiftly. The paper explores how supply chain organisations can overcome these difficulties, identifying investment in digital supply chain technologies such as decision intelligence platforms as a way in which they can bridge the real-time execution gap and enable supply chain leaders to optimise processes. These platforms integrate real-time data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance visibility, decision making and operational efficiency. The paper draws the conclusion that building resilient, future-proof supply chains is crucial for organisations to manage disruptions and capitalise on opportunities effectively. In the wake of ongoing disruption, the paper aims to demonstrate that by adopting the right technological solutions and embracing a cultural shift to data-driven operations, supply chains can transform to better withstand future challenges and move their organisation forward, thus ensuring sustained growth and enhanced customer loyalty.</jats:p>"

It puts forward a theory of how norms can affect voters, politicians, and their interactions. It argues that the political behaviors of citizens are either public or private. If norms affect public behaviors, politicians can underestimate the prevalence of counternormative views. This gives them an incentive not to run for election on a counternormative platform, reducing the pool of potential candidates with that platform, and leaving it with less skilled leaders. Thus, norms can indirectly affect electoral behavior. If their preferred party platform is counternormative and has worse candidates, voters are likely not to vote for it. The chapter also discusses how change can happen within this framework. That norms explain a wide range of processes on their own underlines the importance of bringing them into analyses of political change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today's urgent issues in the water supply of thermal power plants are increasing the efficiency of production processes, reducing energy costs, introducing innovative technologies, as well as ensuring environmental safety and sustainable development. The analysis of the causes of industrial accidents and damages shows that the occurrence and development of accidents, as a rule, is characterized by a combination of random local events that occur with different frequency at different stages of the accident. Logical-graphic methods of fault trees and events are used to identify cause-and-effect relationships between these events. In order to investigate the identification and analysis of cause-and-effect relationships that contribute to the occurrence of failures in the water treatment system using a fault tree for the further development of effective measures to minimize risks and increase the reliability and safety of the water supply systems of thermal power plants, it is proposed to use logical-graphic methods on the previous stage of identification and assessment of technogenic risks. The analysis of the obtained results showed that: 1) the fault tree is an instantaneous display of the system at a certain moment in time t and is a graphical representation of the cause-and-effect relationships obtained as a result of identifying dangerous situations in the system in a forward and reverse order in order to find possible causes of their occurrence; 2) a complex final event should be determined using the so-called «tree top». The top of the tree consists of the final event and additional undesirable events, including potential accidents and dangerous conditions that are direct causes of the final event. The final event and additional events must be carefully defined and all the most important causes of the final event identified. Therefore, the first five heuristic rules must be used when building a rejection tree; 3) construction of a fault tree using heuristic rules can be used when considering any element of the system, however, to simplify cumbersome constructions, it is more appropriate to build trees only for the main elements that cause emergency situations and have a negative impact on people's lives and health, as well as on environment; 4) when building a fault trees for the technological scheme of water treatment, it is possible to specify and quantify events, to find events with a very high probability and a very low probability, to limit the further development of the fault trees and to establish the causes of failures at each stage of the water treatment process; 5) the rejection tree can be used for quantitative assessments using Markov models.</jats:p>"

Malaysia’s strategic location along key maritime routes positions it as a vital hub for international shipping and logistics, facilitating efficient trade between Asia, Europe and the Middle East.Objectives: Despite extensive global studies on freight and trade, little specific research exists from Malaysia’s perspective. Thus, this study aims to evaluate how factors such as economic size of trade partners and distance impact Malaysia’s freight transport in international trade, using the gravity model, a tool for analysing bilateral trade flows.Method: Three types of gravity models are employed to assess the impact of economic scale, infrastructure and demographic factors on freight transport. Then the validity of these relationships is further evaluated.Results: The random effect model (REM) is found to be the best fitted model. The study identifies infrastructure and economic scale as pivotal factors influencing both freight export and import. The result showed the volume of container handled in ports is the main determinant in both export and import of freight, whereas air freight has significant impact to boost the export of freight. Distance is statistically significant, however, with marginally small impact.Conclusion: Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the robust port infrastructure and efficient logistical facilities are important in reducing freight costs and enhancing Malaysia’s international trade competitiveness.Contribution: This study mainly contributes on providing empirical evidence and in-depth insight on Malaysia freight transport services through the application of gravity models.</jats:p>"

The technique is applied to a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) model with 16 industries (16 growth rates, 16 inflations), and the interest rate. The results demonstrate that the suggested technique can yield different implications for the density of relevant measures compared to the conventional random draw approach. Shocks identification is more accurate for suggested approach in experiments with simulated from DSGE model data. The usage of industry specific data and identification of demand and supply shock have large influence on identification of MP-shocks. It reveals important elements of transmission mechanics of monetary policy including differences in magnitude (up to 10–100 times) and shape of responses on MP-shocks, differences in historical decomposition, differences in importance of demand and supply shocks for interest rates dynamic. Variance decomposition shows decrease of relative importance of its own shocks to industries with switching from short-run to long-run decomposition. There are some similarities with input-output tables and some differences those open questions for future researches.\nJEL-classification: C32, C51, E32, E52</p>"

The attention of the scientific community and of water utilities about this topic is focused on energy optimization of wastewater treatment plants and pumping stages in drinking water supply systems (DWSSs). However, because of increasingly stringent regulations and because of more and more extended water-source pollution, the need for ‘unconventional’ drinking water treatment systems, which are very energy-intensive, will bring treatment to be a key factor in this scenario. Analyzing EEC in seven full-scale DWSSs, we wanted to control EEC in every single stage of the DWSS (withdrawal, drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) and distribution) and to identify opportunities for reducing energy consumption in DWSS, with a special focus on each drinking water treatment process. The most energy-intensive unconventional treatment turns out to be membrane filtration by reverse osmosis (for which specific consumption per cubic meter of pumped water is equal to 0.243 Wh/m3), whereas the most energy-intensive conventional treatment turns out to be air oxidation (specific EEC from 0.012 to 0.087 kWh/m3). The main strategies for energy conservation can be applied both in management and in the design phase.</jats:p>",

The existence of varying definitions of SCR complicates efforts to quantitatively measure and assess resilience. To elucidate the essence of supply chain resilience, we conducted a meticulous systematic literature review (SLR) aimed at crystallizing a scientifically rigorous definition of SCR. Our SLR methodology involved comprehensive preparation and judicious paper selection, followed by a thorough analysis of supply chain resilience definitions. This analysis was conducted via the dimensions of three typical characteristics—preparedness, reaction, and recovery—and four foundational pillars—focus event, performance level, speed, and adaptive response. As a result, a robust definition of SCR is proposed, synthesizing insights from the three typical characteristics theory and the four pillars theory, supplemented with meaningful additions.

Any other model is only complementary while it lasts. Therefore, self‐supply needs more emphasis in research and intentional exposure and support in practice. This is underscored by the fact that despite the use of taxes, transfers, and tariffs that fund other service models, major water service gaps still exist in rural households forcing them to invest directly in self‐supply. Over 2.2 billion people globally still lack access to safe water. Our argument is not that other models such as communal or government models are irrelevant; rather, it is that self‐supply is the foundational and often preferred model for rural households due to reliability, predictability, control, and flexibility. Yet it is overlooked often. Therefore, we call for investing in research informing self‐supply policy, practice, and funding especially where it links with other models to be prioritized. This will likely accelerate the achievement of SDG 6.</jats:p>",

The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) (a planning software) was used to assess the actual (2000–2023) water supply sustainability with realistic annual growth rates to project (2024–2035) water demands for Kuwait's water future. The actual total water supply was found to be 1,375 Mm3/yr, of which 44% was for domestic, 5% for industrial, and 51% for agricultural water uses. It was also found that the per capita consumption for domestic and industrial purposes was 214 m3/yr. Suitable growth rates were as follows: 2, 1.5, and 1% for domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors, respectively. This will result in water shortage of 235 Mm3/yr during the period 2024–2035. Kuwait is called to implement strategic solutions to fully reuse treated wastewater and the virtual water concept for agricultural development purposes. This study demonstrates that when Kuwait implements these solutions, it can reduce CO2 emissions by 1.175 million tons saving $573 million annually. With the proper measures and policies, Kuwait can reduce their bulk water demand by 235 million cubic meters saving $1.15 billion dollars per year.</jats:p>",

The results demonstrated economic viability and strong accuracy for T1 with consistently lower values of mean absolute error (3.6165 and 4.3987) and root mean square error (4.4447 and 5.5055) while compared to T2 across two years. In addition, T1 achieved significant water savings (43.47 and 45.16%) alongside higher water productivity (8.11 and 8.22 kg m−3), respectively, for both the years compared to full irrigation (FI). These findings highlight CROPWAT 8.0 model–driven DI scheduling as a promising smart irrigation approach for tackling water scarcity, offering economic benefits to farmers while promoting water security.</jats:p>",

The study objective was to develop adaptation pathways using the Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) approach to enhance the water system performance. Using the hydrological model for the Thika-Chania Sub-catchment, prediction of future water flows for 30 years period was done. A multivariate econometric approach was used to investigate the socio-economic factors on water use and forecasts on future water demand. The demand scenarios were based on different population growth patterns corresponding to the exponential growth and decreasing rate of increase growth, with per capita consumption scenarios of 85 and 170 lpd. The system performance was evaluated through stress testing to determine the behavior under different scenarios. Results revealed an increasing supply–demand gap due to the impacts of climate and demographic changes. Adaptation strategies and their tipping points were established leading to the development of adaptation pathways. From assessment of the flexible adaptation pathways, it was concluded that the non-revenue water strategy be considered as a priority project by the utility.</jats:p>",

To conduct the empirical analysis, the research model was established based on the basic theory of the Cobb-Douglas production function. Before the empirical analysis, a unit root test was performed to verify the stationarity of the data. The results of the unit root test revealed that the industrial production index, the global supply chain pressure index, and labor input were I(1), while capital input was I(0). Subsequently, a cointegration test on the level variables showed that there was no long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables. Therefore, in this study, the I(1) variables were used after first-differencing, while the I(0) variable was used without differencing in the empirical analysis. The results of the empirical analysis indicated that capital input and labor input were statistically significant at the 1% level, with positive signs. On the other hand, while the expected sign for the global supply chain pressure index was observed, it was not statistically significant.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, having inventory data in one place was a benefit to pharmacists and supply managers who would need to use the data to determine their historic consumption. The greatest concern related to the workflow and communication of the OESC was an inability to accurately forecast future supply needs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Milkrun-based material supply plays an important role in the automotive industry, as it is a material supply concept where high efficiency can be achieved. When implementing milkrun-based material supply, the milkrun supply of the production plant often has to be integrated with an existing warehouse material handling system, which frequently leads to a less efficient solution. Methods: In this paper, the author investigates the impact of a hub-based milkrun supply, where the collection processes in the component’s warehouse and the distribution processes in the assembly plant are connected to a hub, which is responsible for the sequencing of component demands. After a systematic literature review, the paper introduces a novel mathematical model, which makes it possible to describe the conventional milkrun-based solutions, the hub-based milkrun solutions, and to compare them in terms of the length of transportation routes, transportation time, total service time, and virtual emission points of view. Results: The scenario analysis demonstrates that the hub-based solution can lead to an efficiency improvement of about 13% in total service time, 23% savings in transportation time, and 45% savings in transportation time in the component’s warehouse. Conclusions: The article’s findings suggest that implementing a hub-based milkrun system in automotive material supply can significantly enhance efficiency. The described approach could lead to more streamlined operations in production plants by optimizing the integration of milkrun systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cultivation of red chili in East Java, Indonesia, has significant economic and social impacts, necessitating proactive supply chain measures. This research aimed to identify priority risk agents, develop effective risk mitigation, and enhance supply chain resilience using the SCOR model, House of Risk, Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM), and synthesis analysis. Examining 238 respondents—including farmers, collectors, wholesalers, retailers, home-agroindustries, and experts—the findings highlight farmers’ critical role in supply chain resilience despite risks from crop failures, weather fluctuations, and pest infestations. Simultaneous planting led to market oversupply and price drops, but accurate pricing information facilitated quick market adaptation. Wholesalers influenced pricing dynamics and income levels, impacting farmers directly. To improve resilience, three main strategies were developed through ten key elements: proactive strategies (real-time SCM tracking, Weather Early Warning Systems, risk management team formation, and training), resistance strategies (partnerships, chili stock reserves, storage and drying technologies, GAP implementation, post-harvest management, agricultural insurance, and Fair Profit Sharing Agreements), and recovery and growth strategies (flexible distribution channels and customizable distribution centers). Furthermore, the study delves into the mediating and moderating effects between variables within the model. This research not only addresses a knowledge gap but also provides stakeholders with evidence to consider new strategies to enhance red chili supply resilience.</jats:p>"

The research utilises the resource-based view (RBV) theory to construct a conceptual model wherein lean and green supply chain practices are employed to augment business processes and sustainable performance. Concurrently, dynamic capabilities theory is applied to signify an organisation’s capacity to adapt and evolve in response to internal and external pressures from customers and competitors. The conceptual model is validated using structural equation modelling with a sample of 170 supply chain practitioners from the apparel and textile supply chain in Jordan. Results indicate that lean practices exhibit no direct impact, whereas green practices significantly influence business process performance and indirectly affect sustainable supply chain performance. Business process performance does not mediate the relationship for lean practices, but it does so for green practices. Moreover, the environmental orientation of both competitors and customers negatively moderates the impact of green practices on business processes and sustainable supply chain performance. These findings contribute to existing literature and underscore the crucial role of green supply chain practices in enhancing sustainable supply chain performance in the apparel and textile industry.</jats:p>",

Yet such data are often costly and challenging to collect. This paper explores how administrative data linkages can partially address this issue. Using recently matched data between the School Workforce Census and National Pupil Database for one school cohort in England, we explore how a set of characteristics are related to the recruitment and retention of teachers in England. Our results illustrate how speaking English as an Additional Language, living at home as an undergraduate and attendance at a Russell Group university (as an undergraduate) are linked to the probability of entering teaching and the rate at which teachers leave the state school sector. We also illustrate how individuals from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds are under-represented within the teaching profession, due to their lower levels of academic achievement while at school. In doing so, the work illustrates how further such administrative data linkages – for other school cohorts and to other datasets – would provide both policymakers and researchers with a valuable, low-cost resource that could enhance our collective understanding of the teacher labour force.</p>"

In recent years, pipeline accidents caused by aging and other factors are common and have caused large economic losses. Therefore, in order to avoid large economic losses, it is necessary to analyze the failure prediction of pipelines so that the pipelines that are going to fail can be replaced in a timely manner. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting the failure pressure of pipelines, i.e., a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the weights and thresholds of a BP neural network. The first step was to determine the topology of the neural network and the number of input and output variables. The second step was to optimize the weights and thresholds initially set for the back propagation neural network using a genetic algorithm. Finally, the optimized back-propagation neural network was used to simulate and predict pipeline failures. It was proved by examples that compared with the separate back propagation neural network model and the optimized and trained genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, the model performed better in simulation prediction, and the prediction accuracy could reach up to 91%, whereas the unoptimized back propagation neural network model could only reach 85%. It is feasible to apply this model for fault prediction of pipelines.</jats:p>"

Although supply chain visibility is crucial to enable and enhance visibility, there is no universally accepted definition. It has been defined by different researchers, emphasising its various features. Therefore, understanding, measuring and improving it is quite difficult. This study aims to create a broad theoretical framework for the supply chain visibility concept. In this direction, its definitions were gathered under a single roof and their dimensionality in the literature was presented. The study guided for companies and supply chains aiming to ensure and enhance their visibility. Additionally, it uncovered the contributions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to visibility. Companies and their supply chains can have superior visibility by utilising them. The study ended with the appraisal of the findings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The present study aims to examine the complex interplay between monetary policy and banks' credit provision in Pakistan. Monetary policy is a fundamental instrument central banks utilize to manage the money supply and control credit availability. It holds significant importance in influencing economic stability and fostering growth. This study examines multiple dimensions of the relationship mentioned above, encompassing the influence of interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market activities on banks' loan supply. The study utilizes panel data analysis to investigate a comprehensive set of bank-specific features and macroeconomic variables spanning 2005 to 2021. The study examines the impact of a restrictive monetary policy on the provision of credit by banks, providing insights into the relationship between central bank policies and lending practices. The outcomes of this study indicate that monetary policy exerts a substantial influence on banks' loan supply. Elevated interest rates tend to diminish the accessibility of credit, whilst reduced rates incentivize the provision of loans.\nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that alterations in reserve requirements and open market operations have a discernible impact on the loan supply dynamics of banks. Moreover, the research underscores the significance of various variables, including the size of banks, their liquidity levels, capital adequacy, profitability, credit risk, and debt-to-equity ratios, in influencing the accessibility of credit. Macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and inflation, significantly affect the propensity of banks to provide loans. In summary, this study highlights the complex relationship between monetary policy and the provision of credit by banks, highlighting the importance of central banks carefully adjusting policy tools to promote financial stability and facilitate economic goals. The results of this study offer significant insights for policymakers and financial institutions in Pakistan and add to the larger comprehension of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy on bank lending.\n<bold>Jel classification</bold>: A1, E3, E6, G28, E58</p>"

Recent investigations focus on curing surface and resin formation regulation to realize printing continuity. However, heat accumulation from light-curing exotherm is aggravated and multi-material printing is compromised with the realization of printing continuity. Here, we propose a continuous liquid supply 3D printing strategy through introducing supplied liquid into one-droplet 3D printing system. Timely curing of slices can be maintained inside droplet reservoir along with on-demand resin supply, decreased heat accumulation and unlimited printing volume can thus be realized. Additionally, supply species, quantity and distribution are controllable in slices, leading to continuous mode of muti-material printing. Multi-material 3D structures with controllable morphologies and distributions can be prepared with enhanced interfacial mechanical properties and clear boundaries, and has been applied in material distribution defined 3D anti-counterfeiting and magnetic-responsive moving trajectories, which guarantees a high efficiency and sustainable multi-material 3D fabrication route.</p>"

The scarcity of water as a finite resource and its availability and quality hold paramount importance for sustaining life, facilitating economic development, and promoting environmental well-being. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the drinking water supply chain, comprising a Public Water System (PWS) and a Bottled Water Plant (BWP) with government intervention. The study investigates the role of the government in motivating the BWP to increase its production greenness level while supporting the PWS to enhance the quality of tap water for citizens. It also evaluates the government's efforts to decrease the final price of tap water by providing subsidies for households and managing tap water demand through increasing public awareness. Furthermore, the study employs dynamic analysis to account for changes in population water consumption and precipitation over time, dividing the households' drinking water demand into three phases. Additionally, the study takes into account rainfall conditions, their uncertainty for water supply, and their impact on PWS profit.  We also develop mathematical modeling for water pricing and managing demand. The study employs concepts such as peak pricing and volumetric pricing for each stage and alterations in price that are penalty and incentive-based, depending on the amount of consumed water, season, or time of use. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and profitability of drinking water supply chains. The paper offers a practical illustration to showcase the effectiveness of mathematical models in a real-world scenario.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The operational performance of container ports is crucial for efficient logistics and trade. However, there is limited understanding of how external integration through Customer and Supplier Integration (SCI-CI and SCI-SI) impacts port operational performance (POP), particularly in emerging markets like Oman. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationship between SCI-CI, SCI-SI, and POP, and explores the mediating role of supply chain management (SCM) practices in this context. Using the Resource-Based View (RBV) as the theoretical framework, the study employed a quantitative cross-sectional survey method. A total of 377 questionnaires were distributed to managers at Sohar and Salalah ports, with 331 usable responses obtained, representing an 88 percent response rate. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that SCI-CI and SCI-SI have significant direct and indirect positive effects on POP, and they directly influence SCM practices. SCM practices, in turn, significantly enhance POP. Notably, SCM practices partially mediate the relationship between SCI-CI and SCI-SI with POP. These findings underscore the strategic importance of external integration and SCM practices as internal resources for improving port performance. This research provides valuable insights for decision-makers and policymakers in optimizing port operations.</jats:p>"

This research compares two well-known gamification tools, supply chain master card games and supply chain board games, in their capacity to teach supply chain management (SCM) concepts. Random sample interviews were conducted with students and employees to gather their perspectives on the games and SCM topics. The study evaluates the content delivery, level of understanding, and the advantages and disadvantages of using it for teaching and learning in a criteria table. It is aligned with the Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) 4 which is Quality Education in empowering sustainability through quality education. The findings demonstrate that gamification, including the use of these games, positively impacts the teaching and learning of supply chain management in Malaysian tertiary education. The results indicate that both the Supply Chain Card Game and the supply chain board game have significant advantages in enhancing student engagement, experiential learning, and the understanding of key SCM concepts which involve three (3) main measurements which are characteristics, content delivery, and level of understanding.  It improves student engagement, facilitates active learning, and fosters essential skill development. The recognition of gamification's potential has led to policy initiatives supporting its integration into the curriculum, aligning with the goals of learner-centered and experiential education. However, challenges remain in implementing gamified learning approaches effectively. The Malaysian government should acknowledge gamification's potential and provide support for teachers to incorporate gamification tools, including training programs, workshops, and educational resources. By addressing implementation challenges, the sustained integration of gamified learning approaches can be ensured in the Malaysian education system. This research emphasizes the significance of gamification in enhancing teaching techniques and its positive impact on student learning outcomes in the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Previous research has shown, however, that political attitudes and preferences do not change this fast. The Introduction argues that, to understand these patterns, one needs to appreciate the crucial role of social norms as drivers of political behavior. Building on a norms-based theory of political supply and demand, it maintains that growing radical-right behavior is driven by individuals who long held radical-right views, but did not act on them because they thought that they were socially unacceptable. If these voters do not show their views, politicians underestimate how much latent support there is for radical-right policy. This leaves the radical right with less skilled leaders, demobilizing even radical-right voters from voting for them. But, if politicians realize that there is more private support for radical-right policy than is typically observable, they have an incentive to run with a radical-right platform and mobilize silent radical-right views. Their electoral success, in turn, makes radical-right individuals more comfortable showing their views, and impels more politicians to join the radical right.</jats:p>",

It is argued here, however, that holistic models of political behavior need to take them into account. Norms can block the translation of preferences into behavior, bringing about gaps between the moment when individuals develop a given preference and the moment when they express them. The Conclusion discusses the need for a research agenda that takes norms as central drivers of political behavior. It lists several important questions that such a research agenda might draw upon. Finally, it discusses how a focus on social norms would allow political culture to return as a central topic in political science.</jats:p>",

First, we find that poorly capitalized banks are more likely to tighten their credit standards in loans to NFCs. Second, these banks have tended to tighten their credit standards more in loans to SMEs than in loans to large firms during the current restrictive monetary phase. Third, the transmission of monetary policy to credit standards in loans to NFCs is stronger in poorly capitalized banks. Fourth, the relationship between monetary policy and credit standards is driven by large contractionary monetary policy shocks, which reveals important asymmetries in the bank lending channel. Finally, a tightening of the monetary policy stance also increases rejection rates in loans to NFCs, to a greater extent in poorly capitalized banks.</jats:p>"

Specifically, This review aims to explore the applications of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques within the textile supply chain to enhance operational performance and decision-making processes. Utilizing a systematic literature review method, we analyzed articles from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on those that address MCDM applications in the textile supply chain. The findings reveal a strong emphasis on supplier selection and evaluation as determinants of competitive advantage, with significant trends toward integrating fuzzy set theory and advanced MCDM methodologies to address uncertainties. Additionally, Sustainability emerges as a core theme, emphasizing the necessity for firms to incorporate green practices into decision frameworks. The insights suggest that by adopting innovative analytical techniques, organizations can improve supplier relationships and operational efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The complexity and dynamism in business environments necessitate the adoption of advanced technologies to enhance supply chain (SC) processes and routines. In the pharmaceutical industry, maintaining high standards of safety and visibility within SCs is critical. Challenges arise from the proliferation of online medical stores and the need for uniform medication safety standards. The shift towards digital SCs has brought about significant changes, demanding improvements in efficiency and transparency. This study explores the potential of Blockchain technology (BcT) to revolutionize SC processes, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. By integrating BcT, which offers transparency and security, pharmaceutical SCs can address issues related to data integrity, cost management, and operational efficiency. Methods: A qualitative content analysis was conducted to assess the impact of BcT on SC practices, using transaction cost economics. The study evaluated how BcT can enhance visibility, reduce transaction costs, and improve the management of pharmaceutical SCs. Hyperledger Fabric, a BcT platform, was used to design and implement a secure medicine distribution system in a smart hospital setting. Results: Implementation of BcT through Hyperledger Fabric demonstrated significant improvements in transaction speed and efficiency. Performance tests showed consistent reaction times and transaction rates even with increasing user loads. For instance, the system maintained a reaction time increase of only 20 milliseconds with 300 users and achieved a mean transaction processing rate of 120 transactions per second with a user group of 300. Conclusion: The integration of BcT in pharmaceutical SCs addresses key issues related to safety, transparency, and efficiency. By utilizing BcT and Hyperledger Fabric, the study provides a robust framework for managing pharmaceutical supply chains, improving data integrity, and reducing transaction costs.</jats:p>",

In addition to the purpose of the building, the interior planning and volume dimensions, as well as the interior design, should be taken into account in providing light. However, proper lighting of workplaces plays an important role in both organizing the work routine and increasing the utility factor. Using both natural and artificial means as illuminators is one of the characteristics of the modern era.

This study reviews the impact factors of ESG practices on supply chain competitiveness, and empirically examines the mechanism of ESG performance on supply chains through a questionnaire survey with a sample of Chinese SMEs. It was found that normative pressure, coercive pressure and imitative pressure in SMEs have a significant positive effect on cognition and attitude and perceived behavioral control; good corporate cognition and attitude, perceived behavioral control and corporate pressure also enhance the level of ESG practices. Further analysis shows that cognition and attitude and perceived behavioral control play a mediating role in the impact of ESG practices, and ESG performance promotes sustainable development of SMEs. The article puts forward the following suggestions: (1) close supply chain partnerships to enhance green innovation; (2) the government should give more resource support to ESG-invested enterprises and support the development of advantageous enterprises; (3) improve the corporate disclosure mechanism and strengthen the supervision; and (4) strengthen the training of professionals in supply chain ESG management.</jats:p>"

To better describe the coordination relationship in the NEV supply chain, we introduce the Nash bargaining framework into the fairness concern preference utility function. Through a comprehensive discussion of shareholding ratios and external environment factors, we discover that the traditional shareholding strategy fails to coordinate the NEV supply chain effectively, as enterprises seek to avoid losing management control, which occurs when excessive shares are held by others. In this context, this study proposes a novel industry–university–research (IUR) shareholding strategy, which can more easily achieve supply chain coordination and improve social welfare. In particular, this study reveals the superiority of the novel strategy in eliminating the double-marginal effect caused by high fairness concern preference among NEV enterprises. Based on these facts, we provide enterprises with optimal strategies under different conditions and offer a government-optimal subsidy to maximize the social welfare function.</jats:p>"

Initially, relevant factors were identified through a comprehensive literature review, encompassing vulnerabilities both general supply chain and pertinent to forestry industry such as natural disruptions. Then, using fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), the relationships between these factors were modeled and simulated. An influence map was constructed based on expert opinions, facilitated by triangular fuzzy numbers to express expert judgments accurately. FCM simulations were conducted to analyze the effects of vulnerability factors of FSC on one another across three sustainability-themed scenarios: economically related vulnerabilities, socially related vulnerabilities, and environmentally related vulnerabilities.

It starts by outlining a common supply chain challenge and stressing the importance of agility and responsiveness in demand planning. The paper also points out the drawbacks of manual forecasting and the advantages of using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data to enhance forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency. Readers will gain insights into the key components of data-driven demand planning, including the integration of various data sources, the application of machine learning (ML) for accurate forecasting and the strategic implementation of exception-based management (EBM). Practical examples, such as automating forecast phasing and utilising suppliers, inputs, process, outputs and customers (SIPOC) process architecture, demonstrate how technology and human expertise can collaboratively enhance demand planning processes. By delving into the synergy between automation and human insight, the paper emphasises the balanced approach needed for effective demand planning. It also introduces unconventional forecasting methods like probabilistic forecasting and reinforcement learning, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of advanced forecasting techniques. Overall, readers can expect to learn how to implement data-driven strategies to achieve improved forecast accuracy, optimised inventory levels, enhanced customer satisfaction, increased profitability and greater business agility. This knowledge equips supply chain professionals with the tools to navigate the complexities of modern supply chain management and drive continuous improvement in their organisations.</jats:p>"

The study investigates the most common causes of data inaccuracies among automotive suppliers and their approaches to reduce consequential supply chain issues and be more agile. Data collection and analysis revealed that main issues arise due to ordering quantities mismatching actual customer demand, a wide range of order lot sizes, lead times and delivery reliability concerns and the reluctance to shift away from mainstream cost-effectiveness and towards strategic added value thinking. These issues sourced significant other related operational challenges such as excessive inventory, short-term stockouts and subsequent express shipping services or product-related inconveniences (quality and capacity levels, contracted volumes and dedicated lines). The paper sources different logistics and supply chain strategies used by the 3 OEMs, their features and operational performance, as well as their overall effectiveness, which can be applied by other automotive industry suppliers to improve own results. Introducing more reliable real-time data collection tools and performance metrics has started hauling more focus towards solving these prevalent issues with some ongoing improvement projects showing up to 25% better results. For one of the 3 OEMs introducing a new warehouse management system has already sourced an overall quality increase (5 percentage points) due to a 60% higher utilization of its production equipment.</jats:p>"

Despite many studies on supply chain management, there is still a lack of research on how Amazon uses operations research and data analytics to optimize its supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to explore how Amazon can improve the efficiency of its supply chain through operations research and data analytics techniques (e.g., linear programming, inventory control, and transportation modeling) to cope with increasing market demand. Through literature analysis and case studies, this paper examines in detail the optimization practices and technology applications of Amazon's supply chain management. The study uses data collected from Amazon as well as relevant academic articles and industry reports. The results of the study show that Amazon effectively uses advanced operations research models, such as linear programming, inventory control, and transportation models, to optimize various aspects of its supply chain. These models help reduce costs, manage inventory levels, and improve delivery efficiency. The analysis shows significant improvements in supply chain performance metrics, confirming Amazon's strategic use of data-driven decision-making.</jats:p>"

This chapter argues that norms can bring about a latency equilibrium, where voters do not publicly express their support for radical-right platforms. This makes politicians underestimate latent support for radical-right parties, leaving those parties with worse leaders, who are unable to mobilize even voters who privately hold radical-right views. At the voter level, radical-right preferences are more costly to express. Consequently, radical-right voters often hide their views. At the politician level, radical-right parties typically have low-skilled leaders, but this is especially so when there are strong norms against radical-right views. Finally, the chapter shows how this equilibrium can be overcome. If individuals learn that there is more private support for their ideology than is typically observable, they become more willing to run for election.</jats:p>",

The entrepreneur can read into this cue and realize that there is more private radical-right support than is typically observable. This gives them an incentive to run for election with the stigmatized ideology, activating silent radical-right preferences in their society. Following outgroup threat triggers, such as Islamist attacks, individuals disregard norms more. At the politician level, more intense attacks make new politicians run for election on radical-right platforms. These entrepreneurs are more skilled, and do better electorally.

The paper examines how these practices, when applied in a coordinated and efficient manner, help to reduce costs and carbon emissions, while also improving resource-sharing between companies located within eco-industrial parks. The results show that implementing circular supply chain management significantly enhances the performance of companies operating within EIPs. Firms that adopt renewable energy sources and optimize their transportation systems using electric vehicles report a 13-14% reduction in operational costs and carbon emissions. The integration of technologies such as Geographic Information Systems and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making tools has also proven beneficial in the site selection and planning of eco-industrial parks, allowing for the optimization of logistics and resource allocation. In Ukraine, which is currently facing critical challenges due to war, adopting these strategies can strengthen industrial clusters, reduce dependence on external resources, and enhance resilience against economic shocks. The scientific novelty of this research lies in the proposed structure of the logistics supply for eco-industrial parks’ residents. The practical implications of this paper include the application of green logistics technologies, the development of self-sustaining energy networks, and the implementation of closed-loop supply chains that promote resource efficiency. Future research directions should focus on the development of logistics optimization models for Ukrainian eco-industrial parks, particularly in war-torn areas, and the assessment of their long-term economic and environmental impact. Additionally, the paper advocates for the expanded use of renewable energy sources and Geographic Information Systems-based planning tools to further improve logistics processes and reduce the ecological footprint of industrial activities. The results of this paper underscore the importance of inter-firm cooperation and the strategic use of logistics to foster both economic and environmental resilience in eco-industrial settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of a firm’s key strategic decisions is whether to concentrate its input purchases in a small number of suppliers versus spreading them among many suppliers. We propose that supplier concentration solves an interfirm free-riding problem: By internalizing externalities between suppliers, it incentivizes buyer-supplier cooperation. Guided by a simple theoretical model, we investigate this hypothesis on slot exchanges between major airlines and their outsourced regional airline partners during inclement weather, a setting where externalities between suppliers are ubiquitous. We find robust evidence that a regional airline engages in more frequent slot exchanges with its major airline partner when it operates a larger share of the major’s outsourced flights. We also find that this positive effect of concentration on mutual cooperation increases in the size of the externalities between regionals. Our results suggest that, in contrast with Porter’s classic five forces framework, supplier concentration can serve as a governance instrument for buyer-supplier collaborations. More broadly, our paper provides novel evidence on task concentration as a tool to solve free-riding problems in multiagent settings. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This paper received financial support from the Spanish Research Agency (MICIU/AEI) [Grants PID2022-136983NB-I00, MCIN/AEI /10.13039/501100011033]. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03455 . </jats:p>"

This chapter argues that, when the radical right makes an electoral breakthrough, societies can be tipped into a surfacing equilibrium, where voters with previously covert radical-right preferences become more comfortable openly expressing them. Politicians, in turn, become less likely to underestimate the electoral viability of radical-right parties, and are more willing to join one. The chapter shows that after radical-right parties break through, individuals who already supported them in private feel more comfortable publicly showing that support. Then, as radical-right parties grow electorally, more politicians are willing to join those parties as compared to parties that are not radical right. The translation of preferences into behavior is thus not automatic, but rather is mediated by perceptions of social acceptability. Norms affect the interplay of political demand and supply.</jats:p>",

There are three phases to political normalization: first, a latency phase, where the radical right is socially stigmatized, electorally weak, and has low-skilled leaders; second, an activation phase, where a skilled entrepreneur enters the race with a radical-right platform and is able to mobilize radical-right support in the voting booth, but still not in public; and finally, a surfacing phase, where the entrepreneur achieves an electoral breakthrough, making radical-right individuals more comfortable publicly acting on their views and impelling more politicians to join the radical right.</jats:p>",

Concentrated solar thermal technology, thanks to cost-effective high-temperature thermal energy storage solutions, can respond to the renewable thermal energy needs of the industrial sector, thus supporting the decarbonization of hard-to-abate processes. Particularly, parabolic trough technology using binary molten salts as heat transfer fluid and storage medium, operating up to 550 °C, could potentially supply a large part of the high-temperature process heat required by the industry. In this work, four industrial processes, representative of the Italian industrial context, that are well suited for integration with molten salt concentrators are presented and discussed, conceiving for each considered process a specific coupling solution with the solar plant, sizing the solar field and the thermal storage unit, and computing the cost of the process heat and its variation with the storage capacity. Considering cost data from the literature associated with the pre-COVID-19 era, an LCOH comprising the range 5–10 c€/kWhth was obtained for all the cases studied, while taking into account more updated cost data, the calculated LCOH varies from 7 to 13 c€/kWhth.</jats:p>"

Further research is needed to understand plant preference for different nitrogen sources and to select appropriate nitrogen sources to improve fertilizer use efficiency. The relationship between soil nutrient dynamics and seedling physiology was studied, and the effects of different nitrogen fertilizers on the growth of <italic>Phyllostachys edulis</italic> seedlings under low phosphorus conditions were evaluated.\nMethods\n Under four different forms of nitrogen supply (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-N; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N; NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-N + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N; Org-N) and two phosphorus treatment conditions (deficient, 5.0 mg·kg<sup>− 1</sup>; sufficient, 20 mg·kg<sup>− 1</sup>).\nResults\n Low phosphorus can alter the nutrient environment of some substrates and inhibit the growth of bamboo seedlings, but it improves the efficiency of plant phosphorus utilization; Low phosphorus has a strong inhibitory effect on bamboo, and under low phosphorus conditions, the proportion of amino acid components in bamboo is imbalanced. But it will enhance its adaptability to low phosphorus stress by coordinating the root to shoot ratio, changing the root morphology, improving the efficiency of nitrogen transport and metabolism in roots, stems, and leaves, enhancing the efficiency of leaf electron transfer, and redistributing nutrient resources. In addition, supplying NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N fertilizer under low phosphorus conditions can increase the root to shoot ratio of bamboo, promote the absorption of phosphorus and metal ions by roots, improve nitrogen transport and metabolic efficiency, enhance leaf light utilization capacity, and alleviate the inhibitory effect of bamboo under low phosphorus stress. However, supplying NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-N + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N fertilizer under suitable phosphorus conditions is more conducive to improving the photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen transport and metabolic efficiency of bamboo seedlings, resulting in a significant increase in their total biomass. Therefore, in the actual production and cultivation of bamboo seedlings, attention should be paid to the supply form of nitrogen fertilizer.\nConclusions\n Single ammonium nitrogen fertilizer was more suitable for planting bamboo seedlings in natural forest land with seriously low phosphorus, while mixed inorganic nitrogen fertilizer was more suitable for planting bamboo seedlings in soil with reasonable phosphorus fertilizer. It provides theoretical basis for the cultivation and nutrient management practice of bamboo industry.</p>"

Governments can thus use this considerable purchasing power to promote environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and economic efficiency, while encouraging the supplier market to innovate and adopt more sustainable practices to remain competitive, and to generate more resilient supply chains. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the subject of sustainable public procurement (SPP), the documentation is abundant and diverse, hence the need for an updated literature review especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis period. This article consists of a systematic literature review focusing on articles with an empirical approach. The results reveal, among other things, 8 main research themes subdivided into 19 sub-themes, with a dominance of literature on the obstacles and incentives related to the implementation of SPP, while those concerning e-procurement and the analysis of the social life cycle remain relatively limited. The study also underscores the role of local economies and SMEs in public procurement strategies. It highlights a trend towards geographical diversification, indicating the global significance of SPP, with noticeable differences in adoption between developed and developing countries. The review calls for future research to focus on developing practical frameworks and tools for integrating sustainability more comprehensively in public procurement. The findings illuminate the pivotal role of SPP as a mechanism steering societies towards a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future, particularly in a post-pandemic world.</jats:p>"

However pharmaceutical companies in the Anambra State have been facing obstacles recently due to disruptions in their supply chains. This research investigates how supply chain disruptions impact the sustainability of firms in Anambra State. A mixed-methods approach, involving qualitative interviews with industry experts and quantitative analysis of operational data, identifies the main causes of supply chain disruptions and their effects on this firm’s long-term success. The research reveals that supply chain disruptions result from factors such as delays in customs clearance, inconsistent regulatory policies, currency fluctuations, inadequate transportation infrastructure and issues with supplier reliability. Interviews with industry experts highlighted customs delays as a disruption while quantitative analysis showed a 20% increase in times for imported pharmaceuticals along with a 15% rise in delivery delays and a 10% increase in product returns due to transportation challenges. Moreover, inefficiencies in inventory management were observed, leading to a 5% rise in holding costs and a 3% decrease in turnover rates due to supply chains. Challenges related to suppliers involved issues, with delivery reliability and product quality leading to a 10% extension in supplier lead times and a 5% uptick, in returns. The findings highlighted a direct correlation between these supply chain issues and decreased profitability, operational efficiency, and the ability to meet patient needs, emphasizing the urgent need for improvements to enhance the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain in Anambra State.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

As energy resources are becoming more and more expensive, improving the energy efficiency of grain dryers is an urgent task. Modernising the design of dryers can improve their energy efficiency. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redesign the ducts to reduce heat loss and improve energy efficiency. However, feeding the drying agent through smooth channels leads to significant heat losses, which reduces efficiency. The longer the feed channel, the greater the heat loss, resulting in inadequate grain drying temperature, longer drying time and higher energy consumption. It is possible to reduce the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the feed channel by intensifying the process through the use of turbuliser protrusions. The optimum aperture height and spacing for turbulent flow should be selected depending on the circumstances.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of supply disruption, having a resilient supply chain is crucial for the survival and growth of enterprises. It is also essential for gaining a competitive advantage in a turbulent environment. Enterprises need to invest in supply chain resilience to better deal with future uncertainties. This paper constructs a Stackelberg game model with the manufacturer as the leader and the retailer as the follower. We explored how supply chain-related factors under supply interruption risk affect supply chain resilience investment, and studied how to choose supply chain coordination strategies to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer capacity recovery and mutual profits in the context of supply interruption. The study also analyzes the asymmetrical impact of changes in product order quantity, supply disruption probability, and the capacity recovery coefficient on retailer decision-making and the profits of supply chain members. The results indicate that manufacturer profits are negatively correlated with supply disruption probability, while retailer profits are positively correlated with supply disruption probability when product order quantities are low and negatively correlated when product order quantities are high. The supply chain resilience investment is positively correlated with the supply disruption probability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the cost-sharing contract is closely related to product order quantity and supply disruption probability. When the product order quantity d&lt;αL−c[1−ξaL+ξaH]+sαHξ+wαL(1−ξ)k or αH−c[1−ξaL+ξaH]+sαHξ+wαL(1−ξ)k&lt;d&lt;αH[1−ξaL+ξaH](w−c)k, manufacturers can withstand the risk of supply interruption by investing in supply chain resilience alone. But when the product order quantity is αL−c[1−ξaL+ξaH]+sαHξ+wαL(1−ξ)k&lt;d&lt;αH−c[1−ξaL+ξaH]+sαHξ+wαL(1−ξ)k and αH[1−ξaL+ξaH](w−c)k&lt;d, the use of cost-sharing contracts is more effective. Additionally, when the sensitivity analysis is conducted, the capacity recovery coefficient positively correlates with supply chain profits in a decentralized mode. However, under the cost-sharing contract mode, it exhibits a U-shaped fluctuation pattern, indicating that the impact of improving capacity recovery efficiency on the profits of both parties is not symmetrical and linear. As ξ approaches 0.5, the profits of manufacturers and retailers decrease. Instead, it undergoes an initial decline followed by a subsequent increase, highlighting the nonlinear benefits of capacity recovery strategies under the cooperative approach.</jats:p>"

This study integrates least-cost path analysis with Kriging interpolation to simulate the dominant wind direction and corrects the interpolated wind speeds to account for terrain and surface conditions. Carbon emissions are spatially distributed using points of interest and road network data. Ultimately, by traversing the carbon emission rate grids along wind directions, the ECSS flows are simulated. The results reveal that the study area has a small carbon sink area but a high total carbon emission, leading to a situation where the supply of ECSS is insufficient to meet demand. The ECSS flows, based on the simulated wind field, demonstrate high spatial resolution and highlight the service flow corridors with distinct spatial heterogeneity. The study area has a significant carbon surplus, requiring a forest area ten times larger than the study area itself to fully sequester this carbon. These findings provide valuable insights for urban sustainable development and carbon emission reduction strategies.</jats:p>"

How to deal with the increase in environmental uncertainty has become an important problem facing the high-quality development of Chinese enterprises. Chinese enterprises generally face financing constraints, and weak debt financing channels hinder the process of high-quality development of enterprises. How to improve debt financing capabilities has become a practical problem that Chinese enterprises urgently need to solve in response to the increase in environmental uncertainty. This paper first introduces the concept, characteristics and common patterns of supply chain finance , and also explains the definition of uncertainty environment and its impact on corporate operations and financing. By systematically combing through relevant domestic and foreign literature, this paper summarizes the results of existing research on supply chain finance, uncertainty environment and corporate debt financing behavior, laying a theoretical foundation for subsequent analysis. Secondly, this paper demonstrates the specific application of supply chain finance in an uncertain environment and its impact on corporate debt financing behavior through case analysis. By analyzing the success factors of these cases, such as risk management, support from financial institutions and technological innovation, the application value of supply chain finance in an uncertain environment is revealed. It is hoped that theoretical support and practical guidance will be provided for policymakers, financial institutions and enterprises to promote the development of supply chain finance and promote sound financing of enterprises.</jats:p>"

Drawing upon data spanning from 2007 to 2020 from Chinese listed companies, the research unveils that the digital metamorphosis of enterprises substantially diminishes the concentration within their supply chains. Interestingly, TMTs’ overseas experiences exhibit a mitigating effect on this phenomenon, indicating that such experiences significantly foster the reduction of supply chain concentration propelled by enterprise digital transformation. Moreover, they facilitate the diversification of supply chains. Further analysis underscores that this influence is more pronounced in non-high-tech sectors and privately-owned enterprises. This investigation highlights a noteworthy trend: as Chinese enterprises embrace digitalization, their supply chain configurations tend towards greater diversification rather than centralized structures. These findings underscore the pivotal role of TMTs' international exposure in shaping the dynamics of supply chain evolution amidst the digital transformation landscape.</jats:p>"

We use ADANCO 2.3.2 for variance-based structural equation modeling. The results show that two of the nine hypotheses are negatively significant, while the rest are positive. In our context, social sustainability and computer self-efficacy are strongly negatively significant for the adoption intention of blockchain technology in our context.

Furthermore, given the perishable nature of most agricultural products, consumers exhibit a preference for high-quality logistics services. This paper analyses the dynamics of the agricultural supply chain, beginning with the “leading enterprises + farmers” production mode, and establishes two optimal decision-making models for online and offline dual-channel agricultural supply chains, incorporating logistics service levels. The first model considers centralised decision-making, where leading agricultural producers and community superstores make decisions simultaneously, aiming to maximise the overall profit of the supply chain. The second model addresses decentralised decision-making in which the producer, as the dominant player in a Stackelberg game, anticipates the reactions of retailers and sets the wholesale price, online sales price, and online logistics service level accordingly. Retailers, as followers, then determine the offline sales price and offline logistics service level based on the producer’s decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the proposed models. Our findings reveal that as consumer focus on logistics service levels increases, the overall profit of the supply chain improves, and as the unit logistics cost corresponding to the level of logistics service increases, the marginal benefits of decreasing profit brought about by the increase in unit logistics cost also decrease.</jats:p>"

Poor cybersecurity decision-making can have significant consequences, such as failure to protect sensitive data, prevent cyberattacks, or quickly respond to security incidents (Fischhoff &amp; Broomell, 2020). The following qualitative study explored how these decision-making capabilities manifest in the cyber risk rating of third-party vendors, particularly under the influence of cognitive biases.

The chapter argues that the breakthrough of the AfD is to be understood via the process of normalization. Before it, Germany was in a latency equilibrium where many voters held radical-right views in private, but did not publicly express them for fear of social sanctions. Consequently, many politicians self-selected out of radical-right parties, which ended up with worse leaders that even radical-right voters did not support. The 2015 refugee crisis triggered politicians to realize that there was more latent support for radical-right policy than anticipated. Skilled political entrepreneurs then took over the AfD and made it a clear radical-right party. As they became electorally successful, individuals who already held radical-right views in private became more comfortable expressing them in public.</jats:p>",

This also applies to railway signal boxes. The aim of the research work was to test the multisource power supply system for a railway signal box with power electronic converter systems and a DC bus, built as part of the research project. The assumption for powering the railway signal box building was to use renewable sources, energy storage devices, and a 3 kV DC traction network as the second required power supply grid. Both power grids were connected by power electronic converters, and the power values of the converters were set based on the calculated power balance values using the values measured at the system nodes and the set constraints. The tests primarily tested the response of the power supply system to changes in load power and power generated by the photovoltaic source, as well as the charge level of the energy storage devices. The correctness of the control algorithm’s operation was assessed based on the recorded power values in the power supply system nodes. The tests were carried out for 60 scenarios that covered all normal and emergency operating conditions. During the tests, delays in response to changes in the power supplied to the converters and the values of circular power flow between the power grid connections were recorded. The recorded delays ranged from 2 to about 50 s and the circular power flows did not exceed 1500 W. Based on the results of the tests, it was found necessary to improve the power measurement system in the power supply system nodes and to improve the quality of communication and the transmission time of measurement data transmission time.</jats:p>"

Research focuses on the transparency, security, and efficiency improvements brought about by blockchain technology, and how these improvements can help address information asymmetry issues in supply chain management and improve overall operational efficiency. At the same time, the study explored the working principle of the practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism, proposed relevant improvement measures, and analyzed how these improvements can be effectively applied in the scenario of supply chain information sharing to improve the stability and efficiency of the overall system. The research results show that the overall latency of improved PBFT is maintained at the millisecond level, while the latency of traditional PBFT can reach several seconds or exceed 10 seconds. In terms of CPU resource consumption, the demand for improving PBFT only shows linear growth, while the demand for traditional PBFT increases sharply. In addition, improving PBFT also has significant advantages in communication costs. In an 8-node network, the communication volume of improved PBFT is only 11.27 KB, while traditional PBFT is 43.67 KB. In terms of throughput and latency performance, the improved PBFT can handle over 16000 requests per second in a 16 node network, significantly better than the traditional PBFT’s approximately 8000 requests. Meanwhile, at 64 nodes, the improved version has a latency of 301.7 milliseconds, much lower than the traditional version’s 510.2 milliseconds. These improvements demonstrate the advantages of improving PBFT in enhancing supply chain transparency, security, and efficiency, providing effective technical support for the digitization and intelligence of supply chain management. We hope that research can promote the digitization and intelligence of supply chain management, and facilitate the efficient operation and optimization of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Based on 74 publications from reliable sources, including Science Direct, JSTOR, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, this review combines data to highlight important concepts, conceptual frameworks, and research findings. According to the review, supply chain strategies that incorporate sustainability principles can improve social responsibility, environmental performance, and economic viability—all of which support long-term competitiveness. The analysis reveals that among the key success factors within SSC that are related to social and environmental impacts, operational resilience and continuity, financial performance, technological innovation, technological innovation, differentiation, regulatory compliance and industry standards, customer satisfaction and loyalty, and resource efficiency and cost savings. Transparency and traceability, market and reputation benefits, risk management techniques, and circular economy ideas are some of the best ways that SSC practices boost company competitiveness. However, some of the biggest obstacles to supply chain management (SSCM) that undermine firm competitiveness are high beginning costs, complexity, supply chain interruptions, and market constraints. The review expands on our knowledge of the ways in which SSCM boosts corporate competitiveness. Discussions are held regarding conclusions, suggestions for additional study, and theoretical and practical ramifications.\n</jats:p>"

KRAS mutation in pancreatic cancer increased the dependency on glutamine and consumption of proline. Proline is a non-essential amino acid but it is important for the synthesis of proteins such as collagen, and also for precursors of antioxidant molecules. Several enzymes such as P5CS(ALDH18A1),PYCR1 and PYCR2 are involving proline synthesis. The effects of proline synthesis enzymes on pancreatic cancer cells are relatively less studied than that of enzymes catalyzing proline. Here, we examined the impact of proline synthesis enzymes on pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation. We first examined that exogenous proline promotes cell survival under low glutamine conditions in various pancreatic cancer cells. Exogenous proline supplementation increased some pancreatic cell survival even when glutamine was not sufficiently available, whereas proline supplement is dispensible for certain cell types of pancreatic cancer. Next, to investigate the importance of proline synthesis enzymes in cell survival, we measured the cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer with knock-down the proline synthesis enzymes. The knockdown of ALDH18A1 and PYCR1,2, which are proline biosynthesis enzyme genes, reduced cell survival in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that in PDAC cells, the enzymes that synthesize proline from glutamine are crucial for cancer cell survival and growth. To test the effect of proline-sysnthesis enzymes on autophagy, we measured autophagy flux in the cell harboring GFP-RFP-LC3 or GFP-LC3 as a reporter. Knockdown of proline synthesis enzymes, particularly ALDH18A1 or PYCR1 led to an increase in autophagy levels, indicating that proline-independent cells can bypass proline synthesis by autophagy induction in the absence of proline synthesis genes. Furthermore gemcitabine-resistant cells showed reduced levels of proline synthesis enzymes. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, proline promotes cancer cell survival, generated by both biosynthesis from glutamine and starvation-induced autophagy, which also critically important for supporting cellular drug resistance. Taken together, these results indicate that proline synthesis is mechanistically associated with autophagy induced by glutamine-starvation, which is pivotal for supplying proline in pancreatic cancer cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Ji hyeon Kim, Heesun Cheong.

The gap provides a measure of the strength of social norms for or against that behavior. In an application of this logic, a measure of political stigma is proposed, called reported vote. Reported vote captures the proportion of the official vote for a party that is declared in post-electoral surveys. If there is a strong social norm against supporting a party, even individuals who voted for it have an incentive not to admit that they did so. A number of validation tests are presented for reported vote as a measure of political stigma.

Studies in relevant literature discuss the sustainability performances of FSCs generally without distinguishing between the internal and external stakeholders’ concerns or clarifying the existence of greenwashing or bluewashing attempts, jeopardizing true sustainability. This is why modelling towards some holistic treatment of the problem that satisfies those concerns is required. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the true sustainability performance of FSCs by considering triple bottom line indicators, i.e. economic, environmental and social. In light of the proposed framework, two models have been developed, one calculating the internal and the other an external sustainability score. The presented models can handle interval or ordinal qualitative and quantitative indicators concurrently while considering desirable and undesirable factors. These novel models have been implemented on data from 50 FSCs in Istanbul, using a two-stage imprecise data envelopment analysis with a special multiplier. To facilitate visualization of true sustainability assessment, an internal–external sustainability performance matrix is proposed. Results reveal that the internal sustainability performance of the focal FSCs is better than the external one. The economic dimension predominates in Turkish FSCs’ internal sustainability performance, while the environmental and social dimensions predominate in the external sustainability performance of the FSCs.</jats:p>"

With their service-oriented architecture (SOA), which can be used for any system design, web services can increase flexibility. Fusing Web services architecture with Semantic Web services can better assist supply chain coordination in a distributive, autonomous, and ever-changing corporate environment than current information technology. Decisions must be made quickly and with enough information many systems fail to provide real-time supply chain insight. Forecasting, inventory management, and decision-making may all be impacted by poor data quality. Modifying preexisting systems according to unique organizational needs may be challenging and expensive. Hence, this paper proposes a semantic web service-based supply chain management framework (SWS-SCMF) to analyze the web services in supply chains and examine how they interact using Web Ontology Language (OWL)-S, including automated discovery, construction, and invocation. The suggested method for improving supply chain data integration uses an ontology-based multiple-agent decision support system. Different accessibility tools, data formats, management information systems, semantic web, and databases are integrated across the five interconnected levels of the system. Businesses may find the proposed approach useful for data and information sharing when dealing with complex supply chain management. The suggested SWS-SCMF is an adaptable, accurate, and effective method for bidirectional chaining composition that uses mediators to enable the automated composition of Semantic Web services.

SCM has both designed and monitored numerous tasks with the following phases such as allocation, creation, product sourcing, and warehousing. Based on this perspective, the privacy of data flow is more important among producers, suppliers, and customers to ensure the responsibility of the market. This work aims to develop a novel Improved Digital Navigator Assessment (DNA)-based Self Improved Pelican Optimization Algorithm (IDNA-based SIPOA model) for secured data transmission in SCM via blockchain. An improved DNA cryptosystem is done for the process of preservation for data. The original message is encrypted by Improved Advanced Encryption Standard (IAES). The optimal key generation is done by the proposed SIPOA algorithm. The efficiency of the adopted model has been analyzed with conventional methods with regard to security for secured data exchange in SCM.

The aim is to enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness by minimizing non-value-added tasks in warehouse operations.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This study investigates the transition from an Assisted-Picker model to a Solo-Picker model at a prominent 3PL service provider in India. The analysis compares two approaches for picking orders—pairing laborers versus employing a Solo-Picker—using metrics such as travel time and picking time.\r\nFindings: Results reveal that while the Assisted-Picker model may initially show faster completion times for individual orders, the Solo-Picker model proves more efficient overall. This is attributed to the elimination of idle time associated with helpers and enhanced labor utilization efficiency. Real-time productivity data collected during the study period demonstrate a remarkable 44% increase in productivity with the Solo-Picker model, resulting in substantial Labor-Savings and significant reductions in operational costs.\r\nImplications to Theory, Practice and Policy: This study highlights the critical importance of reevaluating traditional labor allocation strategies in warehouse environments. By identifying and eliminating non-value-added work, warehouses can move closer to lean and efficient supply chain management practices, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and cost-efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research presents a uni-regression deep approximate forecasting model for predicting future demand in supply chains, tackling issues like complex patterns, external factors, and nonlinear relationships. It diverges from traditional models by employing a deep learning strategy through recurrent bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX), focusing on regression-based approaches. The model can capture intricate dependencies and patterns that elude conventional approaches. The integration of BiLSTM and NARX provides a robust foundation for accurate demand forecasting. The novel uni-regression technique significantly improves the model’s capability to detect intricate patterns and dependencies in supply chain data, offering a new angle for demand forecasting. This approach not only broadens the scope of modeling techniques but also underlines the value of deep learning for enhanced accuracy in the fluctuating supply chain sector. The uni-regression model notably outperforms existing models in accuracy, achieving the lowest errors: mean average error (MAE) at 1.73, mean square error (MSE) at 4.14, root mean square error (RMSE) at 2.03, root mean squared scaled error (RMSSE) at 0.020, and R-squared at 0.94. This underscores its effectiveness in forecasting demand within dynamic supply chains. Practitioners and decision-makers can leverage the uni-regression model to make informed decisions, optimize inventory management, and enhance supply chain resilience. Furthermore, the findings contribute to the ongoing evolution of supply chain demand forecasting methodologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While many countries have witnessed the retreat of the state from social housing under neoliberalism, the Chinese government has taken the opposite trajectory, significantly expanding its involvement in public rental housing (PRH) over the past decade through substantial investments. However, the effectiveness of the PRH program has come under scrutiny due to its inability to meet the demand for housing units while grappling with a substantial vacancy rate. This study aims to unravel this paradox by utilizing a unique city-level database that encompasses information on public rental housing stock, land supply, waiting time, and allocation practices. The data suggest that there is a structural mismatch between supply and demand for PRH in China, with both high and low vacancy rates in different cities, and even high vacancy and high allocation rates co-existing in one city. The results of estimating the OLS regression model of PRH supply and demand indicate that the actual supply fails to align with the policy objectives and the actual housing demand. Rather, they are more a result of the power relationship between the central and local governments, and cities with high fiscal autonomy provide fewer PRH. Furthermore, local governments fail to set eligibility criteria in response to housing supply, demand, and allocation, further exacerbating the mismatch. This paper provides policy recommendations that aim to enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of the PRH program, contributing to more equitable urban development.</jats:p>"

Bennch Sheko Zone is one of the major rice growing areas in the South Western Regional State. The study was conducted with specific objectives to investigate factors affecting smallholder farmers’ market supply of rice and identify constraints related to rice production in the study area. Two-stage sampling technique was employed to select 119 representative rice-producer households. Descriptive statistics and appropriate econometric models were used to analyze the collected data. Multiple linear regression model used to analyze factors affecting rice market supply. Descriptive result of the study showed, the average annual rice production at the household level was 2.8 tons, of which 70% was supplied to the market. Econometric result showed farm size owned, credit use, annual income, number of oxen owned, and quantity of rice produced were found to be significantly affecting the market supply of rice in a district. Major constraints related to rice production in the district were a lack of proper weed management practices, improved seed, proper method and time of fertilizer application, weak institutional support, disease, and post-harvest handling problems were also important. The research findings suggest that attention should be given to rice production constraints through generation and wide demonstration of demand-driven rice production and post-harvest handling technologies for increased production and productivity to have a better market supply of rice to the market and benefit smallholder farmers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the labor legal liability of multinational corporations within the global supply chain in the context of economic globalization.  The legal governance of this issue has complexity because it involves multiple stakeholders, including international organizations, nations, and multinational corporations. Thus it necessitates coordinated efforts in legislation, judicial processes, and self-regulation. While existing laws and the labor compliance efforts of some multinational corporations have partially safeguarded labor rights, significant deficiencies remain. Addressing these deficiencies requires sustained legislative and judicial input from public entities. This requires more substantial protection and even expansion of the supervisory power of international organizations, such as the establishment of a tripartite negotiation mechanism to ensure their right to participate as independent subjects in labor rights protection. Improving the litigation procedure legislation to give international organizations the right to file public interest litigation to protect the rights and interests of workers in domestic courts will also be a probable choice. Additionally, multinational corporations must take concrete steps to uphold labor rights. Possible practices include assigning independent labor oversight bodies to suppliers and involving labor representatives in labor compliance efforts. Clarifying and enhancing the management of their labor legal responsibilities requires the joint efforts of public and private entities.</jats:p>"

Based on a comparison of analytical dependencies used to describe the flow entry laws into the pipelines in each case, relatively simple and practical calculation formulas have been derived to determine the required degree of the side walls perforation of the drainage pipeline. These formulas ensure that the desired water flow rate is achieved in the collector. The degree of perforation S in this work is defined as the ratio of the area of the perforation holes (slots) in the side walls of the drainage pipeline to the total area of its side surface. In the analysis of the pipelines considered, parameter A is used, which comprehensively accounts for both the design and filtration characteristics of the drainage pipelines. Relevant analytical dependencies and a graph for determining this parameter are presented. A series of calculations have been performed using the proposed formulas to determine the degree of perforation for these pipelines. It is shown that, in general, the magnitude of the perforation degree is influenced by both the structural characteristics of the pipeline itself and the filtration properties of the surrounding soil and the surface of the drainage pipes.</jats:p>"

Given these challenges, effective management of resource and material flows by managers has become increasingly complex. Supply chain management is crucial for businesses to sustain competitive market positioning. This study distinctively explores the interplay between supply chain management and the financial performance of manufacturing companies, highlighting the increasingly dynamic and competitive global markets. It scrutinizes the moderating roles of supply chain agility and flexibility in this relationship, offering diverse analytical perspectives. The research methodology involved surveying white-collar employees within these companies. Factor analysis was employed to affirm the scale’s validity, and the Hayes model 3 method was utilized to test hypotheses. Our research uncovered intricate interactions between supply chain management, agility, and resilience, underscoring their collective impact on financial performance. The thesis that supply chain management has a substantial impact on financial performance was corroborated by the study’s results. The study also emphasizes the moderating impact of supply chain agility in the relationship between financial performance and supply chain management. The results of the study that supply chain resilience moderates the moderating effect of supply chain agility indicate that the interaction between supply chain resilience and supply chain agility may affect the relationship between supply chain management and financial performance if supply chain resilience enhances the resilience of organizations to external challenges. These insights suggest organizations must integrate agility, management, and resilience considerations in their supply chains to optimize performance. This study contributes a novel viewpoint to the literature, providing strategic guidance for managerial decision making.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Dniester is a transboundary river between Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. It is the second longest river in Ukraine and the ninth in Europe. From its source to a town of Staryi Sambir, the Dniester flows through the Carpathian Mountains, then across the flat territory of Ukraine and Moldova.\r\nThe Dniester Basin extends across seven regions in southwestern Ukraine (Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Vinnytsia, Chernivtsi and Odesa Regions). A small area of the river in its upper reaches is located in Poland. The basin's shape is a very elongated oval that is curved in the middle, about 700 km long with an average width of 120 km.\r\nAs it flows into the Black Sea, the Dniester River forms the Dniester estuary in Odesa region (between Ovidiopol and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi districts). The estuary area of the Dniester River is a complex landscape system at the sea-river-land contact.\r\n Drinking water is an important factor determining a person's health. Due to the intensive development of industry, agriculture and utility services, the number of pollutants that enter the environment and worsen the quality of drinking water in Ukraine keeps increasing. This increases the risk of toxic and infectious diseases spread among the population that consumes such low-quality water. That is why solving the problem of drinking water monitoring and assessment of its quality is a pressing task requiring urgent action.\r\nThe article examines the quality of water for drinking needs at the water intake site of the Dniester River, a town of Biliaivka, for 2018-2022. Water quality assessment was carried out according to DSTU 4808: 2007 based on average and worst values. The methodology covers 80 indicators and, in accordance with sanitary legislation, is divided into seven separate groups (blocks). According to hygienic standards, the quality of river water is considered suitable for use if it belongs to quality classes 1-3. In this research, the analysis was carried out according to 23 indicators included in three groups, so the assessment is considered as tentative: Group I - organoleptic indicators (chromaticity, turbidity); Group II - general sanitary indicators (dry residue (mineralization), sulfates, chlorides, magnesium, alkalinity, hydrogen index, ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphate phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, bichromate oxidation (COD), BSK5); Group VII – toxicological parameters (total iron, manganese, chromium (VI), zinc, petroleum products, synthetic surface active agents (surfactants), volatile phenols).\r\nIt was determined that, according to the average values, the water quality of the Dniester at the water intake site is characterized as \"good\", which means it has clean water of acceptable quality. As for the worst indicators, the water was assessed as transitional in quality from \"good\" (clean) to \"satisfactory\" (slightly polluted).</jats:p>"

Thus, these practices are not suitable for building effective policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study proposes an approach to forecast greenhouse gas-free supply chain potential based on the producible renewable energy certificate amount to be able to build consistent, realistic, effective, and applicable policies to reduce emissions and promote renewable energy production. The greenhouse gas-free supply chain potential of countries and states can be measured and tracked through their total energy consumption certified with renewable energy certificates. By proportioning this value to the total energy consumption of the supply chain, the extent to which the green transformation has been achieved can be measured and scaled. The proposed model is built on fuzzy logic since renewable energy certificates contain uncertainties, and there is not enough data to make machine learning-supported forecasts because it is a developing field and an innovative business. The developed model is applied to the example of Türkiye, and the practical greenhouse gas-free supply chain potential of Türkiye is forecasted as 30.9 million megawatts (equivalent to 221 thousand ten-year trees) for 2024. Even in possible adverse events in the market and climatic conditions, it is not expected to decrease below 22.7 million megawatts. By considering these calculations, more realistic and more applicable obligatory energy policies can be produced without bringing additional audit burdens to the industrialists across the country.</jats:p>"

New instruments promoted by states from the Global North to address the implementation gap come from the sphere of trade and supply chain regulation. This article focuses on corporate climate due diligence legislation and its potential contribution to fulfilling the objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement. By examining the EU’s legislative process towards adopting a Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), it explores various approaches to regulating the climate impacts of corporations, including along global supply chains. The article critiques both the ultimately adopted climate transition planning requirement and the European Parliament’s alternative proposal, which aimed to incorporate climate mitigation into the general due diligence framework of the Directive but was unsuccessful. It applies two overarching critiques, termed ‘not enough’ and ‘regulatory imperialism’, to the specific context of corporate climate due diligence. Although these critiques may initially appear contradictory, the article endeavours to reconcile them through a compromise approach that fosters greater participation, integrates measures to mitigate impacts on self-determination, and specifies the obligations imposed on corporations regarding climate mitigation. Finally, the article discusses the idea of a decentralised enforcement regime and highlights the importance of regulation in states of the Global South to achieve a truly planetary legal order on corporate climate accountability.</jats:p>",

However, a sizable portion of sectors continues to hold divergent opinions regarding big data's alleged benefits. Moreover, there is not a lot of empirical studies that have been published that addresses the adoption of such a tool or better yet, that investigates what factors affect the decision to adopt BDA in supply chain management (SCM).

This report analyzes the existing supply of raw materials produced by fish processing plants and evaluates the feasibility of integrating these resources into other markets. The synthesized report compiles and integrates information from various databases. The analysis examines the quantities and rhythms of fish components from Walleye and Yellow Perch. The findings reveal that combining components from the two species can mitigate supply volatility throughout the year. Specifically, the analysis shows that the standard deviation of the weekly proportion of multi-species heads (1.09%) is smaller compared to the standard deviation of individual species - Walleye (1.27%) and Yellow Perch (1.45%). The reduced standard deviation for multi-species data suggests that incorporating diverse species smooths out the extreme fluctuations in weekly supply, making it more attractive for new markets to incorporate these materials into their value chains. Additionally, the report identifies several viable upcycling models for repurposing fish by-products and highlights transformative upcycling models from other regions. The implications of this analysis suggest that substantial quantities of fish discards could lead to a broad range of upcycling opportunities for processing plants. By exploring these options, plants can enhance their economic and ecological performance.</jats:p>"

The path grain takes from farmers to consumers is opaque and complicated, due to which consumers cannot trust grain quality and its origin. Although blockchain is widely used for fair and secure transactions between farmers and buyers, issues related to transparency and traceability in the grain supply chain, such as counterfeiting and middlemen involvement, have not been adequately addressed. To tackle these issues, a blockchain-based solution is proposed that unites farmers, warehouses, government central and state agencies, transporters, and food corporations on a single platform to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust among all parties. This system involves minting a non-fungible token (NFT) corresponding to each lot of grain approved by government officials. The NFT comprises grain quality, type, temperature data from sensors, weight, and ownership information, which updates as the grain lot moves across the supply chain from central agencies to state agencies and so on. NFTs enable stakeholders to track the grain lot from cultivation to end-users, providing insights into grain conditions and quality. An Internet of Things-based circuit is designed using a Digital-output relative humidity &amp; temperature (DHT22) sensor, which offers real-time temperature and humidity readings, and geolocation coordinates are gathered from the GPS module across the supply chain. Farmers can directly interact with warehouses to sell grains, eliminating the need for middlemen and fostering trust among all parties. The proposed four-tier framework is implemented and deployed on the Ethereum network, with smart contracts interacting with React-based web pages. Analysis and results of the proposed model illustrate that it is viable, secure, and superior to the existing grain supply chain system.</jats:p>"

Our aim is to fill this lacuna and to examine the Italian theatre market from both the demand and supply side considering the four Italian macro-areas. To this end, we apply both the seemingly unrelated regression and the three stage least square estimation techniques, to identify the factors influencing theatre demand and supply. The empirical analysis is conducted using a 35-year panel data (1980–2014) at country level (20 Italian regions) and separately for the four main areas (each of them including the related regions): North West, North East, Centre, and South and Islands. At the country level, the estimated results confirm as determinants of theatre demand, price and consumer income as well as complementary good (cinema), urban agglomeration and tourism flows. Theatre supply is influenced by past ticket price, income, past attendance, urban agglomeration and public subsidies. At regional level the results provide empirical support for the existence of a strong heterogeneity from both the demand and supply sides. We find that some of the variables that influence attendance and performances at national level play a different role at the local level hence cultural policies should take into account this heterogeneity.</jats:p>"

This could be done either by the adoption of lean strategy which focuses on efficient supply chain enhancement, or the adoption of agile strategy, the primary objective of which is to enhance responsive supply chain. But as seen in most of the manufacturing organizations, their range of products are meant for different categories of customers which starts from low cost to high cost. As per the market study the positioning of the product highly depends upon the differentiation of the customers which leads to the best strategy as per the leaverage of both lean &amp; agility. So adoption of either of the strategy alone is not the best idea to fulfill their objective, while the adoption of a combination of both strategy partially could fulfil their requirement, the concept is termed as leagile supply chain. In this paper the authors has investigated &amp; identified 28 lean enablers, 11 agile factors which are highly responsible to affect any supply chain specially focusing of automobile sector. Apart from above 9 leagile enablers were also identified in the paper. After that few methodologies among many of the Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) are adopted to find the ranking as well as some interrelationships among the identified enablers or factors. The innovation in the paper is that the authors has proposed the fuzzy SWARA-WASPAS based approach for determining the role of lean in enabling the supply chain agility. Also in continuation the AHP methodology is applied to find the priority weightage &amp; ranking of leagile enablers.Finally the comparative analysis has been done in the results obtained by both the applied strategies to have a more clear picture for the stakeholders, whether to adopt any of them as per the customized requirement of their supply chain.</p>"

This paper investigates the optimal information sharing strategy for a biomass power plant where farmers choose whether to encroach on the biomass feedstock supply. Using a game theory model, we analyze eight different information sharing scenarios, and the results show that when the encroachment occurs in supply chain channels, information sharing can significantly increase the profits of the entire supply chain. In this case, the power plant should share its demand information with all upstream players to promote the overall benefit of the supply chain. In contrast, when the power plant shares its information only with the middleman, it can maximize its profits, which, however, may not be conducive to the long-term stability of the supply chain. Furthermore, surprisingly, in the absence of channel encroachment, the power plant sharing information with upstream members may harm their profits. This suggests that power plants may need to consider the scope of information sharing more carefully when the farmers choose not to encroach. Finally, we also examine the impact of channel competition intensity on information sharing strategies, and find that when channel competition intensity is low, transparent demand information helps the power plant maximize expected returns. However, in a highly competitive market environment, the power plant should carefully handle information sharing with farmers to avoid damaging their profits.</jats:p>"

We examine two supply chain structures: traditional and dual channel. Our analysis centers on the effects of consumer green preferences, consumer sensitivity to the freshness of agricultural products, and substitution rate between green and non-green agricultural products on the profitability of supply chain members. The purpose of this work is to study the optimal financing strategy for companies producing both regular and organic products simultaneously. We analyze optimal financing strategies for the manufacturer using three models: bank financing, internal debt financing, and internal equity financing. Our results indicate that in both traditional and dual-channel supply chains, increased consumer green preferences or greater sensitivity to the freshness of agricultural products improve supply chain profitability, while a higher substitution rate between green and non-green products reduces profits. Additionally, the manufacturer prefers internal debt financing when consumer environmental awareness is low. Conversely, as consumer environmental awareness increases, internal equity financing becomes more profitable. These findings offer valuable insights for agricultural product manufacturers facing financial constraints, assisting them in selecting the most appropriate financing model.</jats:p>"

The study differs from other researches, which use monetary shocks in explaining the asymmetric relation, in which that it uses broad money change intervals along with control variables to see the asymmetric impact. Using broad money change intervals, it is concluded that the relation between broad money and inflation is explained better in the asymmetric pooled and fixed effect panel data models, compared to the symmetric models. According to the results, the effects of negative and positive changes in money supply on inflation are not symmetric. Moreover, as broad money increases, inflation goes up further. In the light of this information, it is possible to mention an asymmetric relation between broad money and inflation.</jats:p>",

This article focuses on the relationship between the development of China’s digital economy and medical and health services supply.

Additionally, a two-way fixed-effects model is adopted to investigate the impact of digital economy development on medical and health services supply. The results show that both the supply capacity of healthcare services and the level of digital economy development have been increasing continuously in terms of evolutionary trends. From the perspective of regional differences, compared to the supply level of healthcare services, the regional differences in digital economy development are more significant. The intra-regional differences in medical and health services supply are greater than the inter-regional differences, while the development of the digital economy exhibits the opposite trend. The findings of this paper provide supports for China to enhance the development level of digital economy and improve supply of medical and health service.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pesticides are essential to modern agriculture, significantly enhancing crop yields and quality to ensure global food security. Their critical role in preventing hunger is highlighted by the notable increase in global pesticide trade over the past decade. In Indonesia, pesticide usage has surged, with a 24% rise in registered pesticide formulations between 2017 and 2021. However, this increase presents challenges, particularly in the disposal of empty pesticide containers (EPC), which pose substantial environmental and health risks if improperly managed. To address this, a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is proposed as an effective, eco-friendly solution for the management of EPC waste. This study evaluates the implementation of a CLSC for EPC in Indonesia, employing rich picture analysis and stakeholder interviews to identify key challenges, opportunities, and strengths. Notable challenges include regulatory gaps, financial and operational feasibility, and limited farmer engagement. However, opportunities exist in enhancing environmental sustainability, generating economic benefits, and gaining support from industry groups. One key strength is the widespread practice of triple rinsing among farmers, with 62.63% of respondents already adopting this method. This study underscores the important of establishing clear and enforceable regulations, introducing financial incentives and supportive policies, promoting public–private partnerships, creating targeted behavior change interventions, and ensuring organizational commitments and training programs. These insights are crucial in developing a sustainable CLSC, ensuring both environmental and economic benefits.</jats:p>"

Such challenging events highlight the value of the ASCs that enable businesses to navigate crises turn these challenges into opportunities, and continuously strengthen their structures. While resilience strategies gain attention, practical studies on ASCs are limited. This study applies a case study to examine critical success factors for ASCs, demonstrating the practical application of the Delphi and Fuzzy QFD method within Boyar Kimya, a textile manufac turer. By understanding the relationships between customer needs and critical success factors, the analysis contributes to determining and effectively implementing ASC strategies. The study concludes by unveiling key success factors, including SC risk management, information sharing, proactive management, efficient knowledge processes, collaboration, and innovation strategies. This research provides a valuable roadmap for enhancing SC efficiency and sus taining a competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is focused on studying the possibility to modify and terminate legal services supply agreement. The author has noted that the volume of foreign investments is a significant stimulus for the recovery of the domestic economy, and this should be facilitated by proper protection of the rights of investors as less protected participants of investment relationships. All this will contribute to the need to streamline legislative mechanisms for regulating relations in the sphere of services provision.\r\nIn particular, civil regulation of legal services, despite the extraordinary social importance played by relations on providing legal services in society, has not been sufficiently developed yet, in order to affirm that a fairly well-balanced regime for regulating these relations functions in Ukraine.\r\nThe author of the article has indicated that the right to apply measures of operational influence by legal services’ customers requires a clear description in the legislation, but not to be established through a multi-stage interpretation of the relevant norms. The exercise of such a right should not depend on its enshrining in the terms of legal services supply agreements, i.e. its normative basis should be the relevant legal norms, which should increase the guarantee of protection of the rights and interests of the customers of such services as less protected participants of contractual relations.\r\nThe author has proved that the application of legal services on protection by the customers in the form of terminating the agreement, first of all by filing the corresponding claim to the court, has no particular specificity, compared to similar protection within other contractual obligations. The analysis of court practice indicates the lack of acute problems requiring scientific description and resolution in this regard. There is a stable court practice in Ukraine regarding the protection of legal services’ customers through the termination of relevant agreements. Termination of the contract, as a terminating legal fact, protects rather the customer’s interests, but not the rights (for safeguard of assets; for concluding the same meritous contracts with other entities, etc.).\r\nThe author of the work has specified that modification and termination of legal services supply agreements, which are carried out based on the understandings between the parties, as a general rule, are not applied in the context of the parties’ reaction to the offense committed by the counterparty, but due to other motives. In particular, a significant modification of circumstances can be mentioned among such motives.</jats:p>"

Due to its potential, AI is met with high expectations and sometimes apprehension, as there is a lot of uncertainty about what constitutes AI and how it will affect global trade stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how AI will likely affect customs agencies, importers/exporters, service providers and compliance managers. By using examples and case studies, the paper explains: 1) the role of AI expert systems (ES) that use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP); 2) AI’s potential and limitations in sourcing compliance knowledge for streamlining and automating global trade compliance activities; 3) the importance of upskilling compliance managers and compliance teams to successfully deploy AI, mitigate risks and better manage the global trade compliance process; and 4) our six steps for successfully implementing AI in your global trade compliance department. You will learn how AI can be valuable in performing your job and meeting your goals, if it is kept within its range of capabilities. By such measures, you will be able to obtain the advantages presented by the use of AI, while mitigating its very present risks, some of which are known and many of which are unknown.</jats:p>"

However, the current linear manufacturing and distribution supply chain strategy has been regarded as the source of dangerous waste generation, environmental deterioration, and the global warming phenomenon. In mitigating this issue, circular supply chain management, a practical integration model, is seen as the solution as it helps to reduce material flows and supply chain waste. Unfortunately, the fundamental mechanisms that can support its effective execution have not been comprehensively examined, hindering its complete incorporation into company strategy. Thus, to overcome this knowledge gap and improve organizational understanding, this study uses the systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) procedure to investigate the characteristics, enablers, and barriers of circular supply chain management. The study found five interconnected key structures: government, industry stakeholders, corporate management, end users, and financial institutions, all of which play important roles in the successful implementation of a circular supply chain strategy. As a result, close collaboration across the five identified stakeholders is essential to enable successful implementation. This study's objective is to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 9, and 12, which aim to promote peace and prosperity for people and the planet both now and in the future.</jats:p>"

With the supply disruptions and shortages through 2021 and 2022, the ability to both manufacture and distribute these remains important, especially with the rise of new variants and sub-variants that can evade earlier vaccines.US vaccine delivery strategies show the need to balance between focusing on delivery efficiency and delivery equity. Urban centers can focus on delivering mass numbers of vaccines quickly as these areas are often the epicenters for early stages of a pandemic, but rural areas need to focus on delivery equity over efficiency with sparsely-populated areas. Additional lessons include means to deal with vaccine-hesitant populations. This paper investigates how these changes can be implemented and the effect of current vaccine delivery with lessons for future pandemic preparation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The volume of water loss because of leakage in the conveyance pipe has been alarming. Old and poorly constructed pipelines, inadequate corrosion protection, poorly maintained valves, and mechanical damage contribute to leakage. Water-carrying pipes were buried underground, so tracing leak points manually could be tasking, if not impossible. This work was to report on the effectiveness of a developed Automated Leak and Water Quality Detection (ALWQD) system. This device can detect leaks in the piped water system automatically and can also report any deterioration in the quality of water that flows through affected pipes. The ALWQD consisted of several drainpipe connections, pipe accessories, electronic components, and sensors to monitor water quality impairment. The control signal was the solenoid valves that interfaced with the ESP-32 microcontroller boards placed on the pipe manifold at intervals, along with water quality monitoring sensors of turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and pH. The fabrication and testing of the device followed standard procedures. Testing of ALWQD was done at 0, 5, and 10 minutes under load and no-load conditions, with average variation in reading recorded after three trials. The findings indicated that the efficiency of ALWQD was between 70% and 80%, which could be improved upon. The trend in the results of the monitored parameters was not different from that of similar previous work. Leaks caused pressure drops and disallowed the full flow of water found at pipe joints, which could be a pathway for the intrusion of contaminants into the water conveyance system.</jats:p>"

The research results indicate that there is a one-way causality between electronic money and cryptocurrency, but not the other way around, and there is a one-way causality between the money supply and cryptocurrency, with the money supply as the dependent variable influencing cryptocurrency. The results of the VECM estimation indicate that in the long term, electronic money has a negative and sifnificant impact on the money supply. Meanwhile, the short-term estimation shows that both cryptocurrency and electronic money significantly influence the money supply, but their effects are dynamic and vary based on different lags. The long-term estimation with the exchange rate as the dependent variable shows that cryptocurrency does not have a significant impact on the exchange rate, while in the short term, both cryptocurrency and electronic money have a negative and significant effect on the exchange rate.</jats:p>"

Homogeneous products within the market are categorized into mainstream and niche products. The effects of consumer service sensitivity, channel preference, and degree of personalization on optimal decisions and profitability are analyzed, followed by numerical simulation and analysis. It is found that (1) the supply chain should charge high prices for mainstream products and low prices for niche products to maximize profits. (2) Implementing STS is conducive to expanding niche products in the market when facing highly service-sensitive consumer groups. (3) Based on highly service-sensitive consumer segments, supply chains are more profitable implementing STS strategies in a centralized decision-making model than in a traditional dual-channel one; however, under decentralized decision-making, it is only profitable to implement an STS strategy if consumers have a low level of personalization and have a particularly pronounced preference for online direct marketing channels.</jats:p>"

Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the relationship between decision variables such as product greenness, price of new products and remanufactured products is analyzed. It is found that: the level of carbon emission reduction is conducive to increase the price of new products and remanufactured products; under certain conditions, a stronger green market demand is conducive to increase the greenness of the products and the profits and prices of the remanufacturing supply chain members; an increase in the investment in green technology will lead to a decrease in the manufacturer's profit and the greenness of the products, and even reduce the price of the products under certain conditions; and under certain conditions, the carbon trading price is effective in regulating the price of new products and the price of the products. Under certain conditions, the carbon trading price can effectively regulate the price of new products and remanufactured products, while the greenness of products will decrease with the increase of carbon trading price.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As global economic integration and rapid technological advancements transform international business, international engineering contracting has become essential for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper investigates the significant impact of China’s strategic initiatives, notably the &amp;quot;Going Global&amp;quot; strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), on the operational practices of Chinese enterprises involved in overseas investments. Central to this transformation is the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) model, which emphasizes the integration of supply chain management and stakeholder collaboration to enhance performance in international EPC projects and underscores the crucial role of these elements in promoting sustainability. Incorporating insights from social network data analysis, this study reveals that contractors collaborating with various stakeholders—such as owners/consulting engineers, domestic and foreign customs departments, and group headquarters/design parties—exhibit a high degree of similarity in personnel profiles. This suggests that the internal organizational structure and personnel allocation of contractors could be optimized to enhance operational efficiency, aligning with the collaborative patterns identified. This study addresses a critical research gap by exploring how effective supply chain management and collaborative stakeholder engagement within multinational EPC projects contribute to sustainable outcomes. Employing advanced social network analysis software, the research examines the complex interactions among stakeholders and their influence on procurement dynamics. Findings indicate that strong relational networks and strategic collaborations significantly enhance procurement efficiency and project success, underscoring the importance of supply chain integration. Ultimately, integrating supply chain management principles into the EPC model not only offers innovative perspectives for advancing sustainability in international projects but also provides actionable insights for improving project outcomes within the BRI framework. This research underscores the pivotal role of supply chain organization and stakeholder cooperation in achieving sustainability objectives, thereby enriching the discourse on sustainable enterprise operation and supply chain management in the context of global initiatives.</jats:p>"

Reverse logistics include collection, sorting, recycling, redistribution, and disposal. One of the main challenges MSMEs face is accumulating unsold or damaged products. Chip products not sold out in the stores where they are kept often have to be recalled, resulting in a buildup of products in the warehouse. This study aims to analyze the practice of reverse logistics of banana chip products in one MSME called A3  and evaluate the extent to which they are based on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). The research method used is descriptive qualitative; data collection is done through interviews, direct observation, and analysis of related documents. The results showed that A3 had implemented reverse logistics practices by considering environmental aspects such as production waste management. However, some areas can still be improved further to maximize the contribution to Green Supply Chain Management. The implication of this study is to provide a deeper understanding of reverse logistics practices in the context of MSMEs and provide recommendations for other MSMEs to improve the conformity of their practices with the concept of Green Supply Chain Management.</jats:p>"

Forecasting global future supplies of REE often relies on the valuation of advanced mining projects to assess if projects will initiate production. Classical valuation methods, such as net present value (NPV), require knowledge of initial capital and operating expenditures to assess the economic feasibility of a given project. Typical industry unit expenditure projections are highly precise but are extremely project dependent and require detailed knowledge of a site that is far beyond the level that a domestic and/or global supply-demand model can obtain. To model future REE supplies we developed a new globally representative, simplified, mining project cost model that can be used to approximate the capital and operating expenditures of greenfield REE mining projects. Results from this model allow users to estimate expenses of open-pit and underground mines with mineral processing operations that range from solely beneficiation to individual REE separation. Using our new model and an estimate of NPV, we evaluate several REE mining projects and assess the economic variables impacting the likelihood for these projects to advance to the production stage. Of 12 assessed projects located outside of China, in the early to advanced development stages, nine had positive NPV at 2011 peak REE prices, but none had positive NPV when prices reached bottom in 2016. Two projects yielded positive NPV’s using 2022 and projected 2028 prices. The viability of these projects given the impact of the volatility in REE prices explains the high uncertainty in the future supply for these mineral commodities.</jats:p>"

Currently, and for a significant period in the future, the food industry supply chain faces several risks, primarily due to increased uncertainties. These risks manifest as the need for optimization in the layout of the food industry, prominent structural shortages, and a lack of full autonomy and control in key links of the industry chain. Such risks can potentially evolve into critical factors that restrict the resilience and security of the food industry supply chain. To effectively address these risks, this paper identifies 12 influencing factors based on four key capabilities of the food supply chain: forecasting ability, response-ability, adaptation ability, and recovery ability. An evaluation index system for the resilience of the food supply chain is constructed, integrating the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodologies. Analysis of the interactions between these factors reveals that three factors, including supply chain visibility, are fundamental, seven factors, including the level of agricultural mechanization, are intermediate, and dynamic logistics and flexibility are direct factors. Based on these conclusions, this paper proposes several targeted recommendations to enhance the development of the food supply chain. These recommendations aim to improve the supply chain's resilience and ability to withstand potential risks.</jats:p>"

Durante 2022-2024, producto de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania el intercambio de bienes y servicios es primordial para la supervivencia, siendo vital la oferta y demanda de alimentos con suficiencia, sanos e inocuos. El efecto de la guerra es mayor inflación mundial aumentando a 15.7% durante 2023, y antes de la guerra era ≤ 4%, por ejemplo, el precio café antes de la guerra era de 103,01 centavos USD*Lb y en 2023 fluctuó entre 151,95 y 162,31 centavos, aumentó más del 60%. Sumado a esto, las sanciones a Rusia incrementaron los costos de fertilizantes N, P y K en 200%.  Por otra parte, modelar matemáticamente los elementos que intervienen en la SCM es inevitable para el aseguramiento de la calidad del café, pero sobre todo asegurar la resiliencia y gobernanza que conlleve a la toma óptima de decisiones a nivel estratégico, táctico y operativo. La presente investigación se centra en la tesis titulada “Metodología para la toma de decisiones estratégicas en el marco de la transformación digital en la cadena de suministro del café (Coffea), caso de estudio Dptos. Antioquía y Tolima -Colombia” con el objetivo de generar nuevo conocimiento de alto impacto para la cadena de suministro del café sustentable. Por tanto, este avance relaciona el estado del arte sobre la SCM en pro de la gobernanza y resiliencia en instituciones cafeteras.  El diseño de la red de la cadena de suministro se describió como parte del procedimiento de la SCM, que incide en los costos y rendimientos de esta. Para esto se analizó la siguiente ecuación búsqueda (\"supply chain*\" OR \"generalized supply chain\" OR \"flexible supply chain\" OR \"supply chain network design\" OR \"optimize superstructure\" ) AND ( coffee OR \"coffee chain simulation\" OR \"coffee supply chain\" OR \"coffee producers\" OR \"coffee value chain\") Se analizaron 452 documentos mostrando una tendencia hacia la sostenibilidad y el afianzamiento de la industria 4.0 y 5.0.  De igual modo, se examinaron en el contexto actual colombiano los desafíos para el incremento del índice de competitividad regional cafetero, que trata de asegurar confianza y equilibrio institucional. Consecuencia de esto, se evidenció la volatilidad del mercado y la incertidumbre posterior a la pandemia por Covid19, conduce hacia la carrera por la innovación y la transformación digital en la SCM a nivel global.

Utilizing the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) published data on number of registered vehicles by each state, an estimated quantity of vehicles by type classified as automobiles, buses, trucks, and motorcycles was obtained. When average mileage of each vehicle was factored in, to project generation required, the need of preparation for future energy generation using renewable energy was presented. A roof-top solar photovoltaic system is easy to install on unoccupied roof space for US house owners. Obtaining the capacity of such roof-top solar PV system acts as a good decision-making criterion for both house owners and developers. How well EV cars performed against internal combustion engine (ICE) cars is another positive indication for this transition. With limitations on battery size and thus increased frequency for drivers to return for charging installation, additional fast chargers (level 3) at existing gasoline stations is an option that requires further assessment.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the conditions of constant attempts of rocket and bomb attacks, the development of alternative options for heating systems of objects of joint-stock company (JSC) “Ukrzaliznytsia” has become extremely urgent. Moreover, at some objects equipped with gas boilers, full or partial depreciation of the equipment takes place. Therefore, it is urgent to develop promising options for heating systems. First of all, it can be not only gas, but also electric boilers. Sometimes, during the development of alternative options for investment projects, the method of “reduced costs” is used, which became widespread even in the times of the USSR. But this method does not take into account the change in the value of money during the implementation and operation of the equipment. Therefore, an approach was proposed to determine the costs of implementing heating systems of Joint-stock company (JSC) “Ukrzaliznytsia” facilities, which takes into account the fact that costs depend on the value of money. As a result, it was shown that at the current level of equipment costs and electricity tariffs and gas prices, it is more appropriate to use heating systems based on electric boilers, and the use of the “reduced costs” method to determine the feasibility of implementing heating systems is not unacceptable.</jats:p>",

Renewable energy sources, specifically solar and biogas, are unpredictable and subject to sudden changes due to weather conditions and feedstock availability. Furthermore, their integration with the current conventional plants is complicated. In relation to this, deploying energy storage has become the main agenda under the Renewable Energy Roadmap to achieve 40% installed capacity by 2035. When selecting the most adequate energy storage system, the technological, environmental and economic aspects need to be considered. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the current state of energy storage and the renewable energy situation in Malaysia. The significance of this paper is that it encourages RE consumption in Malaysia in parallel with the government’s target due to the deployment of energy storage in the energy supply system. It can serve as a guideline for policymakers in their penetration of the renewable energy sector.</jats:p>"

As a result, communities supporting sustainability and peace or those fostering economic development will be able to respond effectively to humanitarian crises. Moreover, the UN can remain operational and engage in political and conflict-reduction interventions integral to economic and social recovery and sustainability. This study applied the qualitative multiple case study through semi-structured interviews with nine supply chain managers in the United Nations, direct observations, document analysis, and artifacts. The research is grounded in the dynamic capability theory (DCT). The research revealed several strategies that supply chain managers of the UN use to ensure operational efficiencies grouped around three themes: (a) analytical, innovation, and knowledge management strategies; (b) effective supply chain management leadership strategies; and (c) risk management strategies. This study is one of the first to apply generic findings of humanitarian supply chain studies to the United Nations, the global organization with diverse mandates that continuously strives to achieve efficiencies required by donors providing financial support, thus remaining operational. The study’s results could help leaders in the various humanitarian organizations who operate in vulnerable environments and under strict scrutiny from donors to deliver their aid programs most efficiently by understanding dynamic capabilities. Previous studies indicate the lack of strategic frameworks applicable to the United Nations that could improve decision-making at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels, facilitate collaboration among supply chain stakeholders, and reduce the costs of the operational performance of the supply chain system in the UN.</jats:p>"

RES can be used in railway transport to increase the reliability of power supply to facilities located in areas with insufficiently developed power grid. First of all, this applies to consumers of the first category, whose power failure can lead to significant damage, accidents, and a threat to human life. RES can serve as a basis for independent power sources for consumers of a special group and provide an increase in the efficiency of energy conversion. Furthermore, large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources can significantly reduce energy supply costs and improve the quality of electricity. The study employs a technique of modeling in phase coordinates, which is characterized by the following features: systems approach, which implies determining operating conditions considering the properties and characteristics of complex traction and supply networks; versatility, which provides modeling of power supply systems of various structures and designs; comprehensiveness, which involves calculating normal, emergency, and special operating parameters, which is crucial for the scenarios such as ice melting on catenary wires. The modeling results achieved using the Fazonord software show that the RES-based distributed generation plants provide a variety of beneficial effects: reduction in electricity consumption from power system networks; decrease in the unbalance and harmonic distortion on the busbars of regional windings of traction substations, and stabilization of voltage levels on current collectors of electric locomotives.</p>"

The model employs M/M/C/K queuing systems to optimize the transportation of goods, enhancing efficiency and sustainability. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach is used to identify optimal facility locations while maximizing profitability, minimizing driver waiting times, and reducing environmental impact. Methods: The grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of grasshopper swarms, is utilized to solve the model on a large scale. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, particularly in solving large-scale problems where traditional methods like GAMS fall short. Results: The results indicate that the proposed model, utilizing the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), effectively addresses complex and large-scale food supply chain problems. Compared to GAMS, GOA achieved similar outcomes with minimal differences in key metrics such as profitability (with a gap ranging from 0.097% to 1.11%), environmental impact (0.172% to 1.83%), and waiting time (less than 0.027%). In large-scale scenarios, GOA significantly reduced processing times, ranging from 20.45 to 64.78 s. The optimization of processing facility locations within the supply chain, based on this model, led to improved balance between cost (up to $74.2 million), environmental impact (122,112 hazardous units), and waiting time (down to 11.75 h). Sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that increases in truck arrival rates and product value had a significant impact on improving supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Results: The results suggest that implementing SSCM strategies like eco-friendly purchasing, circular supply chains, and involving stakeholders can greatly improve environmental and social results. Businesses who implemented these strategies saw a 30% drop in carbon emissions, a 25% boost in resource efficiency, and a 20% enhancement in labor conditions. Furthermore, 85% of companies that were surveyed reported improved community relations and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Conclusion: The study concludes that sustainable supply chain management practices are social integrity can only be attained through the implementation of sustainable supply chain management practices. Organizations that actively incorporate these practices not only help to achieve sustainability objectives but also benefit from competitive advantages by improving their reputation and operational efficiency.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Full-scale military actions in Ukraine increased the dynamics of changes in the labour market, caused significant uncertainty in influencing factors, and increased the imbalance of supply and demand in the labour market, which was characterised as a crisis even before the invasion. This strengthened the need for a relevant assessment of the needs of the Ukrainian labour market and the possibility of its personnel support and management of labour resources, taking into account the risks for the country's economy and post-war reconstruction.\r\nAim and tasks. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the labour market of Ukraine in the post-war period and substantiate ways of meeting the market's personnel needs using the example of the construction and IT industries. The tasks of this study are to identify the factors affecting the labour market in the post-war period, assess the dynamics of changes in the balance of demand and supply in the labour market in the post-war period, and develop a mathematically formalised approach to the adaptive assessment of the labour market.\r\nResults. The developed mathematically formalised approach to assessing the imbalance of the labour market in individual areas allowed the stabilisation of the demand and supply of the IT labour market in 2026 at a level 1.496 times lower than the maximum in 2023. In the construction industry, differentiation in sectoral priorities of post-war reconstruction has been determined, as evidenced by the expected shortage of personnel in this industry, which is 2.15 times higher than the indicator for all industries. This is also indicated by the differentiation in the demand for qualified workers from 20% to 60% for large and small construction enterprises.\r\nConclusions. The identified reasons for the uncertainty of factors affecting the labour market (losses in the quality of labour resources and forced migration) proved that post-war reconstruction would require an adaptive approach to managing labour resources at all levels. The lack of personnel in the post-war period will require a change in the concept of ensuring the competitiveness of domestic enterprises by using cheap labour.    It was determined that the demand for qualified personnel in the post-war period for all industries would grow, which is confirmed by the dynamics of the index of change of employees, which is 30% higher for qualified workers than unskilled workers. Significant differentiation by micro-specialty influences the gap between demand and supply, which does not consider the market's needs.</jats:p>"

The change in the power factor of the solar power system connected to the grid and the temperature of the coolant entering the heat exchanger built into the methane tank are predicted. Promising solutions include changing the power of the heat pump compressor to maintain biogas production, unloading fermented wort and loading fresh material while maintaining the power factor of the grid solar system and changing the level of electricity transmission to the grid. The voltage at the input of the hybrid inverter, the voltage at the output of the frequency converter to assess their ratio and the voltage frequency are constantly measured. When changing the voltage at the input of the hybrid inverter from 240 V to 600 V, promising solutions were adopted to reduce the power of the heat pump from 3.14 kW to 1.58 kW in the production of biogas 352.5 m3/day to maintain the temperature of the heating coolant entering the heat exchanger built into the methane tank at 55° C - 45 °C in order to obtain biogas, unload fermented wort and load fresh raw materials.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the factors that impact global oil prices, focusing on the relationship between supply and demand in international markets. The authors used an econometric panel methodology to identify the primary factors influencing global oil prices, using Brent crude oil prices as the dependent variable. The study also considered alternative measures, such as Dubai and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices, as well as a composite global price index derived from the average of WTI, Dubai, and Brent prices, to ensure the robustness of the findings. The study found that key factors influencing global oil prices remained consistent across different dependent variables introduced into the model. The research emphasizes the critical role of supply and demand dynamics as the main drivers shaping global oil prices. On the supply side, variables such as oil reserves, international oil trade, and the number of active oil rigs were considered. The results indicated that an increase in active oil rigs is associated with increased oil prices, while an increase in international oil trade leads to price reductions. When oil prices rise, active oil rigs often increase, but with a specific time lag. This rig increase can further drive up oil prices, particularly when the market expects continued price growth or when investments in new rigs are financed by anticipated higher revenues from oil sales. Increased international trade in oil leads to a more excellent supply of oil in the global market, which drives down global oil prices. Although oil reserves showed a positive coefficient, they were marginally significant, suggesting a potential upward pressure on prices when reserves increase. This positive relationship between oil reserves and prices may reflect market perceptions of future supply constraints, where increased reserves signal potential future scarcity rather than immediate availability, thereby exerting upward pressure on prices due to speculative behavior and strategic stockpiling. On the demand side, industrial growth was a critical factor that significantly drove oil prices higher. At the same time, renewable energy consumption had a statistically significant adverse impact, reducing global oil demand and lowering oil prices. The study also examined the impact of major global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the Global Financial Crisis. It revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a statistically significant negative impact on oil prices due to worldwide lockdowns and economic slowdowns. However, the Global Financial Crisis did not exhibit statistical significance in the model using WTI prices, though it still negatively affected all models. The study employed various panel data regression techniques, including pooled, fixed effects (FE), and random effects (RE) models. Diagnostic tests for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation were conducted, leading to the application of Robust Hausman tests that identified the fixed effects model as the most appropriate for this analysis. Moreover, the study used Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to correct for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and cross-sectional dependence, which reinforced the fixed-effects model's validity. The key findings highlighted the importance of supply and demand as pivotal factors influencing global oil prices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In European countries, electrified routes amount for 40% to 65% of the total railway networks length. Some of those routes are only partially electrified, and construction of a catenary network might not be viable on all routes. Consequently, operators run diesel trains under catenary or require both an electric and diesel vehicle, increasing costs of operation. Dual-mode vehicles exist, but they are mostly equipped with diesel generators, adding to the pollution and resulting in reduced movement dynamics. In this article, the authors present a hydrogen-hybrid electric multiple unit (HEMU), as an environmentally friendly vehicle for partially electrified railway lines. Insight into technologies utilized by both hybrid and hydrogen rail vehicles based on the literature review allowed for the formulation of requirements for such a vehicle. Furthermore, an approach to a modelling hybrid vehicle is described, including an energy management algorithm. A series of simulations were conducted, showing an operation of an HEMU on a partially electrified suburban/regional route. The presented simulation results show potential for the future introduction of hydrogen hybrid electric multiple units as a viable solution for partially electrified local and regional routes.</jats:p>"

The results showed that cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy have a significant and positive effect on SCME. Hypothesis testing based on the robustness checks confirmed these findings. In spite of the growing interest in supply chain management, there is little research on emerging economies compared to developed economies. There is also a significant gap of research on how business strategy could influence the performance of supply chains. The present findings will not only help company managers in developing countries, but due to the lack of similar research, they are of great help to managers in developed countries and the global community. </jats:p>"

Multivariate time series data from several water plants in the Greater Sydney region were analyzed using three methods: correlation heatmaps, t-tests, and descriptive statistics. The findings indicate that neither Australia Day nor Christmas Day has a significant impact on water demand at different water plants in the Greater Sydney region.

This dual role allows auditors to leverage and disseminate crucial chain-specific knowledge. Considering that supplier firms are relatively smaller and at a disadvantage compared with their customers, such supply-chain knowledge is valuable for suppliers to make better demand forecasts and business plans. Consistent with this argument, we find that a supplier sharing a common auditor with its customer(s) has a higher ROA, a higher profit margin, a shorter receivable conversion period, and a smaller demand distortion from the bullwhip effect. Performance enhancement is more pronounced when the common auditor has more opportunities to collect and transfer information and when such information transfer is more valuable to the supplier. Our results are robust to alternative measures of common-auditor presence, alternative explanations, and potential endogeneity concerns.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: The data that support the findings of this study are openly available.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: D82; D83; L25; M42.</jats:p>",

By addressing key gaps in existing research, particularly the integration of risk management and resource optimization across the entire supply chain, this work offers a comprehensive approach to improving supply chain robustness. The framework was empirically tested within the context of Company A's global product management operations, where we quantified the economic impact of underutilized production capacities and assessed the benefits of strategic resource reallocation. Our analysis demonstrated that by optimizing idle production lines, resource utilization could be improved by 18%, resulting in annual cost savings of approximately $1.2 million. Additionally, the framework enhanced overall supply chain resilience by 25%, as evidenced by reduced recovery times and improved operational continuity during disruptions. These findings not only provide empirical support for the framework's effectiveness but also offer practical insights for businesses seeking to strengthen their supply chains in the face of increasing global uncertainties. The research contributes to the theoretical advancement of supply chain resilience and operational efficiency while offering actionable strategies for industry practitioners. The proposed framework serves as a scalable model adaptable to various industry contexts, thereby enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of enterprises in an increasingly volatile market environment.</jats:p>"

By applying economic and statistical methods, the research analyses the role of large distributors and wholesalers in the United States food supply chain. While these supply chain participants support restaurant and manufacturer operations, they can also increase costs, reduce marketing and logistics control, and hinder the development of customer relationships. Direct supply presents significant advantages, such as improved brand loyalty, higher profit retention, and access to high-quality products. However, its growth is constrained by challenges like high marketing expenses and the implementation of same-day delivery. These costs include investments in advertising, technology platforms, CRM systems, and staff remuneration. Key obstacles to same-day delivery include staff shortages (especially drivers), high delivery costs, and inefficient logistics. The study suggests that technological solutions, including the development of direct access networks, automated promotional tools, and logistics infrastructure, can help mitigate these challenges. The Sample Box Marathon and Rgand Prime Fulfilment platforms are analysed as practical solutions that reduce costs and improve profitability. The findings of this research can provide valuable insights for producers and restaurants looking to optimize their supply chain operation</jats:p>",

It was found that the value of the critical stress SK for all test steels increases with the increase in the service life, and the impact viscosity decreases, which indicates the structural embrittlement of the pipe steels associated with their sudden flooding. It is shown that the new 06G2BA steel, which is economically modified with a carbide-forming element (vanadium) and has a fine-grained structure and a low content of harmful impurities (sulfur, phosphorus), has the highest visco-plastic properties and resistance to brittle fracture. The microstrain of the α-Fe crystal lattice, as well as the quantitative decay of cementite and the redistribution of carbon between ferrite and pearlite, were evaluated by X-ray structural methods. 06G2BA steel is recommended for use in the construction of pipelines and, for example, bridge structures, which are constantly under cyclic loads with simultaneous contact with a corrosive-aggressive environment. The influence of the service life of water pipes on the hydrogen content and microcracks in pipe steels was determined. A diagram of the relationship between long-term and static strength depending on the hydrogen content in steels is recommended, which can be used by designers to rationally choose the type of steels with high crack resistance in aggressive technological environments. In order to extend the service life of pipe structures, it is necessary to use economically modified steels.</jats:p>"

However, its practical application in PCSC remains limited under the influence of stakeholders’ adoption strategies. While previous studies have analyzed drivers and barriers to BT adoption, they often take a static view, neglecting the long-term dynamic decision-making interactions between stakeholders. This study addresses this gap by examining the interests of owners, general contractors, and subcontractors, and by developing a tripartite evolutionary game model to analyze the interaction mechanism of the strategy of adopting BT in PCSC. Additionally, a system dynamics simulation validates the evolution of stabilization strategies and examines the impact of key parameters. The results indicate that successful BT adoption requires technology maturity to surpass a threshold between 0.5 and 0.7, along with a fair revenue and cost-sharing coefficient between general contractors and subcontractors, ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 at the lower limit and 0.7 to 0.9 at the upper limit. Notably, general contractors play a pivotal role in driving BT adoption, acting as potential leaders. Furthermore, appropriate incentives, default compensation, and government subsidies can promote optimal adoption strategies, although overly high incentives may reduce owners’ willingness to mandate BT adoption. This study provides practical insights and policy recommendations for critical stakeholders to facilitate the widespread adoption of BT in PCSC.</jats:p>"

This research aims to analyze the effect of implementation of Supply Chain Management (SCM) on the operations of PT Benih Citra Asia. This research uses qualitative methods by conducting in-depth interviews and direct observation as data collection techniques. The research results show that implementation of Supply Chain Management at PT Benih Citra Asia has had a significant positive impact on the company's operational efficiency. Supply Chain Management helps optimize the flow of goods and information throughout the supply chain, which contributes to smooth production processes and responsiveness to market changes. Good collaboration between departments, especially between the Plant and IT divisions, is very important to ensure that product information is always up to date and accurate. Apart from that, this research also found that raw material inventory management that is difficult to predict and fluctuations in customer demand are the main challenges in Supply Chain Management. To overcome this problem, closer collaboration with suppliers and customers is required as well as the use of advanced information technology to improve visibility and coordination between departments. Overall, this research confirms that Supply Chain Management is a key factor in improving the efficiency and operations of PT Benih Citra Asia. Cross-departmental collaboration and effective communication are critical elements in successful implementation of Supply Chain Management.</jats:p>"

The research took the meat and dairy chains as a reference and conducted a brief case study in two organizations. The result is a governance model that includes small and medium-sized organizations in the context of reducing emissions and generating benefits. This research can be extended to other chains and allows for compensation between companies in the same segment. A segment can be a production chain or a group of urban and rural organizations in the same region. The proposed principle is that initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by region contribute to better overall governance of such initiatives, as the materialization of projects and results becomes more agile and effective.</jats:p>"

The study used the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique and the discrete threshold regression model. The finding supports the money neutrality hypothesis in the long run but non-neutrality in the short run. In order words, money supply does not have a significant influence on real output growth in the long-term but does in the short-term. Inflation was found to have a reducing consequence on real output growth in the long and short term, while real effective exchange rates have a reducing effect on real output in the long run but advance in the short run. Structural breaks before the year 2000 have a significant influence on GDP growth in both the long and short run. Sequel to these outcomes, the study suggests an optimum fiscal policy mix with modest monetary policy should be adopted in Nigeria with more attention on the fiscal responsibility of the government to influence changes in real variables. More so, the CBN should urgently begin to announce specific inflation targets for the country since it has a reducing impact on GDP growth in the long run while ensuring the attainment of a more realistic exchange rate for the naira by increasing domestic production for export in the long run.</jats:p>"

Individual-level analyses reveal that the average effect obscures heterogeneous micro-behavior: while the majority of drivers does not meaningfully adjust labor supply in response to social security benefits, a small group reduces labor supply by more than 40%.

The gas sensing experiments involved three MQ series gas sensors under lab-made chamber for continuous Ethanol vapor measurement. To investigate how heaters’ current irregularities, affect the gas sensing performance parameters, the sensor’s response/recovery time, pattern recognition techniques of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were employed. While minor voltage drops (±100 mV) may not significantly affect sensing resistance (R<jats:sub>S</jats:sub>) due to real-time input voltage (Vin) adjustment, a constant current source is essential for heating resistance (R<jats:sub>H</jats:sub>). The study revealed that a slight increase (±3 mA) in heater supply, particularly from 154 mA (94 °C) to 157 mA (96 °C), can significantly accelerate the recovery time (Trec) of the MQ-7 sensor from 484 s to 316 s, resulting in a difference of over 150 s. This improvement can be attributed to the desorption of gas molecules at higher temperatures, aiding in sensor cleaning. However, this small change does not significantly affect the response time (Tres), which remains between 245 and 295 s at worst. Our gas sensor exhibits enhanced sensitivity and operational stability thanks to a calibrated circuit and stable 5V power supply. Strong correlations between normalized response and sensing films’ temperatures, with a correlation coefficient of 0.985, provide insights into the relationship between heater currents, temperature effects, and gas sensitivity. These findings offer insights for optimizing sensing performance under gas exposure conditions.</jats:p>",

Kayumas coffee is one of Indonesia’s specialty coffee with a unique aroma and flavor originating from Kayumas Village, Situbondo District, East Java. Kayumas coffee supply chain needs to be evaluated because of the lack of competitiveness with other specialty coffees. Strategies are needed to improve supply chain performance, improve product quality, and reduce costs. This study aims to configure the supply chain of Kayumas specialty coffee structure, evaluate its performance, and determine performance improvement strategies. Methods: This study uses descriptive analysis to configure the supply chain structure and flow. Analysis of supply chain performance based on Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model then weighted with Analytic Network Process (ANP). Performance improvement strategies were formulated by a discussion with experts and then weighted with ANP. Results: The research results show that the Kayumas specialty coffee supply chain comprises farmers, farmer groups, distributors or resellers, and consumers. There are 6 performance indicators (metrics) to measure performance: perfect order fulfillment, order fulfillment cycle time, flexibility, total supply chain management cost, cost of goods sold, and cash-to-cash cycle time. Performance measurement shows that Kayumas specialty coffee supply chain performance is in the inferior category. Conclusion: The strategy needed to improve supply chain performance by reducing cost is a partnership between supply chain members to reach a price agreement.</jats:p>"

The diffusion of these investments was rather slow until the 1870s and then accelerated in subsequent decades, mostly because of financial constraints and then increasing demand for water. Regressing water supply infrastructure with mortality indicators shows that water supply improvements are associated with declines in mortality, but that their effect is small.

Managers in the food sector have been attempting to incorporate the principle of sustainable development in their supply chains owing to the paramount importance of social and environmental considerations in creating a competitive advantage for food products. To this end, we propose a multi-objective linear mathematical model considering the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental, and social, to design a sustainable food supply chain. Given today’s volatile business environment, we employ a robust optimization model by incorporating Conditional Value-at-Risk into the configuration of two-stage stochastic programming to tackle uncertainty and take up a risk-averse strategy in supply chain design. The model aims to identify the optimal production and delivery times of the products, investigate the effects of their perishability characteristic on inventory decisions, and assess the financial and environmental advantages of transportation decisions to improve the sustainability of logistics operations. A novel version of fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to solve the proposed model. Next, the applicability of the proposed model and its solution method is verified based on computational experiments on a real-world case study of a processed food company. Lastly, conflicts between the sustainability aspects are examined, and several sensitivity analyses on risk-aversion parameters are performed to provide managerial insights for industry executives seeking to optimize their network concerning sustainability issues and well-performance under worst-case scenarios.</jats:p>"

Such barriers include lack of technological and financial resources, inadequate skills, regulatory issues, and fair trade and sustainability concerns. The proposed and discussed in this paper challenges includes: gap assessment, recommendations formulation, and legal implementation where more focus is place on Indian traits. These recommendations relate to improving the enabling framework, promoting technological upgrading and innovation, raising skills and human capital, and facilitating GVC participation that is more equitable and environmentally friendly. By focusing on interventions in the above mentioned areas, the Indian policy makers will be able to put in place measures that will foster growth in Indian MSMEs in the global economy which in turn will support broader and more robust economic growth.

Agriculture, in general, is heavily reliant on monsoon patterns. In recent decades, climate change has led to shifts in these patterns, increasing the likelihood of extreme rainfall events such as droughts and floods. The present study analyses the annual and seasonal rainfall trends in the Green Revolution belt, categorised into agroclimatic zones, estimated by utilising the extensive repository of rainfall data obtained from the CHRS Data Portal pertaining to the geographical coordinates of each district. The study employs non-parametric Mann–Kendall and Sen's slope estimates to evaluate rainfall trends from 1983 to 2022. The findings indicate a discernible upward trend in rainfall across all zones except Zone 1 of Punjab, with the southwest monsoon emerging as the predominant source of precipitation in the area. The study highlights the need for water resource management in the Green Revolution belt as it is crucial for effectively harnessing the escalating rainfall in the region, particularly in view of concerns surrounding depleting groundwater levels.</jats:p>",

However, conventional industrial mobile robots’ route-tracking algorithms typically rely on passive markers, leading to issues such as inflexibility in changing routes and high deployment costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach utilizing active landmarks—battery-powered luminous landmarks that enable robots to recognize and adapt to flexible navigation requirements. However, the reliance on batteries necessitates frequent recharging, prompting the development of an automatic power supply system. This system integrates omnidirectional contact electrodes on mobile robots, allowing to recharge active landmarks without precise positional alignment. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the large size of electrodes and non-adaptive battery charging across landmarks persist, affecting system efficiency. To mitigate these issues, this research focuses on miniaturizing active landmarks and optimizing power distribution among landmarks. The experimental results of this study demonstrated the effectiveness of our automatic power supply method and the high accuracy of landmark detection. Our power distribution calculation method can adaptively manage energy distribution, improving the system’s persistence by nearly three times. This study aims to enhance the practicality and efficiency of mobile robot remote control systems utilizing active landmarks by simplifying installation processes and extending operational durations with adaptive and automatic power supply distribution.</jats:p>"

The framework was tested using SPSS and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).\n \nMethod: The findings indicate that each dimension of social capital affects supply chain collaboration differently. All dimensions significantly impact information sharing. Relational and structural capital are important for decision synchronization, while only cognitive capital significantly influences incentive alignment. Furthermore, relational capital facilitates incentive alignment and mediates the effects of other social capital dimensions on overall collaboration.\n \nResearch Implications: The results provide valuable insights for both scholars and practitioners. They highlight the distinct roles of social capital dimensions in enhancing collaboration, which can help managers design effective strategies for long-term relationship building and overall supply chain benefit.\n \nOriginality/Value: This study offers a detailed analysis of the three facets of social capital and their impact on supply chain collaboration, marking one of the first comprehensive examinations of these dimensions in this context. Its findings have the potential to advance both academic understanding and practical approaches in supply chain management, contributing to more effective collaborative practices.</jats:p>"

The hypothesis that CEAA-rich proteins tend to reduce expression, especially in cells proliferating quickly is expected to be proven, which may provide new ideas for amino acid therapy for some diseases. Lay Abstract: The twenty amino acids making up proteins in animals are classified into three nutritional classes: EAAs, NEAAs and CEAAs. Previous studies show that the amino acid composition of proteins can interact with amino acid availability to influence protein expression levels, independently of the amount of mRNA produced. By analysing the bioinformatic data of protein expression levels in human cells, protein expression was observed to be affected in the way that the more CEAAs present in a protein, the lower its expression, which was particularly evident in cells proliferating quickly. In this project, plasmid constructs were created that express artificial proteins containing almost only one amino acid nutritional class with a V5 epitope at the terminal. These were transfected into A549 cells to test the hypothesis from data analysis in real-life cells that proteins with extreme proportions of CEAAs tend to reduce expression and are most affected by proliferation compared with proteins with other proportions of amino acid class. The V5 tag is an epitope that can be detected by certain antibodies on Western blot or in cells. Through measuring the amount of certain A549 cell protein synthesis in different treatment groups, the results show that proteins with extreme proportions of CEAAs tend to reduce in expression but are not the most affected by proliferation. However, proteins of what amino acid composition ratio are most affected by proliferation and the specific mechanism behind the effect need further study.</jats:p>"

Key risk factors include the volatility of raw material prices, intense competition within the steel industry, and economic downturns. Fluctuations in raw material prices affect production costs and profit margins. Rising raw material costs can squeeze margins unless passed on to customers, which is challenging in a competitive market. The competitive landscape requires the company to balance competitive pricing with quality, leading to potential price wars and further margin erosion. Additionally, economic downturns reduce demand for steel products, impacting sales volumes and revenues. This study comprises four key components: risk assessment, Z-score model analysis, financial ratio analysis, and risk prevention formulation. The risk assessment, covering both internal and external factors, identifies major risks including supply chain disruptions, financing challenges, weather-related issues, major accidents, and steel market volatility. Analysis using the Z-score model, based on data from the past five years, reveals significant profitability risks for the company. Further examination of financial ratios shows that the company’s profitability ratios are generally below the industry average. Integrating these qualitative and quantitative findings indicates that the company should prioritize addressing supply chain disruption risks. Consequently, an early warning system has been developed, and risk prevention strategies have been established.</jats:p>"

Small-sized businesses usually struggle to fulfill client’s demands or honor a contract with bigger firms. That is a fact in countries all around the globe, however, this condition is considered more severe in African countries. African countries face challenges in managing global supply chain chains due to government instability, corruption, limited technology use, and low education levels. With the rise of globalization, it has become ever more crucial to transform and stabilize supply chain management in the region. Supply chain finance (SCF) analyzes capital flows in a supply chain, aiming to reduce financing costs and increase efficiency, which has been an overlooked area for a long time. This research was conducted to understand the potential SCF holds regarding improving the economy in African countries.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we propose three service strategy models for dual-channel closed-loop supply chains, including when there is no service provision, after-sales service and recycling service provided by retailers and after-sales service provided by manufacturers and recycling service provided by retailers, compare and analyze the optimal decisions of supply chain members under the three service strategy models, discuss the role of service generated in dual-channel closed-loop supply chains, and propose a service cost-sharing strategy to achieve a Pareto improvement in the effectiveness of a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain. The study finds that service plays a positive role in the dual-channel closed-loop supply chain; the model of manufacturer providing after-sales service and retailer providing recycling service is the best service strategy choice in terms of economic and social benefits; the service cooperation mechanism of service cost sharing can achieve Pareto improvement of the supply chain within a reasonable range.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Financial debt management in the context of the energy crisis is an urgent problem that requires a strategic approach in countries with an unstable energy system. The imbalance between the supply and demand of energy resources generation creates a trap in which the growth of energy shortages leads to increased import costs, higher prices for end consumers and increased financial burden on the state. This, in turn, can provoke inflationary pressure, a decrease in the competitiveness of the national economy, an increase in public debt and social tension due to an increase in the cost of living and a decrease in the level of energy security. The research used the methods of scenario analysis, descriptive statistics, econometric, monographic and comparative analysis. The purpose of the article is to analyze the impact of energy crises on the state of state financial support, to determine ways to minimize risks and ensure financial stability. In the course of the study, the degree of influence of the imbalance of demand and supply of energy resources on the state financial debt was determined through the use of such tools as: analysis of market conditions, assessment of the level of demand and supply for energy resources. The paradigm of an integrated approach to the management of public debt in the context of energy crises is characterized, which is based on an integrated, multidimensional analysis and management of interrelationships between various economic, financial, social and political factors. It is emphasized that consideration of the energy sector should not take place in isolation, but in the context of its interaction with the financial capabilities of other sectors of the economy. Practical recommendations include risk assessment models related to energy crises and methods of stabilizing public finances, which can be used in the operational management of the state's financial debt. The method of integration and coordination of energy, economic, fiscal and social indicators is proposed for determining effective financial instruments and mechanisms for optimizing budget expenditures. It is concluded that in the conditions of imbalance of energy demand and supply, management of financial debt requires a strategic approach based on investments in clean energy, improvement of energy efficiency and accurate forecasting</jats:p>"

Implementing a circular economy certainly has its own challenges. One of which is to find a sustainable supply chain. Sustainable supply chains are designed and man¬aged by combining practices responsible for the environment and society throughout the life cycle of a product or service. This is possible to achieve through good collaboration between supply chains and having a supply chain design with a sustainable concept. Thus, this research discusses the effect of sustainable supply chain management on circular economy performance mediated by circular economy capability. The objects of this research are 82 courier service companies on Java Island. This research employed quantitative design. The data collection method involved distributing online questionnaires to middle – top managers as respondents. The results show that sustainable supply chain management has a positive effect on environmental performance, then sustainable supply chain management has a positive effect on financial performance. Furthermore, circular economy capability partially mediates the correlation between sustainable supply chain management and environmental performance, and partially mediates the correlation between sustainable supply chain management and financial performance. This research conveys the direction of further research in the same re¬search context.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, traditional forecasting techniques cannot frequently present real-time data and respond to dynamic changes in the supply chain network, leading to less-than-ideal decision-making and higher costs. This research aims to create a technique for optimizing the supply chain network based on blockchain-distributed technology (SCN-BT) to overcome these drawbacks and fully utilize the potential of the digital economy. The suggested framework uses the hybridized LSTM network and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to examine demand forecasting in the supply chain network for inventory planning. The SCN-BT framework develops a safe and productive, enabling precise and flexible demand by combining blockchain with optimization techniques. A thorough case study utilized information collected from an enterprise supply chain that operates in the digital economy to show the efficiency of the suggested framework. Compared to conventional approaches, the results show considerable gains in demand forecasting precision, responsiveness of the supply chain, and cost-effectiveness. In the context of the digital economy, demand sensing and prediction enable firms to react to changes swiftly, shorten turnaround times, optimize inventory levels, and improve overall supply chain performance. The results highlight how blockchain technology has the potential to enhance collaboration, trust, and transparency inside intricate supply chain networks working in the digital economy. The experimental results show the proposed to achieve prediction rate of demand prediction rate of 128.93, demand forecasting accuracy ratio of 92.18%, optimum efficiency of 94.25%, RMSE rate of 1841.25, MAE rate of 260.74, and sMAPE rate of 0.1002 compared to other methods.</jats:p>",

The aim of this review was to explore the various techniques available in the literature for detecting VOCs in water samples and discuss their features, advantages, and limitations in facilitating fast and rapid VOC analysis. Established techniques such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry offer high sensitivity and selectivity but are often hindered by complexity and cost. In contrast, emerging technologies like microfluidic gas sensors and cantilever-based sensors provide portable and real-time monitoring capabilities, although they may be susceptible to matrix effects. Overcoming these challenges requires advanced sample preparation techniques and method optimization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decreased solar radiation is one of the main issues of climate change. Decreased solar radiation reduced rice yield, while compound fertilization with silicate enhanced the yield. However, it is not fully understood regarding the fertilization effects on the yield, the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide in paddy fields under decreased solar radiation. Field simulation experiments with shading were conducted in two consecutive years (2019 to 2020) at the Agrometeorological Station, Nanjing, China. An orthogonal experimental design with three factors and three levels was adopted in this study. The shading was set at 3 levels, i.e. no shading (S0), shading from flowering to maturity period (S1), and shading from tillering to maturity period (S2), with 64% of shading rate. The compound fertilization (as NPK) was set at 3 rates, i.e. 100 kghm-2 (F1), 200 kghm-2 (F2), and 300 kghm-2 (F3). The silicate supply was set at 3 levels, i.e. no silicate supply (R0), adding steel slag at 200 kg SiO2hm-2 (R1), and adding steel slag at 400 kg SiO2hm-2 (R2). The results showed that, shading significantly reduced rice yield. Compared with S0, S1 and S2 significantly decreased rice yield by 43.31-43.32% and 48.51-48.52%, respectively. Shading extremely reduced the cumulative CH4 emission. Compared with S0, S1 and S2 decreased the cumulative CH4 emission by 7.47%-15.21 and 52.15-57.72, but increased the cumulative N2O emission by 8.56%-26.25% and 54.80-57.59%, respectively. The compound fertilization significantly increased the cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions. Compared with F1, F2 and F3 increased the cumulative CH4 emission by 42.01-48.29% and 9.59-57.00%; and enhanced the cumulative N2O emission by 5.67-85.81% and 21.32-192.98%, respectively. Compared with control (R0), silicate supply generally decreased the cumulative CH4 emission by 20.1%-29.57, while increased the cumulative N2O emission by 8.58%-39.57% and 9.12%-48.00%, respectively. Shading (S1 and S2) decreased the total global warming potential (GWP) by 6.88%-13.69% and 47.58%-55.73%, while compound fertilization increased the total GWP by 43.91-49.05% and 10.36-59.70%, respectively. In general, shading and compound fertilization increased the greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) by 59.51%-60.62% and 33.13%-105.76%, while silicate application decreased the GHGI by 23.08%-50.50%, respectively. This study suggests that, controlling the fertilization amount was helpful in decreasing the GHGI, simultaneously ensuring rice yield under decreased solar radiation, with the optimal fertilization at 100 kg&amp;middot;hm-2 of compound fertilizer (as NPK) and 200 kg SiO2&amp;middot;hm-2 of steel slag in the lower reaches of Yangtze River, China.</jats:p>"

However, no comprehensive study addresses the contributions of BCT adoption (BCA) on some special business functionalities projected as financial variables like BCA integrity, transparency, etc. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to close this theoretical gap and determine how BCA has contributed to the four business sectors that were selected since FinTech had the greatest potential in these domains. The PRISMA approach, a systematic literature review model, was used in this work to make sure that the greatest number of studies on the topic were accessed. The PRISMA model’s output helped identify relevant publications, and an analysis of these studies served as the foundation for this paper’s findings. The findings reveal that BCA for companies with a disrupting financial technology (FinTech) attitude can help in securing corporate transaction transparency; offer knowledge, same-data, and information sharing; enhance fidelity, integrity, and trust; improve organizational procedures; and prevent fraud with cyber-hacking protection and fraudulence suspension. Moreover, blockchain’s smart contract utilization feature offers ESG and sustainability functionality. This paper’s novelty is the projection to four business sectors of the three-layer research sequence: (i) financial variables operated as BCA functionalities, (ii) issues, risks, limitations, and opportunities associated with the financial variables, and (iii) implications, theoretical contributions, questions, potentiality, and outlook of BCA/FinTech issues. And the ability of managers or practitioners to reference this sequence and make decisions on BCA matters is considered a key contribution. The proposed methodology provides business practitioners with valuable insights to reevaluate their economic challenges and explore the potential of blockchain technology to address them. This study combined a systematic literature review (SLR) with qualitative analysis as part of a hybrid research approach. Quantitative analysis was carried out on all 835 selected papers in the first step, and qualitative analysis was carried out on the top-cited papers that were screened. The current work highlights the key challenges and opportunities in established blockchain implementations and discusses the outlook potentiality of blockchain technology adoption. This study will be useful to managers, practitioners, researchers, and scholars.</jats:p>"

In the agriculture industry in developing countries like Vietnam, social capital may have a greater role when other formal systems are not in place. This study empirically tests the mediating role of supply chain absorptive capability as a complementary asset to leverage social, and cognitive capital to enhance innovation performance. This research examined small food producers using a standard questionnaire and captured 85 responses in Vietnam. The findings showed that social capital plays a more significant role in enhancing absorptive capability, highlighting the need for a structural resource network in developing regions. Food processing firms benefit from the direct and indirect influence of absorptive capability. Absorptive capability acts as a catalyst in enhancing cognitive, and social capital for improving innovation outcomes, such as new product development. The food producers should not just stop at sharing and capturing information, but move forward to deploy new ideas and learned knowledge. The results urge agricultural businesses to establish networks with supply chain partners, who can significantly impact the development of new ideas, and quickly exploit new knowledge to accommodate resources for sustainable agricultural strategies.</jats:p>"

This article presents the state of the field on interventions to maintain food production in these scenarios, aiming to prevent mass starvation and reduce the chance of civilizational collapse and potential existential catastrophe. The potential for rapid scaling, affordability, and large-scale deployment is reviewed for a portfolio of food production methods over land, water, and industrial systems. Special focus is given to proposing avenues for further research and technology development and to collating policy proposals. Maintaining international trade and prioritizing crops for food instead of animal feed or biofuels is paramount. Both mature, proven methods (crop relocation, ruminants, greenhouses, seaweed, fishing, etc.) and novel resilient foods are characterized. A future research agenda is outlined, including scenario characterization, policy development, production ramp-up and economic analyses, and rapid deployment trials.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transportation sector being one of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, there is growing concerns about environmental sustainability, and reducing GHG emissions which has prompted re-evaluation of transportation systems. The 1.5 million strong Indian defence forces have huge transport fleet and this study delves into the potential of Aerial Cableway (ACW) as a promising alternative mode of transport that can significantly reduce emissions of military supply chain in mountainous terrain. The study takes a case of Himalayan terrain to investigate how ACWs offer a low-impact, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly solution compared to conventional ground-based transportation. It takes a case of Pharkian Pass in North Kashmir where defence forces has presence and this pass is often exposed to frequent landslides, snowfall and avalanches. Every year, on an average, approximately 12,000 trucks cross Pharkian pass in a year for purpose of logistics and sustenance. Without touching sensitive issues and by using a multi-criteria-based cost-benefit analysis, the study establishes that even if 75 % of road transport trips are shifted to ACWs, the reduction of GHG emissions is by 57.7 % in addition to significant benefits of the social cost of carbon, environmental costs, economic savings and ensuring strategic advantage like all-weather connectivity.</jats:p>"

This technology, according to the conclusion of a number of authoritative international organizations, along with other energy-saving technologies (use of solar, wind energy, ocean energy, etc.), belongs to the technologies of the 21st century. The main heat costs for household needs in buildings during the cold season are heating costs. This is explained by the operating conditions of buildings during the cold season, when heat loss through the building envelope significantly exceeds internal heat release. Therefore, to maintain the required internal air temperature, buildings are equipped with heating units. During the cold season, to create and maintain thermal comfort in buildings, technically advanced and reliable heating installations are required.\nThe use of the proposed heat pump system will improve the efficiency of autonomous heat supply to decentralized and remote residential and industrial facilities, service enterprises. In addition, the proposed combination of heat pump units and renewable energy sources expands the resource base of the heat pump heating supply system, making it less dependent on fluctuations in ambient temperature, which is very important for increasing the level of reliability of heat pumps.</jats:p>"

Through a comprehensive analysis of 86 SMEs, employing multiple regression models and SEM, the research establishes a significant positive relationship between SCF utilization and SME profitability, as measured by ROA. The findings reveal that financial constraints mediate this relationship, suggesting that SCF alleviates financial pressures, thereby enhancing profitability. Additionally, the study demonstrates that both the degree of financial constraints and the capability for risk management exert moderating effects on the SCF-ROA link, indicating that the benefits of SCF are more pronounced under greater financial challenges and with stronger risk management practices. The constructed SEM model validates all hypotheses, illustrating that SCF positively impacts profitability through direct effects and by reducing financial constraints. The model fit indices confirm the high level of model fit, supporting the theoretical and practical implications of the study. The research contributes to the literature by enriching theories related to supply chain finance, SME development, financial constraints, and risk management. It also provides actionable insights for Chinese SMEs in optimizing financing strategies and risk management, and offers a basis for policymakers to improve support policies. The study acknowledges limitations in sample size and scope, suggesting avenues for future research to expand the sample and explore non-financial factors affecting the effectiveness of SCF.</jats:p>"

Four Stackelberg game models are developed: (i) the dual-fairness concerns are considered by the retailer (model F); (ii) the retailer does not consider both types of fairness concerns (model N); (iii) the retailer only considers the distributional fairness concerns (model D); (iv) the retailer only considers the peer-induced fairness concerns (model P). We use numerical analysis to examine the equilibrium outcomes under dual-fairness concerns. The results show that: (1) The increase in the coefficient of peer-induced fairness concerns will result in more profit for the manufacturer in most cases, while distributional fairness concerns always hurt the manufacturer; (2) In most parameter cases, the increase in the degree of distributional fairness concerns favors the retailer. The retailer considers only peer-induced fairness concerns when the degree of distributional fairness concerns is low and the degree of peer-induced fairness concerns is relatively high, whereas in other cases, two kinds of fairness concerns are ignored; (3) Model P is the most profitable and model D is most disadvantageous for the third party, however, for the manufacturer it is the opposite; (4) The impact of fairness concerns on the environment depends on the retailer’s attitude towards fairness concerns. Model P is the best for the environment, while model D has the highest environmental impact.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces social network analysis (SNA) to investigate retrofitting supply chains. It tests the approach by studying those undertaking whole-house retrofit of social housing in a case study city. Network visualisations and metrics including network density (overall connectedness), in-degree centrality (support needed to complete a task) and closeness centrality (speed of access to information) are used to compare how communication varies through different retrofit stages. The preliminary results indicate high density networks and strong ties amongst project leaders (the local authority and tier-one contractors), indicating the transfer of tacit, complex information. These project leaders retain a high closeness centrality throughout the retrofitting process, but there is uneven communication, with subcontractors experiencing infrequent communication and connection only to tier-one contractors. This does not necessarily hinder project success, but may indicate missed opportunities for shared learning. Further, as a quantitative mapping technique, SNA alone does not provide insight into the nature of the interactions taking place. The approach introduced here can be strengthened by incorporating analysis of the types of information exchanged and detailed qualitative insight into participants’ experiences of communication throughout a single retrofitting project.\nPractice relevance\nThis paper develops an SNA approach to map the organisations involved in whole-house retrofitting in the social housing sector. The findings illustrate how patterns of communication change throughout the retrofitting process. The data show close collaboration between the project managers and tier-one contractors at the beginning (project definition) and end (commissioning and monitoring) of the retrofitting project. Tier-one contractors retain closeness to contractors during physical install, but the overall network is dispersed for this stage. For practitioners such as retrofitting project managers, the method can be used to understand how supply chains are coalescing under the PAS2035 standard, and indicate potential points where communication with and amongst contractors could be developed. The method could be powerfully combined with the evaluation of retrofitting outcomes to understand which types of supply chain structure are most effective in delivering successful retrofit.</jats:p>"

This paper examines a secondary supply chain comprising manufacturers and retailers, focusing on three supply chain decision-making models: one where the manufacturer is the channel leader, one where the retailer is the channel leader, and one where both parties have equal power. The study investigates the impact of manufacturers misrepresenting their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) information and the challenges associated with recycling efforts on the optimal performance of the supply chain. The findings reveal that when manufacturers lead the supply chain, they do not misrepresent their private information. However, when retailers dominate, manufacturers tend to underreport their CSR levels and the difficulty of recycling efforts. In scenarios where manufacturers and retailers have equal power, manufacturers do not misreport the difficulty of recycling but do underreport their CSR levels. This misreporting benefits the manufacturers at the expense of retailers and overall supply chain profitability, while also discouraging the recycling of used products. Across all three power structures, the study shows that retailers’ marketing efforts decrease as the misrepresentation of recycling difficulty increases, and increase as the misrepresentation of CSR levels increases. To mitigate the effects of manufacturers’ misreporting under information asymmetry, the paper proposes revenue-sharing contracts and two-part pricing contracts to coordinate the closed-loop supply chain under different power structures. Both contracts are shown to achieve Pareto improvements within the supply chain. This research provides valuable insights for enterprises operating within closed-loop supply chains, highlighting the importance of enhancing communication and cooperation to bridge information gaps and ensuring the coordina.</jats:p>"

The findings demonstrate that when the government chooses static subsidy and static tax policies, there is no evolutionary stable strategy in the game system. The flaws of the static reward and punishment system can be adequately compensated for by the dynamic subsidy and dynamic tax policy, leading to an evolutionary stable state. The likelihood of developers producing prefabricated structures is negatively connected with policy cost and subsidy upper limits and favorably correlated with tax upper limits, according to the dynamic reward and punishment mechanism. The findings of the study have significant implications for government policy that will encourage the widespread use of prefabricated structures in China.</jats:p>",

This study developed an economic optimization model using linear mathematical program theory to determine the optimal sizes of different components in a CCHP system. The study found that CCHP systems with internal combustion engines have the largest optimal size due to lower capital expenditure and improved hourly changes in combined energy production by considering electrical and absorption chillers simultaneously. The analysis compared the size determination of CCHP systems with internal combustion engine (ICE), sterling engine (SE), and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technologies. PEMFC had the highest annual overall cost among the technologies studied. The results of determining the size of the CCHP system are compared with ICE, SE, and PEMFC technologies. It has been noted that PEMFC has the highest annual overall cost among the studied technologies.

Cooling machines generally use refrigerant working fluid in the compressor, refrigerant is a gas that is not environmentally friendly. So it is necessary to conduct alternative studies, that can replace refrigerant gas and simplify dimensions, weight, and convenience. This study was conducted to analyze the effect of applying a power supply on the performance of thermoelectric coolers. The experimental method applied 2 types of power supplies for thermoelectric Peltier coolers in cooling the mini cooler box space, then the 1400 ml capacity cooling room was given a varying volume of drinks. Analysis of the effect of using a power supply on the cooling performance of the mini cooler box on the thermoelectric Peltier system obtained the results that the time to reach the ambient temperature takes different times. The greater the load put into the box, the longer it takes to cool the drinking water. The greater the power supply ampere specifications, the better it is in accelerating the cooling rate but the power required is greater such as the application of the type of power supply with the type 20A.</jats:p>"

Drawing upon positions from the systems sciences and the supply chain management literature, a survey on supply chain resilience and systems thinking skills was constructed, with the perspectives of 180 supply chain practitioners obtained. A positive correlation was identified between the variables, indicating that the presence of systems thinking skills can positively benefit practitioners when tackling the supply chain resilience challenge. The data show that resilience returned a more substantial position than systems thinking skills, with practitioners upstream being more resilient and having a greater system thinking awareness than downstream compatriots. A conceptual framework that positions systems thinking skills as an enablement for practitioners when devising supply chain resilience strategies is presented, with the new knowledge providing a more expansive array of insights that can complement extant approaches employed. Limitations of this paper relate to the skills questions being informed by a single methodology, systems dynamics, with future research being called for that represents a broader array of systems knowledge to investigate this unexplored phenomenon.</jats:p>"

A large number of concepts, tools, and methodologies have been proposed in support of this performance improvement. They are mainly based on the use of classical optimization or enterprise modeling methods. However, environmental and social issues, not to mention digital transformation, are often ignored or not sufficiently integrated. Indeed, the world geopolitical situation, the increase in oil prices, and the commitment to protect our earth require the integration of sustainability aspects and Industry 4.0 concepts like digital twin and artificial intelligence in transforming the supply chain. This paper focuses on defining a conceptual framework to support sustainable supply chain management and digital transformation. It aims to exploit the sustainability and digital maturity of companies to transform their supply chains and enhance their performance to meet the challenges of Industry 5.0. Several practices related to sustainability, as well as two use cases on optimization and digital twin, are presented to illustrate this framework. Finally, based on the previous practices and use cases, an adapted framework for the supply chain manager to support the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 has been developed, as well as a performance dashboard.</jats:p>"

Supply chains are often plagued by fraud, counterfeiting, and a lack of transparency, particularly for end customers. Blockchain technology, known for its immutability and transparency, presents a promising solution to these challenges. In this study, we thoroughly discuss our implementation of blockchain technology within the context of the supply chain. The paper outlines the entire process, beginning with data collection and pre-processing and culminating in the secure posting of transactions via smart contracts. By leveraging Blockchain's decentralized nature, our system ensures that each transaction is securely recorded and immutable, significantly reducing the risk of data tampering or fraud. A synthetic dataset tailored for supply chain operations demonstrates the proposed system's feasibility and effectiveness. The results indicate substantial improvements in data integrity, traceability, and overall supply chain efficiency. This research highlights the potential of Blockchain to revolutionize supply chain management and provides a detailed framework for implementing such a system in real-world scenarios. The study's findings suggest that blockchain technology can be a critical tool in addressing the prevalent issues of trust and transparency in modern supply chains, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability and efficiency of these complex networks.</jats:p>",

Initially, this division was intended to focus work on specific sectors, ensuring precision, speed, and guaranteeing Project Performance. However, high levels of fragmentation can result in a lack of integration between parts of the project, which can adversely affect both the implementation process and the final outcome of the project. One such adverse effect is project delay, which can diminish project performance, as seen in the X PEB steel construction project. Previous studies have identified an approach to improve project quality through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM). Therefore, this study examines the impact of fragmentation on SCM concerning project performance, comparing the effect of SCM on performance under conditions of high fragmentation versus when fragmentation is disregarded in the PEB steel construction project. The results show that SCM influences performance by 51%. This analysis indicates that SCM plays a crucial role in achieving the performance of PEB steel construction projects. When project fragmentation is assumed to be non-existent, SCM's influence on project performance is even greater, reaching 82%, indicating that SCM has a significant impact on project performance and serves as a solution to maintaining project performance. This study concludes that fragmentation serves as a moderating variable affecting project performance in PEB steel construction.</jats:p>"

Social media usage (SMU) is a vital and valuable tool that builds customer-centric supply chains by effectively communicating large volumes of valuable data. This study examines the influence of social media usage on the development of dynamic capabilities, including supply chain sensing capabilities (SCSC), knowledge sharing capability (KSC), and social capital (SC), which are crucial for constructing agile and resilient supply chains that can effectively respond to dynamic and turbulent environments, ultimately enhancing sustainable business performance. To assess the proposed investigation model, data was gathered through a structured questionnaire administered to supply chain members currently engaged with manufacturing firms. The evaluation of the proposed hypotheses is carried out through the application of structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study offer empirical evidence supporting the proposition that SMU within manufacturing firms promotes the development of sensing capabilities, knowledge-sharing capability, and social capital. Furthermore, this study tests the moderation role of environmental dynamism in the relationship between social media use and sustainable business performance. This underscores the pivotal role played by SMU in facilitating the adaptation and responsiveness of the supply chain to dynamic and uncertain environments, thereby contributing to the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of organizations.</jats:p>"

These converters ensure stable sustainable power transmission across various energy sources while enabling high-power conversion. However, controlling power direction poses a challenge in DAB/TAB converters for emergency energy supply, typically a rapid change of power direction of any port of DAB/TAB converters. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel automatic power direction control method for DAB/TAB converters, enabling bidirectional power transmission without manual intervention based on the state of charge (SOC) of battery for emergency energy supply. This method realizes the change of power direction of each port in DAB/TAB converter automatically according to different situations, even in emergencies. Given the now widespread shortage of emergency energy and the higher cost of labor regulation, this approach simplifies operations and enhances system safety and sustainability by eliminating the need for human supervision. A well-implemented automatic control method ensures efficient and consistent power transfer within the system by change the direction in about 3 s, whenever power direction adjustment is necessary.</jats:p>"

Conjunctive use, a united management of both surface water and groundwater resources, is being progressively considered as one of the fundamental approaches to solving these issues. This paper gives a detailed overview of the conjunctive use in water resource management considering the present tendencies and directions of development in this sphere. The present study relies on a diverse variety of literature resources which integrate the new techniques, equipment, and policies in respect to conjunctive use. It covers important issues like hydrological modeling, innovative groundwater recharge methods, and integrating conjunctive use techniques into adaptive management system. Moreover, the review also evaluates the roles of different parties, such as government agencies, communities, and industries, involved in the conjunctive use approaches and the promotion of collaborative governance mechanisms. This review identifies that while the conjunctive use approaches are very promising for solutions to water security, fragmented management and poor data integration constrain them. The paper conducts an all-embracing analysis that pinpoints the upcoming problems and solutions, and discovers the need for extensive research and innovation to make the conjunctive water resources management more efficient and resilient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim: Research on supply chain disruptions is most commonly conducted on the inter-organizational level of analysis. Although personal relationships in business-to-business relationships are generally considered important, the role of personal relationships during supply chain disruptions has been neglected in extant literature. Our study aims to fill this void by focusing on the role of personal relationships from the buyer perspective.\nDesign / Research methods: An embedded case study was conducted at manufacturer ASML on the role of personal relationships during seven supply chain disruptions. ASML is the world’s leading supplier of machines for the semiconductor industry. The unit of analysis is a supply chain disruption due to a delay or interruption in supply caused by the supplier or a sub-supplier. A total of seven sub-cases were examined.\nConclusions / findings: We found that personal relationships facilitate communication, the building of trust, flexibility, mutual understanding and anticipating behaviors. The results indicate that personal relationships indeed can play an important role in advancing supplier performance and addressing supply chain disruptions.\nOriginality / value of the article: The lack of research into the role of personal relationships in handling supply chain disruptions is a notable omission and points to a gap in the current body of knowledge. This study contributes to current understandings and knowledge by being one of the first studies to specifically investigate the role of personal relationships in a context of supply chain disruptions.\nImplications of the research (if applicable): The results of this study have important implications for practice. The recommendation for management is to make employees aware and train them to invest in personal relationships which lays the foundation for successful collaboration also on the inter firm level. Trust and communication can be reinforced by regular face-to-face meetings, team-building activities with counterparts and communication training for better personal skills. Regular communication and maintaining relationships in stable times can help to increase supply chain resilience.\nLimitations of the research: A limitation of this research is its focus on describing the role of personal relationships during different supply chain disruptions within a single focus organization. Another limitation of our study is the focus on supply chain disruptions that were successfully resolved. Further research could address these issues.\nJEL: L63, M5\n </jats:p>"

However, these strategies also introduce risks that require meticulous management. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disruptions in supply chains, including the vulnerable food supply chain (FCS), strained further by escalating food prices and resource depletion in recent times. Within this context, the vulnerability of global FSCs has escalated significantly due to government-imposed lockdowns during the pandemic. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted disruptions in global FSCs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By delving deep into the complexities of these disruptions, it seeks to uncover the key factors contributing to the vulnerability of supply chains. Employing a blend of literature review and expert opinions, the study identifies and prioritizes factors using the Fermatean Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FF-AHP). A two-level criteria framework consisting of three main criteria and eleven sub-criteria has been developed, taking into account expert recommendations and previous studies. According to the results obtained, it has been revealed that the Managerial factors within the main criteria are the most significant factors in the fragility of the FSC. Among these factors, it has been observed that Technology, Corporation, and Inventory Management are the leading criteria causing to the vulnerability of the FSC. This is the first study to investigate the vulnerabilities of FSC using fuzzy logic. The research underscores the imperative of comprehensive risk management strategies that encompass all stakeholders within the supply chain, particularly during unanticipated crises like pandemics.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the relationship between supply chain risks and performance among SMEs in the ASEAN countries. Supply chain performance, defined as meeting end-customer demands, involves ensuring commodity availability, on-time deliveries, and maintaining sufficient inventory and capacity across organizational boundaries from raw materials to the final consumer. Methods The study utilized a sample of 385 entrepreneurs from the consumer products industry in ASEAN countries. The research was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to establish the correlation between supply chain performance and risks. Factors related to the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) for economic integration and regional trade agreements were incorporated to understand the diverse economic development, infrastructure, and regulatory environments across nations. Results The analysis revealed a strong correlation between supply chain risks and performance. Entrepreneurs in the consumer products industry should collaborate closely with governmental organizations to address the unique challenges posed by regulatory landscapes, cross-border logistics, and geopolitical risks within the ASEAN region. Adapting to cultural nuances and market variations, along with optimizing logistics and infrastructure, are crucial for successful supply chain risk management. Conclusions Effective supply chain risk management significantly enhances the performance of the consumer products industry’s supply chain. Entrepreneurs in this sector should align their strategies with regional and national governments to proactively address issues and mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and adaptive measures are necessary to handle emerging risks in the dynamic market landscape. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers, suggesting that supportive frameworks and policies are necessary to bolster SME capabilities in risk management. By fostering a collaborative environment between the public and private sectors, ASEAN countries can enhance overall supply chain resilience. Future research could explore sector-specific risk management practices and their impact on supply chain robustness, underscoring the imperative for SMEs to adopt proactive and integrated risk management approaches to thrive in a complex and evolving economic environment.</ns3:p>"

This study aimed to examine the status of functional areas within the drug supply chain management framework and assess the overall capability maturity at first-level PHFs. The cross-sectional study was conducted among 183 drug store sites from six townships of Pyay District. Only situational analysis was exercised to determine the existing situations. The overall capability maturity was determined according to the definitions of levels of the Capability Maturity Module Tool. 58.47% lacked formal drug supply management training, with 23.5% not undergoing performance reviews. Drug forecasting predominantly relied on a pen-paper system (91.6%) and factors like patient load (87.39%), drug consumption (85.71%), and disease prevalence (64.71%). Store site analysis revealed that 65.03% exhibited marginal capability, lacking standardized drugstores and employing unstandardized procedures. Storage practices varied, with 48.69% storing drugs conveniently and others categorizing them by drug type (32.79%) or using the first-expired-first-out system (40.98%). Approximately 42.69% reported having expired drugs. Concerning transportation costs, 37.16% incurred expenses exceeding 20,000 Kyats per time, with management staff often covering the costs. Waste management methods included burial pits (49.18%), incineration (62.84%), and sharp pits (55.19%). A majority (78.14%) used safety boxes, and 57.38% implemented a color-coded system for waste bins. The logistics management information system was entirely paper-based (100%). On average, assessments of drug quality conditions and physical damages scored 46.51% and 48.20%, respectively. The overall supply chain maturity at first-level public health facilities is at a marginal capability level (36.35%). While some basic drug supply chain management procedures were in place, they were not consistently followed, and many systems remain manual. The findings underscored significant inconsistencies in the management functions of supplied drugs, with poor adherence to Standard Operating Procedure guidelines.</jats:p>"

However, the escalation of geopolitical tensions has posed significant challenges to the smooth flow of mineral resource trade. This study aims to analyse the consequences of global trade policy uncertainty (TPU) and various measures of geopolitical risk (GPR), including terror threats, war threats and nuclear threats (NCT), on Russian mineral exports (MEX). The analysis covers the period from January 2013 to December 2021. By employing sophisticated quantile regression methodologies, such as the cross-quantilogram (CQ) and cross-spectral quantile coherency (CQC) techniques, this study uncovers a compelling interaction between TPU and Russian MEX across different market conditions. Interestingly, TPU exerts a significantly positive impact on the export volumes of Russian mineral resources. In contrast, the presence of GPRs, particularly warfare and terrorism, proves to be detrimental to MEX during bullish market phases across various memory horizons. Surprisingly, NCT stimulates mineral trade during bearish market conditions, both in monthly and annual timeframes. These findings remain robust and consistent even when the CQC technique is employed. In light of these pressing geopolitical challenges, this study underscores the importance of developing sustainable mineral trade policies that foster enhanced global cohesion. It is crucial to address these challenges effectively to ensure the smooth and efficient flow of mineral resources in the international trade landscape. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: C22, F13, F14, P28, Q21, Q27 </jats:p>"

This context raises the need to analyze sectors that, due to the complexity of their projects, require more efficient supply chain management. Two clear examples of these sectors are aerospace and shipbuilding, which demand greater efficiency and sustainability in their operations. The main objective of this study is to compare these two sectors to evaluate the degree of sustainability of their supply chains and how Industry 4.0 technologies have contributed to achieving these goals. To perform this, the Delphi method will be used, a tool that collects information through expert opinions, which will provide key indicators for the comparison. The use of this method will facilitate the identification of convergences and divergences in the management of sustainability in both sectors. Through this analysis, the expected results will reflect the specific needs of each industry in terms of productivity and sustainability. Thus, the study will offer a comprehensive view of how the aerospace and shipbuilding sectors can move toward more sustainable and efficient production models, integrating Industry 4.0 concepts and improving the management of their global supply chains.</jats:p>"

The behavior of dependences on the tourist market of supply and demand on the price is considered. The modeling of the behavior of the tourism market was carried out using a market dynamic model in the plane of variables “supply – price – demand” taking into account the interests of different groups of consumers, primarily from the point of view of pricing. The delay between changes in supply and demand volumes is taken into account using a Cobweb model. To test this method, information was collected on family expenses when traveling abroad (outbound tourism, tourist vacations lasting 7-15 days) by surveying the employees of 38 travel organizations as of 2021. Three segments of the tourism market are identified: low ($2000 − 4000), medium ($4000 − 12000), and VIP-segment ($12,000 − 20,000). The analysis of the modeling results showed that the behavior of tourists of different segments can significantly influence the market dynamics. The use of a Cobweb model allowed for determining the level of stability of tourist behavior and assessing the possibility of consumer migration from one segment to another. Sensitivity to price changes and response to new offers from different segments can be different, which is important for determining pricing strategies, marketing, and the development of new tourism products.</jats:p>",

The Wilaya of El-Oued is considered the backbone of agriculture in Algeria, covering 40% of the total cultivated area in the country. This makes it one of the regions with the highest consumption of agricultural fertilizers to meet the aspirations of local authorities in this field. Additionally, it has experienced significant population growth in recent years, coupled with a weak sewage network, which could lead to the direct contamination of groundwater and the region's natural resources. This study aims to test various deterministic interpolation methods, such as the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, the radial basis function (RBF), and the geostatistical methodology (point kriging), for mapping nitrates in 113 wells in the El-Oued aquifer. We utilized Surfer 20 for this purpose. Given the significant differences in estimates based on the methods used, it is appropriate to evaluate the spatial distribution maps of nitrates obtained by comparing their predictive qualities through the calculation of the mean estimation error. The results indicate the superiority of the point kriging technique compared with deterministic estimates, with R2 estimation errors of about 0.067.</jats:p>",

Because a medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution network transmits power at relatively high voltages (typically in the tens of kV), accurate fault diagnosis using high-performance sensors is crucial to improve the safety of MVDC distribution networks. With the increasing power consumption of high-performance sensors, conventional power supplies using optical converters with 5 W-class output characteristics face limitations in achieving the rated output power. Therefore, this paper proposes a safe and reliable power supply method using the principle of IPT to securely maintain the insulation distance between the distribution network and the current sensor-supply line. A 100 W prototype IPT system is investigated, and its feasibility is validated by comparing its performance with conventional optical converters.</jats:p>"

Analysis of the data shows a broad range in mean annual rainfall, from 631.26 to 1,174.16 mm, highlighting the region's climatic diversity. A stark contrast in rainfall levels is noted between two periods: 1986 to 1990 saw exceptionally low rainfall (9.53–12.55 mm), while 1981 to 1985 experienced high precipitation (13,220.97–13,951.36 mm). The study identifies a peak in precipitation coverage (66%) from 2016 to 2020, with rainfall volumes reaching 5,993.81–6,357.93 mm, contrasting with the lowest coverage (1%) from 2006 to 2010. Additionally, the research reveals significant variation in specific humidity, with the lowest levels recorded between 2021 and 2023 (6,623.94–7,600.59 g/kg) and the highest between 2016 and 2020 (16,353.74–17,313.94 g/kg). The highest and lowest area-wise percentages of specific humidity were observed between 1991 and 1995 (38%) and 1996 and 2000 (5%), respectively. These findings shed light on the dynamic nature of precipitation and humidity in the region, offering critical insights for understanding local climate patterns and informing sectors dependent on precise climatic data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous studies have advanced the conceptual framing of a “supply chain” to describe and examine key steps, inputs, and flows related to the production and use of seed and plant material in ecological restoration. However, these studies have paid less attention to investigating interrelationships among social actors throughout the “supply chain” stages for ecological restoration and allied activities. We applied social network analysis metrics to evaluate the number, kind, and strength of relationships among 157 social actors in the nine‐state region of the Northeastern United States, where rapid growth in restoration activities is driving a demand surge for native seed and plant materials. Restoration supply chains are more complex than previous conceptualization suggests, and we argue that the term “restoration supply networks” is more illustrative of this complexity. Results highlighted interdependency among different sectors, marked variation in input and output flows across spatial–temporal scales, and interplay among linear and nonlinear supply chain steps. The restoration supply network in the study area had a core–periphery structure, with a core comprising end‐users such as government agencies, design and build contractors, and non‐profit organizations surrounded by a periphery of seed and plant material suppliers. It is important to avoid oversimplifying seed and plant material supply chains as linear systems with strong linkages. Understanding relationship patterns among supply network actors can enhance communication, coordination, and collaboration among actors in all key restoration supply chain steps, a prerequisite to overcoming seed and plant material bottlenecks and meeting global restoration goals in the coming decades.</jats:p>",

Whether the Japanese military at the IMR ever played a role in overseeing the building of the Thai-Burma railway also raises a salient question. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether any Japanese EPWSD had ever been deployed to the IMR and if it played a role in overseeing work at the Thai-Burma railway. A secondary objective is to examine the trials of former Japanese soldiers who were negligent in providing Allied prisoners of war (POWs) with clean accommodations and forced them to live in unsanitary conditions along the railway, resulting in diseases, a punishable war crime. This is a qualitative study that relies on old documents, especially those concerning the trials of the Japanese by the Allies, memoirs of former Japanese soldiers serving in Malaya and other secondary sources. A document and content analysis were conducted. The results of this study are presented as a narrative. The findings show that the 2nd EPWSD, part of the 5th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, conducted malaria research at the IMR and was present at the Thai-Burma railway to supply clean water with the Ishii Shiro water filter, dig trenches, make attempts to combat malaria and ensure the cleanliness of the camps where POWs lived. However, the trials of Banno Hirateru et al., Major Mizutani, Eiguma Ishida et al. and Seita Takizawa illustrate that failing to ensure sanitary living conditions, resulting in various diseases, and denying medical supplies were punishable war crimes with varying sentences.</jats:p>"

The control of the amount of leaked information facilitates information sharing because, absent such control, a retailer may refrain from sharing information due to the concern of information leakage. Specifically, we analyze a supply chain in which a retailer observes Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) demand for a single product where all players use the myopic order‐up‐to policy for determining their orders. We introduce a new class of information sharing arrangements, coined partial‐information shock (PaIS) sharing. This new class of information sharing agreements extends the previously studied mechanisms of demand sharing and full‐information shock sharing. We demonstrate that the retailer can construct a PaIS sharing arrangement that allows for an intermediate level of information sharing while simultaneously controlling the amount of leakage. We characterize when one PaIS arrangement will be more valuable to the supplier than another. We conclude with a numerical study that highlights that there does not necessarily need to be a tradeoff between the supplier having a better forecast and the retailer experiencing a higher level of leakage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regulatory compliance was an essential component of contemporary corporate operations, guaranteeing conformity to laws, rules, and standards controlling different aspects of organisational activity. Businesses operating in South Eastern Nigeria encounter complex obstacles to regulatory compliance, such as currency depreciation, the dynamic nature of data protection legislation, and the increasing global integration of supply chains. This report offers valuable insights into the intricate process of adjusting supply chain strategies to address regulatory compliance difficulties in South Eastern Nigeria. The paper examined regulatory compliance difficulties and their effects on supply chain dynamics by conducting a thorough literature review and analysing current research. Devaluing currency led to changes in import/export levies, tariffs, and customs procedures, which need quick and adaptable actions to ensure compliance and competitiveness. In addition, the digitalization of corporate operations intensified the issues of ensuring data security and privacy compliance. This necessitated investing in technological solutions and adopting proactive risk management strategies. Despite these difficulties, firms in South Eastern Nigeria adopted a range of tactics, such as implementing compliance management systems, diversifying suppliers and markets, and engaging with regulatory agencies, to successfully modify their supply chain strategies. The results emphasised the significance of taking proactive actions, engaging in strategic planning, and fostering cooperation among relevant parties to effectively address regulatory compliance obstacles and maintain competitiveness in the global market.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pacific Medan Industri, a leading producer of palm oil, faces significant challenges with its scrap distribution system, which currently relies on manual processes. This manual system has been identified as having several major issues, including inaccuracies in data recording and management, delays in the shipping process, and ineffective coordination between various units within the supply chain. These issues not only lead to low operational efficiency but also risk disrupting customer satisfaction and diminishing the company's competitive edge in an increasingly competitive market. This study aims to address these problems by optimizing the scrap distribution system through the application of Supply Chain Management (SCM) principles. Using a qualitative approach that includes literature review, in-depth interviews with stakeholders, and relevant documentation analysis, this research explores the various weaknesses present in the current manual scrap distribution system. The analysis reveals significant shortcomings, such as inefficiencies in data management, lack of integration between units resulting in poor coordination, and slow shipping processes that hinder productivity and customer satisfaction. As a solution, the study proposes the development of a SCM-based information distribution system. This system is designed to address the identified weaknesses by leveraging current technology to automate distribution processes, improve data accuracy, expedite shipping times, and enhance communication and coordination between units in the supply chain. The implementation of this system is expected to enhance overall operational efficiency, improve scrap management, and ensure better coordination across the entire supply chain. It is anticipated that PT. Pacific Medan Industri will benefit from increased operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and a strengthened competitive position in the market through the adoption of this SCM-based information distribution system.\r\n \r\nKeywords: Supply Chain Management, Scrap, PT.

В качестве теплоносителя используется нагретая вода и энергия высокопотенциальных источников тепла. Актуальным вопросом является оптимизация использования энергии низкопотенциальной теплоты с целью повышения энергоэффективности в системах теплоснабжения. Результаты. Выполнен сравнительный анализ тепловой эффективности термосифонного и традиционного теплообменных аппаратов в системах теплоснабжения и горячего водоснабжения. Выводы. Внедрение термосифонных теплообменных аппаратов требует больших материальных вложений, и их работа менее эффективна, но в некоторых схемах сопоставима с традиционными теплообменными аппаратами.

Heating of supply air and water in heat supply systems is currently carried out using recuperative heat exchangers. Heated water and energy from high-potential heat sources are used as a coolant. Currently, a pressing issue is the optimization of the use of low-grade heat energy in order to increase energy efficiency in heat supply systems. Results. A comparative analysis of the thermal efficiency of thermosiphon and traditional heat exchangers in heat supply and hot water supply systems has been carried out. Conclusions. The introduction of thermosiphon heat exchangers requires large material investments and their operation is less efficient, but in some schemes it is comparable to traditional heat exchangers. In this regard, the use of circuits with thermosiphons is an urgent task in the heat supply system.</jats:p>",

This is because, since the mid-2000s, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has consistently used interest rate adjustment as a policy tool to manage exchange rate volatility, with mixed outcomes. The study utilised a dataset consisting of 68 quarters of time series data, spanning from 2006Q1 to 2022Q4, and adopted the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to evaluate the influence of interest rates, money supply growth, and institutional quality on exchange rate stability in Nigeria, employing an ex-post facto research approach. Using the ARDL to test the hypothesis, the study found that monetary policy rate and money supply have long-run insignificant cointegrating relationships with exchange rate in Nigeria (Adj R2=0.642; F-stat (4, 63) = 53.813, p&lt;0.05). The study concluded that interest rates have a significant impact on exchange rates in Nigeria. The study found that the independence of the CBN and adoption of capital mobility, and a fixed exchange rate mechanism in Nigeria are a violation of the principle of “impossible trinity” of fixed exchange rates and recommended a review of the exchange rates management policy.</jats:p>"

We focused on three main historical periods, namely the Roman, Lombard and Papal times, and the recent-present times. During this long historical time, the water supply amount and quality have changed many times, and this has probably affected the well-being and growth of the city. The best water quality characterized the Roman times, when large karst springs were tapped, feeding the town for centuries. In this period, the town experienced the largest population expansion. On the other hand, the most depressed period was the Papal times, coinciding with the isolation of the city, as it was an enclave of the Pontifical State. During this period, the water supply from external sources was not guaranteed and therefore it primarily derived from the local, low-quality water resources. Only after the unification of Italy, and also after the Second World War, the water supply systems have been improved, and new aqueducts have brought again high-quality waters to Benevento coming from karst aquifers. Nowadays, the drinking water management of Benevento is still a matter of debate. In the near future, the water from a dam-reservoir (Campolattaro dam, Tammaro River) will be exploited to guarantee the water needs of the city, and water-supply systems will undergo further changes . The knowledge about the historical evolution of the water supply of Benevento represents an essential requirement for consciously analyzing the future planning and management of water resources.</jats:p>"

The author presents materials and methods for finding solutions related to the actualization of the tasks of improving the reliability of the university's supply system in conditions of increased requirements for the duration of logistics cycles for servicing applications from internal consumers with a change in the proportion of urgent and unique positions. The general aspects of the options under consideration for the logistical procurement process of the university, supply functions and the principle of determining the needs for purchased resources are determined. A factor analysis of the reduction in the duration of the logistics cycle of servicing requests from internal consumers has been carried out, taking into account the specifics of managing the time parameters of logistics processes in strict accordance with established regulatory documents. Based on the factor analysis, the influence of the parameters of the requests of internal consumers and the processes of functioning of the university's contract division on the efficiency of the supply system in terms of compliance with the target parameters of the duration of the logistics cycle is shown. The relationship between the degree of strength of the regulatory framework of the Russian Federation and the degree of maturity of logistics processes in conducting procurement procedures to provide the university with resources has been clarified. It was revealed that not in all cases the accepted logistic process of purchasing inventory and other resources to provide the university is positive. The assessment of compliance with the strategic objectives of the university's resource supply process was carried out. A methodology for the work of departments with the assessment of various groups of indicators, in particular, determining the logistical, corporate, financial, production and other results of interaction, is proposed.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to assess groundwater quality and contamination sources in the region utilizing statistical methods. A total of 78 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed using standard methods. The hydrochemistry analysis of samples revealed that several parameters such as Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3−, NO3−, F− and PO43− surpassed the limits prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The principal component analysis yielded three significant factors, explaining 68.96% variation, highlighting geogenic and anthropogenic influences on groundwater chemistry. Hierarchical cluster analysis categorized groundwater into three clusters based on the parameters with similar trends of variation. Furthermore, discriminant analysis identified four significant variables (Mg2+, F−, Cl− and NO3−) responsible for creating the distinction among the identified clusters. Hydrogeochemical categorization and multivariate statistical analyses indicated that rock–water interaction, weathering, leaching and anthropogenic activities collectively influenced groundwater quality throughout the studied region. The Water Quality Index reveals that 59% of samples have good water quality, while 41% exhibit poor quality predominantly concentrated in the south-western, south-eastern and central regions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of statistical techniques to interpret complex datasets and grasp water quality dynamics, enhancing groundwater management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, apart from manufacturing processes, the remanufacturing of products is considerably important. Appropriate remanufacturing requires the operation of long-run manufacturing systems. However, in long-run processes, the production system may convert to an out-of-control state due to machine breakdowns. Then, defective products are frequently produced; this increases wastage and disrupts environmental sustainability. In this model, a smart autonomation policy is deliberated for an error-free inspection in separating defective products during production. The autonomation policy facilitates waste reduction through remanufacturing. This paper concentrates on customer awareness and service-dependent demand, which directly improves the overall profitability of the system. A discrete investment to reduce setup cost, continuous investment to collect used goods, and cap-and-trade strategy to limit carbon emission are considered to obtain a more realistic model. Classical optimization method is applied for global maximum profit test of the profit function with respect to cycle length, customer awareness, service investment, discrete investment to reduce setup cost, number of shipments, and container capacities. Numerical testing, sensitivity to total profit in different cost parameters, and comparisons with previous research are explained. Some special scenarios including graphical representations are discussed to prove that a large investment is more beneficial than the cost of specific setup and collection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The trend in many countries is to promote local consumption of food. This is done by encouraging consumers to connect directly with local farmers or by building hubs that are known as food hubs. Most of the studies on the environmental impact of short food supply chains (SFSCs) focus on the evaluation the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SFSCs where consumers are directly connected to local farmers. Also, these studies mainly focus on GHG emissions due to transportation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study or theoretical models on the estimation and impact of food hub selection and design on total GHG emissions, although they can play an important role in economic, environmental, and social sustainability of an SFSC. In this paper, we develop a framework to estimate GHG emissions from hubs and transportation in a two-echelon SFSC. We introduce a novel approach that utilizes piece-wise linear functions to model the hubs’ GHG emissions combined with an optimization model to calculate the total GHG emission of the SFSC. With this approach, we address the gaps in the literature for a more realistic supply chain model. Our optimization-based approach determines the optimal location, size, and number of food hubs to minimize total GHG emissions. We apply this framework, under various conditions, to the design of a particular SFSC in the Normandy region of France. We also extend the study to other countries. We provide several numerical results that are then analysed. Our analysis shows that the number of foods hubs, their location, and their design may considerably impact the total GHG emissions, depending on the input parameters and data. Furthermore, this study contributes to the advancement of sustainable and green supply chain management, providing valuable insights for practitioners and policy makers aiming to optimize SFSCs for environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

It becomes easier for real-time data sharing, collaboration, and communication among supply chain participants.  However, the prevailing organizational culture has a considerable impact on how effective IT integration exists, as it can either help or hinder the adoption and exploitation of IT integration. The relationship between SCP, organizational culture, and IT integration is examined in this study. Measurement model assurance and research hypothesis examination are accomplished through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM). 90 manufacturing firms are surveyed for this research online. This analysis employs regression analysis and an ANOVA test that confirms the significant correlation between IT integration, organizational culture, and SCP. The results and findings show that supply chain performance and IT integration are positively correlated, highlighting the fact that the impact of IT integration is increased by an encouraging organizational culture that values adaptability, teamwork, and continuous learning. (β=0.50,0.45,0.35,and 0.30,p&lt;0.001) provide strong evidence in favor of hypotheses 1–4. The study finds that SCP is greatly improved by successful IT integration, but the effectiveness of the integration is heavily dependent on an organizational culture that encourages flexibility and teamwork.</jats:p>"

This study proposes evaluation indexes for emergency supply schemes from the perspectives of profit and customer satisfaction. The study analyzes the characteristics of different customers and introduces reduction coefficients to constraint demand. Considering the hydraulic operation constraints of each pipeline, equipment, and nodes in the pipeline network, as well as the tiered pricing constraints of each customer, a multi-objective emergency supply scheme optimization model under extreme conditions is established. The spatial branch and bound algorithm in the Gurobi solver is employed to solve the established Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) model. The min-max method makes a trade-off among the Pareto solution sets to obtain the optimal supply scheme. Taking a large-scale loop-topology pipeline network in a province of China as a case study, the conflicting relationship between profits and customer satisfaction is analyzed under extreme conditions of source supply shortage and customer demand surge. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively balance profits and customer satisfaction. The solution time under different conditions does not exceed 1 second. Compared with the SPS simulation software, the relative error of the node pressure does not exceed 3%, demonstrating high solution efficiency and feasibility. The method developed in this study can provide decision support for network operators to formulate gas supply schemes reasonably under extreme conditions, offering strong guiding significance.</jats:p>",

This research examines an integrated, multi-echelon supply chain for perishable agricultural goods. The supply chain consists of four stages: supply, processing, storage, and customers. This study investigates the quality-related costs associated with product perishability to maximize supply chain profitability. Key factors considered include the network design, location of processing and distribution centers, the ability to process raw products to minimize post-harvest quality degradation, the option to sell the excess produce to a secondary market due to unpredictable yields, and the decision not to fulfill demand from distant customers where significant quality loss and price drops would be involved, instead diverting those products to the aforementioned secondary market. Quantitative methods and linear mathematical programming are employed to model and validate the proposed supply chain using actual data from a real-world case study on vegetable supply chains. The main contribution of this research is the incorporation of quality costs into the objective function, which allows the supply chain to prioritize meeting nearby customers’ demands with minimal quality loss over serving distant customers where high quality loss is unavoidable. Additionally, deploying a faster transportation fleet can significantly improve the overall profitability of the perishable product supply chain.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper constructs a network platform supply chain model consisting of a manufacturer and a platform, considering that the manufacturer invests in green technology to produce products, and the network platform uses consumers' online shopping data to carry out digital intelligence-driven marketing activities. The marketing strategy of the manufacturer and the platform co-marketing green products is studied, and the problem of the manufacturer using the cost-sharing contract to cooperate with the network platform to carry out digital intelligence-driven marketing of green products is considered. The study found that: 1) Optimizing green investment and digital-driven marketing costs, as well as enhancing consumers' sensitivity to green products and digital-driven marketing, are conducive to improving the profitability of network platform supply chain members and the green level of products; 2) Under the agency sales strategy, the commission rate charged by the network platform is the main factor affecting the sales strategy choices of manufacturers and platforms. There is a commission rate threshold that allows manufacturers and platforms to obtain more profits compared to the resale strategy; 3) Under the agency sales and resale strategies, manufacturers can use cost-sharing contracts to effectively incentivize network platforms to sell green products, and there is a cost-sharing threshold that allows manufacturers and network platforms to have the opportunity to obtain Pareto-improved profits. Network platforms charging less commissions and manufacturers sharing larger marketing costs are conducive to achieving a win-win situation in economic and ecological benefits.</jats:p>"

Various use cases where blockchain has brought various stakeholders in a large supply chain on a common platform and has ensured transparency and established a trustless environment among them have been studied and implemented by multiple organizations. This is facilitated by having a shared distributed, immutable ledger which facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking the assets as they move in a business network. In this project, we propose the application of Blockchain technology on the transactions between the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Various aircraft components move from IAF to HAL for repair and maintenance purposes and change hands as they move along the various departments involved in servicing and repairing those components. The proposed architecture of Blockchain based transactions between IAF and HAL would bring transparency, and better security and establish a trustless environment among all the stakeholders involved, and would also empower the stakeholders to optimize their working capabilities thereby saving the time for which an aircraft is on the ground owing to want of an unserviceable component.</jats:p>"

BOS focuses on creating uncontested market spaces by making competition irrelevant through innovation, a strategy that can be particularly beneficial for African firms facing infrastructure, technology, and logistical challenges. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to explore how BOS can improve the growth and competitive positioning of African firms by improving their supply chain practices.A systematic literature review, guided by the PRISMA framework, was employed to gather and analyze relevant literature published between 2018 and 2023. The review included a comprehensive search of databases, rigorous screening for eligibility, and thematic analysis to identify key themes related to the integration of BOS in supply chain management for African firms. The findings reveal that integrating BOS into supply chain management enables African firms to address operational challenges, improve competitive positioning, and promote sustainable growth. The strategic alignment of BOS principles with supply chain practices encourages innovation, operational efficiency, and the creation of new market spaces. Key themes identified include collaboration, competitive advantage, supply chain resilience, and sustainable practices. The study concludes that BOS integration into supply chain management can significantly improve the operational efficiency and competitive advantage of African firms. This approach not only addresses the unique challenges faced by these firms but also opens new avenues for market growth and sustainability. The insights gained from this review provide valuable guidance for both academics and practitioners aiming to optimize supply chain operations and achieve sustainable development in the African context.</jats:p>",

This literature review integrated both the peer-reviewed academic literature and public sector grey literature. Using the critical incident technique, the authors then conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) who had previously been tasked with flood response operations. Participants were asked about the tasks required while conducting flood response operations. Interview transcripts were then content analysed to identify themes regarding those tasks, and the competencies needed to perform those tasks were then extracted and contrasted with the literature review findings.

In particular, the subtle challenges in competency crossover from military operations to flood response operations may facilitate not only more efficient, targeted training (that could improve the effectiveness of army personnel involved in humanitarian roles), but could be applied to the selection of army personnel as well. This study may also help provincial/municipal operators and emergency planners by better communicating the strengths and limitations of army personnel in addressing civilian military cooperation for humanitarian operations. Thus, the findings of this research study represent an important first step in prompting attention to the strategic human resource planning studies required to make all responders more efficient and effective in their respective division of labour within the humanitarian domain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Peering a little beyond these research findings, human-induced climate change is expected to continue increasing the frequency of such events (IPCC, 2021), and a timely, national force is likely to be increasingly required for Canadians impacted by major disasters stemming from natural hazards when local resources become overwhelmed. Yet, there is some concern from the CAF that increasing responsiveness to disaster operations will affect their military readiness (Leuprecht and Kasurak, 2020). One can indeed envision a paradox whereby the CAF is both a “force of last resort” while increasingly becoming a “first choice for domestic disaster and emergency assistance”. The practical implications from this research also suggest that military personnel, while fully capable of successfully conducting flood response operations, may become overburdened and less able to adopt yet greater capacity and training for other additional humanitarian work. Nevertheless, the competencies highlighted by participants can help inform the next flood response operation in Canada.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Most literature in the field of emergency response focuses on cooperation between civilian and military resources and other strategic-level themes. The findings address critical granularity missing at the operational and tactical levels of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief research.

The potential of smart technologies like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) to contribute to security of supply has prompted the need to quantify their impact. We hypothesize that the F-Factor methodology can effectively quantify V2G’s security of supply contribution. Applying F-Factor analysis to V2G through optimization modeling and sensitivity studies, we find that key parameters like V2G charger ratings, EV battery capacities, and load profile peakiness significantly influence the results. We conclude that the F-Factor provides a valuable tool for assessing V2G’s potential to enhance security of supply, with implications for more efficient grid planning in the context of transport electrification.</jats:p>"

However, acknowledging the transformative power of AI in SCM, we must also acknowledge the hurdles in its implementation. This paper underscores the significant challenges that organizations may face while integrating AI into their SCM processes, ranging from data quality issues and concerns regarding privacy and security to the need for domain-specific human expertise. To address these hurdles effectively, the paper proposes a comprehensive framework. This framework encompasses a holistic strategy that aligns AI initiatives with organizational goals, governance, and ethics considerations to ensure responsible AI deployment, and a clear roadmap that guides the implementation journey from inception to full integration. In conclusion, this paper offers valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges that AI-powered SCM presents in the ever-evolving business landscape. By providing practical recommendations, it equips organizations with the knowledge and tools needed to successfully harness the potential of AI in their supply chain operations, ultimately paving the way for enhanced competitiveness and sustainability in the future.\n \nReceived: 29 September 2023 | Revised: 17 April 2024 | Accepted: 23 July 2024\n \nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nShankha Shubhra Goswami: Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>When water and sediment supply to a river change, the short‐term channel response will be a combination of adjustments in bed grain size (texture) and the accumulation or evacuation of sediment in the channel (topography). This response is well documented for gravel bed rivers, but little attention has been given to sand bed rivers, the focus of this paper. If the channel response is predominantly textural, subsequent changes in channel geometry may be minor. If the channel response is predominately aggradation or degradation, long‐term changes in channel dimension, planform, and slope may occur. Here, we use a mixed‐size morphodynamic model to explore the interaction between the textural and topographic responses to an increase in sediment supply in sand bed rivers. First, we consider how the steady‐state transport condition varies as a function of sediment supply rate and grain size. We then evaluate the path to steady‐state using numerical morphodynamic experiments. We find that bed aggradation in response to an increase in sediment supply can be <jats:italic>reduced</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>eliminated</jats:italic>, or even <jats:italic>reversed</jats:italic> depending on the sediment supply grain size. The path to the new steady‐state condition involves two adjustment phases: the first is textural‐dominated, and the second is topography‐dominated. Under the common condition of an increased supply of finer sediment, rapid textural adjustments can produce a transport capacity that is a large fraction of the new supply rate long before the system has reached complete equilibrium. Under conditions of supply coarsening, the initial textural adjustment is less dominant, and aggradation is immediate.</jats:p>",

To meet customer needs, every company needs to maintain the effectiveness of its supply chain so that products can be distributed to customers in a timely manner. For multinational company, lead time of releasing imported goods from the port to the warehouse tends to go up. This phenomenon is also the reason why improving the lead time of the import process is very important because it will affect the performance of its supply chain. The aim of this study is to reduce lead time of import process. The method used to reduce lead time in the import process is value stream mapping (VSM) by making current state mapping, identifying non-value added activities, designing future state mapping and conducting focus group discussions with business process owners and experts to validate future state mapping with the improvement goal in reducing lead-time can be implemented properly and the supply chain performance becomes effective and efficient\n\n\nKeywords: Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Reduce Lead-Time, Supply Chain, Import Process.</jats:p>",

Wine supply chains represent a strategic asset for the world economy and an ideal setting for the implementation of LSS, I4.0 and CE, but studies that integrate these three approaches to improve wine supply chain processes are lacking. The present research intends to demonstrate how wine supply chain processes (SCPs) can be improved by deploying the synergies between LSS, I4.0 and CE, so as to face the quality, efficiency and sustainability challenges modern competition poses to wine companies. To this aim, this study proposes an original methodology that adopts a step-by-step procedure inspired by the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) cycle to systematically improve SCPs throughout the different phases of wine supply chains (i.e., vineyard, cellar, distribution). The methodology has been conceptualized starting from three sources - review of scientific literature, interviews with experts and personal contribution – and assembles in an original way some concepts and tools referring to different bodies of literature such as strategic decision making, data-driven process improvement, lean management, industry 4.0 and circular economy. The methodology has been tested in a real case to evaluate its utility for practice and relevance.</jats:p>"

The important effects of IoT on manufacturing are examined in this research, with a focus on how it might increase output, decrease downtime, and facilitate customisation. Furthermore, the impact of IoT on supply chain management is analysed, emphasising its potential to boost sustainability efforts, streamline logistics, and promote transparency. This study's approach includes secondary data analysis from industry publications, reputable academic sources, and peer-reviewed journals as well as a systematic literature review (SLR). The research focused on the effects of Industry 4.0 and IoT on supply chain management and manufacturing by methodically choosing and evaluating relevant material. Using search phrases like \"Industry 4.0,\" \"IoT,\" \"smart factories,\" \"supply chain management,\" and \"digitisation,\" data was collected from academic databases including IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The study consolidates the body of knowledge, focussing on theoretical frameworks and real-world applications in a range of sectors. However, there are obstacles in the way of these technologies' broad adoption. Significant obstacles include the requirement for specialised skills, high initial investment costs, and cybersecurity threats, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The long-term advantages of Industry 4.0 and IoT, such as improved flexibility, sustainability, and responsiveness, outweigh these challenges. The study's conclusions highlight the technologies' revolutionary potential while pointing out the scientific and financial obstacles that still need to be solved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the transformative role of Machine Learning (ML) in Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), emphasizing its ability to enhance risk prediction and mitigation through real-time, data-driven insights. It demonstrates how ML applications like demand forecasting, inventory optimization, supplier risk assessment, and fraud detection improve supply chain resilience by analyzing large datasets to identify patterns, predict risks, and recommend proactive actions. However, the article also highlights key challenges, including data quality, availability, and privacy issues, which limit the effectiveness of ML models. Integrating ML with legacy systems poses additional technical and financial difficulties, particularly for smaller businesses. High implementation costs and scalability constraints further hinder widespread adoption. Ethical concerns, such as data bias and privacy, still need to be explored, raising questions about responsible ML use in supply chains. Future research should address these gaps by improving data governance frameworks for accuracy and privacy, developing scalable ML models suited to various supply chain environments, and exploring synergies with technologies like blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). These advancements will help realize ML’s full potential, fostering more agile, transparent, and resilient supply chains capable of navigating complex global risks. By tackling these challenges, ML can shift SCRM from reactive to proactive, ensuring long-term operational continuity and a competitive edge in the evolving global market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An strategy that has evolved as a transformational way for improving operational efficiency in supply chain management (SCM) is known as Lean Six Sigma. This approach is a combination of the ideas of Lean Manufacturing with the methodology of Six Sigma. The influence of Lean Six Sigma on supply chain management is investigated in this abstract via an analysis of its fundamental concepts, advantages, and problems, as well as implementation options.\r\nLean concepts are centred on the reduction of waste and the enhancement of value via the streamlining of operations, while Six Sigma is geared towards the reduction of variability and defects through the use of data-driven approaches. Through the integration of various methodologies, the Lean Six Sigma methodology offers a complete framework for enhancing the performance of supply chain operations. Continuous improvement, ensuring that customers are satisfied, and making effective use of available resources are all emphasised by the process.\r\nThe use of Lean Six Sigma in supply chain management has the potential to considerably improve operational efficiency by optimising processes, enhancing quality, and lowering costs. Through the use of Lean principles, organisations are able to effectively identify and remove operations that do not add value, simplify workflows, and improve the overall efficiency of their processes. In order to address and remove errors and variability in supply chain operations, Six Sigma methods such as DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control) are used. This ultimately results in goods and services that are of a better quality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research background: Green logistics has become a focal point of interest for researchers and practitioners across diverse sectors, including operations, logistics, and supply chain management, over the past two decades. As global sustainability pressures intensify, the significance of green logistics continues to rise, driving a surge in empirical studies aimed at uncovering its far-reaching organizational impacts.\nPurpose of the article: This empirical study seeks to bridge a gap in the literature by consolidating key organizational elements that have not been collectively explored. At the core of this research is an original conceptual framework, meticulously developed and validated through a comprehensive empirical survey. The framework captures nine distinct factors, grouped into three critical dimensions: (a) drivers of green logistics practices, (b) the implementation of green logistics practices, and (c) firm performance as measured by the outcomes of these practices. Notably, four factors — customer pressure, economic pressure, environmental regulatory pressure, and government support — act as independent variables, while green logistics practices serve as both an independent and dependent factor. The dependent variables span four key aspects of firm performance: operational performance, financial performance, market performance, and social reputation. More explicitly, the aim of this study is to explore the key drivers and outcomes of green logistics practices, focusing on how factors like regulatory pressures and customer demands influence their adoption, and how these practices impact different measures of firm performance.\nMethods: The conceptual framework introduced in this study, organized across three dimensions, represents a novel approach that has been scarcely explored in the existing literature. To evaluate this framework, a newly developed, structured questionnaire was distributed to a carefully selected sample of Greek manufacturing companies. Respondents, including supply chain managers, operations managers, and chief executive officers, were chosen for their specialized knowledge and strategic insights. The empirical data were rigorously analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), a robust and well-established multivariate technique. This study is grounded in primary data, it is explanatory in nature as it examines cause-and-effect relationships, it is deductive as it tests (eight) research hypotheses, and quantitative through its statistical analysis of data gathered via a structured research instrument.\nFindings &amp; value added: This study contributes significant empirical insights into the implementation and impact of green logistics practices within supply chain management. Unlike previous studies, it consolidates critical organizational elements into a comprehensive framework that reveals the influence of regulatory, economic, and customer pressures on green logistics adoption. The empirical results demonstrate that environmental regulatory pressure is the strongest driver of green logistics, underscoring the importance of regulatory compliance in shaping sustainable practices. This finding is particularly relevant, as stricter environmental regulations are expected in the coming years, making it timely and impactful for both academics and practitioners. The research also highlights the tangible benefits of green logistics practices on operational, financial, and market performance, as well as social reputation. This multi-dimensional approach offers more depth into the current body of research, indicating how green logistics practices can align with broader sustainability goals, while also enhancing business competitiveness. The value added of this study lies in the integration of three sets of factors, proposing a framework that can be used by future empirical research and business executives in the future. Finally, this empirical research offers practical guidance for state policymakers that aim to promote the adoption of green logistics and maximise their positive impact for business and society. Its findings suggest that enhancing the regulatory framework and, at the same time, offering better access to government support can really enhance the adoption of green logistics.</jats:p>"

A large part of the drop in consumption is due to the reduction of household income, which is mainly caused by the labor supply loss during the pandemic. To present the mechanism of the impact of the pandemic on consumption, this study constructs a novel theoretical model. Two hypotheses about the pandemic’s impact on labor supply are proposed and empirically tested. Subsequently, a comparative static analysis is carried out to determine the numerical mechanism of the pandemic’s impact on household consumption. In addition, the model is also empirically tested and further modified for application, enabling the studies of both a realistic simulation and a policy simulation. This study finds that the labor supply of households has been affected during the pandemic, and there is a mediating effect channel through the regulation stringency. The epidemic severity and regulation policies have a negative impact on household consumption, in turn, will raise the saving rate of households. The income effect of the two on consumption accounts for 32% and 44% of the total effect respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaysia's reputation as a global leader in the halal industry has recently been called into question due to concerns over the integrity of halal food products. Muslim consumers are increasingly skeptical about the authenticity of halal certifications and the practices of manufacturers claiming to adhere to halal standards. This has led to a need for greater transparency and accountability in the halal food supply chain.The concept of halal extends beyond just the food itself to encompass the entire process of production, from handling and packaging to storage and delivery. Halal supply chains (HSCs) must comply with strict criteria to ensure the preservation of halal certification standards throughout the supply chain. However, the extent to which halal-certified food and beverage manufacturers in Malaysia are implementing these practices remains unclear. This paper aims to explore the adoption of halal supply chain practices from the perspective of halal-certified food and beverage manufacturers. The primary research question is: why do halal-certified manufacturers adopt HSC practices? Understanding the motivations behind HSC adoption is essential for enhancing consumer trust and ensuring the integrity of halal food products. The findings will provide valuable insights into the current state of the halal industry in Malaysia and offer recommendations for strengthening its position as a global leader in the halal market.</jats:p>"

The data collected concerned socio-economic characteristics, compost application methods, yields with and without compost.\r\nThe results characterize the views of 87 people in total. They are made up of 97.7% men and only 2.3% women. These respondents constitute 93.1% married, 4.6% single and 2.2% widows/widowers. The group variable has five levels. The addition of compost to the field on the fly with 4 effective, the micro dose in the field with 18 effectives, the addition on the broadcast to the garden with 6 effective, the use of any two of these methods with 31 effectives and the using any three of these methods with 28 as effective. The descriptive statistics show a physical difference between the yield of millet with the use of broadcast compost (319.5) in the field and in the gardens (295.5) and that of the use of compost by micro dose (1467.83). The result is also different between the yield of sorghum from the gardens with the broadcast method (88.5) and that of the same speculation from the fields (609.16) with the micro dose compost addition method. The results of the analysis show a significant difference between the yields of millet from the micro dose at the field level and those from spreading in the garden. Likewise, a significant difference is observed between the yield of millet in the garden from spreading and that which comes from spreading the combined micro dose in the same environment.</jats:p>"

This is relevant for the 2,066,175 inhabitants of the city of Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, since per capita consumption of fish is one of the highest in Brazil. Data collection was carried out from May, 2021 to March, 2022 and establishments were grouped into: Emporiums (Group 1), Supermarkets (Group 2) and Hypermarkets (Group 3). A total of 25 establishments from 14 chains were visited. In all, 1,019 different products were recorded, 346 from groups of continental species (20 groups of species) and 673 from groups of marine species (29 groups of species), with greater diversity in Group 2. Products with greater commercial value are found in Group 1, those with lower value in Group 2. Whole fish are offered, in chunks, sliced, balls, in paste form (pate, sachets, surimi), sausages/tambaqui (Colossomo macropomum) sausage, dried and salted, canned, in mixes and paella kits, etc. In the comparative analysis of the prices between the groups, there was no significant difference in prices among the groups of establishments for 11 of the 17 products analyzed, in which we can highlight three marine species: tuna (Thunnus thynnus) with 62 products, cod (Gadus macrocephalus; Gadus morhua) with 41 products, sea sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis) with 31 products; and one freshwater species, tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) with 41 products; allowing the consumer a wide choice between the types of establishments and the products available in order to meet their needs, preferences and provide convenience.</jats:p>"

Using survey data from 312 Chinese ASC companies, BP-DEMATEL-ISM and PLS-SEM methods were employed to conduct causal analysis and factor level evaluation. The results indicate that “diversification of agricultural products and supply chain (SC) networks,” “Agriculture 4.0 and digital transformation,” and “taking proactive climate action” are critical strategies to enhance ASCRes in the context of climate change. These findings can provide theoretical basis for farmers, ASC companies, and governments to cope with the impact of climate change, so as to build more robust ASC systems.</jats:p>"

One area that has great potential in the tourism industry is Rembang Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. However, this industry is also vulnerable to various risks, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and security issues. Therefore, this research aims to identify risks in the tourism industry supply chain in Rembang Regency and develop effective mitigation strategies. The research method used is decision matrix risk assessment (DMRA), which involves supply chain mapping, risk identification, risk assessment, risk response development, and risk response control. The results of identifying risks that need to be mitigated from travel agents to tourist activities include fluctuating products/services, incompatibility with tourist destinations, and failure in promotional programs. Meanwhile, stakeholder activities in the tourism industry include failure in formulating policies and promotional programs. Proposed mitigation measures include diversifying supply chains, improving communication between suppliers and the tourism industry, and developing flexible policies. Implementation of this strategy is expected to strengthen the tourism industry supply chain in Rembang Regency, improve the tourist experience, and support sustainable economic growth. Risk mitigation in the tourism industry also contributes to the performance of the tourism industry and the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by providing benefits to the environment, economy, and local communities.</jats:p>"

To ensure a right products and services are supplied in a right quantity to keep a firm running, SCM concepts are important into the tourism sector. On the other hand, organisational performance (OP) could be sensitive to the SC complexity factor. This research aims to examine a relationship among SCM strategies on OP in a context of the Jordan tourism industry with a focus on a moderating effect of supply chain complexity. A SCM practices reported by 261 Jordanian travel agencies include: customer relationship management (CR), information flow management (LI), and strategic supplier partnerships (SSP). In the study, the focus is placed on the coordination of SC complexity to ensure that maximum effectiveness is derived from SCM to support enhanced organisational performance. An R-squared of 0. 66 for OP reveals that SCM practices account for 66 percent of its variation. This demonstrates the extent to which the complexity of the SC enhances the global performance of the organisation. Managers should address issues of information management and learn to handle supply chain delays in a manner that is strategic. This emphasises the need of doing further studies in this field to comprehend the effects of these elements on organisational effectiveness.</jats:p>"

We study a setting in which customers seek service from workers and a platform facilitates such matches over the course of the day. The platform allocates time slots to workers using an allocation policy, and the workers are strategic agents (with respect to “when to work”) who maximize their expected utility that depends on their preferred times to work, the allocated slots, and the total availability time. The platform seeks to ensure that a sufficient number of workers is available to satisfy demand, whereas the workers aim to maximize their wage-driven utility. Methodology/results: We evaluate policies on two dimensions critical to any firm: the supply of workers across the day, and the effective wages of workers. We illustrate that several families of currently deployed policies have serious limitations. We find these limitations exist because the policies do not let workers fully express their preferences and/or cannot account for heterogeneity in such preferences. We propose a new allocation policy and establish strong performance guarantees with respect to both the workers’ supply and effective wages. The policy is simple and fully leverages the market information to reach better market outcomes. We supplement our theory with numerical experiments in the context of ride-hailing calibrated on various New York City data sets that illustrate performance across a range of markets. Managerial implications: We highlight a fundamental inefficiency of policies currently deployed that limit workers’ ability to express their preferences. By allowing workers to express their temporal preferences, and by judiciously prioritizing “full-time” workers over “part-time” workers, we can obtain a potentially significant Pareto improvement, maintaining (or even increasing) workers’ supply while increasing their effective wages. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0414 . </jats:p>",

The objective is to understand the impact of crucial factors on Proton's supply chain's performance, including information quality, information technology, information sharing, big data analytics capacity, supply chain integration, traceability, and agility. The study used a qualitative research methodology to examine Proton's supply chain dynamics, focussing on its strategic collaboration with Geely and the incorporation of new technology. Both primary and secondary data are utilized for analysis. The results demonstrate that Proton's focus on up-to-date information, sophisticated analysis, and robust supplier connections has greatly improved its ability to respond quickly and effectively to operational challenges and maintain its ability to recover from disruptions. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the significance of supply chain agility and integration in effectively responding to market fluctuations and reducing risks. The findings indicate that Proton must consistently engage in technology and supply chain innovation to retain its competitive advantage and successfully traverse the intricate nature of the global automobile market.

Designing strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery can help businesses to mitigate risks and disruptions. Among them, flexible strategies can effectively improve supply chain resilience. In the literature, several studies have considered different types of flexible strategies and investigated their impacts on supply chain resilience. However, a systematic literature review (SLR) paper on this topic can further help to understand the scientific progress, research gaps, and avenues for future research. Hence, this study aims to explore how the literature has contributed to the area of flexible strategies and the impact on supply chain resilience performance. To achieve our objective, we apply an SLR methodology to identify themes such as research areas and key findings, contexts and industry sectors, methodologies, and key strategies and performance indicators in the connection between flexible strategies and supply chain resilience. The findings show that many studies connect flexible strategies to supply chain resilience. However, research gaps exist in analysing relationships between flexible strategies and performance, conducting comparative studies, developing dynamic resilience plans, applying flexible strategies, conducting theoretically grounded empirical studies, and applying multiple analytical tools to develop decision-making models for supply chain resilience. Finally, this study suggests several future research opportunities to advance the research on the topic. The findings can be a benchmark for researchers who are interested in conducting research in the area of flexible strategies and supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

As such, there is a need to explore the influence of this latest technological innovation on industries with a focus on logistics providers; this research examines the impact of Industry 4.0 on logistics providers' supply chain management. Using qualitative analysis of secondary sources, this research identifies the key relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies to logistics providers while assessing their adoption and exploring their impact on supply chain performance. Through the series of examination of secondary sources, it was revealed that Industry 4.0 components such as IoT enable real-time tracking, reducing lead times and improving customer service. AI, on the other hand, helps optimize routing and scheduling while also enhancing efficiency. Nevertheless, the industry 4.0 implementation into the logistics provider supply chain is not without challenges; the challenges evidenced through the research include data security, interoperability, and workforce skills. This study recommends investments in technology and skills, data security measures, collaborative organizational structures, agility, change management, and benchmarking to navigate the transformative landscape of Industry 4.0 in logistics supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Stability analysis is a critical issue for HVPS, but it presents significant challenges due to their prominent high‐dimensional and nonlinear characteristics. This paper presents a large‐signal stability analysis scheme for HVPS of rolling stocks, enabling the assessment of system stability under sudden load changes. Based on the state‐space averaging method, a mathematical model for the large‐signal behavior of the system is established. Subsequently, the small‐signal stability parameter range of the system is determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. To further analyze the stability of the system during large‐signal disturbances, a nonlinear decoupling transformation approach is employed to decompose the original high‐order state equations into multiple lower‐order equations. For the decoupled lower‐order subsystems, their stability is analyzed using phase portrait, and the region of attraction (ROA) is determined using the inverse trajectory method. Based on the stability analysis results, the controller is enhanced to bring the points outside the ROA back within it, thereby mitigating the transient instability phenomenon of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using two case studies.</jats:p>"

An assessment of gas supply and demand reveals a potential shortfall in Peninsular and East Malaysia before 2026. This situation creates an opportunity to capitalize on associated gas and non-associated gas (NAG) to fulfill the demand, leveraging existing facilities that remain within their operational life. This will also enhance field recovery in late life and depleting fields before decommissioning. Gas Cap Blowdown (GCBD) involves a process of depressurizing the gas cap of an oil reservoir to produce the associated gas cap (AG) volumes, more often after the oil rim has been depleted of significant oil production. Notably, in Northeast Malaysia, the gas cap project has yet to be undertaken, as the predominant attention of future resource growth focuses on deepwater development. This underscores the strategic importance of optimizing gas resources and exploring new initiatives to address evolving energy demands in the region.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Gas portfolio development and master plan is currently a high priority effort by host government since several oil fields, reservoirs or fault blocks are nearing depletion. Therefore, it is imperative to have a standardized approach for developing the Gas Cap reservoirs.

Among the criteria are oil depletion, molecule tradeoffs, facilities age and its design limit, economic life and ultimately demand availability. Detailed study is required to determine the oil vs gas trade off evaluation on the timing of blowdown opportunities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water serves as a vehicle for the transmission of various diseases to man and animals, and have been associated with both acute and chronic health syndromes. This study was carried out to determine the bacteriological quality of borehole water supply in the Hostels of Rivers State University, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.  Borehole water samples were collected from six (6) hostels for each study period, and subjected to standard bacteriological Procedures. Results obtained indicated that the highest mean total heterotrophic bacterial count of 3.6±1.7 X 105cfu/ml was recorded in the Hostel C water sample, while the least mean bacterial count of 5.5±0.35 X 104cfu/ml was observed in FCMB Hostel. The total coliform count had the highest value (3.3±3.82 X 104cfu/ml) recorded in Hostel D and the lowest value of 2.0±0.14 X 103cfu/ml was obtained in the Hostel H water sample. The faecal coliform count recorded the highest value in FCMB Hostel (1.5±0.71X 103 cfu/ml) and lowest in Hostel H (8.5±4.95 X 103 cfu/ml). The staphylococcal count was highest in Hostel B (8±9.9 X 104 cfu/ml) and lowest in Hostel C (0.6±0.57 X 104cfu/ml). Six bacterial species were identified, which included Bacillus spp (100%), Staphylococcus spp (100%), Pseudomonas spp (83.3%), Klebsiella spp. (66.6%), Salmonella spp (16.6%) and Escherichia coli (16.6%). Data obtained showed that all the isolates were biofilm producers, albeit at varying percentages, as 52.9%, 55.5%, 60%, 30%, 33.3%, and 100% of Bacillus spp, Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, respectively were positive for biofilm formation. The hemolysis result indicated that 28.3%, 10%, and 61.7% of the isolates were alpha, beta and gamma hemolytic, respectively. The study indicated the presence of bacteria of public health importance, thereby, making the need for regular monitoring and treatment of these water sources very necessary to check bacterial proliferation and ensure continuous access to safe water in the hostels.</jats:p>"

Currently, there needs to be a global consensus on safe levels of microplastics in WHC, which will allow regulatory efforts and risk assessments to be carried out. Therefore, this study aims to characterize MP particles in WHC of the Lisbon water supply system (LWSS) and compare two approaches to quantify these particles (length and width of the particles, and the area equivalent diameter (AED) of the particles). The quantification of MP particles was made via micro-FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) on transmission mode after water filtration on 5 µm silicon filters. Thirty-eight WHC samples from the LWSS showed MPs up to 836 MPs/L, with an average value of 196 MPs/L. The most representative polymer was polyethylene (PE, 77.2%). The other eight polymers were also quantified. The length and width of MPs ranged between 84 µm and 41 µm, respectively. The AED of MPs ranged between 24 µm and 405 µm. The MP dimensions of both approaches can differ significantly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increasing prominence of food safety problems, consumers are paying more and more attention to the quality and safety of agricultural products. Information traceability of agricultural products supply chain is an important way to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural products. Blockchain technology provides a new solution for information traceability of agricultural products supply chain with its characteristics of decentralization, immutable and transparency. This paper reviews the basic principles of blockchain technology and its application in agricultural supply chain information traceability. By combing relevant literature, it is found that blockchain technology is widely used in the production, processing, logistics and other aspects of agricultural products, effectively improving the transparency and traceability of the supply chain. Finally, it is concluded that the information traceability of agricultural product supply chain under the blockchain improves the traceability, visibility and information security of the supply chain, and also promotes the cooperation and coordination among various entities in the supply chain. With the continuous development and improvement of blockchain technology, its application in agricultural product supply chain information traceability will be more extensive and in-depth, providing more solid technical support for the quality and safety of agricultural products.</jats:p>"

Sedimentation in the dam significantly reduces water storage capacity, exacerbating the water crisis. The research employs a combination of hydrological modeling, scenario analysis, and stakeholder consultations. Hydrological data were used to simulate the impacts of sedimentation on water storage capacity. Various management scenarios, such as river diversion and reforestation, were modeled to assess their effectiveness in reducing unmet water demand. Stakeholder consultations provided insights into local perceptions and implementation challenges. The results project an unmet water demand of 82 million cubic meters by 2060 in the baseline scenario. Implementing river diversion could reduce unmet demand by 16%, while reforestation offers a 7% reduction. Combining these measures could achieve a 21% reduction in unmet water demand. This underscores the critical importance of integrated approaches for holistic water resources management and the urgent need for effective action.\r\nThe study highlights the necessity of an integrated approach to mitigate unmet water demand, which is essential for sustainable water management. It also advocates for proactive collaboration among stakeholders to address environmental, economic, and social challenges, ensuring the long-term resilience of water resources in the region.</jats:p>"

Being the first grain crop in China, maize is important feed and raw materials for industrial uses, while soybean constitutes the major raw materials for animal protein feed. Hence, both are essential and strategic agricultural products related to people’s livelihood worldwide. This paper mainly analyzed the changes in production, consumption, trade and price of maize and soybean in China, and applied the CAMES model to predict the trends in maize and soybean production, consumption, trade and price in the next decade (2024-2033) based on certain hypotheses of economic and social conditions and agricultural production conditions. According to the study, supply and demand of maize in China will witness regional balance in the foreseeable future, when maize imports will constantly decrease and the maize self-sufficiency rate will exceed 97%. In the meantime, imported soybeans will still be the major source for domestic feed use, with Brazil and the United States as the major importers. Despite the high imports, the self-sufficiency rate of soybean in China will keep rising and soybean imports will decrease due to the decline in feed processing and the increase in domestic soybean production capacity. In addition, this study also introduced the domestic and international uncertainties facing the supply and demand of maize and soybean in China in the future.</jats:p>"

It focuses on identifying factors and barriers and recommended solutions to enhance resilience in these supply chains. The study employs a comprehensive approach, incorporating Delphi surveys, a literature review, and the STEEPED analysis. Experts from the satellite communications field participated in the Delphi survey, and the study scrutinised the impact of Delphi theses on various stages of supply chains. STEEPED analysis was used to identify factors enhancing the resilience of European supply chains in satellite communications. An analysis of their validity and uncertainty was also carried out. The research highlights the factors influencing supply chain resilience within satellite communications, emphasising the importance of coping with uncertainty, shocks, and disruptions. The study presents valuable recommendations to strengthen supply chain resilience amid infrastructural and geopolitical challenges. This research enriches insights into building resilience strategies for European supply chains operating within intricate and uncertain environments. By analysing the role of the Copernicus programme and Earth observation data, the paper contributes to the theoretical framework, providing essential knowledge for managing supply chains in a dynamic and complex environment. The study’s recommendations offer practical guidance for EU institutions overseeing the Copernicus programme and its users. By effectively leveraging Copernicus and Earth observation data, stakeholders can enhance their analysis methods. These insights enable practical actions to be taken, ensuring the continuity and stability of European supply chains amidst challenging global scenarios.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study provides a global comparative evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the twin issues of affordable housing and housing supply. Google Scholar, Science Direct, ResearchGate and Primo Search were used in conducting database searches for previous studies published within the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023). The framework of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was adopted in the systematic selection of 37 extant studies. Bibliometric, content and thematic analyses were conducted for the qualitative data analyses. Findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted various issues, viz: housing prices, demand and supply, socioeconomic gaps, housing construction activities, informal sector housing conditions, government housing policies, mortgage repayment defaults, multidimensional matters, increased digital nomads, and elderly housing supply. This study is unique in providing a systematic appraisal of extant studies to report the global implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on affordable housing and housing supply. Findings of the study are based on a systematic review of the literature. Indeed, the study offers a global perspective on the impact of the pandemic on the blighted affordable housing situation of different countries.

Although it has been proposed, and is often assumed, that captive breeding can reduce pressure on wild populations, there has been little scrutiny of the scale, viability, or impacts of captive breeding to prevent overexploitation among parrots, compared with similar approaches in other threatened taxa, such as pangolins or tigers. We reviewed the primary and gray literature to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate evidence concerning 5 criteria, established a priori, for commercial captive breeding of parrots as an effective supply‐side intervention. We focused on a sample of 16 threatened parrot species that are heavily traded or for which unsustainable trade has been a factor in the decline of wild populations, representing a range of taxonomic groups, life histories, and native regions. We identified multiple major gaps in knowledge of the extent to which these criteria are met, including a lack of quantitative data on breeding productivity under current commercial breeding practices, the scale and scope of commercial breeding practices in growing parrot markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, and the lack of financial viability of captive breeding under effective regulation to prevent laundering or use of wild‐sourced specimens as breeding stock. The capacity for captive breeding to displace demand for wild‐sourced parrots varied between species, and complex interactions between trade in different species and contexts sometimes made consequences of commercial production difficult to predict. Decision makers and regulatory authorities should approach commercial captive breeding of parrots with caution and take into account knowledge gaps and cross‐linkages between trade in different species to avoid unanticipated consequences from stimulating and facilitating unsustainable trade in wild‐sourced parrots.</jats:p>",

There was a temporary surge in staffing through emergency hires during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the permanence of these positions remains uncertain. Concurrently, public health degree conferrals have sharply increased, creating a mismatch between the growing number of graduates and the actual needs of health departments. This study analyzes the distribution of the potential public health labor supply within a 50- and 150-mile radius of health departments, revealing a significant regional imbalance. Most regions experience substantial differences in the concentration of public health graduates when accounting for population size, reflecting geographic disparities in workforce distribution. These findings underscore the necessity for structured partnerships between health departments and educational institutions and advocacy for adaptive policy changes to align educational outputs with labor market demands, essential for a resilient public health workforce.</jats:p>",

This study discusses the agro-food supply chain risk assessment for smoked skipjack tuna in Ambon. Related literature and expert interviews identify risk factors that arise along the supply chain. These risk factors are contained in internal risk, company external operational risk, and macro-level risk. This research aims to evaluate comprehensively the risk factors of the smoked skipjack agro-industry supply chain, which are a priority to be addressed. The decision-making framework uses the BWM (Best Worst Method) to determine each risk factor's relative weight, followed by a sensitivity analysis to determine how robust the outcome is. Experts pick the risk factor assessment, and then an optimization model is modelled to obtain the weight of each risk factor, which is calculated with the help of Lingo software. The findings show that three risk factors will be prioritized to be addressed out of the eleven risk factors assessed, namely \"Quality of the final product,\" \"Financial instability,\" and \"degradation of fish populations.\"  Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to see the overall robustness of the results achieved. The weight of the selected risk factor (\"final product quality (R1c)\") has its weight value changed from 0.1 to 0.9 with an increase of 0.1. These findings are expected to help smoked skipjack tuna agro-industry managers make decisions to reduce supply chain risks and better administration management to maintain the sustainability of their business processes.</jats:p>"

This research aims to evaluate water supply system governance policies as well as potential springs, constraints and problems related to the water needs of border communities. This research is a descriptive study using a qualitative approach. The qualitative approach looks at policies, institutions, conflicts, and problems faced, as well as looking at data on water sources, socio-economic challenges, culture, and local wisdom. The research location was in Belu Regency, on the Indonesia-Leste Timor border. Research informants were representatives of local government, academics and the community. The problems faced are the underdevelopment of piped networks due to budget constraints, low capacity and quality of human resources, and the absence of specific regulations governing the Drinking Water Supply System (SPAM). The study area has springs spread across 11 subdistricts, with raw water potential ranging from 0.5 to 250 liters per second. Most of these water sources are good for community consumption, but some have not been optimally utilized so that they cannot be fully utilized to meet the needs of the population. The results show that SPAM management policies can be implemented to a certain extent, but have not yet run optimally because they still require capacity building and competence of the apparatus and local communities and an increase in the role of local governments to help implement central government policies in relation to assistance tasks and as a tool for deconcentration of the central government. In conclusion, the potential of raw water sources has not been fully utilized due to the challenges of infrastructure development and the limited capacity of human resources and budgets. Without good management and institutional support, communities will continue to face problems related to access to clean water.</jats:p>"

To assist retailers who may be disadvantaged in the game, this study constructs a two-stage green supply chain game model, considering the bounded rationality of decision-makers and the substitution effect of non-green products, and analyzes the impacts of two operational strategies that retailers can adopt—price-cutting strategy and early replenishment strategy. The research reveals that retailers tend to lower prices in the second stage when price reductions stimulate consumer purchases, enhancing their profitability. However, strategic retailers may raise prices in the first stage to create room for discounts later, potentially harming consumer interests. Contrary to expectations, anticipating future demand does not always improve supply chain profitability in the early replenishment strategy, which mainly depends on the market environment. Early replenishment deprives retailers of negotiation leverage in the second stage, and bulk orders may lead manufacturers to over-invest in green innovation. Therefore, this strategy is effective only when green innovation costs are low, consumer environmental awareness is high, or price sensitivity is low.</jats:p>"

Con el objetivo plantear un escenario de discusión y generar una reflexión al lector con respecto los beneficios que ofrece la industria 4.0 y la planeación colaborativa, dentro de las cadenas de suministros, se desarrolló un análisis teórico de su aplicación.                                                    Este proyecto de investigación deja como resultado una metodología para abordar artículos científicos a partir de la construcción de macro mapas mentales, partiendo desde la lectura y análisis de los documentos hasta proponer integraciones de informaciones que aparentemente no tenían un grado de relación visible. De esta manera, consolidando una herramienta iterativa que se puede aplicar a cualquier contexto académico e investigativo y que a su vez fomenta la creatividad y actúa como una fuente de estructuración visual y de organización de ideas. Otro beneficio identificado, mediante esta metodología, es la aplicación de conocimientos que se habían adquirido en las fases tempranas de la carrera de ingeniería industrial y que no habían sido retomados nuevamente como un conjunto.   Para llevar a cabo este cometido, se tomaron como base de lectura artículos científicos orientados a ambas temáticas. Una vez procesados los textos, se utilizó la metodología del pensamiento sistémico aplicando el arte de conectar, obteniendo de esta manera dos mapas sistémicos cada uno con 207 y 235 nodos respectivamente, en los que se abordan los aspectos teóricos e implicaciones prácticas de los artículos en cuestión, complementados con comentarios que resumen/aportan a secciones específicas de los mapas. En un segundo paso, la aplicación de Critical Thinking, mediante el contraste de información, la interconexión, la ampliación de nodos y la unificación de saberes, se logró consolidar un tercer gran mapa de 440 nodos que condensa y desarrolla, de una mejor manera, lo suministrado en los anteriores mapas y a la vez es complementado con los conocimientos de los autores y otros textos existentes de la literatura.  Desde un punto de vista estructural, con este pensamiento se logró realizar las abstracciones de los elementos, de mayor relevancia, pertenecientes a los artículos, obteniendo una visión que da cuenta del funcionamiento global, características, factores determinantes y la inclusión de buenas prácticas en la industria 4.0 y la planeación colaborativa.   A partir de este pensamiento, se propone el siguiente texto (siendo el resultado definitivo que se puede llegar en términos de conciencia y criticidad) en el que se aterrizan las ideas, conceptos y opiniones de la industria 4.0 y la planeación colaborativa, donde se puede llevar a cabo una extrapolación bajo el marco común, hacia el ámbito empresarial colombiano.</jats:p>"

The dataset used in this study was constructed by integrating in vivo experimental data collected from open databases (the National Animal Nutrition Program) and articles (Journal of Dairy Science), which includes a total of 1,779 observations from 436 publications. In the development of the model, animal information and feed chemical components were used as candidate variables, and two types of machine learning algorithms, Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were employed. After testing, the following predictors were selected for predicting: 1) NPm: body weight (BW) and dry matter intake (DMI), 2) NPl: BW, DMI, days in milk (DIM), and dietary organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) contents, 3) RUP: DIM, DMI, dietary DM content, and CP fraction intake (B and C), and 4) MicN: DIM, DMI, DM, dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content, CP fraction intake (A, B, and C). The selected models were assessed using a cross-validation method with the following statistical metrics including the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP), residual analyses, and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). For the RUP and MicN models, they were compared with the NASEM (2021) model. In predicting NPm, both SVR and RFR algorithms demonstrated increased precision (R2 = 0.965 vs. 0.969) and accuracy (RMSEP = 9.7 vs. 9.2 g/d); however, during residual analysis, the RFR model showed a statistically significant slope bias (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the NPl prediction, the RFR algorithm showed slightly greater performance compared with SVR (R2 = 0.864 vs. 0.814 and RMSEP = 86.7 vs. 98.5 g/d). However, similar to the NPm prediction, the RFR model displayed a statistically significant slope bias (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the supply model, the RFR model exhibited the greatest precision and accuracy in predicting RUP (R2 = 0.60, RMSEP = 0.326 kg/d, and CCC = 0.71) without any biases. This model achieved a 2.37-fold increase in R2 and a decrease of 0.111 kg/d in RMSEP compared with the NASEM model. As for MicN prediction, the SVR model performed the best (R2 = 0.76, RMSEP = 42.4 g/d, and CCC = 0.86) without biases. This model attained a 19-times improvement in R2 and a reduction of 38.7 g/d in RMSEP when compared with the NASEM model. In conclusion, the models developed using machine learning algorithms can be helpful for accurately and precisely predicting protein requirements and supply based on animal information and the chemical composition of feed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon cap-and-trade has been introduced to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG). Carbon cap-and-trade is expected to incentivize reducing GHG emissions because it enables the receipt of refunds based on the gap between actual GHG emissions and the predetermined allowance. Moreover, GHG emissions, procurement costs and custom duties depend on the country, its economic conditions, the electric energy mix, and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). To reduce GHG emissions with an affordable cost in a global supply chain, it is important to select suppliers and factory locations considering these factors. Furthermore, since carbon price and GHG emission allowance could be changed, manufacturers should also be paid attention to cost fluctuations due to carbon cap-and-trade. This study develops a mathematical model for a global supply chain with a carbon cap-and-trade system, analyzes GHG emissions and costs under different carbon prices and GHG emission allowances. First, procurement cost and GHG emissions for each part are estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database, and a bill of materials (BOM), listing the estimated cost and GHG emissions for each procured country, is created. Second, a global supply chain with a carbon cap-and-trade is formulated using mathematical programming. Third, numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate a design example. Finally, the results are discussed and analyzed from the viewpoints of reducing costs, GHG emissions, cost-effectiveness, and switching suppliers. It is found cases that the carbon cap-and-trade system can be effective in constructing a global low-carbon supply chain considering customs duties and FTAs and that carbon price has a greater impact on the reduction of GHG emissions instead of GHG emissions allowance in the numerical experiments.\n \nReceived: 31 December 2023 | Revised: 06 July 2024 | Accepted: 26 August 2024 \n \nConflicts of Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement \nData available on request from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement \nMiyu Kotegawa: Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Data curation, Writing - review editing, Visualization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to explore the application of data-driven analytics and modelling, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and MATLAB, to develop circular supply chains that support net zero manufacturing. As industries face growing pressure to reduce their environmental impact, circular supply chains, which focus on resource reuse, waste reduction, and sustainable production, are becoming essential. By integrating CNN models for data analysis and optimization, this research enhances the ability to identify inefficiencies, forecast demand, and optimize resource flows, contributing to a reduction in carbon emissions. Key findings demonstrate that circular supply chain strategies, enhanced by CNN-driven analytics, significantly reduce carbon footprints in manufacturing processes. The application of CNN, executed in MATLAB, enables advanced pattern recognition for optimizing material reuse, predicting logistical demands, and improving lifecycle management. These data-driven insights result in lower emissions, cost savings, operational efficiencies, and enhanced supply chain resilience. The implications of these findings suggest a transformative impact on the manufacturing industry. By adopting CNN-based analytics powered through MATLAB for circular supply chains, companies can achieve net zero goals while improving competitiveness. This approach fosters a shift towards sustainable manufacturing by minimizing reliance on finite resources and reducing waste, aligning the industry with global sustainability objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The boiler manufacturing industry faces unique challenges in supply chain management due to complex product specifications, stringent regulatory requirements, and fluctuating demand patterns. This paper presents an innovative approach to optimizing supply chain management in boiler manufacturing through the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integration. Our study employs a multi-faceted methodology, combining machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and natural language processing to create an intelligent system that seamlessly connects customer- facing CRM data with backend ERP processes. This AI- driven approach enables real-time decision making, predictive demand forecasting, and adaptive inventory management specifically tailored to the boiler manufacturing sector. The research demonstrates significant improvements in key performance indicators across the boiler manufacturing supply chain, including reduced lead times for custom boiler orders, optimized inventory levels for critical components, enhanced supplier relationship management for specialized parts, and increased customer satisfaction through improved order tracking and delivery precision. A case study of a mid- sized boiler manufacturer that implemented this AI- enhanced integration is presented, showcasing a 20% reduction in operational costs and a 18% increase in on- time deliveries over a 12-month period. Furthermore, we address industry-specific challenges such as regulatory compliance tracking, energy efficiency optimization, and integration with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors for predictive maintenance. The findings of this study have significant implications for boiler manufacturing enterprises seeking to leverage AI and data integration to gain a competitive edge in supply chain management and meet the evolving demands of the energy sector.</jats:p>"

At present, there are few studies on the matching of supply and demand considering the actual living population of residential communities at the street level and the number of degrees provided by basic public education services. From the perspective of the matching of supply and demand of basic public education services in space, taking Zhengzhou as an example, this paper makes an in-depth analysis of the accessibility of primary and secondary schools in the main urban area of Zhengzhou by improving the two-step mobile search method, and further analyzes the spatial imbalance of supply and demand matching. The results show that most of the central areas in the main urban area belong to high demand and high supply areas, but they still cannot meet the needs of educational resources, and the matching degree of supply and demand of educational resources in primary and secondary schools is low. The periphery of the central area, namely the southwest of Erqi District, the north of Huiji District and the northeast of Jinshui District, belongs to the low-demand high-supply or low-demand medium-supply area, and the supply and demand matching degree is high. The competent authorities need to pay close attention to the development trend of the city and the change of the resident population, so as to adjust the layout of educational resources in time. Encourage and support the flow of high-quality educational resources to marginal areas, narrow the educational gap between regions, and steadily promote the goal of high-quality and balanced basic public education services.</jats:p>"

The increase in the scale of central networks is associated with high capital investments and long project implementation time, which creates inconvenience for consumers and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, unlike power supply, gasification issues, which are actively being resolved in all regions of the country, make it possible to connect new consumers of natural gas several times faster and cheaper, which is due to the high manufacturability and speed of construction of polyethylene gas pipelines of distribution networks, provided that gas pipelines pass in the region. In addition to lower capital and operating costs, the process of transporting energy resources through pipelines in the form of a primary source — gas — is characterized by significantly lower losses compared to water and electricity. At the same time, network gas in combination with trigeneration technologies and cryogenic hydrocarbon storage can be used not only as boiler fuel, but also as motor fuel, a source for generating electricity, heat and even cold with a replenished autonomous reserve. Thus, as an alternative solution to traditional power systems, it is proposed to use hybrid power systems — systems based on trigeneration plants with gas piston installations, turbine and screw machines, as well as cryogenic gas storage facilities that can provide the population with electricity, heat, cold and motor fuel. The article analyzed the state and development of the fuel and energy complex in Russia, conducted a study of the needs for heat, gas and electricity for an average compact settlement with small and medium-sized enterprises. Analysis and selection of equipment parameters for uninterrupted autonomous power supply of the economy was carried out.</jats:p>"

One of the important categories of factors that underly the problem in supply chain is the establishment of processing units that results in end – product distribution. This paper presents an optimal establishment of processing unit around production area for apple supply chain as a case study of India. This study proposed amalgamation of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and colored petri nets (CPN) to model the PPSC. The mathematical model was set up in regard with capacity of processing unit and transportation cost with continuation in partner selection using MILP approach. The simulation model directs the maximization of system performance by running in CPN environment. The values of the results are subjected to transportation cost and production area with estimate of 25% loss during post harvesting such as transportation and environmental variation. The results corresponding to the case study provided an optimal establishment of processing units. Further, the specific partner associated with the facility and transportation cost. Decision-makers can identify the set of partners from the set of facilities dependent upon the transportation cost for further supply of product using a threshold values. Thereby, the model can be used as a decision-making system for processing companies to result in efficient PPSC management. The developed model was tested and validated on case study to demonstrate our approach’s applicability.</jats:p>",

The paper analyzes the cause-and-effect relationship between accidents of water-carrying networks and the conditions of architectural heritage preservation using the example of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. The results of determining waterlogging zones and their factors by non-destructive monitoring methods on the territory of the Metropolitan Garden of the Upper Lavra are given. This area combines complex engineering and geological conditions and technogenic mastering, creating conditions for developing dangerous engineering and geological processes and emergency situations. In terms of danger, the garden’s territory belongs to unstable areas for preserving historical monuments of the UNESCO world heritage. The last accident on the water supply networks occurred in October 2022. It caused sinkholes on the surface, rising groundwater levels, significant destruction of an underground structure of historical importance – the Metropolitan Cellar. The research was carried out using the methods of electrotomography and natural electric field. The results of electrotomography were interpreted using two- and three-dimensional models. The existence of an anomalous dome (soils of low resistance), which is observed in the central part of the site, is probably the focus of waterlogging of the soil massif as a result of an accident on the heating network. The analysis of the adapted 3D model based on the results of non-destructive methods of monitoring the geological environment made it possible to indirectly establish the places of unsatisfactory technical condition of engineering networks (cold water supply), where a wetted section with low values of apparent resistance was recorded. Research has confirmed the presence of an inflow of man-made waters (leaks) from main water supply networks in the western part of all profiles as a constant source and factor of waterlogging of the array of soil bases of architectural monuments – Monastyrski walls, Kushnyka tower, etc. Based on the research results, the need to develop compensatory measures to strengthen part of the fortress walls was proposed, and a safe distance for moving networks from historical objects was substantiated to preserve them. \n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As electricity demand increases, especially in transportation, renewable sources such as solar energy become more important. The direct integration of solar energy in rail transportation mostly involves utilizing station roofs and track side spaces. This paper proposes a novel approach by proposing the integration of photovoltaic systems directly on the roofs of trains to generate clean electricity and reduce dependence on the main grid. Installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on train rooftops can reduce energy costs and emissions and develop a more sustainable and ecological rail transport system. This research focuses on the Milan Cadorna-Saronno railway line, examining the feasibility of installing PV panels onto train rooftops to generate power for the train’s internal consumption, including lighting and air conditioning. In addition, it is a solution to reduce the power absorbed by the train from the main supply. Simulations conducted using PVSOL software 2023 (R7) indicate that equipping a train roof with PV panels could supply up to almost 10% of the train’s auxiliary power needs, equating to over 600 MWh annually. Implementing the suggested system may also result in a decrease of more than 27 tons of CO2 emissions per year for one train. To optimize the performance of PV systems and maximize power output, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) as an evolutionary-based method is proposed alongside a DC/DC boost converter and its performance is compared with two other main maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods of perturb and observe (PO), and incremental conductance (INC). The accuracy of the suggested algorithm was confirmed utilizing MATLAB SIMULINK R2023b, and the results were compared with those of the PO and INC algorithms. The findings indicate that the GSA performs better in terms of accuracy, while the PO and INC algorithms demonstrate greater robustness and dynamic response.</jats:p>"

By comparing the equilibrium solution results, the main research results are as follows: (1) in the market structure where electricity producers and electricity retailers make decisions at the same time, electricity producers are more willing to invest in low-carbon technologies and increase carbon emission reduction. The electricity retailer also set the lowest electricity prices at this time, and electricity demand is the highest. (2) In the case of the Stackelberg game for electricity producers, the wholesale electricity price is the highest, and the electricity producers obtain the most profits. In the case of the Stackelberg game for electricity retailers, the electricity price is the highest, and the profit of the electricity retailer is the highest. (3) In the market structure dominated by electricity retailers, the electricity price is the highest, and the electricity producers reduce the investment in carbon emission reduction technology after observation; the carbon emission reduction intensity is the least, and the electricity demand is also the least. (4) With the increase of price competition coefficient, the intensity of carbon emission reduction, electricity demand, electricity producers, and electricity retailer profit increase. However, as the competition coefficient of carbon reduction technology increases, these equilibrium solutions decline. We verify the above conclusions using multi-agent simulation.</jats:p>",

Explanatory research design was used and a sample of 216 heads of logistics and procurement departments was used, for a total of 52 textile firms in Kenya. The findings showed that green procurement (β1=0.282, p&lt;0.05), reverse logistics (β2=0.287, p&lt;0.05) and outsourcing (β3=0.331, p&lt;0.05) had a positive and significant effect on organizational performance. Competitive edge enhances the relationship between green procurement (β=-0.069; p&lt;0.05), reverse logistics (β=-0.137; p&lt;0.05), outsourcing (β=-0.122; p&lt;0.05) and organizational performance. Boosting competitive edge makes the supply chain efforts more effective in improving firm performance. Organizations should leverage on competitive edge to enhance the impacts of green procurement, reverse logistics, and outsourcing on performance.</jats:p>"

In supply chain outcomes (SCO), an understanding of the effect promotes efficiency overall, improves coordination, and maximizes performance. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was initially applied to experimentally analyze data from a survey of 85 enterprises using a quantitative approach. The relationships between cultures such as OC, market culture (MC), clan culture (CC), Hierarchy culture (HC), Professional culture (PC), Adhocracy culture (AC), and supply chain outcomes are analyzed in this research. The findings are evaluated using the combination of a reliability and validity test, multiple regression analysis. The SEM approach is employed to investigate the intricate correlation that exists between these cultural aspects and SCO. A more detailed comprehension of these linkages is provided by the simulation technique, which enables a thorough investigation of the ways in which each cultural feature affects SCO. Positive correlations between the independent variables (OC, AC, MC, HC, PC, and CC) and the dependent variable (SCO) are predicted. The majority of these relationships exhibit statistically significant positive impacts(p &lt; 0.05), signifying noteworthy and substantial benefits for SCO. Furthermore, although OC, AC, MC, PC, and CC have substantial positive impacts, HC has a relevant but invisible effect. OC has a major influence on SCO, according to the study, with some cultural characteristics having a considerable impact on performance measures. Improved efficacy and efficiency in supply chain operations are fostered by a well-aligned culture.</jats:p>"

Performance metrics in this lateral collaborative structure are useful for tracking and measuring the achievement of more comprehensive business goals that are not found in only vertical or horizontal structures. This research aims to explore and propose the best model for collaborative performance system (CPS) in the fresh produce supply chain (FPSC) and success factors in CPS implementation, including CPS metrics and matching collaborative individual performance (CIP) and supply chain performance (SCP). Papers from the last seventeen years including journal papers, working papers and conferences were selected in three steps. From 175 articles found in the first step, 63 articles matched the topic. In the third step, 48 articles were selected as important topics of discussion focused on the field of fresh products, with three classifications of collaboration structures and identifying CIP and SCP metrics which were then analyzed. The results of this review provide good opportunity as reference material for further research, through a comprehensive analytical description complete with a conceptual model presented to complete the gaps in this field. Keywords: Collaborative Performance System, Lateral Model, Performance Metrics, Rural Farmers, Supply Chain.</jats:p>"

Given the critical importance of small reservoirs in flood management, water supply, and ecological balance, the effective monitoring of their structural integrity is crucial. This paper developed a fully convolutional semantic segmentation method for hidden danger images of small reservoirs using an encoding-decoding structure, utilizing a deep learning framework of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process and analyze high-resolution images captured by UAVs. The method incorporated data augmentation and adaptive learning techniques to improve model accuracy under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, the quantification data of hidden dangers (length, width, area, etc.) was obtained by converting the image pixels to the actual size. Results demonstrate significant improvements in detecting structural deficiencies, such as cracks and seepage areas, with increased precision and recall rates compared to conventional methods, and the HHSN-25 network (Hidden Hazard Segmentation Network with 25 layers)proposed in this paper outperforms other methods. The main evaluation indicator mIoU of HHSN-25 is higher than other methods, reaching 87.00%, and Unet is 85.50%, Unet++is 85.55%. The proposed model achieves reliable real-time performance, allowing for early warning and effective management of potential risks. This study contributes to the development of more efficient monitoring systems for small-scale reservoirs, enhancing their safety and operational sustainability.</jats:p>"

The primary goal of revascularization is to provide symptomatic relief and enhance left ventricular (LV) functions. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is proven to be more sensitive than the ejection fraction (EF), especially for subtle ischemic changes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement in LV GLS after revascularization of symptomatic stable coronary patients with single-vessel CTO, categorized according to their collateral supply grades. Sixty-nine patients with successful CTO-PCI were grouped, according to their collateral supply grades, as well-developed (WD) and poor collateral groups and followed-up for 3 months. Basal characteristics were similar for both groups, except for a lower EF (p = 0.04) and impaired GLS (p &lt; 0.0001) in the poor collateral group. At the end of 3 months follow-up, symptomatic relief was similar in both groups (p = 0.101). GLS improvement reached statistical significance only for the poor collateral, not for the WD group (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.054, respectively). The EF did not change significantly in both groups. Poorly collateralized CTO lesions may not only result in baseline LV dysfunction, but also appear to carry potential for recovery after revascularization. This may not be the case for WD collaterals.</jats:p>"

Employing a comprehensive methodology that combines literature review, documentary data analysis, and case studies, the research sheds light on the ethical dilemmas faced by stakeholders in the Nigerian supply chain. The findings reveal the vulnerabilities and disruptions caused by the war, affecting the ethical sourcing, distribution, and pricing of essential goods in the Nigerian market.The implications of these disruptions extend to the ethical considerations within the global supply chain and Nigeria's resilience in the face of external shocks. The paper discusses potential strategies to address ethical challenges, enhance supply chain resilience, and ensure the ethical and sustainable flow of food and energy resources in the aftermath of the Russo-Ukraine conflict. In conclusion, this research contributes to the understanding of the ethical dimensions of supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical events.

This method innovatively incorporates the density of road networks, population density, economic density, and post-disaster response capability as key indicators. It then utilizes the multi-attribute weighted intelligent gray target decision-making evaluation model to evaluate the synthetic effect. Based on the evaluation results, optimization recommendations for the site selection of emergency supply reserve warehouses are provided. To validate the credibility of the proposed method, a comparative analysis is then conducted using the EEM-TOPSIS and TOPSIS–Gray Correlation Degree methods, resulting in largely consistent evaluation results. The study demonstrates that the multi-attribute weighted intelligent gray target decision-making evaluation model accounts for both hitting-the-target and missing-the-target scenarios for effect values and vectors of objectives. This approach effectively addresses the limitation of traditional multi-attribute evaluation methods, which can only rank evaluation schemes without effectively distinguishing between superior and inferior ones. This method also proves to be more user-friendly compared to others.</jats:p>"

To reduce invasiveness, minimally invasive surgical options are being explored, such as the insertion of one or more drill channels. Due to the proximity to critical structures, a temperature sensor is incorporated into the medical drill for process parallel temperature monitoring to prevent thermal damage. The temperature data is sent to the analysis hardware via Bluetooth BLE. This requires a power supply for the electronics on the drill. There are a number of limitations to the design of such a power supply. For one, the drill is rotating. Therefore, the energy generation must be contactless. Secondly, the energy generation should not depend on the rotation of the drill, so that the temperature can be measured even without the drill rotating and the rotational speed of the drill is not limited. In this paper, we propose a solution for a contactless energy transmission system (ETS) based on inductive coupling. Considering the dimensional limitations of attaching the electronics to the drill shaft, a multilayer PCB coil with multiple contacts for different number of turns is developed. The electrical circuit is simulated and the best settings are identified. The power supply is validated according to the predefined requirements. In the future, the medical drill will be built with the newly developed ETS. Sterilization and wear tests are performed to confirm the suitability of the drill with integrated temperature sensor for the operating room.</jats:p>",

However, there are still unresolved problems between the storage and supply of hydrogen and the power demand during the operation of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In this study, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is taken as the research object, and a one-dimensional model is built according to the basic performance parameters so as to explore the operation law of the power performance demand of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, simulate the power demand in the actual operation process, summarize the influence of different parameters on the power economic performance of the vehicle, and put forward optimization strategies to improve the power, durability, and fuel economy of the vehicle.</jats:p>"

Pointing out this view, this paper explores the game theoretical approach (Stackelberg and Bertrand) for a two-echelon green supply chain where the duopolistic manufacturers produce two substitutable green products and sell their products through a common retailer. The demands for both green products are functions of the selling prices and green levels (GLs). The effects of power structures on optimal price and green level decisions and associated equilibrium decisions are examined in three scenarios. Firstly, trilateral competition manufacturer-led Stackelberg (MS); secondly, retailer-led Stackelberg (RS); and thirdly, vertical collaboration, and compares the optimal decisions analytically. Our investigations show that, in addition to increasing the product’s greening level, vertical collaboration creates a win–win situation for collaboration members, whereas the manufacturer outside the collaboration experiences a decline in profits. Additionally, we find that the overall profit from vertical collaboration is greater than the sum of the individual profits corresponding to two participants in the trilateral competition models (MS and RS). Further, a selection criterion is developed for retailer to select the most suitable manufacturer for vertical collaboration. Finally, a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis are performed to determine the impact of parameters.</jats:p>",

Secondly, the module temperatures and output voltages are used as main parameters to establish the health indexes of DC–DC and DC–AC modules, and then the health index of the multi-energy conversion equipment is further calculated. Thirdly, the new energy consumption index is defined, and a multi-objective optimization model for power dispatching of highway power supply systems is established with the goal of improving the health index of multi-energy conversion equipment and the new energy consumption index.

This paper analyzes the issue of supply chain carbon abatement under different power structures, as well as the effect of consumers’ low-carbon preference and carbon tax rate on the optimal decisions. This paper constructs five different models, namely ML-NO model, ML-CS model, RL-NO model, RL-CS model and VI model. The research finds that VI model is the most ideal model for promoting supply chain carbon abatement. The optimal abatement efforts, market demand, and total profits in the VI model are all the largest among the five models. Whether the supply chain leader is the manufacturer or the retailer, cost sharing contract can enhance optimal abatement efforts, market demand, and profits of both parties. In any model, the leader in Supply chain earns higher profits than the follower. When consumers’ low-carbon preference increases, the optimal abatement efforts, market demand, and profits of both parties will all increase, and the growth rate is gradually accelerating. For the manufacturer with high carbon emissions, when the carbon tax rate increases, the optimal abatement efforts first increase and then decrease. For the manufacturer with low carbon emissions, when the carbon tax rate increases, the optimal abatement efforts will also increase.</jats:p>"

Thus, exchange risk uncertainty and tax saving planning should be considered in the operational decisions of a multi-national supply chain. This paper constructs a Stackelberg game model with four composite modes to explore the risk-taking and hedging strategy of retailers with reference-dependent psychology. The results show that: (1) exchange rate risk is transmitted through all subjects under the cost-plus transfer pricing strategy, while it is transmitted only between headquarters and retailers under the resale-price transfer pricing strategy. (2) No matter which subject bears the exchange rate risk, the motivation is stronger under the resale-price transfer pricing strategy. (3) The effect of futures hedging exchange rate risk is influenced by retailer reference-dependent psychology. When the reference dependence coefficient is low, and the risk of positive exchange rate fluctuations is too high, the retailer chooses to hedge its exchange rate risk. At this time, the transfer pricing strategy should shift to cost-plus, and the exchange rate fluctuation range that each entity can afford is larger than before hedging.</jats:p>"

Bamboo is a valuable and sustainable resource with significant economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, the existing supply chain in Bukidnon faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited value addition, and a lack of market linkages. This study outlines key strategies and interventions to address these challenges and promote a vibrant bamboo industry. The methods involve a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the bamboo supply chain in Bukidnon, including a review of existing literature, consultations with industry experts, and case studies from successful bamboo industries in other provinces. The study recommends several strategies for strengthening the bamboo supply chain. First, enhancing bamboo production through sustainable cultivation practices, providing technical assistance to farmers, and adopting modern techniques are crucial. Second, promoting responsible harvesting practices and regrowth management through training programs can ensure the long-term sustainability of bamboo resources. Third, improving processing and value addition by investing in modern facilities and equipment can enhance competitiveness and quality. Lastly, establishing effective market linkages through trade fairs, networking events, and online marketplaces will connect producers with buyers, foster collaboration, and open up new market opportunities. The study concludes that a strengthened supply chain will contribute to economic growth, enhance the competitiveness of Bukidnon's bamboo industry, and generate higher economic returns. Moreover, establishing effective market linkages will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, leading to domestic and international market expansion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pork supply prediction is a challenging task of significant importance for pig producers and administrators, as it aids decision-making and maintains the pork supply–demand balance. Previous studies failed to consider impact factors like the month-age transfer principle of pigs, epidemic factors, and the simultaneous import and export volumes of pork, leading to the absence of a quantitative prediction model for pork supply. In this background, we proposed a novel quantitative prediction model of pork supply that incorporates pork production and pork import/export volumes. First, a prediction model for pork production that takes into account the month-age transfer principle of pigs and epidemic factors was presented, along with a recursive model of the pig-herd system. A novel method based on a modified self-organizing migrating algorithm (MSOMA) was proposed for calculating the quantity of monthly newly retained sows (NRS). Furthermore, the pork-production prediction model considered the epidemic factor as a random disturbance term (RDT), and a prediction method based on MSOMA and a back-propagation neural network (MSOMA-BPNN) was introduced to predict such disturbance terms. Second, the proposed MSOMA-BPNN was employed to predict pork import and export volumes. The pork supply was subsequently determined based on the predicted pork production, as well as the pork import and export volumes. The proposed pork supply prediction model was applied to forecast China’s pork supply from 2010 to 2023. The results validate the high effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model, providing valuable insights for decision makers. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising and effective tool for predicting the pork supply. To our knowledge, this is a novel tool for pork supply prediction, considering the pig-herd system and pork import and export volumes from a systemic perspective. These features allow for consideration of the scientific formulation of a pig production plan, the establishment of early warning mechanisms to deal with epidemic situations and emergencies, and the regulation of pork supply and demand balance.</jats:p>"

A range of strategic, tactical, and operational level decisions pertaining to the design and operation of sustainable supply chains have been studied in the extant literature. However, investigations into the adoption of multi-modal transportation as a strategic decision in the context of agri-food supply chains operating in constrained environments are limited. As such, in this study, the adoption of bi-modal transportation for the domestic vegetable supply chain in a developing country context under certain constraints was examined. A mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to determine the volume and direction of the product flow to achieve the minimum total food-miles and smallest emissions footprint. As a case study, a Sri Lankan mainstream vegetable supply chain was used to investigate the applicability of a combination of truck and railway modes to transport vegetables from farms to retailer locations via economic (consolidation) centers. The adoption of a bi-modal transportation structure demonstrated the potential to reduce food miles by 32%, transportation costs by 36%, contributions to global warming potential by 35%, and empty truck hauls by 38%, compared to a structure with truck-based, uni-modal transportation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Academia's current emphasis on supply chain performance highlights the significance of information sharing as a mediator and the supplier-buyer relationship as a moderator. Nevertheless, the examination into the intermediate effects of the supplier-buyer relationship has been relatively neglected. This research examined the factors affecting supply chain performance, emphasizing the mediating role of the supplier-buyer relationship to address the existing knowledge gap in the literature. The research included both descriptive and explanatory methodologies. The positivist research paradigm and stratified sampling method were employed to obtain a sample size of 167 respondents. The data were collected through a questionnaire and an analysis of relevant documents. The collected data was examined using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, facilitated by SmartPLS 4, a tool for conducting inferential statistical analysis. The analyzed data on respondents' profiles underwent descriptive statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26. The research findings indicate that supply chain performance is affected by information sharing, strategic procurement planning, and the relationship between suppliers and buyers. The statistical significance of strategic procurement planning and information sharing indicates that buyers and suppliers rely on these practices to improve supply chain performance. The results provide definitive evidence validating the accuracy of the proposed research model within the domain of decision-making, specifically regarding the prioritization of investments to improve supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

Using the United Kingdom (UK) medicine supply system as the research context, we explore how decision‐makers navigated the effects of an event with knowable implications (UK's European Union exit, 2016–2020) followed by an event with unknowable implications (COVID‐19 global pandemic, 2020–2021). We adopt a longitudinal case research design that incorporates causal loop diagramming, to understand the system's responses. We find that learning evolves as crisis events unfold, changing from surface (know‐what) to deep (know‐why and ‐how) and at the highest level, it is transcendent. Transcendent learning entails understanding system effects into the future (i.e., beyond the past and present) and in relation to other supply systems (i.e., beyond the UK system). Capabilities to absorb, avoid, and accelerate away from shocks are developed sequentially as learning changes. We contribute to prior research by developing a theory of system‐level strategic agility and the adaptation processes that underpin it. The latter hinge on dynamic resource (re)allocation and the continuous (re)configuration of processes, protocols, regulations, and structures.</jats:p>",

The principle of choosing a territorial section for analyzing the situation with a simultaneous increase in demand for fuel and energy resources is described. An algorithm for conducting research is given. Research is carried out by modeling the work of the country’s fuel and energy complex during the period of the average day of January in the conditions of a peak-increasing demand for thermal energy in the territories of federal districts. At the same time, the cooling is modeled in turn for each of the federal districts in the zone of operation of the Unified Gas Supply System of Russia. An analysis of the possibilities of meeting the demand for final types of energy in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation is carried out for all key scenarios of cooling and loss of efficiency of critical gas industry facilities. The principles of modeling the situation with the supply of final types of energy to consumers in these situations are shown. The most vulnerable regions under the analyzed conditions are identified. The conclusion is made about the need for a balanced approach to determining the optimal degree of dominance of natural gas in the fuel and energy balance of the regions, taking into account the existing opportunities for its supply in the conditions of large-scale emergencies in the gas industry.</jats:p>"

The four indices of blockchain are introduced, and the model from the resilience of the supply chain subject to the overall resilience is established. The interaction behavior between subjects is analyzed. The weight is determined by the AHP method, and the multi-agent model simulation is carried out using NetLogo(6.5) software. After the introduction of blockchain technology, even in the early stage of application, supply chain resilience has been significantly enhanced; especially in the decision-making stage, information transparency and efficiency have been significantly improved. When the technology is maturely applied, the toughness of each stage shows an accelerated growth trend, and the improvement in toughness in the assembly stage is particularly significant. By optimizing key influencing factors, the growth rate of resilience in the assembly stage is further improved, which verifies the positive impact of blockchain technology and main factor optimization on overall resilience. In summary, the introduction of blockchain technology and its mature application are crucial for improving the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain, providing an effective way to meet the challenges of VUCA.</jats:p>"

In Ukraine, which is experiencing challenges related to the need to modernize critical infrastructure, this task is of particular relevance. The Desnianska Water Supply Station (DVS), which supplies drinking water to a large part of Kyiv, needs a comprehensive renovation due to the deterioration of water quality at the water supply source and outdated treatment technologies. In this context, pilot studies are an important tool for optimizing and selecting effective technological solutions before their implementation on an industrial scale.\r\nThe article discusses the development of a pilot plant to improve the technology of water purification at the Desnianska water supply station in Kyiv. The main goal of the study is to increase the efficiency of the water purification process through the introduction of the latest technologies and methods. The paper describes 4 technological schemes of water purification and the principle of operation of the pilot plant, as well as the justification for the use of such technological schemes. Requirements for research include: working out technological schemes during all seasons of the year; laboratory control of water quality at all stages of purification and disinfection; preparation of interim and final reports; presentation of research results. After the research, a significant improvement in the quality of treated water and a reduction in operating costs are expected.

DEAs need to be capable of generating intricate high-voltage waveforms or simultaneously controlling multiple quadrants with distinct high-voltage levels. This paper proposes a high-voltage power supply for DEAs, featuring a four-quadrant high-voltage driving circuit. The circuit is capable of independently generating high-voltage signals ranging from 100 V to 6000 V and producing arbitrary waveforms with adjustable frequencies. The independent operation of the quadrants without crosstalk showcases the system’s integration and potential for cross-disciplinary applications.</jats:p>"

While research has made strides in connecting information technology (IT) and SCR, a gap remains in understanding how sustainability dimensions integrate into these aspects, particularly in socio‐economically and environmentally challenged countries. This study aims to address this gap by investigating how IT and SCR contribute to enhancing overall supply chain performance, with a specific focus on the role of social (SS), environmental (ENS), and economic (ECS) sustainability dimensions. To achieve this, we formulated hypotheses that were tested using structural equation modeling, based on data from a sample of 321 apparel enterprises in Bangladesh. The findings reveal that IT significantly enhances resilience, while SCR does not directly improve supply chain performance when sustainability dimensions are considered. However, SCR positively influences all dimensions of sustainability, underscoring the importance of the combined strength of IT and SCR for achieving enduring sustainability in an uncertain world. Moreover, the results show that the triad of sustainability (SS, ENS, and ECS) fully mediates the relationship between resilience and supply chain performance, serving as the linchpin that binds and strengthens these elements. This research advances the understanding of the interplay between IT, resilience, and sustainability, providing valuable guidance for policymakers and sustainability professionals. Moreover, by integrating sustainability into IT and resilience strategies, organizations can enhance their supply chain performance and ensure long‐term success.</jats:p>",

The purpose of using a ducted propeller is to increase thrust, increase propeller efficiency, and encourage better ship movement. This is suitable for Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) vessels operating on offshore platforms to support oil drilling activities. In designing a kort nozzle, one of the most important components is the tip clearance, the distance between the edge of the propeller and the inner nozzle. The diameter of the kort nozzle can affect the thrust efficiency of the propeller. Due to the blade momentum theory for ducted propellers, the volume of water passing through the propeller should be as large as possible, with the smallest possible flow velocity. In this study, numerical simulations using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method were carried out to determine the effect of tip clearance on thrust and torque on a ducted propeller with a MARIN foil 19A nozzle type and tip clearance of 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm. From all models, the highest thrust and torque values were obtained from the nozzle 19A tip clearance 10 mm model with thrust 367,413 kN and torque 315,338 kNm. The relationship between tip clearance and thrust is inversely proportional; the greater the tip clearance, the smaller the value of thrust, and the same is true with torque.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most technological machines (TM) use hydraulic drives and internal combustion engines, such as lifting and transporting, loading and unloading, construction, road, track, and mining. Increasing the durability of the specified TM units is an urgent task. One of the possible solutions to this urgent problem is the electrostatic treatment of hydraulic oils and diesel fuels.\nOver the past three decades, researchers have conducted many studies focused on finding optimal means of using external force fields to improve the quality of lubricating materials and intensify their production. Types of influence of force fields, such as mechanical, mechanochemical, acoustic, electromagnetic, and electric, are increasingly used to regulate the behaviour of dispersed particles in nonpolar and slightly polar environments.\nThe theory of regulated interphase transitions proves that the emergence, growth, and size change of supramolecular structures, surrounded by an adsorption-solvate layer and creating complex structural units in oil dispersion systems, contribute to the emergence of new properties of these systems. One of the main provisions of this theory is the need for extreme and antibating changes in the size of complex structural units with the help of external influences, which include force fields.\nLubricating materials differ in their degrees of dispersity, composition, and properties, so the effect of force fields on them is diverse. The ability to regulate intermolecular interactions and the size of complex structural units are significant in the operation of lubricants. Electric fields make it possible to control phase interactions in these dispersed systems: they increase the constant dipole moments of particles and the electrosurface forces, which contribute to the deformation of the electric double layer. Under the action of strong electric fields, structural changes occur in hydrocarbon dispersion systems, which significantly change the physicochemical properties of lubricating materials. Thus, the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant and its resistance to deformation may change depending on the chemical nature of the system.\nPreviously conducted experimental studies allow us to formulate the requirements for the stand in detail, which enables investigation of the properties of petroleum-based liquids. Thus, it is possible to achieve increased anti-wear properties of petroleum-based liquids when the liquid passes through the gap between the electrodes in an electrostatic field. The voltage between the electrodes should be U = 1000–1500 V, and the speed of the liquid movement in the space between the electrodes should be V = 4.5–6.5 m/s. The power supply unit of the stand for electroprocessing petroleum-based liquids, proposed in this paper, meets these requirements.\nThe article proposes a fundamentally new scheme for the power supply unit of the laboratory stand for direct current electrotreatment of petroleum-based liquids. The power supply unit is a bipolar source of adjustable direct current. It provides smooth regulation of the voltage from 0 to 3000 V and step regulation of the output current. The block has double protection against short circuits at the output and input.\nKeywords: anti-wear property, oil, influence of an electrostatic field on the anti-wear properties of oil, device for electrostatic treatment of oil.</jats:p>",

While some research focuses on the effects of IFRS modifications on accounting quality, limited attention has been given to the broader implications of IFRS enforcement strategies. This study fills that gap by examining the influence of various IFRS adoption strategies on accounting quality and exploring the role of Fraud control as a mediator in this relationship. Using a two-step system GMM estimator and data from 35 countries spanning 2019 to 2023, the research reveals significant correlations between different IFRS adoption strategies and accounting quality. Specifically, both enforcement and modification strategies show positive associations with accounting quality, particularly in terms of timely loss recognition. Moreover, the study demonstrates that Fraud control acts as a mediator between IFRS adoption strategies and accounting quality. This suggests that the effectiveness of IFRS implementation and modification strategies in enhancing accounting quality is contingent upon the level of Fraud control. Notably, improvements in accounting quality are more pronounced when Fraud is effectively managed alongside IFRS implementation efforts. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of considering diverse IFRS adoption strategies and the role of Fraud control in enhancing accounting quality. By shedding light on these dynamics, the study contributes valuable insights to stakeholders and advances the understanding of accounting quality within the context of IFRS adoption.</jats:p>"

The stakeholder theory perspective was used in this study to examine supply chain risk in the automotive industry. A quantitative method was employed, resulting in 157 valid responses. The results reveal that demand risk had the most significant effect on auto dealer performance, followed by logistics/transportation, production, and supply risk. Notably, proactive resilience strategies were found to significantly impact the relationship between risk and performance. The findings underscore the importance of proactive measures in mitigating the performance impacts of supply chain risk. This study contributes a theoretical framework by identifying four major supply chain risks and seven proactive and 12 reactive strategies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Iron, an essential micronutrient, is involved in several physiological activities, including oxygen transport, cellular respiration, and DNA synthesis. Its homeostasis is strictly controlled to avoid overload and deficiency. Ferrous iron is taken up by intestinal enterocytes through the apical membrane with the help of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Iron can then be discharged into the bloodstream by ferroportin 1 (FPN1) or stored intracellularly in ferritin. Hepcidin, a hormone produced in the liver, binds to FPN1 and causes its internalization and degradation, a key factor in controlling systemic iron levels. Thus, hepcidin limits the absorption and release of iron by decreasing the iron outflow from enterocytes and macrophages. Iron-responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) system and hypoxia-inducible factor 2 (HIF-2) are important cellular regulators of iron homeostasis. The IRE/IRP system post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of iron-related proteins in response to iron availability. At the same time, HIF-2 promotes the expression of iron transporters and metabolic enzymes under hypoxic conditions. Iron-related disorders can result from disruptions in these regulatory mechanisms; for instance, mutations in the genes encoding hepcidin, FPN1, or hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) can cause iron overload disorders like hemochromatosis, while iron deficiency anemia is caused by impaired iron absorption due to genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies. A deeper understanding of these intricate mechanisms is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and treat iron-related disorders. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We consider an online retailer selling multiple products to different zones over a finite horizon with multiple periods. At the start of the horizon, the retailer orders the products from a single supplier and stores them at multiple warehouses. The retailer determines the products’ order quantities and their storage quantities at each warehouse subject to its capacity constraint. At the end of each period, after random demands in the period are realized, the retailer chooses the retrieval quantities from each warehouse to fulfill the demands of each zone. The objective is to maximize the retailer’s expected profit over the finite horizon. Methodology/results: For the single-zone case, we show that the multiperiod problem is equivalent to a single-period problem and the optimal retrieval decisions follow a greedy policy that retrieves products from the lowest-cost warehouse. We design a nongreedy algorithm to find the optimal storage policy, which preserves a nested property: Among all nonempty warehouses, a smaller-index warehouse contains all the products stored in a larger-index warehouse. We also analytically characterize the optimal ordering policy. The multizone case is unfortunately intractable analytically, and we propose an efficient heuristic to solve it, which involves a nontrivial hybrid of three approximations. This hybrid heuristic outperforms two conventional benchmarks by up to 22.5% and 3.5% in our numerical experiments with various horizon lengths, fulfillment frequencies, warehouse capacities, demand variations, and demand correlations. Managerial implications: A case study based on data from a major fashion online retailer in Asia confirms the superiority of the hybrid heuristic. With delicate optimization, the heuristic improves the average profit by up to 16% compared with a dedicated policy adopted by the retailer. The hybrid heuristic continues to outperform the benchmarks for larger networks with various structures. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: X.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to investigate the effects of raised floor height, floor opening rate, and cold/hot air channel closure on airflow organization. Furthermore, the efficiency of airflow organization was evaluated using entransy loss metrics. The results show that optimal airflow conditions are achieved when the height of the raised floor is 600–800 mm, the opening rate is 40%, and the combined opening is 40%. Additionally, the closure of either the cold channel or both the cold and hot channels significantly improves airflow performance. Specifically, cold channel closure is recommended for new data centers with underfloor air supply systems, while combined cold and hot channel closure is suitable for data centers with high power density and extended air supply distances.</jats:p>"

Methodology: The questionnaire was used as the main tool for the study. It contained a set of questions to measure the study variables. It was designed based on previous studies. This study was conducted on a sample of 288 individuals from the owners of companies in the Palestinian industrial sector, their managers and decision-makers. A number of hypotheses were formulated and examined using the structural equation model (Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using the statistical program SmartPls4.  Results: The study found a positive significant impact of e-procurement in its combined dimensions (e-design, e-sources, e-negotiation, and e-evaluation) on the agility of the supply chain. As for the results of the impact of the individual dimensions of e-procurement, the study found a positive significant impact for all dimensions except the dimension of e-negotiation on the agility of the supply chain. The study also found a positive significant impact for both e-procurement and supply chain agility on its performance.  Conclusion: E-procurement is an important tool in enhancing the agility of the supply chain in the industrial sector, and an important factor in improving the performance of this chain.</jats:p>"

It is referred to as a green logistics supply chain. To reduce the negative effects of logistical activities on the environment, sustainable transportation, eco-friendly packaging, and effective waste management techniques are used. Adopting environmentally conscious supply chain practices can improve a company's environmental reputation while lowering carbon emissions, increasing operational effectiveness, and saving money on human resource management. In order to adopt sustainable practices across every aspect of the value chain, from acquiring raw materials to delivering completed items to clients, this strategy necessitates coordination across stakeholders in the supply chain management and logistic process. In general, using a green logistic supply chain is a crucial approach for companies looking to grow sustainability while reducing their environmental impact. Using IoT in human resource management can boost operational effectiveness, cut down on transportation expenses, and boost customer satisfaction. For instance, current information on inventory levels, the quality of goods, and shipment status can be provided by smart sensors and devices, allowing businesses to optimize the way they manage their supply chains and reduce waste in human resource management.</jats:p>",

The primary objective is to qualitatively analyze the literature to understand how these innovative practices contribute to enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. The research employs a qualitative literature review methodology, synthesizing findings from academic articles, industry reports, case studies, and empirical studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field.\r\nThe literature review methodology involves systematically collecting and analyzing scholarly sources that discuss various aspects of precision agriculture, climate-smart farming, and sustainable supply chain management. The study categorizes the literature into key themes, such as the technological advancements in precision agriculture, the principles and practices of climate-smart farming, and the impact of sustainable supply chain management on agricultural productivity and sustainability. Thematic analysis is used to identify patterns and trends in how these practices interact to influence agricultural outcomes.\r\nThe findings indicate that precision agriculture, through the use of advanced technologies like GPS, IoT, and AI, enables farmers to optimize field-level management regarding crop farming. This leads to increased yield, reduced waste, and better resource utilization. Climate-smart farming practices, including crop diversification, improved irrigation techniques, and soil health management, are essential for adapting to climate change and mitigating its impacts on agriculture. Sustainable supply chain management ensures that agricultural products are produced, processed, and distributed in ways that minimize environmental impact and enhance economic viability.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to analyze the roles of women in the crab fishing supply chain. This study was conducted in June 2023 at Pagagan Village, Pademawu District, Pamekasan Regency. The research employed interview methods, field observation, and secondary data sources, including articles and journals. Six respondents participated in the study, representing fishermen’s wives, mini-plant owners, crab pickers, and crab suppliers. Results showed that fishermen’s wives play a significant role in marketing and selling the crab catch, as well as assisting their husbands in making and repairing fishing gear. In the case of crab suppliers, women or housewife contributed in weighing and boiling the crabs. At the mini-plant level, women play the main role as pickers in sorting and stripping process, while the mini-plant owner supervises the overall process. The study highlighted the substantial contribution of women in coastal areas to the local community, demonstrating a strong reliance on marine resources, which fluctuate with the seasons. Additionally, the income earned by coastal women significantly contributes to their families finances, thereby enhancing their household’s economic condition.</jats:p>",

The resource dependency theory suggests that a firm cannot develop green strategies in isolation, and a substantial involvement of all supply chain partners is needed for achieving larger impacts on environmental sustainability. However, the literature has yet to explore this link in detail. In this paper, we investigate the link between sustainability initiatives at a firm level and at the supply chain level in line with global green agenda. Data collected through a questionnaire survey of senior logistics and supply‐chain managers in UK companies were used to propose and statistically validate a framework combining both constructs and causal hypotheses. We further use a case of a farming company from Luxemburg to validate our research findings. Our results suggest a strong link in terms of green strategies between the firm level and supply chain level. We find that this link is mediated by the degree of involvement of supply chain partners. A case company participated in the study agreed to our research findings related to importance of technology and collaboration in food sector to share the resources among all supply chain players. We also find that green strategies result in improved business performance.</jats:p>",

While such technologies are poised to streamline supply chains for increased efficiency, the nexus between these technologies and environmental sustainability remains underexplored. This study applies the resource‐based view and network theories to assess the role of Industry 4.0 in fostering eco‐product innovation through supply chain integration. Data from 496 Indian manufacturing firms were analyzed using structural equation modeling to probe the relationships between Industry 4.0 adoption, supply chain integration, and eco‐product innovation capability. Results demonstrate that Industry 4.0 technologies have a positive direct effect on supply chain integration. However, when considering the capability for eco‐product innovation, the role of Industry 4.0 is contingent upon the degree of supply chain integration at upstream, internal, and downstream stages. The findings reveal that supply chain integration acts as a pivotal mediator in harnessing Industry 4.0 for eco‐product innovation. The direct influence of Industry 4.0 on eco‐innovation capability was found to be insignificant, underscoring the integrated approach to supply chain management as critical for environmental advancements. This work contributes a nuanced understanding of how manufacturers can strategically employ Industry 4.0 to bolster their environmental and competitive positioning, providing a comprehensive framework for enhancing eco‐product innovation capability.</jats:p>",

Food safety encompasses measures to prevent contamination, spoilage, and health hazards from farm to fork, utilizing technologies such as traceability systems. Food waste, which accounts for approximately one-third of global food production, results from inefficiencies and improper handling throughout the supply chain, with significant losses occurring in production, distribution, and consumption stages. Strategies to combat food waste include improving logistics infrastructure, better inventory management, and consumer education.

The rise in industrial production indicates economic progress, improved livelihoods, enhanced access to necessities and increased domestic investments. Economic strength transforms into economic weakness if the industrial sector is not producing the desired outcome. This study investigates how tax revenue and money supply relate to Singapore's industrial production in order to understand more about the shifting trends in the country's industrial output. This study takes into account FDI inflows, domestic listed companies and electric power consumption as controlling factors of industrial production function. The ARDL bounds test has been employed over the period from 1980-2022. The empirical findings provide evidence of cointegrating relation between industrial production and its regressors in the long run. The results further demonstrate that tax revenue as an instrument for fiscal policy and money supply as an instrument for monetary policy are significantly escalating industrial production but between both, money supply has a stronger impact on industrial production. This study suggests that expansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy may be adopted to accelerate industrial production in Singapore while keeping the cost of conducting these policies in mind. Furthermore, FDI inflows and domestic listed companies are also advised to be encouraged as these give a boost to industrial production. </jats:p>"

Suppliers make more relationship‐specific investments (RSIs) measured by R&amp;D and patent filings toward their customers that share common institutional investors. Such effect is stronger as the CIO network between a supplier and customer pair becomes wider and deeper. We establish causality by exploiting exogenous shocks to CIO using a broad sample of mergers between financial institutions and further find the CIO effects on suppliers’ innovation specificity are stronger for those who ex ante face severer hold‐up concerns. Lastly, we provide evidence that CIO involvement increases the combined valuations of supply chain pairs (mainly for customers). Our work sheds light on the hold‐up mitigation effect of CIO on firms’ decision to make RSIs along the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Given the extensive transfer of capital, knowledge, and information between merging parties, we hypothesize that customers’ competition concerns discourage their suppliers from engaging in vertically conflicted transactions (i.e., acquisitions of their customers’ rivals or suppliers to those rivals). Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that suppliers are less likely to engage in such transactions when their customers are subject to higher product market competition. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced when suppliers and customers have greater relationship‐specific investments and when customers face heightened proprietary information concerns. Using plausibly exogenous variation in common ownership between customers and their rivals as a shock to customers’ competition concerns, we conclude that the link between customers’ competition concerns and supplier acquisitions is likely causal. Our findings suggest that firms alter their investment and strategic decisions in response to the product market competition concerns of their economically related peers.</jats:p>"

The effectiveness of supply chain companies corresponds to a cumulative score on a multi-criteria and perspectives-based evaluation. In this paper, we analyse the performances and challenges of several celebrated e-commerce companies to perceive their overall impression of supply chain management. Method: A mathematical model is framed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with challenges as criteria and companies as alternatives. The criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method is used in this paper to adjust weights representing the available data. The ranking of e-commerce companies is evaluated using multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) method. Results: This model investigates the most dependent criteria and sub-criteria for the adaptation challenges of supply chain companies (SCCs). Furthermore, the SCCs are prioritized based on various conflicting criteria. Conclusion: Various challenges of SCCs, like logistics constraints, disruptions in supply chains, issues with technology, ethical sourcing and inconsistency between the products’ availability and the pace of consumption, are considered and analysed. We amassed the difficulties as criteria and sub-criteria in a numerical process using the MCDM approach. Additionally, the sensitivity and comparative of several optimal phenomena are analysed based on distinctive combinations of challenges in the ranking arena.</jats:p>"

Second, the investigation extends to analysing the impact of renewable energy consumption by sector on economic development. A hybrid approach is used, namely structural equation modelling and artificial neural networks. The study findings indicate the effect and the meaning (directly or inversely) exerted by the three sectoral components on economic growth, with different intensities from one country to another. There is a significant influence on the consumption of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sectors and transport on gross domestic product at the European Union level and for most member states.

Industries with green product labels generally face more significant supply chain challenges. These challenges can come from internal or external disruptions. Therefore, building supply chain resilience (SCRes) capability is one strategy to survive and overcome disruptions while practising green business. Resilience is the ability of a system to respond to disturbances that occur due to an event. Strategic SCRes capabilities enable the supply chain to develop survival capacities that can absorb, adapt, and restore to form a new business model. This study investigates the gap between the resilience capability performance in the green supply chain and stakeholders’ expectations. It took place in an apparel manufacturer in Indonesia that supplies and produces for various global fashion brands where high environmental performance is required. A survey was conducted of 45 experts in the apparel supply chain to determine the SCRes’ capabilities. It employs the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) method to analyze the result. The analysis includes the extent of the SCRes capabilities practices. It also examines the degree of gaps, whether larger or smaller, in positive or negative trends. The research found that the most challenging disruption in the green apparel supply chain is the availability of green material. The result shows that effective communication and coordination are the most significant SCRes capabilities. The second is the supply chain readiness toward demand fluctuation. Furthermore, the IPA results provide recommendations for increasing the resilience performance of the green supply chain in the apparel industry.</jats:p>",

Obtaining such transfer functions is based on the solution of the non-stationary heat conduction equation, represented in operator form using the integral Laplace transform, and in which approximating spline functions in the form of second-order polynomials are used. The article gives the solution of the non-stationary thermal conductivity equation, which describes the thermal processes in the heat-protective coating of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system under the thermal effect of a fire. This solution comes in the operator form for the surface temperature of the heat-protective coating on the side of the gas generator wall. The peculiarity of this decision is the presence of hyperbolic functions of an irrational argument in its composition. The structural and dynamic scheme of the thermodynamic system ‘gas generator wall – heat-protective coating’ is presented, the feature of which is the presence of two entrances. The signal at the scheme’s first input reflects the thermal effect of the fire, and the signal at the second input reflects the thermal state of the gas generator cavity. An equivalent mathematical transition to the description of thermal processes in the heat-protective coating of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system was carried out. This transition happened due to the use of spline functions, which approximate the hyperbolic functions of the irrational argument and are polynomials of the second order. The article gives a verbal interpretation of the algorithm for determining the transfer functions of the heat-protective coating of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system and also an example of its implementation. Furthermore, it shows that for the given conditions of functioning of the gas generator heat-protective coating, the relative errors in approximation of hyperbolic functions by second-order polynomials do not exceed 1.7 %, and the average relative error when equivalent replacement of transfer functions does not exceed 3.8 %.\nKeywords: gas generator, hydrogen storage and supply system, thermal protection coating.</jats:p>",

Niszą badawczą niniejszego artykułu jest zjawisko glokalizacji. Rozważania koncentrują się na dwóch aspektach – istocie i wymiarach konfiguracji łańcucha dostaw (globalnej i lokalnej) oraz tym, w jaki sposób podejście do globalizacji, które uwzględnia połączenie tych wymiarów, może wspierać zdolność adaptacji i odporność łańcuchów dostaw. W szczególności rozważania dotyczą przemysłu farmaceutycznego. Cel tego artykułu jest dwojaki. Po pierwsze, identyfikacja wyzwań i kierunków rozwoju zarządzania łańcuchem dostaw oraz przedstawienie istoty i roli glokalizacji, a po drugie, zdefiniowanie kluczowych czynników konfiguracji łańcuchów dostaw w branży farmaceutycznej, szczególnie w kontekście glokalizacji. Do rozwiązania problemu badawczego zastosowano jakościowe podejście badawcze, odwołując się do odpowiedniej literatury z zakresu zarządzania łańcuchem dostaw i funkcjonowania przemysłu farmaceutycznego w Polsce. Główny wniosek obejmuje stwierdzenie, że projektowanie i zarządzanie nowoczesnymi, odpornymi i adaptacyjnymi łańcuchami dostaw wymaga połączenia podejścia globalnego, zintegrowanego na poziomie międzynarodowym lub globalnym, z podejściem skoncentrowanym na potrzebach rynków lokalnych. Przemysł farmaceutyczny stoi przed wyzwaniem harmonijnego połączenia globalnych ambicji z lokalnymi realiami. Glokalizacja w branży farmaceutycznej podkreśla, że sukces na rynku globalnym wymaga umiejętności elastycznego i skutecznego reagowania na zróżnicowane i zmieniające się konteksty lokalne.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article identifies the relevance of the problem of optimisation of material reserves of a company and their effective management, as the state of existing reserves has a decisive impact on the competitiveness of the company, its financial condition, and the corresponding performance results. It allows the formulation of the research objective in this development. It is a given that inventory management technology is an integral part of the management system of any manufacturing and trading company. The efficiency of these companies depends on such critical criteria as the number of costs incurred for inventory management. Traditional indicators, such as inventory volume, resource turnover, and continuity of supply, cannot be used in isolation to accurately measure the extent to which an inventory management system is improving since they are part of the overall cost criterion. The article examines scientific developments of theoretical foundations for implementing rational solutions in the supply chain, where the authors use modern research methods and approaches. After analysing these studies, we identify the main problematic issues: determining a rational way of servicing orders by the core production warehouse systems, organising an efficient product supply form, and developing rational inventory management technologies throughout the entire product supply chain. We create a structural model of interaction between the warehouse system of the ‘OLL TRAK PARTS’ company and suppliers and customers, formed with the participation of certain parties in all relevant operations. The structure of stocks accounts for the customer’s needs in a multi-nomenclature offer of spare parts for trucks, cars, and agricultural machinery supplied by ‘OLL TRAK PARTS’. The authors build a mathematical model of spare parts inventory management under limited demand conditions, which considers the following parameters of influence: the period for ordering spare parts, the cost of supplying ordered spare parts, and the cost of storing one unit of spare parts inventory. To achieve maximum measurement accuracy with a minimum number of trials and to maintain the statistical reliability of the results, we develop a full-factor experiment plan for three input parameters with three levels of values, consisting of 27 series of trials. The experiment allowed us to model the change in minimum costs with different order volumes of spare parts. Based on the results of the regression analysis of the obtained values of the estimated indicator, we determined the type of regression model – a linear form with a non-zero coefficient.\nKeywords: model, warehouse, system, logistics, interaction.</jats:p>",

Aims of study to integrate environmental considerations into all stages of the supply chain process. Effective management of a complex network of suppliers is crucial to reducing a company's environmental impact, as GSCM seeks to integrate environmental management (EM) and SCM. GSCM practices may be adopted for internal reasons, such as strategy processes, or external reasons, such as stakeholder pressure. This fundamental principle of GSCM is that environmental considerations should be integrated throughout the SCM process, from initial design through material selection, production, distribution, and disposal. This research aims to examine the association between GSCM (GSCM) practices and organizational performance. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both primary and secondary data. The findings suggest that GSCM practices have a negative correlation with organizational performance. The study also found a statistically significant link between GSCM practices and business success, as well as organizational performance. However, the impact of GSCM practices on organizational performance may not be as substantial as previously believed, as it did not have a significant effect on other aspects of organizational performance.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a thematic review of the role of alternative fuels in sustainable air, land, and sea logistics, their challenges, and potential mitigations. Through an extensive literature survey, we determined that biofuels, synthetic kerosene, natural gas, ammonia, alcohols, hydrogen, and electricity are the primary alternative fuels of interest in terms of environmental sustainability and techno-economic feasibility. In air logistics, synthetic kerosene from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids is the most promising route due to its high technical maturity, although it is limited by biomass sourcing. Electrical vehicles are favorable in road logistics due to cheaper green power and efficient vehicle designs, although they are constrained by recharging infrastructure deployment. In sea logistics, liquified natural gas is advantageous owing to its supply chain maturity, but it is limited by methane slip control and storage requirements. Overall, our examination indicates that alternative fuels will play a pivotal role in the logistics networks of the future.</jats:p>"

However, a limited but growing body of research suggests rapid renewable energy development is leading to conflict and resource exploitation in energy-transitioning communities. Such injustices are attributable to the extractivist nature of renewable energy development, where raw materials, also known as Clean Energy Technology Materials (CETMs), are in limited quantities and often concentrated in resource-constrained zones in the Global South. In this perspective, we call for an urgent need for energy justice considerations in CETM’s supply chain. We used demand projection data from 2020 to 2040 to look into the effects of important CETMs like nickel, cobalt, and lithium on distributive justice. We also examined the potential of these effects to tackle systemic injustices such as conflict, labor exploitation, and transactional colonialism. Next, we analyzed global mining production data from the United States Geological Survey using a CETM life cycle lens and found that increasing demand for these materials is exacerbating restorative injustices, particularly in the Global South. Finally, building on the above evidence, we called for the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships and the establishment of fair trade standards across the critical CETM supply chain.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Graphical abstract</jats:title>\n                \n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Highlights</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Here, we analyzed the projected demand growth for selected clean energy technology materials by 2040 relative to 2020 levels using data from the International Energy Agency, visualized their global mining production using data from the United States Geological Survey, explained how the demand for these materials is exacerbating certain injustices, and recommended multi-stakeholder partnerships across the supply chain of these materials.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>The rapid growth of renewable energy technologies is creating injustices throughout the supply chain of clean energy technology materials (CETM).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>A lack of any energy justice framework across CETMs’ extraction, processing, decommissioning, and recycling is exacerbating restorative injustices, especially in the Global South.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>By examining the projected demands and geospatial patterns for the extraction of minerals, metals, and other materials essential for clean energy technology development, the inequities faced by impoverished, marginalized, and Indigenous communities become apparent.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>We argue that if coffee can have fair trade standards across its supply chain, why can’t we have similar considerations for the CETMs?</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>There is a need to include transparency in the sustainability, ethics, and energy efficiency of CETM extraction and processing through global partnerships across its supply chain.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                </jats:list></jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

This paper deals with a two-echelon sustainable dual-channel supply chain containing two manufacturers and a single retailer. One manufacturer of the investigated supply chain produces a traditional non-green item, and another one releases a substitutable green item. The demand of both the item at the online and offline channel is a function of the sales price, greenness level, sales effort of the retailer. Furthermore, we have discussed the criteria for optimal pricing and greening strategy of supply chain members and the sales effort level of the retailer under a centralized and decentralized model. To enhance the supply chain performance, a revenue-sharing contract has been proposed, subject to the pareto improvement of each channel member. The numerical result demonstrates that the proposed revenue-sharing contract can enhance the manufacturer’s profit as well as system profit compared to the centralized and decentralized model and ensure higher profit for all the members than the decentralized model. Moreover, the item in the centralized model enjoys the highest green level than all other scenarios. Sensitivity analysis exhibits that a higher value of greening cost reduces the manufacturer’s green level, decreasing the sales price.</jats:p>",

Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) survey was also conducted to carry out the study. Five thematic maps were generated for weighted overlay. Descriptive statistics was used to analysed data on water supply situation, aquifer parameters were analysed using standard table where porosity and permeability were calculated. The VES data was analysed using ipi2win, thematic maps were produced through overlay analysis using extension of ArcGIS 10.4. VES result reveals the existence of about three to four geologic layers in the study area which constitute the topsoil, weathered rock, weathered/fractured rock, fractured basement, and fresh basement rock. Nine out of the thirteen soundings conducted were found to be of good in nature while the only non-promising aquifers were found in Jalam Kukadi, Hardawa PHC, Bada Koshi, Dambam A Bam. Five groundwater potential zones were determined which are very low 354 km2 (15%), low 393 km2 (15%), moderate 416 km2 (20%), high 436 km2 (25%), and very high 497 km2 (25%). Drainage is the most important factor affecting groundwater occurrence with 25% which is the highest followed by geology with 22%. It can be concluded that 50% of the study area was characterized under high, and very high groundwater potential. It is recommended that areas with poor groundwater potentials government and non-governmental organizations should provide them with an alternative source of water to aid them during periods of difficulties.</jats:p>"

The method takes into account the characteristics and uncertainties of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and incorporates advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms. Furthermore, it integrates real-time market price feedback to achieve the accurate allocation of power supply and demand. Through a case study of a multi-energy VPP in Jiangxi Province, this paper examines the optimal combination model for various energy sources within VPP, and analyzes the impact of different market environments on supply–demand balance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling optimization method significantly improves economic benefits while ensuring grid stability.

Data were further aggregated at the waterworks level by the annual mean and at the supply area level by the weighted mean (weighted to waterworks annual abstraction volumes). Temporal and spatial gaps were filled prior to these aggregations. Various stakeholders could benefit from these open access data. They provide a societal service in response to increased public interest in drinking water hardness. The research community could use the data in environmental, exposure or epidemiological assessments.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the era of global commerce, the integrity and resilience of supply chains have become paramount. However, the increasing complexity of international supply networks has exposed them to a myriad of security risks, including both physical threats and cyberattacks. This paper explores the critical role of strategic communication and criminological approaches in mitigating security risks within global supply chains. It argues that a proactive approach to security—one that integrates effective communication strategies and criminological theories—can significantly enhance the ability of organizations to manage and mitigate these risks. Strategic communication, encompassing clear messaging, timely information sharing, and robust stakeholder engagement, is essential for maintaining transparency and preparedness in supply chain operations. Effective communication ensures that all stakeholders are informed about potential threats and the measures in place to address them, thereby facilitating a coordinated and timely response to security incidents (Fearn-Banks, 2016; Coombs, 2007). This paper examines how organizations can develop and implement comprehensive communication plans that enhance their ability to anticipate and respond to security threats. In addition, the application of criminological theories, such as routine activity theory, situational crime prevention, and deterrence theory, provides valuable frameworks for understanding and addressing security vulnerabilities in supply chains. Routine activity theory emphasizes the importance of identifying motivated offenders, suitable targets, and capable guardians, which can help organizations develop targeted security measures to reduce opportunities for criminal activities (Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979). Situational crime prevention focuses on modifying the environment to deter crime, while deterrence theory highlights the role of penalties and enforcement in preventing criminal behavior (Clarke, 1997; Becker, 1968). This paper explores how these theories can be applied to enhance supply chain security and develop effective preventive strategies. The integration of strategic communication with criminological approaches offers a holistic framework for mitigating security risks in supply chains. By combining these strategies, organizations can improve their ability to manage security threats, safeguard their assets, and ensure the continuity of their operations. The findings of this paper underscore the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to supply chain security that incorporates both communication and criminological insights.\r\nKeywords: Global Supply Chains, Security Risks, Strategic Communication, Criminological Approaches, Cyber Threats, Licit Trade, Routine Activity Theory, Situational Crime Prevention, Deterrence Theory, Supply Chain Security.</jats:p>"

This method is developed and tested in a case study in which BRT is used to investigate the alignment between the curriculum and labour market demand for skills, knowledge, and compe-tences. We compare the curriculum of the multimedia design programme with relevant job advertisements. This comparison involves a qualitative analysis of both the programme’s learning goals and the advertisements’ content based on qualitative and abductive coding.

Twelve samples [4 varieties (Arborg, Haymaker, Nasser, Summit) × 3 harvested years (2018, 2019, 2020)] were used in this study. The DVE/OEB system and NRC-2001 system were applied to evaluate these parameters. The experiment design was RCBD design (oat varieties as a fixed effect and harvested year as a random block effect). MIXED procedure model of SAS 9.4 was used for statistical analysis, and significance was declared at P &amp;lt; 0.05 and tendency at 0.05 ≤ P &amp;lt; 0.1. Based on the DVE/OEB system, results showed that microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available nitrogen (MREN, g/kg DM), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available energy (MREE, g/kg DM), truly absorbed microbial protein in the small intestine (DVME, g/kg DM), truly digested protein in the small intestine (DVE, g/kg DM) and feed milk value (FMV, kg milk /kg feed) of Nasser oat were least in these four varieties although Nasser oat had no significant differences on MREN content with Arborg and Summit oat. Nasser oat had highest endogenous protein loss (ENDP, g/kg DM) and undigested dry matter (UDM, g/kg DM) in these four oat varieties (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Nasser oat also had the largest degraded protein balance (OEB, g/kg DM) value compared with Arborg, Haymaker and Summit oat, and all the OEB values were positive indicating having potential N losses from rumen. There were significant differences in the MREE, DVME, ENDP, UDM, DVE, OEB and FMV between feed oat and milling oat (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and feed oat had larger OEB values than milling oat. Based on the NRC-2001 model, oat varieties had significant impact on microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available energy (MCPTDN, g/kg DM), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available protein (MCPRDPNRC, g/kg DM) and truly absorbed microbial protein in the small intestine (AMCP, g/kg DM; P &amp;lt; 0.05). Haymaker oat had higher metabolizable protein (MP) and FMV than Summit oat (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and had similar MP and FMV with Arborg and Nasser oat. As for the oat types, no significant differences were found on all the characteristics between feed type and milling type, and feed oat had better FMV compared with milling oat.</jats:p>",

This article will fully consider introducing the value concept of a community with a shared future into the operation and management of dynamic supply chains. Based on the optimal information fusion mechanism of artificial intelligence, this article aims to examine the operation and management of dynamic supply chains within the framework of a community with a shared future for mankind. The core idea is to consider the common interests among enterprises, establish a global collaborative operation concept for upstream, midstream, and downstream enterprises, and achieve the goal of sustainable development. Firstly, a type of composite dynamic supply chain model is considered, in which the total inventory of each node in the supply chain is further subdivided into raw material inventory and finished product inventory. At the same time, we have considered factors such as the signing of procurement contracts between core enterprises and upstream enterprises, as well as the signing of supply contracts between core enterprises and downstream enterprises. Secondly, the static and dynamic monitoring information of the enterprise has been established. We use steady-state Kalman filtering theory to obtain dynamic reference signals for upstream enterprises, core enterprises, and downstream enterprises. Based on the optimal information fusion processing mechanism of artificial intelligence, the coefficient weighting method is used to obtain the optimal fusion signals of upstream enterprises, core enterprises, and downstream enterprises. Once again, through high-quality switching strategies, enterprises can achieve in-order switching, improve production efficiency, reduce downtime, enhance their competitiveness and responsiveness, and transform the dynamic supply chain, including order switching, into a discrete-time linear switching system for processing. Fourthly, sufficient conditions, robustness analysis results, and inventory control criteria for the solvability of dynamic supply chain H∞ with order switching are provided. Finally, data analysis is conducted using historical order information from three fruit companies to verify the validity and feasibility of the conclusions in this article and to improve the performance of the dynamic supply chain system. The research findings of this article enrich the exploration of the operation and management of dynamic supply chains and the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.</jats:p>"

This issue has hardly been studied in multiple pregnancies, the prevalence of which has been steadily increasing. Therefore, our study investigated the relationship between newborns&amp;rsquo; anthropometric parameters and the concentration of 25(OH)D in maternal blood of women with twin pregnancies and umbilical cord blood. The study included 50 women who gave birth after the 36th week of twin gestation. 25(OH)D was determined in maternal blood collected during the antenatal period and in the umbilical cord blood of 100 newborns. Anthropometric parameters of the newborns (birth weight, length, head and chest circumference) were obtained from hospital records. Data on nutrition and lifestyle during pregnancy were collected from the patients during an interview conducted by a dietitian. No relationship between maternal and neonatal cord blood vitamin D concentrations and any of the anthropometric parameters of the newborns was found. However, only 6% of the mothers and 13% of the newborns had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;le;20 ng/mL). The type of pregnancy and maternal height were the main factors associated with neonatal size. Newborns from dichorionic pregnancies were on average 202 g heavier (p&amp;lt;0.001) and 1 cm longer (p=0.006) than newborns from monochorionic pregnancies. Newborns of mothers &amp;le; 160 cm in height had on average 206 g lower birth weight (p=0.006) and were 3.5 cm shorter (p=0.003) compared to newborns of taller mothers.

As the natural water quality deteriorates, the treatment plant’s efficiency in preparing drinking water for the population’s needs decreases. The hydraulic flake formation chamber allows for physicochemical processes that produce large and solid flakes of metal hydroxides with impurities that quickly settle and are then removed from the water.\nThis study aims to develop a methodology for experimental research on the new design of a swirl-vortex flake formation chamber that intensifies the water purification process in the domestic and drinking water supply systems.\nThe proposed design of the swirl-vortex chamber has dimensions of 0.75×2.0 m and a height of 0.65 m. Due to the installation in the first section of 4 fittings with nozzles, two pieces on each pipe, and in the second section, six fittings with nozzles, three pieces on each pipe with a diameter of 6–10 mm, it is possible to increase the effect of water illumination. The authors performed hydraulic modelling following the Reynolds criterion (Re) and the Froude criterion (Fr). We conducted experiments using artificial turbidity water. White-blue clay was used as a turbidant because it contains more small particles than the white-green one. We decided to model flake formation chambers according to the Froude criterion (Fr). Modelling according to the Reynolds criterion leads to such large velocity gradients that it simply does not make sense to talk about flake formation processes. We carried out the second series of experiments to obtain a qualitative assessment of the swirl-vortex chamber’s work in forming flakes by studying the deposition of flakes at different velocity gradients and angles of inclination of the nozzles. The best effect of lightening the water in the flake formation chamber occurs at a nozzle inclination angle of 45° to the bottom. The best effect of water clarification happens at a velocity gradient of about 60 s-1 and the water residence time in the flake formation chamber of 200–300 s.\nKeywords: water treatment, intensification, flake formation chamber, drinking water supply.</jats:p>",

The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with three replications and comprises eight treatments viz., T1-Absolute control, T2-125% NPK, T3-100% RDN+ 25% N through vermicompost, T4-75% RDN + 25% N through vermicompost, T5-50% RDN + 25% N through vermicompost + Biofertilizer (Azotobactor), T6-75% RDN + Biofertilizer (Azotobactor), T7-75% RDN + Azotobactor + PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Biofertilizer) and T8-75% NPK + ZnSO4 @ 25 kg/ha + Azotobactor. The highest growth of wheat crop was achieved by adopting nutrient supply system through synthetic fertilizer under treatment T2-125% NPK which was significantly at par with T5 50% RDN+ 25% N through vermicompost + 25% N through Biofertilizer (Azotobactor), which also proved significantly superior to rest of the treatments. The minimum value of growth parameter was recorded under T1-Absolute control. Results also revealed that higher yield attributes viz. No. of effective tillers, Spike length, No. of spike, Grain per spike, test weight, were recorded under T2-125% NPK followed by 50% RDN+ 25% N through vermicompost+ 25% N through Biofertilizer (Azotobactor) and lowest were recorded under T1- Absolute control. Yields of crop viz. grain yield, straw yield, biological yield was also recorded highest under T2-125% NPK and lowest were recorded T1- Absolute control. On the basis of one season study, it can be safely concluded that the application of integrated nutrient supply system 50% RDN+ 25% N through vermicompost+ 25% N through Biofertilizer (Azotobactor) gave similar result as 125% NPK in terms of growth and yield.</jats:p>"

However, most research focus on the mismatch between the retailer's order and customer's demand, which ignores the influence of the supplier's random yield on supply chain members' decision‐making. This paper investigates a two‐stage optimization problem within a two‐echelon supply chain, featuring a supplier with random yield and a retailer updating demand information in real‐time. Faced with a long production lead time, the retailer can either place advance orders at the production season's onset (first‐stage advance order) or opt for instant orders at the beginning of the sales season (second‐stage instant order). To ensure timely order fulfillment, the supplier initially employs a cost‐effective regular production mode with random yield during the production season. If yields are insufficient during sales, a pricier emergency production mode with guaranteed output becomes available. Utilizing a dynamic programming approach, we formulate the two‐stage optimization problem to derive optimal production and order decisions. Our analysis uncovers how realized random yield and stochastic market signals influence emergency production and instant order quantities in the second stage. We compare expected profits in scenarios with perfect and imperfect market signals, probing the members' preferences regarding order strategies. An intriguing finding emerges: as instant wholesale prices rising, the supplier's preferred order strategy diverges from the retailer. By strategic adjustments to the instant wholesale price, we demonstrate the potential for unanimous agreement on preferred order strategies among supply chain members — a quality enhancing the chain's flexibility and performance. Moreover, we extend the model to hybrid order strategies and identify conditions for unanimous preference among the three strategies. To bolster our theoretical findings, we provide numerical examples, lending practical support to our study.</jats:p>",

Supply chain network design (SCND) reduces the effects of disruption, employing mitigation strategies such as extra capacity and flexibility to make SCs resilient. Currently, no systematic literature review classifies mitigation strategies for SCND. This paper systematically reviews the literature on SCND, analysing proposed mitigation strategies and the methods used for their integration into quantitative models. First to understand the key failure drivers SCND literature is categorised using geography, with local, regional or global disruptions linked to vulnerable sections of a SC. Second, the strategies used in mathematical models to increase SC resilience are categorized as proactive, reactive, or SC design quality capabilities. Third, the relative performance of mitigation strategies is analysed to provide a comparison, identifying the most effective strategies in given contexts. Forth, mathematical modelling techniques used in resilient SCND are reviewed, identifying how strategies are integrated into quantitative models. Finally, gaps in knowledge, key research questions and future directions for researchers are described.</jats:p>",

Based on a literature review of articles addressing the topics of green hydrogen and isolated systems, an analysis is conducted on the application of green hydrogen as an energy supply solution for isolated systems. The review identified and collected data on important parameters for comparing solutions, such as CAPEX, OPEX, energy cost, and the price per kilogram of hydrogen. Using these data, analyses were performed to provide an overview of the application of green hydrogen in isolated systems. One of the objectives of this work is to present a comprehensive analysis of the green hydrogen chain and its application in the context of electricity generation, particularly for isolated systems in Brazil.</jats:p>"

Calls for increased theory‐building and practically relevant research have driven the discipline's development. This article advocates the wider use of grounded theory methodology, providing practical guidance to ensure reliable theoretical contributions. The study employs a multi‐method approach (bibliometric analysis, mapping review, and state‐of‐the‐art analysis) to quantitatively review existing grounded theory research on logistics and SCM issues, investigate its methodological attributes, and outline its strengths and weaknesses. Based on these findings, guidelines are proposed for methodologically sound grounded theory building in the discipline. Derived from empirically grounded theory studies, these guidelines address issues that hinder the effective use of the method, such as misunderstanding its fundamentals, improper use of literature, coding challenges, inadequate research design, and difficulties in transitioning from analysis to theorizing. By adding an empirical perspective to supplement existing guidelines, the study aims to enhance the quality of SCM research. While grounded theory is not the only solution for advancing the discipline, its judicious use is advocated to bring rigorous, theory‐driven, and practice‐oriented contributions to logistics and SCM research.</jats:p>",

According to the World Health Organization, around 600 million people, approximately 1 in 10 individuals worldwide, experience illness due to contaminated food consumption, resulting in nearly 0.42 million fatalities annually. The recent development in software and hardware sectors has created opportunities to improve the safety concerns in the food supply chain. The objective of this review is to explain the fundamentals of blockchain and its integration into the supply chain of various food commodities to enhance food safety. This paper presents the analysis of 31 conceptual works, 10 implementation works, 39 case studies, and other investigations in blockchain‐based food supply chain from a total of 80 published papers. In this paper, the significance of adapting conceptual ideas into practical applications for effectively tracing food commodities throughout the supply chain has been discussed. This paper also describes the transformative role of blockchain platforms in the food industry, providing a decentralized and transparent ledger to access real‐time and immutable records of a product's journey. In addition, both the positive impacts and challenges associated with implementing blockchain technology in the food supply chain have been evaluated. In summary, the blockchain‐based food supply chains offer greater transparency, traceability, and trust, ultimately resulting in higher standards of food safety and quality.</jats:p>",

Detailed experimental testing and characteristic analysis reveal that alkaline water electrolyzers have long startup times, rapid dynamic responses, and poor dynamic stability. These characteristics are critical for the development of accurate models and effective strategies. A dynamic simulation model was established in MATLAB R2022b and Simulink, enabling standalone simulation operation and module encapsulation. This model facilitates the construction of hydrogen production clusters and serves as a foundational tool for system strategy research. Simulations of rated current loading and unloading for four electrolyzers over 6 h showed significant differences in startup and operation. Key parameters such as cell voltage, maximum loadable power, hydrogen production efficiency, and energy consumption were analyzed. Temperature simulations indicated significant differences in thermal equilibrium points and cooling modes among the electrolyzers, as determined by structural design and cooling system efficiency. These findings highlight the need for efficiency improvements in high-current density electrolyzers. Overall, the model effectively represents commercial electrolyzer characteristics and offers a reliable tool for future research on control strategies for adapting hydrogen production systems to renewable energy power fluctuations, laying a solid foundation for the optimization of electrolyzer design and operation strategies.</jats:p>"

In the second stage, the power quality of the feeder is optimized by reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) by optimally allocating D-STATCOM units. In the third and fourth stages, the reliability and resilience aspects of the feeder are optimized using optimal network reconfiguration (ONR) and by integrating an energy storage system (ESS). To solve the non-linear complex optimization problems at all these stages, an efficient meta-heuristic Chernobyl disaster optimizer (CDO) is proposed. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus feeder considering the non-linear characteristics of NRRs, variability of the feeder loading profile, and PV variability.

To effectively integrate renewable sources of energy, multi-directional power flow and control are required, and to facilitate this multi-directional power flow, peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is employed. For a safe, secure, and reliable P2P trading system, a secure communication gateway and a cryptographically secure data storage mechanism are required. This paper explores the uses of blockchain (BC) in renewable energy (RE) integration into the grid. We shed light on four primary areas: P2P energy trading, the green hydrogen supply chain, demand response (DR) programmes, and the tracking of RE certificates (RECs). In addition, we investigate how BC can address the existing challenges in these domains and overcome these hurdles to realise a decentralised energy ecosystem. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of how BC technology can act as a catalyst for a multi-directional energy flow, ultimately revolutionising the way energy is generated, managed, and consumed.</jats:p>"

We study the competition between a fast-fashion brand and a luxury brand that sell substitutable products. Through the whole selling season, the fast-fashion brand commonly adjusts its retail price. Specifically, it may either determine the promotion price responsively in the clearance period (dynamic pricing) or pre-determine and pre-announce it in the regular period (pre-announcement pricing). The luxury brand prefers an unchanged retail price to maintain its brand image. We study how to optimally make pricing decisions in different pricing schemes and how consumers’ strategic behavior, consumers’ hedonic superiority and brands’ pricing schemes affect the optimal decisions. We find that consumers’ strategic behavior is detrimental to both brands even in a competitive pricing model. Besides, consumers’ hedonic superiority will benefit the luxury brand but enhance the fast-fashion brand’s profit only when the cost differentiation is small. Also, we find that a pre-announcement pricing scheme will be unambiguously beneficial to both brands and the whole supply chain. Furthermore, a pre-announcement pricing scheme can alleviate price competition, mitigate monopolization and consumers’ strategic behavior. Finally, we conduct two extensions and find that the qualitatively remain unchanged. </jats:p>"

This paper examines a manufacturer-led secondary low-carbon supply chain consisting of a single supplier and a retailer, focusing on the impact of blockchain technology on carbon transaction costs and consumers’ low-carbon preferences. Utilizing Stackelberg game theory, the paper constructs a supply chain decision model for emission reduction, determining the payment matrix and analyzing the stable strategy for blockchain adoption through evolutionary game theory. The findings indicate that retailers’ adoption of blockchain technology significantly promotes emission reduction within the supply chain, whereas manufacturers’ adoption has minimal impact. Additionally, the study reveals that variations in blockchain adoption costs and carbon quotas result in multiple evolutionary stable strategies. Specifically, when blockchain adoption costs and carbon quotas are below certain thresholds, the system reaches a unique equilibrium where both parties adopt blockchain technology.</jats:p>",

The literature has not examined the possibility that ignoring the labor supply increase associated with the termination of caregiving can lead to an underestimation of the decrease in labor supply after inheritance. Based on a dataset of Japanese women, we found that inheritance decreased labor supply, primarily through changes in the extensive margin, particularly for recipients in their 50s and under 40 years of age with children. Unlike labor supply, household expenditures hardly change after an inheritance. Furthermore, unanticipated inheritances reduce labor supply compared to anticipated inheritances. Additionally, controlling for the termination of caregiving responsibilities resulted in a 25 % larger estimate of the wealth effect of inheritance receipt on labor supply. Finally, pre-inheritance liquidity constraints have no effect on changes in labor supply.</jats:p>",

This study identifies key elements and strategic directions for upgrade negotiation of the Korea-ASEAN FTA by comparing it with other relevant trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA (AANZFTA). As key partners in economic cooperation and integration, both Korea and ASEAN could benefit economically and strategically by upgrading the Korea-ASEAN FTA to a level beyond the RCEP. This could include further liberalizing the market, establishing safeguards in response to changes in global supply chains, and expanding digital trade. Particularly, there is a need to strengthen rules of origin on cumulation, introduce a new chapter on supply chain cooperation to enhance supply chain resilience, and elevate regulatory standards through the establishment of a digital trade chapter.</jats:p>",

The Sanitation Risk Index is calculated using a questionnaire on households regarding sanitation conditions and water supply. This research examines the relationship between the Sanitation Risk Index and its effect on water use, as well as the strategies implemented to reduce sanitation risks in water supply in poorer areas in Pontianak City, West Kalimantan. The city of Pontianak is located downstream of Kapuas River. Many settlements grow along riverbanks and require clean water and adequate sanitation facilities. This study began with an assessment of sanitation conditions and clean water supply with a sanitation risk assessment using a questionnaire in poorer areas. The results of the questionnaire led to calculation of the Sanitation Risk Index (IRS). Descriptive and statistical analyses show the relationship between IRS and water supply. In obtaining the water supply strategy carried out here, it was found that more than 50% of the population uses refillable water for drinking; however, rainwater and river water are still used by poorer area settlements for daily activities. The sanitation risk index was 350, indicating the influence of sanitation risk on the quality and supply of water in Pontianak City poorer area settlements. There are urgent problems that must be resolved in the clean water supply sector in the studied poorer areas.</jats:p>",

Ecosystem services (ESs) are promising targets for regional integration due to their inherent heterogeneity and mobility, yet research in this area remains limited. This study quantifies crop production (CP), water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), and habitat quality (HQ) for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 using the InVEST model and identifies four ES bundles through a K-means cluster analysis. A conceptual ecosystem service flow (ESF) network at the service cluster scale is constructed based on county-level ESF data. The results reveal the following: (1) there is an upward trend in the ES budget for all services from 2000 to 2020, coupled with spatial mismatches between supply and demand; (2) deficit nodes for CP and CS services are concentrated in densely populated districts, while deficits in WY and HQ services are mainly in western Jilin Province; (3) Bundles I and II act as “sources” of ES, Bundle IV serves as a “sink”, and Bundle III is the only cluster with a CP surplus, balancing CP services across the province. In addition, this study provides ecological perspectives for understanding regional integration by suggesting differentiated integrated management for different ecosystem bundles.</jats:p>"

(3) What is the model of the factors influencing the performance of evaluation of agricultural product supply chain in Guangxi province, The People's Republic of China? Through the study of this paper, it is found that there are the following problems in the supply chain management of agricultural products in Guangxi Province: the quality of goods supplied by suppliers is uneven, the timeliness is slow, and the loss during transportation is large. The information systems of various agricultural enterprises are not fully popularized, data between different enterprises cannot be shared, the level of information management is not high enough, the efficiency of transportation management is low, and the quality of transported products cannot be guaranteed.  Major Findings: The research model takes the performance of the agricultural product supply chain in Guangxi Province as the dependent variable, the supplier performance evaluation (SPE) as the independent variable, and the information technology evaluation (ITE) and logistics performance evaluation (LPE) as the mediating variables. The validity of the survey plan and data was tested by confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis. Subsequently, the structural equation model and regression analysis were used to verify the various assumptions in the supply chain organization efficiency hypothesis model. This study deeply explores the many factors that affect the efficiency of the agricultural product supply chain. Finally, a new model for analyzing the factors affecting the performance of the agricultural product supply chain in Guangxi was constructed.</jats:p>"

Holstein-Friesian bull calves [n = 120; body weight (BW) = 43.1±3.56 kg] were enrolled. In the first 12 h after birth, calves were fed either 2 L (100 g of IgG) or 6L (300 g of IgG) of colostrum replacer (CR) to obtain either failure (F) or successful (S) transfer of passive immunity, respectively. Upon arrival at the facility, serum IgG concentrations were measured; therefore, F and S calves were identified accordingly and randomly assigned to one of two milk replacer (MR) feeding schemes: Moderate (Mod; ~8 L) or Low (Low; ~4 L). In total, there were 4 treatments resulting from the 2 × 2 factorial design: F-Mod, F-Low, S-Mod, S-Low (n = 30/treatment). Calves were individually housed and fed twice daily until d 42, gradually weaned until d 56, and had free access to straw and water during the study. On d 22, a calf pelleted starter was offered. To evaluate organ and gastroinstetinal tract development, 10 calves/treatment were euthanized at 84 d of age. Other measurements include weekly BW, daily intakes, and daily fecal score until d 21. Data were analyzed by PROC MIXED in SAS accounting for the fixed effects of block, CR, MR, and time, and their interaction. Time entered the model as a repeated statement, and initial BW was used as a covariable when appropriate. Initial BW was not different across treatments, whereas serum IgG was greater in S calves (S = 1,962.9 vs. F = 941.0 mg IgG/dL). During the study, BW was influenced by both CR (P = 0.001) and MR (P &amp;lt; 0.001), where S and Mod calves consistently exhibited greater BW when compared with F and Low calves, respectively. At d 84, Mod calves (F-Mod and S-Mod) were on average 18 kg heavier than Low calves. Similarly, Mod calves exhibited greater fresh tissue weights in the liver, pancreas, spleen, and both the small and large intestines (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Starter intake was influenced by MR (P &amp;lt; 0.001), with Low calves having the greatest intake before and during weaning. However, post-weaning starter intake was greater (P = 0.010) in Mod calves. Fecal consistency was influenced by CR (P = 0.001) and MR (P &amp;lt; 0.001), with S and Low calves having improved fecal consistency. Although no interactions were observed between CR and MR, these findings underscore the importance of considering both colostrum and MR levels in calf nutrition management to optimize growth and improve animal welfare during the early stages of life.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s world, businesses and, in general, supply chains have undergone extensive transformations, and relying solely on traditional metrics such as cost and quality cannot provide a comprehensive and complete evaluation of companies active in various sections of supply chains. One of the main concerns of supply chain managers is to create an integrated and comprehensive structure for evaluating the performance of active branches. In this context, this study presents a structure that, by simultaneously considering agility and sustainability metrics within the context of the industry 4.0, which has brought about fundamental changes in the supply chain environment in recent years, aims to evaluate the active branches in the dairy product supply chain. On the other hand, the increase in the volume of data produced in the supply chain environment and the development of the applications of machine learning algorithms in various fields, which offer better applications compared to intuitive approaches, have led this study to use hybrid data-driven approaches, which are a combination of expert-based methods and documented organizational data, to evaluate the performance of supply chain branches. Therefore, this study is innovative in terms of the evaluation metrics and the data-driven approach developed. In the first step, evaluation metrics appropriate to the dimensions of agility, sustainability, Industry 4.0, and general metrics were identified, and then the fuzzy best-worth method (FBWM) approach was used to weight the metrics. According to the findings, data-driven, marketing, overhead costs, delivery timeframe, and product quality were selected as the most important metrics. Subsequently, using the developed artificial neural network algorithm, which calculates the input weights of the metrics using the FBWM method, a model for evaluating the supply chain was presented, and the findings show that the developed approach performs better than other algorithms on the problem data with more than 92% accuracy.</jats:p>",

The developed framework encompasses seven key components of the MC supply chain technical system – namely, pre-approval, building plan pre-submission, detailed design, module production, logistics, module installation, and quality assurance and quality control – considering various stakeholders embedded in broader contexts. The case study validates the framework as a theoretical lens to comprehend the complex MC supply chain and as a novel analytical model to enhance the MC supply chain from different stakeholder and contextual perspectives. Future research directions are suggested regarding strategy establishment, performance measurement and policy road map development to achieve a mature and sustainable supply chain. </jats:p>",

This radial turbine shows high potential for various energy applications, such as Organic Rankine Cycle or combined heat and power systems. Analyzing the flow inside the gap between the corotating disks of the Tesla turbine presents challenges due to several factors, including submillimeter length scales, variations in flow cross-section, interactions of body forces arising from rotation with turbulence, interactions between the turbine’s inlet nozzles and rotor, and moving walls. General design parameters, e.g., number of nozzles, also pose a challenge in order to achieve the full potential of this turbine. In this research, two different variants of the supply system are considered with six and forty nozzles. To minimize computational expenses, a portion of the entire domain is considered. The flow in each domain, consisting of one inlet nozzle and a segment of one gap between the disks, is examined to reveal the complexity of flow structures and their impact on the Tesla turbine performance. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model is used to verify the results of the k-ω Shear-Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model in the first case study with six nozzles. Analyzing the results indicates that the k-ω SST model provides valuable insights with appropriate accuracy. The second case study, with forty nozzles, is simulated using the k-ω SST turbulence model. The research compares flow structure, flow parameters, and their impact on the system’s performance. From the comparison between the k-ω SST turbulence model and LES simulation, it was observed that although the k-ω SST model slightly overestimates the general parameters and damps fluctuations, it still provides valuable insights for assessing flow structures. Additionally, the mesh strategy is described, as the LES requirements make this simulation computationally expensive and time-consuming. The overall benefits of this method are discussed.</jats:p>"

Aim of this paper is to analyze the main theoretical approaches of public management in the field of water supply and drainage in order to identify the main principles and tools that affect the efficiency and sustainability of the field. The tools of strategic planning, operational management and emergency response are considered as key components of successful management in this area. Emphasis is placed on the special role of developing fair tariff policies and financial support for infrastructure investments. The importance of the legal framework that regulates the sphere, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and protection of consumer rights is highlighted. The environmental aspect of resource management in the field, which includes modern methods of wastewater treatment and minimizing the negative impact on natural water bodies, is considered. It was emphasized that state intervention is a key factor in ensuring equal access to clean water, which is a basic human right according to the United Nations. The problem of natural monopoly in the field is considered through the prism of high capital investments and low elasticity of demand, which limit market competition. Strategies to stimulate competition and improve service quality are explored, including regulating tariffs and encouraging innovation. The example of Scotland, where water supply management is centralized through the creation of a single national company Scottish Water, reveals the effectiveness of such an approach in improving infrastructure and ensuring high quality services with public participation. The importance of a multidisciplinary approach to management in the field is emphasized, with a special emphasis on the stability of the service in wartime. The research may be useful to researchers, state and local authorities, and international organizations. Further perspectives of research include the study of the peculiarities of the application of the theoretical base in the solution of scientific and practical problems in the field in Ukraine during the war.</jats:p>",

It emphasized the integration of supply chain management in the four critical quadrants of product creation. Since, no product is created of the sake of creation, but for satisfying the end-users,  supply chain management amplifies customer satisfaction through strategic management of all related logistics in the production process. Raw materials deposit, industrial plant, warehousing, and consumption were identified as the critical quadrants by which supply chain processes can enhance efficiency in industrial operations, thereby leading to higher economic performance, and welfare improvement for the citizens through enhanced customer satisfaction. The study identified three challenges for the adoption of the 4-Quadrant approach, while also recommended further test of the approach by empirical analysis.</jats:p>"

Pre-defined selection criteria were used on four research questions to identify a hundred relevant publications from the Scopus database, including publishers such as Emerald, Elsevier, Springer, Inderscience, and Wiley. The review begins with the first research question – the characteristics of the selected publications. Then, the authors delve into the second question – negative impacts, such as reputational damage, profit losses, and unreliable data. The third question highlights supply chain (SC) processes that are particularly vulnerable to the influence of social media. In addressing the fourth question, the authors identified the most common social networks (SN) discussed in related literature. Despite the comprehensive research, no publication thoroughly explored these four research questions, pointing to gaps for future empirical research. The limitation of focusing solely on English-language literature and other disciplines suggests the need for broader studies.

The research adopts a quantitative approach, using a structured questionnaire to gather data from a representative sample of students across BSc, MSc, and PhD programs. Of the almost 700 population, 255 were sampled and the findings reveal that power interruptions are a frequent and significant issue, with 85% of students experiencing outages at least once a week and 60% reporting outages lasting between 1 to 3 hours. These disruptions have a pronounced negative impact on academic performance, with 78% of respondents indicating that power outages have adversely affected their grades. Furthermore, 82% of students reported delays in project completion due to power interruptions, with a substantial number having to redo portions of their work due to unsaved progress. The study highlights a strong correlation between the frequency of power outages and the decline in academic performance, as well as the delays in project completion. Additionally, the psychological impact of these outages, manifested in increased levels of stress and anxiety among 70% of respondents, further exacerbates the challenges faced by students. The research concludes that reliable power infrastructure is crucial for academic success, particularly in technology-intensive disciplines like architecture. Recommendations include improving power infrastructure, implementing energy management strategies, developing contingency plans, enhancing student support services, and fostering collaboration with power utility providers. By addressing these issues, educational institutions can create a more stable and conducive learning environment, thereby enhancing students' academic outcomes and overall well-being.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing interest in groundwater as a sustainable resource for water supply regulation is noteworthy. Just as surface reservoirs in many countries are primarily designed to manage seasonal fluctuations throughout the year, aquifers possess significant reserves, making them particularly well suited for interannual regulation, especially during droughts. In the face of climate change, this form of regulation may increasingly highlight the importance of groundwater resources. For instance, the temporary use of groundwater reserves through intensive pumping in arid or semiarid regions, compensating for seasonal or interannual variations in natural water recharge, can significantly affect aquifers. The exploitation of groundwater reserves may lead to adverse effects over time, eventually being deemed overexploitation and subject to environmental or even legal issues. This work assesses the interannual regulation capacity of aquifers and estimates the groundwater renewal rates and periods for aquifers according to river basins. We first present the mathematical background and development of a method to assess the hydrodynamic volumes (renewable groundwater reserves) in large regions. This method builds on prior knowledge of the distribution functions of spring water contributions based on their discharge and for lithological groups exhibiting similar hydrogeological behavior. Furthermore, it establishes a relationship between spring discharges and hydrodynamic volumes, facilitating the integration of the latter based on discharge. Although proposed for Spain, the method can also be implemented to other regions where data are available.</jats:p>"

Along a roadmap, this report presents measures and tools that support the reduction of information uncertainty, the description of effects of uncertainty within regeneration planning and control and in regeneration logistics as well as a superordinate assessment and configuration of regeneration supply chains. For forecasting a Bayesian Network based approach is presented. The planning quality that is achieved based on these forecasts is assessed using a descriptive model based on the classic milestone trend analysis. To support logistics oriented regeneration supply chain assessment and configuration an extensive simulation model as well as a model for pool stock dimensioning is presented.

Additionally, it explores the mediating role of SCM practices in the relationship between SCI-INTI, SCI-INFI, and POP in Oman. To meet the study’s objectives, a quantitative cross-sectional survey method was used. A total of 377 questionnaires were distributed to managers responsible for supply chain operations in the main departments at Sohar and Salalah ports, yielding 331 usable responses, with a response rate of 88 percent. The data collected were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that both internal and information integration within the supply chain have positive and statistically significant effects on the operational performance of Oman’s container ports (POP). Specifically, Supply Chain Integration with Internal Integration (SCI-INTI) significantly impacts POP (β = 0.249, t = 5.039, p &lt; 0.001), and Supply Chain Integration with Information Integration (SCI-INFI) also significantly affects POP (β = 0.259, t = 4.966, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, SCI-INTI positively influences Supply Chain Management Practices (SCMP) (β = 0.381, t = 7.674, p &lt; 0.001), as does SCI-INFI (β = 0.484, t = 9.878, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, SCMP positively and significantly influences the operational performance of Oman’s container ports (β = 0.424, t = 7.643, p &lt; 0.001). These findings contribute to the literature by emphasizing the significance of internal and information integration within the supply chain and SCM practices as strategic internal resources and capabilities that enhance operational performance in container ports. Understanding these elements enables decision-makers and policymakers within government port authorities and port operating companies to optimize internal resources and capabilities to improve port operational performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The contradiction between ecological resource protection and urban sprawl in urban agglomeration areas is becoming more and more prominent, facing a serious imbalance between the supply and demand of ecosystem services. To analyze the impact of urban agglomeration expansion on regional ecosystem services, based on multi-source data, an assessment model of supply and demand of ecosystem services for water conservation, carbon sequestration, soil conservation and crop production was constructed. With the help of value transformation model and spatial analysis method, this paper explores the risk of ecosystem service supply and demand imbalance faced by the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration in the process of expansion. This study found that the supply capacity of ecosystem services in the YRDUA has continued to decline at the spatial pixel scale; ecosystem service value deficits are a common problem in the YRDUA, with cities around Taihu Lake, such as Shanghai and Suzhou, being the most serious; the value surplus areas are concentrated in the southern cities, such as Xuancheng and Chizhou, but the balance between the supply of and demand for ecosystem services in these cities is also facing a challenge as the cities are expanding. This study analyzed the spatial pattern changes in the Yangtze River Delta region in the context of urban sprawl from the perspective of ecosystem service supply and demand, which helps to clarify the changing ecosystem service dynamics of the region and guide the formulation of urban planning policies and to achieve a balance between ecological supply and demand as well as sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Although the integration of HESS and PV facilitates the energy saving and cost reduction of the co‐phase TPSS, the high cost and configuration of HESS should be considered, which is the key to affect the optimal operation strategy of co‐phase TPSS. Here, the optimal operation strategy of co‐phase TPSS with HESS and PV is proposed to design the HESS configuration, recycle RBE and improve power quality. The proposed model aims to minimize the total system cost, including HESS investment cost, electricity cost and operation and maintenance cost. Moreover, the proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming by employing linearization approaches. Finally, case studies verify that the 29.2% cost reduction rate is achieved and the three‐phase voltage unbalance meets the standard requirements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currency risk was a significant difficulty for firms involved in international commerce in the current global economy. The profitability and competitiveness of organisations with supply chains that span across borders were greatly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. This introduction examined the intricacies of managing currency risk in global supply chains, investigating the most recent solutions used by organisations to strengthen their operations. Over the last 10 years, there has been an extraordinary increase in globalisation, characterised by more market integration and increased international trade. Nevertheless, globalisation brings with it not just benefits but also inherent concerns, with currency volatility being the most prominent among them. According to projections by Grand View Research, Inc., the global currency exchange market was expected to reach a value of $28.8 trillion by 2025. This highlights the significant currency risk that firms throughout the globe were facing. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasised the need to effectively handle currency risk in worldwide supply networks. Amidst trade interruptions and shifting currency rates, economies faced increased uncertainty and volatility, which in turn affected enterprises. Research conducted by the Foreign Monetary Fund had shown that there was a significant increase of 59% in currency volatility during the early phase of the epidemic. This has worsened the difficulties faced by companies that heavily depend on foreign commerce. In light of this situation, companies were obligated to reevaluate their methods for managing currency risk to strengthen their ability to withstand challenges and reduce the possibility of financial losses. Conventional methods such as forward contracts and currency options, while somewhat successful, may not be enough to handle the intricacies of contemporary supply chains. As a result, organisations are using novel methods and technology to effectively manage currency risk. Recent developments in Financial Technology have created new opportunities for innovative currency risk management strategies. Blockchain technology had the potential to provide transparent and secure cross-border transactions, which helped decrease the risk of currency exposure. Moreover, the advent of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms enabled organisations to analyse extensive information and forecast currency fluctuations with enhanced precision. Collaborative alliances within supply chains provided a strategic opportunity to reduce currency risk. Companies may enhance risk mitigation and improve their ability to adapt to market dynamics by developing stronger connections with suppliers and consumers. This can be achieved via the exploration of collaborative hedging methods and the sharing of risk burdens. Nevertheless, effectively managing currency risk in international supply chains requires the ability to quickly adapt, come up with new ideas, and work together. This summary summarised important findings from the following conversation, emphasising the need for proactive risk management techniques in protecting against the uncertainties of the global economy.

The Citarum River, with a catchment area of 6,090 km2, plays a crucial role in regional water supply and hydroelectric power generation. However, environmental challenges such as deforestation, land use changes, and sedimentation pose significant risks. We employed the CA-Markov model integrated with IDRISI TerrSet software and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to predict future land use changes and assess water supply, soil erosion, and sedimentation impacts for 2030 and 2040. The analysis revealed diverse trends in water yield across different catchment areas, with some regions showing increased water availability and others facing declines. High erosion and sedimentation rates were identified as critical issues affecting hydropower efficiency. The study highlights the need for comprehensive watershed management strategies, including reforestation, sustainable land management practices, and sediment management, to enhance the sustainability of small hydropower projects. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating environmental considerations into hydropower development to ensure the ecological integrity of the Citarum Watershed.</jats:p>",

The study of volatile compounds revealed that the enzymes that are responsible for their genesis during the technological process were significantly affected by oxygen addition in both the systems of fruit crushing. The results from the stoning technology proved that the quality improvement was a consequence of the prevention of the seed breaking and the oxidation catalyzed by the olive stone enzymes. In Peranzana EVOOs, it was possible to increase the aldehyde concentration up to 97% using stoning technology with a 0.2 L/min oxygen addition compared with traditional crushing. At the same time, non-significant reductions in phenolic compounds were detected when comparing crushing and stoning with and without the addition of oxygen, and similar trends were observed for the two studied cultivars.

Differently from dynamic capabilities that enable adaptation, supply chain transformative capabilities include four core dimensions: triggering, envisioning, navigating, and stabilizing capabilities. By using a multiple‐case study approach involving six Italian companies related to fashion and furniture sectors, we investigate these concepts and identify the microfoundations of supply chain transformative capabilities for circularity. They are classified with reference to individuals, processes, and structures. Our findings illustrate how supply chains can facilitate and effectively govern their circular transformation by developing the transformative capabilities and their microfoundations. This paper provides valuable theoretical insights and managerial perspectives, advancing the concept of transformative supply chain management.</jats:p>",

It goes on to discuss the operational dynamics of these chains and the corporate priorities that they reflect, which, it argues, do little to improve the poor work health and safety (WHS) outcomes in LMICs. It then examines evidence for the effectiveness of various private and public regulatory strategies that are claimed to bring about improved health and safety practices and outcomes among GSC suppliers in these countries. The paper critically evaluates this evidence and argues that, while there may be some examples of effective strategies and regulatory practices in particular contexts, their overall influence remains limited. It identifies and discusses the principal reasons for these limitations and concludes that the global regulation of conditions of labour – including WHS – at the end of GSCs falls well short of universal best practice and is, more generally, insufficient to counter the economic forces working against the maintenance of adequate standards of worker protection.</jats:p>",

However, the action process of the check valve is often disregarded in the design of protective measure. In this study, a one-way surge tank model incorporating a check valve was developed based on the method of characteristics. The check valve action process and different installation positions for one-way surge tanks were investigated based on an actual water supply project. The results show that, compared with the existing one-way surge tank mathematical model, the pipeline pressure calculated by the new model is smaller and the water replenishment is slower, which means that there is a safety risk based on the calculation results of the existing model. As the opening process of the check valve slows down, the pipeline minimum pressure is reduced. When the valve opening rate reaches 0.5 s, negative pressure appears in the pipeline. In addition, for undulated terrain with two obvious high points, when the first one-way surge tank is installed at the node behind the pump, the second one should be installed at the highest point to ensure that the pipeline pressure is greater than 0 m.</jats:p>",

Indeed, many firms recognize that it is critical to leverage their supply chains to gain a competitive advantage. We propose that common suppliers enhance a rival firm's awareness of the focal firm's credibility, reducing competitive responses. In addition, a rival firm's strong supplier inventory performance will motivate rivals to respond more aggressively, while the rival's supply–chain partnerships enhance its capability to react to the focal firm. Using panel data from S&amp;P 1500 firms between 2007 and 2015, our findings provide support for our hypotheses, illustrating that supply chain characteristics can significantly influence a rival firm's responses to the focal firm's preannouncements. This research contributes to the competitive dynamics and supply chain management literature by highlighting the strategic role of supply chain characteristics in interfirm competition, offering practical insights for managers on leveraging supply chain resources to effectively navigate competitive threats.</jats:p>",

The influence of the method (design) of air supply, the cross-sectional shape of the supply channels and nozzle tubes on the gas-dynamic structure of the flow in a vertical diffuser for different flow characteristics was assessed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>METHODS.</jats:bold> The structure (distribution) of the flow inside a vertical diffuser for supplying air using different designs of supply channels was studied on an experimental bench. Based on the thermal imaging method, the flow structure in a vertical diffuser was studied. In this study, two methods of supplying air to a vertical diffuser were studied: supplying air through one straight channel from the bottom and nozzle supplying air through four tubes. The channels and nozzles had cross sections in the shape of a circle, square and triangle. Accordingly, the influence of six air supply designs into a vertical diffuser and their influence on the gas-dynamic flow structure were studied.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS.</jats:bold> The experiments were carried out under stationary air flow conditions in the diffuser for air flow rates from 0.015 to 0.06 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s. The Reynolds number for the air flow at the outlet of the supply channel was in the range from 42500 to 150000.

In this case, the cross-sectional shape of the supply channel has a significant impact on the flow structure in the conical diffuser. Features of the flow structure in a vertical diffuser with nozzle air supply through four tubes are the absence of stagnant zones and a central air flow along the axis. At the same time, the use of square and triangular nozzle tubes leads to a more uniform distribution of air flow throughout the entire volume of the vertical diffuser.</jats:p>"

The water right transaction between Zhengzhou and Nanyang in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project is taken as a case for simulation. The study shows t: the lower the marginal return of the water resources in the water-rich area is, the higher the water-scarce area is, the easier to promote water rights trading; the higher the environmental and social benefits for both parties are, the easier the water rights trading; the lower the transaction cost of both parties is, the easier the water rights trading.</jats:p>",

This paper delves into the critical issue of food security within the context of micro-food businesses in Malaysia, particularly how they grapple with challenges like maintaining food supply chain stability during crises. Through a narrative review, this research explores the four pillars of food security (availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability) while incorporating agency and sustainability considerations. The review also analyzes food security at general, national, and micro-food business levels, encompassing food supply and crisis management strategies. A comprehensive search was conducted on Emerald Insight, Scopus, and Google Scholar, incorporating Google searches for pertinent reports and policy documents. Drawing on existing literature and research in this field, the paper sheds light on the ongoing challenges and issues surrounding food security among micro-food businesses in Malaysia. Besides, it underscores the need for further in-depth investigations to gain a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of this sector’s intricacies. By highlighting these areas, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on food security and calls for proactive measures to address the persistent challenges faced by micro-food businesses in Malaysia, ultimately contributing to broader global food stability efforts.</jats:p>",

The potential of integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) with machine learning has been highlighted in recent studies. This hybrid framework is valuable not only for assessing food supply chains but also for improving them toward a more sustainable system. Yet, an essential step in the optimization process is defining the optimization boundaries, or minimum and maximum quantities for the variables. Usually, the boundaries for optimization variables in these studies are obtained from the minimum and maximum values found through interviews and surveys. A deviation in these ranges can impact the final optimization results. To address this issue, this study applies the Delphi method for identifying variable optimization boundaries. A hybrid environmental assessment framework linking LCA, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, the Delphi method, and genetic algorithm was used for optimizing the pomegranate production system. The results indicated that the suggested framework holds promise for achieving substantial mitigation in environmental impacts (potential reduction of global warming by 46%) within the explored case study. Inclusion of the Delphi method for variable boundary determination brings novelty to the resource allocation optimization process in the agri-food sector.

Usually, because MSME products are hampered by supply chain disruptions and production. However, through recovery strategies and interventions to apply mathematical concepts in the demand and supply functions, a balance curve between the demand and supply functions is formed. Awareness to apply mathematical concepts for business actors has an important role in controlling the rate of supply of goods so that the number of goods demand can be fulfilled according to the number of desires and the prices offered can be adjusted to the prices requested by consumers.

Stalk yields showed trends similar to those for grain yields, but plant density had the opposite effect on the leaf weight (g 20 leaves<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the flowering stage. K fertilization increased the K content to the greatest extent in the vegetative parts (leaf and stalk), while increasing plant density had a reverse effect. The K-Ca-Mg antagonism was also the most pronounced in the vegetative parts, i.e. maize leaves in the flowering stage. According to the results obtained in the field trial, it seems that a century ago, in our grandparents’ time, food contained more minerals than nowadays, due to the fact that plant density decreases grain mineral composition more than mineral fertilization can increase it.</jats:p>"

To the extent that the previous literature on GPN/GVC governance included the state as one of the extra-firm actors, geopolitics has not been explicitly dealt with in its role in shaping GPN/GVC governance. We build on the existing research on GPN/GVC governance and propose a shift in perspective, from one of cost-driven to diplomacy-driven governance. Taking the case of the semiconductor industry, we conduct an analysis of native language sources and examine how regulatory supply chain controls are shaping East Asian industrial and trade policies. Specifically, we focus on how East Asian states are negotiating their dependence on the world’s two largest markets, the United States and China, and developing new policy strategies in order to navigate the dual hegemony. The analysis reveals that, while varying strategies are adopted, multilateral alliances of the states are gaining prominence in GPN/GVC governance. We conclude that a more state-centric analysis of GPN/GVC is in order.</jats:p>",

The objective is to optimize low‐carbon objectives and reduce environmental impact. Existing static models fail to capture the dynamic nature of supply chain systems and overlook the ripple effects when sourcing decisions propagate throughout the interconnected network. To bridge this gap, our study develops a dynamic model that explicitly captures the bullwhip effect and leverages real‐time and historical data. This model conceptualizes suppliers as prey and manufacturers and consumers as predators, employing an ecological analogy to decipher the intricate interactions and dependencies within the supply chain. Through this approach, we identify strategies to promote sustainable practices and motivate suppliers to adopt low‐carbon measures. We assess two data‐driven algorithms, the nonlinear auto‐regressive exogenous (NARX) network and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamic systems with input variables (SINDYc). The results reveal that SINDYc outperforms prediction accuracy and control, offering significant advantages for rapid decision‐making. The study highlights how shifts in market demands and regulatory pressures critically influence the strategies of chemical firms and fertilizer markets. Moreover, it discusses the economic challenges in transitioning from high carbon footprint suppliers (HCFSs) to low carbon footprint suppliers (LCFSs), exacerbated by a notable cost disparity where HCFSs are approximately 30% cheaper. By advancing beyond conventional static models, this research provides a deeper understanding of the environmental impacts and operational dynamics within supply chains, emphasizing the significant “ripple effect” where decisions at one node profoundly affect others within the chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Equal rights to rent and purchase affects the supply of compulsory education resources. How to promote the balanced compulsory education resources supply in the context of equal rights to rent and purchase is currently a hot issue amongst government and society. To achieve such balance, conducting research in the context of equal rights to rent and purchase becomes crucial. However, existing research has yet to provide sufficient explanations for the differentiated paths for realizing the balanced compulsory education resources supply in practice. This study uses 31 cities in China as case samples and jointly applies fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and the ‘technology–organization–environment’ (TOE) framework. The findings are summarized as follows. Firstly, the balanced compulsory education resources supply in the context of equal rights to rent and purchase is affected by six key technological, organizational, and environmental factors. Namely, data co-construction and sharing, technological infrastructure, attention allocation, government information disclosure, policy support for equal rights to rent and purchase, and level of urban economic development. Secondly, the linkage matching of technological, organizational and environmental conditions forms diversified configurations that drive the balanced compulsory education resources supply in the context of equal rights to rent and purchase. These configurations include the ‘organization’ driving model, ‘technology–environment’ driving model, ‘technology–organization–environment’ driving model, and ‘technology-organization’ driving model. Finally, eastern, central and western China are driven by different configuration paths. Amongst them, eastern China has relatively good basic conditions at the technological, organizational and environmental levels. The combination of different conditions can drive the balanced compulsory education resources supply in a ‘different paths lead to the same destination’ manner. Although the development in central China is somewhat restricted, the radiation and impetus from eastern China, in combination with the different conditions in central China, can drive the balanced compulsory education resources supply. Western China shows no advantages at the technological, organizational and environmental levels. Faced with restrictions in organizational and environmental conditions, the government in western China should develop the necessary technological conditions to drive the balanced compulsory education resources supply.</jats:p>"

We find that the supplier, who is farther away from customers, is the optimal agent to be responsible for recovery activity. Following, we design a simple transfer price contract for the supplier‐collection mode such that the recovery rate achieves the centralized level. Subsequently, a fixed payment is proposed to compensate the supplier, thereby realizing Pareto improvement. Finally, we consider the supplier as the Stackelberg leader and find opposite results regarding optimal reverse channel structure.</jats:p>",

Secondly, the traditional distribution network carrying capacity evaluation method is studied and introduced. Then, the distribution network carrying capacity evaluation considering uncertainty is reviewed and investigated.

First, the concept of novel energy cell and its mechanism model, which has ecological restoration functions such as sewage and waste treatment, is proposed in the paper. Second, the interaction mechanism between multi-energy supply benefits and ecological restoration benefits in the novel energy cell cluster is studied, and the quantification model of the comprehensive benefits of the novel energy cell cluster is established. Then, with the objectives of the maximum energy saving rate, the maximum emission reduction of system pollutants, and the minimum total operating costs of the system, a comprehensive benefit optimization model of urban multi-energy system and its solving algorithm are established. Finally, a simulation model is established. The simulation results show that the proposed method is conducive to the coordinated development of the integration of energy, environment, and economy of the city.</jats:p>",

During COVID-19, the supply chains of non-alcoholic drinks faced a revenue decrease of approximately 8.5 percent. The authors identified the research gap by revising publications in the Clarivate Analytics database on multinational enterprises (MNEs) and COVID-19 disruption. The review results show that only 14 publications were dedicated to revising MNEs’ operations and responding to COVID-19 disruption when customers’ demand suddenly decreased. Even, the researches by sector are provided, there is no research covering Nestle and Coca-Cola’s supply chain contribution to COVID-19. The paper’s non-alcoholic drinks supply chain specifics are revised, particularly those related to Nestle and Coca-Cola companies. The authors used the Bloomberg database to revise the upstream and downstream of Nestle and Coca-Cola supply chains and used secondary data from Statista and other sources to investigate the specifics of their supply chains and the sales results during the COVID-19 period. The authors concluded that Nestle and Coca-Cola faced a decline in net revenue in the beverages segment compared to PepsiCo, Red Bull, and Monster, which increased net revenue during 2020 worldwide.</jats:p>"

Silicon nanoparticles used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries are known to have biological activity. Taking into account the widespread prevalence of silicon compounds, the issue of the safety of its use is becoming more urgent.\r\nAIM: To study the effect of water-soluble silicon on the morphological structure of the liver of Djungarian hamsters for three months.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment was carried out on Djungarian hamsters kept in normal vivarium conditions under natural light. The animals were divided into three groups: control, which received bottled drinking water; the first experimental group, which received the same water, but with the addition of sodium metasilicate nine-hydrate at a concentration of 10 mg/l in terms of silicon; the second experimental group, which also received the same water, but with the concentration of sodium metasilicate nine-hydrate doubled (up to 20 mg/l). After three months, the animals were removed from the experiment. Sections were processed by general histological (hematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson method, toluidine blue), histochemical (monoamine oxidase-positive cells) methods.\r\nRESULTS: In the liver of hamsters from the experimental groups, changes in the micromorphological structure were revealed, such as an increase in the nuclear area, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of hepatocytes, and the diameter of sinusoidal capillaries. Moreover, more pronounced changes were observed in the liver of hamsters of the second experimental group, such as polymorphic cell infiltration of the portal tracts, an increase in the number of eosinophils, deformation of hepatocyte nuclei and the appearance of apoptotic bodies. A decrease in the area of mast cells and an increase in their number, as well as the number of monoamine oxidase-positive cells in the liver of hamsters of both experimental groups were recorded.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: An increase in the concentration of silicon supplied with drinking water in both cases is reflected in the micromorphological structure of the liver of hamsters. Moreover these changes are more pronounced in the liver of hamsters of the second experimental group.</jats:p>"

Various operational tools and policy guidelines in the UK regulate staffing across different sectors of health and social care. However, frameworks for safe staffing in social work are less developed. This study was based on qualitative and quantitative methodologies and specifically targeted Gateway and Family Intervention child protection teams in Northern Ireland, given the significant caseloads and staffing shortages within these specific team structures. The analysis unveiled systemic issues demanding systemic solutions. Frontline social workers and managers were often contending with overwhelming worker-to-caseload ratios, extensive waitlists and vacancies within teams. This analysis also assisted in defining safe staffing in social work, including service-user safety, and staff well-being and retention. These findings serve as a foundation for evidence-based strategic planning, informing the development and enactment of safer and effective social work policies and legislation in the forthcoming years.</jats:p>"

In the quantitative study, survey questionnaires were distributed to county hospitals, township hospitals, and patients, and a prescription review was performed in township hospitals. In the qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the pharmacy managers, physicians, and patients in county hospitals, township hospitals, and village clinics.

Of the 6,323 patient medication surveys, after excluding 152 patients not involved in medication use, 945 (15.3%) indicated medicine shortages, with half of these attributable to institutions lacking required medicines (52.8%). On average, the prescription qualified rate of 37 township hospitals was 72.2%. Four final themes emerged during the qualitative data analysis: (1) Supply of PHC medicines; (2) Solutions to the shortage of off-list medicines; (3) Appropriateness of PHC medicines list; (4) Pharmacist workforce development and pharmacy services.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The discrepancy between patients’ need for PHC medicine and present medicine supply is noteworthy.

The selective and chronic circumvention of tumor‐infiltrated MDSCs has potential clinical significance for CRC treatment, which unluckily remains a technical challenge. Because tumor hypoxia makes a significant contribution to the recruitment of MDSCs in tumor sites, a dual oxygen‐supplied immunosuppression‐inhibiting nanomedicine (DOIN) is demonstrated for overcoming tumor hypoxia, which achieves selective and long‐term inhibition of intratumoral recruitment of MDSCs. The DOIN is constructed by the encasement of perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) and 4‐methylumbelliferone (4‐MU) into a TME‐responsive amphiphilic polymer. This nanoplatform directly carries oxygen to the tumor region and simultaneously loosens the condensed tumor extracellular matrix for the normalization of tumor vasculature, which selectively remodels the TME toward one adverse to the intratumoral recruitment of MDSCs. Importantly, this nanoplatform offers a long‐acting alleviation of the hypoxic TME, chronically avoiding the comeback of tumor‐infiltrated MDSCs. Consequently, the immunosuppressive TME is relieved, and T cells are successfully proliferated and activated into cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which boosts a systemic immune response and contributes to lasting inhibition of tumor growth with a prolonged survival span of xenograft.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimizing the food supply chain through the integration of financial models and big data analytics presents a transformative strategy for reducing food prices. In an increasingly complex global market, managing procurement effectively is crucial for cost control and price stabilization. Financial models, such as cost-benefit analysis, financial forecasting, and risk assessment, provide valuable insights into procurement decisions, helping organizations anticipate price fluctuations and manage expenses. When combined with big data analytics, these models enable more precise predictions and strategic planning. Big data analytics harnesses vast amounts of information from various sources, including market trends, supplier performance, and consumer behavior. By analyzing this data, organizations can identify patterns, optimize inventory levels, and forecast demand with greater accuracy. This data-driven approach enhances decision-making in procurement, allowing for better negotiation with suppliers, efficient inventory management, and the reduction of wastage. The integration of financial models with big data provides a holistic view of the supply chain, enabling companies to implement dynamic pricing strategies and adjust procurement practices based on real-time insights. This integration helps in minimizing operational costs, improving supply chain efficiency, and ultimately reducing food prices for consumers. For example, predictive analytics can identify potential supply disruptions and adjust procurement strategies proactively, while financial models can evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various sourcing options. Challenges such as data integration, quality, and privacy must be addressed to fully leverage these technologies. Moreover, investment in advanced analytics tools and skilled personnel is essential for successful implementation. In conclusion, the synergy between financial models and big data analytics offers a strategic approach to optimizing the food supply chain. By enhancing procurement practices and leveraging real-time insights, this strategy contributes to reducing food prices and improving overall supply chain efficiency, benefiting both businesses and consumers.\r\nKeywords: Food Supply Chain, Financial Models, Big Data Analytics, Procurement Optimization, Cost Control, Price Reduction, Inventory Management, Predictive Analytics, Supply Chain Efficiency.</jats:p>"

However, the high cost of fibers greatly limits its widespread application. This paper proposes the use of untreated low-cost polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers and polyethylene (PE) fibers to develop a low-cost, high-performance SHGC. Axial compression and axial tension tests were conducted on the SHGC with different PE fiber volume fractions (1%, 1.5%, and 2%) and different PVA fiber replacement ratios (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) to investigate the hybrid effects of fibers with different surface properties and to reveal the mechanism of fiber hybridization on the mechanical behavior of SHGCs. The results show that increasing the PE fiber volume fraction improves the compressive and tensile ductility of the SHGC while increasing the PVA fiber replacement rate impacts the strength indicators positively due to the good interface effect formed between its hydrophilic surface and the matrix. When the PVA fiber replacement ratio is 100%, the compressive strength (93.4 MPa) of the SHGC is the highest, with a 21.1% increase compared to the control group. However, the tensile strength shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase in the PVA fiber replacement ratio, reaching the highest at a 25% replacement ratio, with a 12.5% increase compared to the control group. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental performance of the SHGC indicates that a 25% PVA fiber replacement ratio results in the best overall economic benefits and relatively low actual costs, although the effect of fiber hybridization on carbon emission indicators is not significant. This paper provides new ideas and a theoretical basis for designing low-cost SHGCs.</jats:p>"

The present study aims to conduct water accounting in the groundwater-depleted districts of Haryana and Punjab, India, analysing the potential irrigation water savings achievable through the implementation of efficient management techniques in these selected districts. The study area encompasses Kaithal and Karnal districts in Haryana and Patiala and Sangrur districts in Punjab with water availability assessment for 2015. Results showed that there is a mismatch between the annual groundwater pumped and replenishable groundwater recharge in all selected districts indicating a need for improved water management. Adjusting the timing of rice sowing to align with the onset of the rainy season can significantly save water and reduce groundwater extraction. For instance, delaying rice transplanting from May 21st to June 15th can reduce crop water demand by 10.89%. Similarly, transplanting rice on June 15th can reduce water demand by 9.03%, 6.23%, 4.31%, and 2.46% compared to transplanting on May 26th, May 31st, June 5th, and June 10th, respectively. Shifting of a rice-wheat cropping system to a maize-wheat system can substantially decrease crop water demand. Replacing rice with maize can result in a 54.66% reduction in crop water demand per hectare.</jats:p>",

In this setup, the supplier directly sells to customers and also through a capital‐constrained retailer. We investigate a unique financing approach involving a blend of bank loans and supplier equity investment to support the retailer's operational (procurement and marketing) activities. Analyzing the equilibrium strategies under both symmetric and asymmetric information settings yields intriguing insights. In the case of symmetric information, we find that the retailer's equilibrium order quantity decreases with the potential market size under hybrid financing, contrary to traditional notions. When asymmetric information is present, a higher acceptance of supplier equity investment by the retailer tends to lead to order quantity distortion downward, increasing signaling costs. Furthermore, a greater proportion of supplier equity investment prompts the retailer to order more products, ultimately boosting profits for both the retailer and supplier. This suggests that supplier equity investment can enhance supply chain efficiency and alleviate the double marginalization effect.</jats:p>"

With the popularization of urban cables, the low-resistance grounding system gradually replaced arc suppression coils in some large cities. Compared to arc suppression coils, the low-resistance grounding system features simplicity and reliability. However, when a high-resistance grounding fault occurs, a lower amount of fault characteristics cannot trigger the zero-sequence protection action, so this type of fault will exist for a long time, which poses a threat to the power grid. To address this kind of problem, in this paper, a hybrid grounding system combining the low-resistance protection device and fully controlled power module is proposed. During a low-resistance grounding fault, the fault isolation is achieved through the zero-sequence current protection with the low-resistance grounding system itself, while, during a high-resistance grounding fault, the reliable arc extinction is achieved by regulating the neutral-point voltage with a fully controlled power module. Firstly, this paper introduces the principles, topology, and coordination control of the hybrid grounding system for active voltage arc extinction. Subsequently, a dual-loop-based control method is proposed to suppress the fault phase voltage. Furthermore, a faulty feeder selection method based on the Kepler optimization algorithm and convolutional neural network is proposed for the timely removal of permanent faults. Lastly, the simulation and HIL-based emulated results verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it became imperative to effectively manage the existing groundwater resources to fulfill the anticipated demand for potable water. To achieve this goal, an analysis involving seven spatial parameters: geomorphology, land use/land cover, slope, lineament density, drainage density, soil types, and geology was conducted. These parameters were examined using a combination of geographic information system (GIS)-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and cumulative score index (CSI) techniques to delineate potential zones for groundwater recharge. The AHP methodology was employed to assign relative weights to the thematic layers and their corresponding features, reflecting their importance. The AHP results were integrated using a weighted linear combination within a GIS environment to generate the groundwater recharge potential map. Further, the CSI was used to reclassify the composite groundwater recharge potential map. The resultant map revealed three zones which were classified into high, moderate, and low potential zones founded on the CSI approximation. About 98.56 km2 (8.28%) of the study area is categorized as having low potential, 803.77 km2 (67.54%) falls within the moderate potential zone and 287.71 km2 (24.18%) falls in the high potential zone.</jats:p>",

One of the major challenges is the quick and accurate detection of leaks, which can lead to water loss, infrastructure damage, and environmental hazards. Many existing leak detection methods are ineffective, especially in complex and aging pipeline networks. If these limitations are not overcome, it can result in a chain of infrastructure failures, exacerbating damage, increasing repair costs, and causing water shortages and public health risks. The leak issue is further complicated by increasing urban water demand, climate change, and population growth. Therefore, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that can overcome the limitations of traditional methodologies and leverage sophisticated data analysis and machine learning technologies. In this study, we propose a reliable and advanced method for detecting leaks in water pipes using a framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with autoencoders. The framework is designed to manage the temporal dimension of time-series data and is enhanced with ensemble learning techniques, making it sensitive to subtle signals indicating leaks while robustly dealing with noise signals. Through the integration of signal processing and pattern recognition, the machine learning-based model addresses the leak detection problem, providing an intelligent system that enhances environmental protection and resource management. The proposed approach greatly enhances the accuracy and precision of leak detection, making essential contributions in the field and offering promising prospects for the future of sustainable water management strategies.</jats:p>"

This paper used a deep learning-based Deep Prophet memory neural network forecasting approach, which combined temporal, historical, trend, and seasonal data, to develop a more accurate model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate prophet with a long short-term memory network (LSTM) for demand forecasting. At first, the data may be obtained here, and linear clipping data normalization (LCDN) was used for pre-processing. After that, the bivariate wrapper forward elimination approach may be used to extract the features. The Sequential Bayesian Inference Optimization (SBIO) approach is used to choose the specialized features from the retrieved characteristics. Ultimately, the demand for the items was examined after the Deep Prophet Memory Neural Network (DPMNN) approach was modified. Using M5 Forecasting and Predict Future Sales datasets in a Python context, the built system is used and evaluated. Numerous exhaustive and comparative trials show that the suggested demand forecasting technique performs much better than state-of-the-art research.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this labeling analysis is to inform on the daily elemental iron (with or without vitamin C) supply provided by multivitamin–multimineral supplements sold online by Amazon in Western and Southern Europe (amazon.es®, amazon.de®, amazon.it®, and amazon.fr®). Results. We identified 298 iron-containing multivitamin–multimineral preparations sold by Amazon marketplaces: 153 preparations sourced from amazon.de®, 68 from amazon.fr®, 54 from amazon.it®, and 23 from amazon.es®. The daily iron dose provided by these preparations was 14 [5–14] mg (median and interquartile range), with no differences among the marketplaces. Approximately 90% (n = 265) of the preparations contained ferrous iron. Moreover, 85% (n = 253) of the preparations were fortified with vitamin C in a dose of 80 [40–100] mg daily. Conclusions. The median supply of iron (about 14 mg) and vitamin C (80 mg) in iron-containing multivitamin–multimineral preparations offered on Amazon platforms in Western and Southern Europe falls below that currently recommended for iron deficiency in review articles, namely 100 mg of iron and 500 mg of vitamin C per day. The iron supply of iron-containing multivitamin–multimineral preparations falls also below the dose of 30–60 mg advocated to prevent iron deficiency in menstruating women.</jats:p>"

The study uses an exhaustive survey of 350 engineering company representatives to reveal the complex interactions between different qualities of supply chain systems-on-time data and inventory practice efficiency. By applying advanced techniques of regression analysis, the authors worked out three hypotheses and exhaustively tested them to find out the impact of digital adaptivity, dynamism and flexibility on both the visibility of information and inventory management effectiveness. This study has many interesting findings. First, this paper found strong positive connections between Digital Adaptability Supply Chain and Digital Flexibility Supply Chain in terms of both information visibility and inventory management effectiveness. These results argue that to effectively manage inventory levels with optimal information transparency across its network of links, companies must establish supply chain systems that can adapt to change and embrace flexibility. Digital Agility Supply Chain did not show any significant relationships with these variables, but it could be important. We need to study its nuances until we know how it is going to affect supply chain performance indices. This paper encourages investment in new supply chain technologies that will help all the engineering companies in Jordan be more adaptable and flexible. It also calls for adding data analysis capabilities across the company directly into supply chain processes through real-time tracking solutions. These solutions will make it easier to see and give decision-makers quick, reliable information about inventory management practices and agreement practices. By incorporating these recommendations, all Jordanian engineering companies can enhance their supply capacity and appropriate inventory management procedures to compete in the evolving marketplace now finally taking effect.</jats:p>"

Employing multidimensional fixed effects, moderated effects, and threshold regression models, the analysis yields several key findings. First, an inverted “U” shaped relationship exists between farmers’ non-agricultural income and sustainable food supply security, where food security is initially promoted but subsequently suppressed as income increases. Agricultural technological progress significantly enhances sustainable food supply security, and mechanism analysis confirms a moderating effect of technological progress on the relationship between non-agricultural income and food security. Second, regional heterogeneity analysis shows that the inverted “U” shaped inflection point for farmers’ non-agricultural income occurs earliest in the western region and main food-producing areas, with the strongest impact observed in the eastern region and main non-food-producing areas. Agricultural technological progress more significantly promotes sustainable development in the central and western regions and main food-producing areas. Third, threshold testing reveals a non-linear double threshold effect of agricultural technological progress on sustainable food supply security, with non-agricultural income thresholds at 6.759 and 9.427. Beyond these thresholds, the promotion effect of technological progress exhibits a “flat-steep-flat” S-shaped fluctuation. These findings suggest a need for a balanced approach to managing farmers’ non-agricultural income growth, maintaining incentives for sustainable food production and increasing financial and technological investments in central and western regions to secure China’s long-term food supply security.</jats:p>"

To reduce emissions and improve organisational efficiency, adopting the net-zero concept is a prevalent trend in today’s highly competitive global business environment. Governments and stakeholders are pressuring the manufacturing sector to use natural resources efficiently and reduce environmental impacts. As a result, the manufacturing industry is focusing on cleaner production using net-zero practices. This study aims to identify and analyse the interaction among the drivers of net-zero adoption in the MSC. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), a list of drivers was recognised. To validate these drivers, we conducted an empirical study with 173 respondents from the Indian manufacturing industry. Further, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to weigh the nonlinear effect of drivers. Fuzzy interpretive structural modelling (F-ISM) was used to identify the interaction relationships among the drivers and construct a hierarchical structure among these identified drivers. The fuzzy matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to the classification (F-MICMAC) method was used to categorise these drivers into driving and dependent categories. The outcomes of ANN show that Environmental predictors (100%) emerged as the most significant drivers, followed by Economic drivers (60.38%) and Technological drivers (59.05%). This study is a valuable resource for academia and industry professionals, providing essential insights into how adopting net zero facilitates the manufacturing industry’s ability to achieve net zero across the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Appropriate microbiological techniques are needed to ensure the acceptability of rainwater for potable uses. Bacteriophage has been widely used as a viral indicator in water studies, and its concentration is an important step when sampling several litres of water. Skimmed-milk flocculation (SMF) is a simple method for viral recovery, and its efficiency has already been assessed for some viruses. However, there are only a few records on bacteriophage recovery using SMF, and none with PhiX-174 coliphage, an important surrogate for human enteroviruses. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMF technique on the concentration of PhiX-174 coliphage in rainwater. 3 L of rainwater samples were artificially spiked with PhiX-174 and were concentrated to 10 mL volumes by SMF. The phage enumeration on the concentrated samples were evaluated by a standard double layer plaque assay. From the 6 samples tested, the average recovery was 22.8 ± 15.2%, ranging from 10.8 to 52.8%. This is the first time that SMF is applied for PhiX-174 coliphage recovery, and in rainwater. Therefore, SMF is a cost-effective method that can effectively be used to recover bacteriophage PhiX-174 in water samples.</jats:p>",

Understanding its fluoride content and health implications is crucial for water resource management. This study investigated the quaternary aquifer in Suzhou, China, collecting and analyzing 49 groundwater samples. Thermodynamic simulation, multivariate statistical analysis, and health risk assessment models were employed to determine fluoride concentration characteristics, hydrochemical controlling mechanisms, and noncarcinogenic risks. Results revealed an average fluoride concentration of 0.89 mg/L, with 26.5% of samples exceeding the Grade III groundwater quality standard. High-fluoride groundwater (&amp;gt;1 mg/L) exhibited spatial heterogeneity and was predominantly of the Na-Mg-HCO3 hydrochemical type. Multivariate analysis and thermodynamics simulations indicated that water–rock interactions (e.g., silicate mineral weathering and fluorite dissolution) governed groundwater hydrochemistry. Fluoride primarily originated from fluoride-bearing mineral dissolution, while negative cation exchange and precipitation of calcite and dolomite enhanced fluoride enrichment. pH had minimal impact on fluoride concentrations under weakly alkaline conditions. Health risk assessment suggested that fluoride in shallow groundwater posed a higher noncarcinogenic risk to children than adults via ingestion. These findings provide valuable insights for regional groundwater resource management.</jats:p>",

Here, a dual gelation strategy under gravity‐enhanced orientation is proposed to construct super‐strong bacterial cellulose (BC) aerogel fiber using BC as the matrix material and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (HCNT) as the photothermal conversion material. Under the assistance of orientation property and dual network structure with soft–hard synergy, the silanized BC/HCNT (SBT) aerogel fiber has rich network, tensile strength up to 26.0 MPa, flexibilityand knittability. Thanks to the enhanced network backbone, after the introduction of the phase change material eicosane in SBT aerogel fiber (SBTE), the SBTE fiber achieves high enthalpy of 105 J g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, low leakage, storage stabilityand super‐strong and tough mechanical properties of 23.9 MPa and 8.7 MJ m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, while maintaining flexibility, knittabilityand hydrophobicity. The textile woven by SBTE fiber also exhibits a long‐lasting heat supply capacity at low temperatures and under real‐world conditions. Therefore, the finely designed SBTE fiber has the potential to be used in solar‐driven wearable heat supply textiles in cold weather.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogen energy has made significant progress as one of the technological pathways that can facilitate the green transformation of various sectors, including the chemical industry, steel production, transportation, and power generation. However, areas with high demand for hydrogen are typically located thousands of kilometers away from large-scale production facilities. Hydrogen transported from the most cost-competitive large production sites to areas that lack hydrogen resources requires converting gaseous hydrogen into a high-density liquid. Thus, global market trade is important for hydrogen carriers in long-distance and large-scale transportation. In this study, liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and ammonia (NH3), which are hydrogen-based energy carriers, are analyzed and compared in terms of economic costs, energy efficiency, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It has been demonstrated that the LH2 supply chain is more energy-efficient and has higher CO2 emissions compared to the NH3 supply chain. Furthermore, this study shows that the levelized cost of hydrogen transportation (LCoHT) delivered from Australia to Ningbo, China, is lower for NH3 (19.95 yuan/kg-H2) compared to LH2 (22.83 yuan/kg-H2). Meanwhile, the LCoHT for the two supply chains is in a similar range (27.82 yuan/kg-H2 and 21.53 yuan/kg-H2 for LH2 and NH3, respectively) from Norway to Ningbo, China. The impacts of important parameters on the LCoHT, energy efficiency, and CO2 emissions of the LH2/NH3 supply chain are also considered through a sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a bi-objective mixed integer programming model to improve the preparedness of the emergency supply network. The maximization of connectivity reliability and relief is taken as the objective function as the design perspectives were inclined towards prioritizing human survival over cost. The number and location of storage points, the preset level and the pre-matching of demand nodes with their supply storage points are determined based on this. Then, applicability is evaluated through numerical examples, and critical parameters are demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Finally, practicality is evaluated through practical examples. The results demonstrate that the method in this paper designs an emergency supply network with high reliability and relief level. The reliability of the supply network is improved by 42.3% and the rescue level reaches 96.6% compared with the pre-optimization period. Results may provide theoretical support for urban pre-earthquake preparedness and can help traffic planners and local governments formulate better earthquake prevention strategies.</jats:p>",

Breaking the cold chain directly reduces tuna quality. To overcome these challenges, an effective and efficient cold chain management method that focuses on the aspects of risk, performance, value chain, and sustainability is required. This study aimed to analyze the methods used in cold chain management and develop an integrated framework to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of sustainable cold supply chain management in tuna agro-industries. This study uses a systematic literature review (SLR) approach. Scientific article search databases using Scopus, Google Scholar, and others in 2013-2023. The selection resulted in 86 articles for further studies. The results of this study show that there are still very few cold chain studies in the tuna agro-industry. Cold chain studies on risk, performance, and sustainability aspects are dominated by quantitative methods with the following percentages: 76%, 58%, and 92%, respectively. By contrast, studies on the value chain aspect are dominated by descriptive qualitative methods (89%). This study found that the tuna cold chain problem in Indonesia is a soft problem on the upstream side and a hard problem on the downstream side. These two properties are rarely considered in single cold chain studies. The properties of the soft and hard systems were studied using qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively. In future research, we will develop an integrated framework for tuna agro-industry cold chain management in terms of performance, risk, value chain, and sustainability by considering the soft and hard aspects of the cold chain from onboard the ship to the consumer.</jats:p>"

Alberta, Canada, addressed this by integrating 1000+ health systems and implementing Connect Care (CC), a Clinical Information System (CIS), to enhance patient safety and care coordination. In 2020, the Primary Health Care Integration Network (PHCIN) released the Home to Hospital to Home (H2H2H) Transitions Guideline and metrics to improve patient outcomes and system integration. \r\nApproachThis study examines provincial data on H2H2H transitions measures from acute care hospitals using CC between April 1, 2022, and October 31, 2023, to assess transitions and support improvement efforts. CC data assesses transition components, including confirming primary care providers at hospital discharge, utilizing the LACE Readmission Risk Index, and ensuring timely discharge summary (DS) signoffs. It links with administrative data to evaluate post-discharge outcomes like primary care physician follow-up, unplanned readmissions, and Emergency Department (ED) visits.\r\nResults47 CC-implemented sites show nearly 80% discharges identified a primary care provider; less than 5% incorporated the LACE index in DS. About 90-93% of DS were signed within 24-72 hours. Approximately 62% of moderate-risk and 55% of high-risk discharges received timely follow-up. Readmission and ED visit rates within 7-30 days varied from 2-8% and 5-11% respectively.\r\nConclusionIn conclusion, adopting CC and H2H2H transition metrics facilitates integrated care measurement, highlighting the need for risk index inclusion and high-risk discharge follow-up for improved patient transitions.

This paper analyzes the gate charge degradation in multi-chip IGBT modules after thermal cycling, which can be used to evaluate the operational state of these modules. Furthermore, to delve into the electrical response of a gate drive circuit caused by local damage within the IGBT module, an RLC model incorporating parasitic parameters of the gate drive circuit is established, and a sensitivity analysis of the peak current in the gate charge circuit is provided. Additionally, in the experimental circuit, an open sample of an IGBT module with partial bond wires lifted off is used to simulate actual faults. The analysis and experimental results indicate that the peak current of the gate charge is closely related to L and C. The significant deviation in the gate current, influenced by the partial bond wires lift-off, can provide a basis for the development of predictive methods for IGBT modules.</jats:p>"

It is use to change the initial phase period of fuel injection into diesel cylinders for each fuel injection line. The developed hydraulic corrector is a body with a movable rod with an annular groove in the central part. The movement of the rod occurs with the help of a power electromagnet. The hydraulic correc-tor itself is a blocking element and blocks the fuel supply to the injector for a certain period. The duration of this period depends on the need to change the injection start time. Its installation does not require significant structural changes to the fuel system. Location – near the nozzle. To determine the efficiency of this hydraulic corrector, it is necessary to con-duct a complex of non-motorized and motorized studies. In the course of these studies, the advantage of using an experi-mental fuel supply system with a distribution fuel pump without a mechanical centrifugal clutch for advanced fuel injec-tion was determined. According to the results of comparative motorless studies, there is an improvement in the parame-ters of fuel supply in a wide range of changes in the frequency of rotation of the camshaft of the injection pump. There is a decrease in the fuel injection phase by 20…30%, an increase in the maximum injection pressure by 30…40 MPa, an in-crease in the average injection pressure by 10…20%. In addition, the use of this hydraulic corrector allows you to improve the quality of the transient acceleration mode of the 6ChN13/11.5 diesel engine by reducing the transition time to a new speed mode and improving the parameters of the air supply system. In particular, the duration of the stabilization of the rotation frequencies of the crankshaft and the rotor of the turbocompressor in the new stable mode of operation is reduced by an average of 10-12%, there is no clear read-justment of the operating parameters; a decrease in the normalization time of the turbocharger rotation frequency by 0.1s, a decrease in the temperature of the exhaust gases by 25°C and an increase in the boost pressure by 30% with an increase in the air supply to 540 m3/h were noted. The obtained results convincingly confirm the effectiveness and expe-diency of using the proposed hydraulic corrector for the modernization of the fuel systems of the auto-tractor diesel en-gine without significant structural changes in its fuel system.

The actual distribution network has few samples of power supply risk and it is difficult to identify the power supply risk by using conventional deep learning methods. In order to achieve high accuracy of self-provided power supply risk identification with small samples, this paper proposes a combination of transfer learning, convolutional block attention module (CBAM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the risk of self-provided power supply in an active distribution network. Firstly, in order to be able to further identify whether or not a risk will be caused based on completing the identification of the faulty line, we propose that it is necessary to identify whether or not the captive power supply on the faulty line is in operation. Second, in order to achieve high-precision identification and high-efficiency feature extraction, we propose to embed the CBAM into a CNN to form a CBAM-CNN model, so as to achieve high-efficiency feature extraction and high-precision risk identification. Finally, the use of transfer learning is proposed to solve the problem of low risk identification accuracy due to the small number of actual fault samples. Simulation experiments show that compared with other methods, the proposed method has the highest recognition accuracy and the best effect, and the risk recognition accuracy of active distribution network backup power is high in the case of fewer samples.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the response characteristics of root morphology, plant physiology, and P and K uptake and utilization efficiency to different supplies of P and K. Two local conventional rice varieties (Shennong 265 and Liaojing 294) were used as experimental materials across four treatments, including HPHK (sufficient P and K supply), HPLK (sufficient P supply under low K levels), LPHK (sufficient K supply under low P levels) and LPLK (low P and K levels) in a hydroponic setting. The results showed that HPHK and HPLK significantly decreased the acid phosphatase activity of leaves and roots from full heading to filling stages when compared to LPHK and LPLK. Sufficient supply of P or K significantly increased the accumulation of P and K (aboveground, leaves, stem sheath, and whole plant) and root morphological parameters (root length, root surface area, total root volume, and tips) during major growth stages when compared to LP or LK levels. HPHK was significantly higher than other treatments in terms of dry weight and the root activity at the main growth stage, P and K uptake rates in nutrient solutions at various stages, related P and K efficiency at the maturity stage, yield, effective panicle number, and grain number per panicle. In addition, the effect of HPHK on the above indexes were significantly greater than those of single sufficient supply of P or K. In conclusion, HPHK can improve plant configuration, increase plant P and K absorption and root activity, and increase rice yield and related P and K utilization efficiency.</jats:p>"

Under the combined influence of climate change and human activities, the runoff of the basin decreases noticeably. The Mann–Kendall trend test, the Hurst index, cumulative anomaly, and wavelet analysis were used to analyze the runoff evolution characteristics of the Kuye River, and the contributions of climate change and human activities to the runoff reduction were quantitatively separated by the slope-changing ratio of the cumulative quantity. The results showed that the runoff decreased significantly from 1970 to 2020, and there was an obvious abrupt change in 1996, while the change trends in precipitation and evaporation were not significant. The contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff reduction were 22.71 and 77.29%, respectively, and human activities have become the dominant factor in runoff variations. Coal mining and the implementation of soil and water conservation measures are considered to be the main human activities contributing to the reduction in runoff. In particular, mining activities reduce groundwater recharge to rivers, which provides a profound understanding of the effect of human activities in mining areas on runoff variation.</jats:p>",

However, relevant studies ignore the influence mechanism of altruistic preferences of enterprises on green dismantling technology in supply chains. Driven by filling this theoretical gap, this paper firstly integrates reciprocal altruism theory and the Stackalberg game method and constructs a construction and demolition waste (CDW) recycling supply chain system consisting of a recycler and a remanufacturer, in which enterprises’ altruistic preferences are considered. The main theoretical outcomes of this paper are as follows. (1) In the case of unilateral altruism, enterprises’ altruistic preference behaviors help in increasing the green dismantling technological level and the amount of CDW recycling. Under the mutual altruism model, the influence of the recycler’s altruistic preference degree on the amount of CDW recycled hinges on the remanufacturer’s altruistic preference degree. (2) The utility of the enterprises and the green dismantling technological level are optimized under the mutual altruism model. (3) In a system of unequal power, unilateral “goodwill” by the follower will have a negative effect on their own interests; the leader plays a crucial role in facilitating equal cooperation and realizing win–win situations. This paper enriches the reciprocal altruism theory in waste management. It also helps in providing guidance for the recycler and remanufacturer in making operational decisions.</jats:p>"

SMEs can mitigate these disruptions by collaborating with their supply chain partners. This study presents a framework for how modeling simulation and artificial intelligence can aid in collaboration to support SMEs in mitigating the operational impacts of environmental supply chain disruptions. It indicates that partnerships can assist SMEs in creating contingency plans, sharing resources, and building resilience. It identifies key benefits of collaboration for SMEs and different strategies that SMEs can use to mitigate the disruptions due to environmental issues.

A discrete pulse switching control method is introduced, and the input voltage and output current are sampled to calculate the primary target phase shift angle of the DAB converter, followed by the inner phase shift angle, while the secondary phase shift angle is rapidly adjusted by the voltage feedback. In order to meet the requirements of effective control and safe power supply in harsh environments, the system parameters are designed by comprehensively considering the control performance and intrinsically safe requirements. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DAB converter exhibits rapid dynamic response and intrinsic operation safety.</jats:p>",

This article advances this research by making three significant contributions. Firstly, it offers a more succinct formalization of the turnover process, improving pedagogical clarity. Secondly, it reinterprets the significance of set-free money capital within the modern credit money system using post-Keynesian endogenous money theory, linking production directly to the money supply. Lastly, it demonstrates through simulations that production structure influences the periodic fluctuations of set-free money capital at the macro level, affecting the money supply. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: B51, E32, E51 </jats:p>",

The new blended fat stimulated feed products with three-batch samples (BFSFP1, BFSFP2, BFSFP3) were developed. Barley grain samples (n = 3) and canola meal samples (n = 3) were obtained from Canadian Feed Research Center. Total rumen degradable and undegradable protein and carbohydrate supply to dairy cows were determined using the updated Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. The treatment design was a one-way structure. The experimental design was a CRD with feed treatments as a fixed effect. The data were analyzed using the Mixed model procedure of SAS. Tukey method was used for mean separation. The results showed that compared with commercially available energy-rich and protein-rich feeds, the BFSFP had less (P &amp;lt; 0.05) total degradable protein supply to dairy cows (TRDP: 17.0 vs. 23.9, 7.4%DM) and total undegradable protein supply (TRUP: 13.9 vs. 17.8, 5.1%DM) than canola meal and greater than barley grain. For carbohydrate degradable and undegradable supply to dairy cows, the results showed that the BFSFP had greater (P &amp;lt; 0.05) total degradable carbohydrate supply to dairy cows (TRUC) than canola meal and less than barley grain (TRDC: 26.0 vs. 20.8, 56.6%DM, respectively).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the world is in turmoil, climate and environmental problems are prominent, the import and export of fresh agricultural products are restricted, etc. The impact of the growing demand for fresh agricultural products and healthy lifestyle choices, and fresh agricultural products are essential for people’s daily life, which are perishable, fragile, seasonal, and other unstable factors. Therefore, when the fresh produce supply chain faces various pressures and difficulties, how to enhance the resilience of the supply chain against various problems and risks with flexible and multi-dimensional strategies and methods has become the focus of extensive attention. This kind of problem is a typical contradictory problem, and previous studies have failed to achieve good results. In this paper, based on extenics, we are able to one-dimensionalise the multi-dimensional contradictory problems and multi-dimensionalise the one-dimensional contradictory problems to solve such problems in a scientific and effective way. Firstly, taking fresh agricultural products supply chain enterprise M as the research object, we constructed the fresh agricultural products supply chain enterprise toughness system and identified the toughness state of each index. Secondly, we found the low-evaluation toughness indexes that need to be solved and constructed a extension model of incompatible problems of enterprise toughness. Thirdly, we analysed the objectives and conditions of toughness incompatible problems of fresh agricultural products supply chain enterprises numerically and quantitatively, and then, with the objective of toughness improvement, we analyzed the correlation of the condition basic-elements of incompatible problems and carried out extension transformations. Again, the objectives and conditions of the incompatible problems of fresh produce supply chain enterprises are analysed numerically and quantitatively, and with toughness enhancement as the objective, the correlation analysis and extension transformation of the condition basic-elements of the incompatible problems are implemented to generate the set of toughness enhancement strategies that can solve the incompatible problems in a multidimensional and scientific way. Finally, the optimal toughness enhancement strategies are selected through the superiority evaluation and composed into a new strategy to enhance the toughness of the fresh produce supply chain. Combined with extenics calculations and screening, a new strategy for supply chain resilience enhancement of fresh agricultural products was finally formed. The existing problems are solved from six aspects: product supply type, product demand, product supply efficiency, human resource quantity, production and processing equipment, and logistics guarantee ability. It provides a certain reference significance for the fresh agricultural products supply chain toughness enhancement, and helps enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness and sustainability through the enhancement of toughness.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of extra supplementation of a combination of functional amino acids (FAA, +20% Threonine, Methionine, and Tryptophan) preventively (pre-sanitary challenge), curatively (post-sanitary challenge) or both on the performance of growing pigs challenged with Salmonella typhimurium (ST) and poor housing conditions. Male pigs [n = 60; body weight (BW) = 21.7 ± 4,6 kg] were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments, with a basal AA profile fed throughout the experimental period (Control; NRC, 2012) or a functional AA profile (FAA+; +20% Trip:Lys, Tre:Lys, and Met+Cys:Lys) fed only before the SC (FAA Preventive), after the SC (FAA Curative), or throughout the experimental period (FAA Continuous). On d 0, after a 7-d adaptation period (d -7 to 0, pre-SC), all pigs were inoculated with ST (2 x 109 CFU/mL). Manure from a commercial pig farm was spread on the solid concrete floor, and the room was not cleaned during the experiment for 28 d (d 0 to 28, SC period). Pigs were housed in groups, and diets were supplied using 5 Precision Feeders. Body composition was determined using DXA on d 0 and 28 and protein and lipid deposition was calculated. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, with diets considered a fixed effect and initial BW as a covariate. Each pig was considered the experimental unit, and means were compared using Tukey’s test. There was no effect of providing FAA before the sanitary challenge on performance, indicating that the control diet was adequate for the phase requirements. All pigs tested positive for fecal ST shedding. A 1.2°C increase in rectal temperature was observed on d 1 (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and rectal temperature remained elevated throughout the first week (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The control treatment had a higher rectal temperature than the preventive treatment (P = 0.02). There was an increase in serum haptoglobin on d 7 (P &amp;lt; 0.01). A reduction in albumin on d 7 and 28 compared with the pre-sanitary challenge period was observed (P = 0.02), and pigs in the control group had a greater value compared with the curative and continuous groups (P &amp;lt; 0.01). A heavier final BW (P = 0.02), daily gain (P = 0.02), and feed efficiency (P = 0.01) were observed in the continuous FAA treatment compared with the control, whereas preventive and curative FAA showed intermediate values (Table 1). Providing FAA through a combination of preventive period with curative supply during a chronic sanitary challenge was able to positively modulate the immune response and performance of pigs at the beginning of the growth phase.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Reservoirs are ubiquitous water infrastructure, providing functional capability to manage, and often mitigate, hydrological variability across space and time. The presence and operation of a reservoir control the downstream flow regime, such that in many locations understanding reservoir operations is crucial to understanding the hydrological functioning of a catchment. Despite many advances in modelling reservoir operations, inclusion of reservoirs in large-scale hydrological modelling remains challenging, particularly when the number of reservoirs is large and data access is limited. Here we design a set of simple reservoir operating rules (with only two calibrated parameters) focused on simulating small water supply reservoirs across large scales with various types of open-access data (i.e. catchment attributes and flows at downstream gauges). We integrate our rules into a national-scale hydrological model of Great Britain and compare hydrological simulations with and without the new reservoir component. Our simple reservoir operating rules significantly increase model performance in reservoir-impacted catchments, particularly when the rules are calibrated individually at each downstream gauge. We also test the feasibility of using transfer functions (which transform reservoir and catchment attributes into operating rule parameters) to identify a nationally consistent calibration. This works well in ∼ 50 % of the catchments, while nuances in individual reservoir operations limit performance in others. We suggest that our approach should provide a lower benchmark for simulations in catchments containing water supply reservoirs and that more complex methods should only be considered where they outperform our simple approach.\n                    </jats:p>"

Second, the topological structure and mathematical model of co‐phase power comprehensive compensation device (CPCD) are put forward based on the principles of V/v transformer and ESVC, and the operation mode of CPCD in multiple scenarios is designed. Then the strategy of CPCD with double closed loop control is analysed: corresponding compensation mode is selected according to negative‐sequence unbalance degree and expected power factor value. In this strategy, the compensated current output by ESVC is taken as the quantity of external loop control, and the rotation angle of ESVC is taken as the quantity of internal loop control to realize double‐closed loop control of CPCD. Finally, the comprehensive CPCD compensation model is built on the simulation platform and validated the accuracy of the mathematical model and the effectiveness of the control strategy.</jats:p>",

However, under the background of rapid urbanization, linear large cities, with their unique spatial forms and high-density population agglomerations, have brought special challenges for the planning and management of urban public green spaces. This study takes Lanzhou, a typical representative of high-density linear large cities in China, as a case study. Based on the improvement of the traditional Gaussian Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method (G2SFCA), combined with the Gini coefficient and the Lorentz curve, the social equity and spatial equity of UPGS supply-demand in the central urban area of Lanzhou were evaluated at the city and district scales. Meanwhile, the areas with shortage of UPGS supply-demand were accurately identified as the key areas for future optimization. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences in the equity of UPGS supply-demand in the linear large Lanzhou at the social and spatial levels, and most UPGS resources are enjoyed by a few people; (2) The spatial accessibility of UPGSs has an obvious “string of beads” distribution Characteristics, and the areas with high accessibility are mainly concentrated along rivers; (3) The equity of UPGS supply-demand exhibits a spatial gradient effect, which is characterized by a circle distribution. From the inside to the outside, it is as follows: good supply—dense population, good supply—sparse population, supply shortage—dense population, supply shortage—sparse population. Finally, based on the concept of “progressive micro-regeneration” and the Location Allocation model (LA), the optimal sites for new UPGSs were determined, maximizing the equity of UPGS supply-demand. This provides a practical reference for relevant management departments to optimize park layouts in the future.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of hydraulic transient (HT) phenomenon on the flow of the main water main in Moamba village water supply system. The following parameters were checked: (i) physical parameters in terms of Nodes (N), by length of each connection; stretches, by defining the pipe wall, internal diameter, celerity and suction cups; and (ii) the profile of the raw water pipeline, through manual excavation, water supply time in working hours, and checking the operation of the pumps, with the aim of analyzing the pressures acting on the system. Simulations were carried out using Allievi software. The results of the physical parameters showed celerity with maximum pressures in the permanent regime at the inlet of the pipe of around 97.64mca, and a minimum of 5.50mca at the outlet; no HT, the overpressures were close to the pressure line in relation to the permanent regime, however, there was a single case of -21.08mca representing a risk to the pipe. As a solution, suction cups, pressure regulating valves and hydropneumatic reservoirs were tested, which proved to be effective in smoothing out the pressure envelopes, but did not solve the problem of underpressures operating below the water vapor pressure.</jats:p>"

Companies that hold central positions within supply chains may leverage their strategic location to reduce information asymmetry, enhancing their ability to engage in sustainable activities. However, research on the role of supply chain network centrality in M&amp;A decisions remains underexplored. This study aims to empirically examine whether and how centrality in supply chain networks enhances the likelihood and success of M&amp;A activities, contributing to both theory and practice in corporate strategy. In particular, we construct a novel measure of firm centrality within the supply chain and utilize panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies spanning 2008 to 2021. Our findings reveal that the central position of supply chain networks promotes the probability and frequency of mergers and acquisitions. Mechanism analysis reveals that gaining information advantages and relieving financial constraints are two key channels through which the supply chain network promotes mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, the effects are more pronounced for firms with non-state ownership, with closer proximity to customers or suppliers, with higher operational risk, and with growth and decline phases. A series of robustness tests support these results, including alternative measures, alternative estimating methods, and sub-sample tests. Moreover, central supply chain companies exhibit better long-term financial performance following mergers and acquisitions. This paper enriches our understanding of the roles of supply chain networks in firms’ mergers and acquisitions and holds important practical implications for companies seeking to achieve sustainable and long-term development.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansion was used to describe the non-homogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity while modeling the simulation model. In the solution process of the optimization model, typical algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GAs) might encounter problems such as low search efficiency. To address the challenges, this paper adopted the Rat Swarm Optimizer (RSO) algorithm to solve the optimization model. Compared with GA, the RSO's average relative error of identify the source position was 1.55% and the source strength was 2.61%, both of which were better than 7.91 and 97.9%, respectively, in GA. To solve the problem of a shortage of computational resources caused by repeated and massive calls to the simulation model, this paper considered the use of a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model. According to the results, the BPNN surrogate model had a high fitting accuracy to the simulation model, with R2 of 0.9906 and RMSE of 9.2446 g/day. The identification of groundwater contamination sources based on BPNN and RSO achieved excellent results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the impact of tariff escalation on multinational suppliers relocating their production capacity to tariff-preferential regions with unreliable supply caused by low-production technology. We build a game theory model to analyze this issue based on three decisions for supplier-capacity relocation: no relocation, partial relocation, and full relocation. Our analysis finds that when tariffs are low or the production technology of the base in a preferential tariff region is not advanced, the supplier tends to adopt a partial-relocation strategy, but this strategy may be hindered by a manufacturer’s order-allocation decision, leading to a no-relocation strategy as the supply chain’s equilibrium. This may result in greater losses for the supplier. When tariffs are high or the production technology of the base in the preferential tariff region is advanced, the equilibrium strategy for the supply chain shifts to a full-relocation strategy. Interestingly, in the partial-relocation strategy, the higher production technology in the preferential tariff region negatively impacts the manufacturer’s expected profits but benefits the supplier’s expected profits due to the increased double marginalization. Finally, we find that the supplier can reduce the impact of tariffs by relocating their production capacity, especially with the partial-relocation strategy, as the supplier is always motivated to improve the production technology of the base in the preferential tariff region, with a potential purpose of transferring tariff costs to the manufacturer and consumers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the face of global climate change and the collision of consumer preferences towards green and low-carbon, businesses need to accelerate the transition to sustainable development to achieve long-term growth. Companies must raise significant funds to support this transition and manage high market risk. The existing research on green innovation within supply chains often overlooks market risks, particularly those associated with incomplete information. Hence, this paper considers a two-echelon supply chain system composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Manufacturers are willing to carry out green innovation and make a single product for sale in the consumer market with green preferences. However, innovation is risky due to the uncertainty in the sales volume of green products. In addition, the manufacturer may lack internal capital to invest in the innovation activities and may seek external financial resources, e.g., bank loans or retail prepayment financing. Hence, the manufacturer and retailer must decide which financial option to adopt. The results show that when the market risk is high, the supply chain members tend to make conservative decisions, no matter which financial modes they choose. However, with the robust optimization approach, the manufacturer and the retailer may earn a higher profit when the market risk is high. When the prepayment rate and bank loan interest rate are equal, regardless of the market risk, the manufacturer’s optimal decision is to choose prepayment financing from the retailer. However, when the prepayment rate is higher than the bank loan interest rate, there is no dominant strategy for the manufacturer to choose.</jats:p>"

There is an urgent need to improve the resilience of the industrial chain and supply chain. This paper identifies 21 resilience-influencing factors from 4 perspectives: absorption capacity, adaptability, recovery capacity, and self-learning capacity; it then constructs an evaluation indicator system. The Interval Type 2 Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Analytic Network Process (IT2F-DEMATEL-ANP) method is adopted to determine the weights of the indicator system, and a resilience evaluation is performed based on the Interval Type 2 Fuzzy-Prospect Theory-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (IT2F-PT-TOPSIS) method. Furthermore, in the case of the CTL industrial chain and supply chain of China Shenhua Energy Group Ningxia Coal Industry Co., Ltd. (CENC) (Ningxia, China), this study ranks the resilience level from 2018 to 2022 to identify the factors that have contributed to a reduction in resilience and to implement measures to enhance the resilience of the CTL industrial chain and supply chain. The results show that the level of the CTL industrial chain and supply chain resilience was lowest in 2020, while it was highest in 2021. Factors such as the degree of domestication of key technologies, the rationality of the CTL industry layout, and the stability of supply and demand chains are identified as significant determinants of resilience levels. This points the way to enhancing the resilience of the CTL industry and supply chain.</jats:p>"

SCG helps relay the preferences of international consumers to producers and fills environmental policy gaps. Brazil’s Zero-Deforestation Cattle Agreements (CA) are one of the longest-standing examples of SCG but shortcomings in implementation have reduced their conservation impacts. Chief among the reasons for their limited effect is that slaughterhouses monitor only the suppliers they buy from directly. This does not account for the complex supply network upstream of the direct sale, whose dynamics are also poorly understood. We provide the first comprehensive characterization of the strength and duration of cattle supply chain relationships based on animal transaction records from across the Brazilian Amazon. Whereas direct supply relationships (from ranchers to slaughterhouses) are relatively few and long-lasting, upstream relationships between ranchers are numerous and short-lived. Expanding monitoring to include these upstream sup- pliers increases the number of monitored transactions by an order of magnitude. However, 1% of the largest direct suppliers sell nearly half of cattle to CA slaughterhouses. More comprehensive upstream monitoring of only these prolific suppliers could greatly increase coverage at a fraction of the cost. While it may be challenging to monitor the entire supply network, significant advancements are within reach.</jats:p>",

Considering the manufacturer’s adoption of differentiated channel strategies when providing heterogeneous products is also considered, and combined with the impact of online reviews on consumer utility, an e-commerce platform online dual-channel financing model is constructed. The research findings are as follows: (i) when the effectiveness of online reviews differs within a certain range, the equilibrium solution exists. If the relative interest rates of the e-commerce platforms and bank change within a certain range, the same financing mode can bring mutual benefits to both the manufacturer and e-commerce platform, resulting in a “win–win” situation. (ii) If the interest rates under both financing modes are the same, the e-commerce platform financing mode has a higher wholesale price, but the difference in retail prices of distribution products depends on the costs difference between the two products, and at this point, the manufacturer will select e-commerce platform financing mode. (iii) At the optimal interest rate, when the cost of heterogeneous products is the same, the e-commerce platform consistently offers a more favorable interest rate compared to the bank’s optimal rate. when the e-commerce platform’s commission and the positive difference in product reviews is large, the manufacturer will choose e-commerce platform financing mode. Under the e-commerce platform financing mode, both the manufacturer and e-commerce platform are willing to provide lower retail prices to attract more consumers.</jats:p>",

Aiming at the problem that the supply data of logistics transportation has the characteristics of long sequential data, numerous influencing factors, and a significant spatiotemporal evolution law, which leads to the lack of accuracy of supply predictions, this paper proposes a supply prediction method for logistics transportation based on an improved Informer model. Firstly, multidimensional feature engineering is applied to historical supply data to enhance the interpretability of labeled data. Secondly, a spatiotemporal convolutional network is designed to extract the spatiotemporal features of the supply volume. Lastly, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model is introduced to capture the supply volume’s long- and short-term dependencies, and the predicted value is derived through a multilayer perceptron. The experimental results show that mean square error (MSE) is reduced by 73.8%, 79.36%, 82.24%, 78.58%, 77.02%, 53.96%, and 40.38%, and mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by 52%, 59.5%, 60.36%, 57.52%, 53.9%, 31.21%, and 36.58%, respectively, when compared to the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), LSTM, gated recurrent units (GRUs), a back propagation neural network (BPNN), and Informer and InformerStack single models; compared with the ARIMA + BPNN, ARIMA + GRU and ARIMA + LSTM integrated models, the MSE is reduced by 74.88%, 71.56%, and 74.07%, respectively, and the MAE is reduced by 51.31%, 50%, and 52.02%; it effectively reduces the supply prediction error and improves the prediction accuracy.</jats:p>"

On the flip-side, however, it can provide a new vantage point on how to improve human life and planetary prosperity. This objective requires the development of economic and sustainable supply chains and a governance framework to guarantee fundamental human needs and well-being under the limitations of distant and inhospitable environments. This review describes learnings for human habitation in space from remote communities on Earth that have developed and survived over generations. These include a long history of human survival strategies on Tristan da Cunha, Pitcairn Islands, Nauru, and Easter Island. Their supply chain management solutions and their problems can guide the implementation of logistics systems for the efficient use of resources in space, to satisfy vital needs of human survival but also to ensure social and governance in space, e.g., build-up of thriving communities, mobility, and industrial activities. This review demonstrates that there are significant gaps in recent space supply chain studies with respect to the space environment, social and governance. Analysis of established practices and concepts from remote regions on Earth can readily respond to these deficiencies and thus supplement space exploration. This review recommends extending the assessment of supply-chain assets from the near future to long-term strategic. This implies going far beyond current space supply chain reports to include aspects of social responsibility and governance, such as sustainable health systems, product quality management, and local decision-making.</jats:p>"

First, firms without government subsidy should adopt blockchain only when privacy costs are low. Both subsidy strategies can always motivate the manufacturer to increase greenness investment levels and achieve a triple-win situation. Second, when the government controls the greenness investment level, the demand, profits, and subsidy amount under cost subsidy are always lower than those under production subsidy. Third, when the government controls the subsidy amount, the greenness investment level under cost subsidy is always higher than that under production subsidy. The offline demand and retailer’s profit are higher under production subsidy, while the online demand and platform’s profit are higher under cost subsidy. The manufacturer’s profit is higher under cost subsidy only when the subsidy level is low.

Firstly, the Northern Goshawk Optimization optimizes the decomposition levels and penalty factors of Variational Mode Decomposition, and obtains their optimal combination. Subsequently, the optimized parameters are used to decompose the pressure signals into modal components, and the effective components and noise components are distinguished according to the correlation coefficients. Then, an optimized wavelet thresholding method is applied to the selected effective components for secondary denoising. Finally, the signal components that have been denoised twice are reconstructed with the effective signal components, and the denoised negative pressure wave signals are obtained. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared to wavelet transforms and Empirical Mode Decomposition, our method achieves the highest signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 12.23 dB and normalized cross correlation of 0.991. It effectively preserves useful leak information in the signal while suppressing noise, laying a solid foundation for improving leak localization accuracy. After several leak simulation tests on the leakage simulation test platform, the test results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The minimum relative error of the leakage localization is 0.29%, and an average relative error is 1.64%, achieving accurate leakage localization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The development of small hydropower is of enormous importance in the context of the development of territories that are isolated from the point of view of access to the central energy system and are located in special inaccessible mountainous areas. The implementation of small hydroelectric power station projects in such territories is vital for the living population, in view of the possibility of uninterrupted supply of electricity, especially to social infrastructure. Methods and materials. The classification method allowed the object selected for consideration to be positioned among other hydropower objects, which are distinguished by significant diversity and many characteristics that identify them, and to use this data for forecasting. The location of these SHPPs and the design solution that depends on it vary and act as conditions determined for choosing the power of an energy facility. In this regard, the study used the comparative analysis method to compare practices in different countries. The research materials included: scientific research by Russian and foreign authors in the field of renewable energy sources, reports from authorities, the international energy agency, which take into account statistical studies of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), British Petroleum (BP), materials from the Center for Strategic Research Foundation and the Development Strategy for Small Hydropower of the Republic Tajikistan and RusHydro property management services reports. The most important information resource on SHPPs was reference materials for navigating these objects in GPS/GLONASS. The results. Based on the results of the potential analysis for locating SHPPs IMA, the territories of the country in which these energy facilities may be most in demand were identified, taking into account their location in technologically isolated and inaccessible territories, and the development potential of such facilities was quantitatively assessed. Based on a combination of technological and managerial developments related to the creation and operation of IMA SHPP facilities, the conditions for decision - making at the level of forecasting for their placement were determined. Discussion. Implementing the MGES IMA construction solution for SHPPs is unique, different from the standard set of procedures for formation of project solutions based on the composition of the aggregates and mechanisms of implementation of fuel energy projects. The formation of a unique path to the implementation of the SHPPs IMAproject with regard to the proposed measures will, in practice, help to establish the development of VIE energy supply of mountain territories. The practice of large - scale generating companies also demonstrates the potential for the use of carbon units, verification and evaluation, which are in line with the existing discussion character and prospectively it can be seen in the scientific field when establishing the energy supply and consumption network at IMA. Conclusion. The service life of dam structures of small hydroelectric power stations significantly (2-4 times) exceeds the service life of other renewable energy facilities (SPP, WPP) and reaches 100 years. Capital costs for the construction of small hydroelectric power stations IMA average from 100 to 1000 rubles. per kW of installed capacity and depend primarily on the location, site and level of manufacturability of the power plant. Based on the consolidation of public data from authorities and the largest generating companies, it was concluded that there is unrealized potential for the placement of small hydroelectric power stations IMA, which is of greatest importance for the Sakhalin region.</jats:p>",

This assistance is essential for promoting high-quality economic growth and ensuring stable, long-term development. This study empirically examines the effects of supply chain finance on investment efficiency, exploring the underlying mechanisms involved. Additionally, it assesses whether financing constraints and information asymmetry serve as mediating variables in the relationship between supply chain finance and investment efficiency among enterprises. The analysis is based on data from publicly listed companies in China covering the period from 2013 to 2022. The results indicate that supply chain finance effectively addresses both overinvestment and underinvestment issues, leading to a notable improvement in overall investment efficiency. Utilizing a two-way fixed effects model to analyze the role of financing constraints and information asymmetry as mediating variables, the study demonstrates that both factors significantly mediate the relationship between supply chain finance and investment efficiency within enterprises. Supply chain finance improves investment efficiency by mitigating financing constraints and lessening information asymmetry between enterprises and external stakeholders. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive impact of supply chain finance on investment efficiency is notably greater in non-state-owned enterprises and in regions with more advanced development.</jats:p>"

Accurate calibration of these models is crucial for effectively representing the behavior of such complex systems and achieving a comprehensive understanding. However, the limited availability of measured data in actual systems often leads to an ill-posed problem characterized by more variables than equations. This paper proposes a calibration framework based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive particle swarm optimization to address this challenge. The influence of the number of measurement points and the measurement errors on the calibration results is analyzed within an actual long-distance water supply system featuring multi-branch pipelines. Results showed that ANNs can accurately reconstruct flow rates and pressures at unmeasured nodes, even with very limited measurement data. Compared to conventional calibration methods, the proposed framework can reduce the influence of measurement data uncertainty on calibration results, achieving better calibration accuracy. Additionally, by introducing regularization into the loss function, the constraints of physical laws are incorporated into the neural network's training process, further enhancing the calibration accuracy of the model.</jats:p>",

To improve PQ, it is necessary to accurately detect disturbance parameters, identify the causes of disturbances, and formulate corresponding management measures. Traditional disturbance detection methods primarily target single disturbances. As a contribution to complex disturbances, this paper proposes a composite PQD detection method based on extremum extension successive variational mode decomposition and Teager Energy Operator (EE-SVMD-TEO). Briefly, the SVMD method is utilized to decompose PQD signals. This method is further improved using an EE approach to reduce the influence of endpoint effects. Subsequently, the TEO is applied to the disturbance components obtained from the SVMD for disturbance detection. The results from composite disturbance detection simulation experiments show that the proposed method can differentiate disturbances in composite PQD signals. Combined with TEO, it successfully recognizes the start and end times of each disturbance, achieving a detection accuracy of over 97.5% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB Gaussian white noise. By comparing the modal decomposition results, the detection accuracy of disturbance time points, and the detection result stability, our method is more suitable for detecting composite PQD events than EEMD-TEO and EWT-TEO.</jats:p>",

By focusing on China, the major production region of fresh apple in the world where the effects of aesthetic preference and shape abnormality are substantial, the present study aims to gain insights into the on-farm grading processes and different marketing channels for fresh apples in China. It was discovered that 35% of the volume in China’s major production areas of fresh apples were graded by aesthetic characteristics such as ripeness, colour, fragrance, bruising, intactness and appealing appearance. About 17.1% of production on average were considered as food losses mainly caused by such grading schemes. Favouring ‘perfect’ appearance; however, the grading did not yield economic benefits for smallholders. Lastly, direct procurement by supermarkets had a depressive effect on the price of fresh apples at the farm gate. The study has a unique value for global debates and actions against food loss and waste as it quantifies on-farm post-harvest losses of fresh apples by different agri-food chain organizations in China with respect to mass and economic value. </jats:p>"

However, a significant limitation lies in their endurance. This study presents the design of an extended-range power supply system to ensure continuous endurance for an electric tractor. The objective is to provide a continuous power source for our self-developed electric tractor while preserving the benefits of electric propulsion. Extended-range power systems utilize a primary mover, typically an oil-fueled internal combustion engine, to drive the generator for electricity generation, and the generated AC-form electricity is subsequently converted into stable DC bus voltage by a power electronic converter. The hardware and control design of an extended-range power supply system are finalized and validated through experimental trials. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to sustain stable DC bus voltage amidst disruptions such as sudden load shifts and fluctuations in the prime mover’s speed. Even with a 50% sudden load change, the voltage drop is within 12% and can recover to ±3% within 4 s. The extended-range can be used alone without a battery to power the electric tractor, or it can used in parallel with other extended ranges or batteries for power sharing thanks to the droop control ability.</jats:p>"

On this basis, three differential game models are constructed, namely, no emissions penalty, trading under the grandfathering principle, and trading under the benchmarking principle. The results indicate that the implementation of carbon trading policies enhances consumers’ low-carbon reference levels, the carbon emission reduction levels of manufacturers, and the low-carbon publicity levels of retailers. Moreover, the enhancement of the low-carbon reference effect becomes a positive driver of profit growth. Manufacturers are observed to make more efforts in carbon reduction under the benchmarking principle compared to the grandfathering principle. In contrast, the level of low-carbon publicity by retailers remains unchanged. The above findings can provide a scientific basis for the decision-making of emission reduction in low-carbon supply chain enterprises, which has certain theoretical significance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology has reshaped how members of supply chains transfer information, effectively avoiding the phenomenon of information silos and helping to improve the emissions reduction performance and profit of each subject in the supply chain. It is now critical to understand how supply chain members can be encouraged to collaboratively invest in low-carbon service platforms based on blockchain technology to realise chain-wide systematic carbon reduction. In this regard, considering the time-dynamic characteristics of enterprise emissions reduction, this paper establishes a differential game model of collaborative emissions reduction in a low-carbon supply chain composed of a Stackelberg leader manufacturer and a supplier. We compare and analyse the four investment decision scenarios regarding whether the supplier and manufacturer invest in the blockchain low-carbon service platform under decentralised decision-making, as well as the equilibrium solutions of supply chain members under centralised decision-making scenarios by solving the Hamilton function. Finally, we introduce a bilateral cost-sharing contract to make the supply chain perfectly coordinated. We find that the significant unit return is an important incentive for supply chain members to take the lead in investing in a low carbon service platform (LCSP). In this regard, when only one member invests, the other one demonstrates free-riding behaviour. Under centralised decision-making, the supply chain can achieve Pareto optimality, and the bilateral cost-sharing contract can achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain, which is the best choice for the decision-makers of low-carbon supply chains. As the influence level of the LCSP gradually increases from small to large, the optimal decision-making of supply chain members gradually transitions from waiting for the right time to “hitchhike” to a strong willingness to cooperate. This study is of great reference value and practical significance for economic entities to improve profits, promote systematic carbon reduction in the whole chain and promote the sustainable development of low-carbon supply chains.</jats:p>",

Typical pumped storage hydropower stations have relatively small storage capacity but are vulnerable to complicated combinations of dam breaks between their upper and lower reservoirs. This paper provides basic principles for determining different dam-break classes that could initiate at a pumped storage hydropower station and summarizes these in terms of risk source. After idealizing the breach development process, a simple dam-break model and a planar two-dimensional depth-averaged shallow flow model are used to calculate the discharge hydrograph of the dam-break flood and simulate the temporal and spatial characteristics of downstream inundation. Taking a montane rockfill-pumped storage project as an example, 12 dam-break schemes are used to examine different types of combined flow patterns driven by upper and lower dam breaks with modes that are gradual and/or instantaneous. It is found that predicted dam-break discharge hydrographs and downstream inundation indexes under adverse schemes fit common features of dam-break floods in mountain rivers. Downstream disaster losses are evaluated and flood evacuation routes are recommended. The findings of this study should be useful in ensuring the safe management of pumped storage hydropower stations.</jats:p>",

We used hotspot analysis tools and the minimum cumulative resistance model to establish the ecological corridors, identifying the spatial flow paths of ecosystem services in our site. By calculating the flow volume of the key corridor value through the breakpoint formula and field strength theory and combining this with the ratio of the regulating service value, we computed the ecological compensation amount, thereby realizing the value of the ecosystem service. The results indicate that the area of balance between ecosystem service supply and demand gradually decreased and the deficit area in the Zheng-Bian-Luo region increased 43.62% from 2000 to 2020 along with rapid urbanization. The total value flow of ecosystem services by the important ecological corridors in 2000 and 2020 was USD 242.40 million and USD 365.92 million, respectively. In 2020, it was predicted that Luanchuan County would receive ecological compensation totals of USD 237.76 million from each ecological demand area, and mainly from Jinshui District.

Subsequently, the proposed SD model is analyzed using various schemes. The findings suggest that without mandatory contracts, CLSC members are frequently unable to fulfill their quality improvement commitments. Among them, recyclers are less likely to improve quality and more prone to breaking promises. The quality control problem in CLSC can be addressed through contract coordination, and the quality control contract scheme can avoid non-compliance with quality improvement commitments. The application of the quality control–revenue-sharing combination contract scheme not only resolves the quality control issue but also promotes profit improvement in the CLSC.</jats:p>"

It is widely used in medical, food, and environmental protection fields. Home air sterilization is an emerging field of plasma application, which puts higher requirements on the miniaturization, operational stability, and operating cost of plasma device. In this study, a novel magnetically driven rotating gliding arc (MDRGA) discharge device was used to sterilize <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic> fermentation. Compared with the traditional gas-driven gliding arc, this device has a simple structure and a more stable gliding arc. Simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics showed that adding permanent magnets can form a stable magnetic field, which is conducive to the formation of gliding arcs. Experiments on the discharge performance, ozone concentration, and sterilization effect were conducted using different power supply parameters. The results revealed that the MDRGA process can be divided into three stages: starting, gliding, and extinguishing. Appropriate voltage was the key factor for stable arc gliding, and both high and low voltages were not conducive to stable arc gliding and ozone production. In this experimental setup, the sterilization effect was the best at 6.6 kV. A high modulation duty ratio was beneficial for achieving stable arc gliding. However, when the duty ratio exceeded a certain value, the improvement in the sterilization effect was slow. Therefore, considering the sterilization effect and energy factors comprehensively, we chose 80% as the optimal modulation duty ratio for this experimental device.</jats:p>",

In this work, the presence of phthalic acid esters (phthalates, PAEs) and heavy metals in ice cubes distributed by 77 vending machines installed in two different zones in southern Italy and fed by water from the public water supply was investigated. Solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) was used to evaluate contamination with four PAEs, which were selected because they are commonly used in the production of food-contact plastics, while inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) was used to quantify the heavy metals. It was found that ice samples, especially those from one of the two considered zones (zone 2), exceeded the dibutyl phthalate (DBP) threshold limit value; some ice cubes from the other zone (zone 1) instead showed levels of both lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) up to one order of magnitude higher than those observed in samples collected in zone 2 and higher than the maximum permitted values (European Directive n. 2184/2020). Since the water source connected to the ice vending machines was found to be free from significant levels of all considered target compounds and metals, the high levels of DBP, Ni, and Pb in ice cubes could be attributed to the components and/or to the state of repair of the ice vending machines themselves.</jats:p>"

The present study investigated physicochemical parameters of surface water in the upper segment of River Mahaweli, which provides drinking water to the Nuwara Eliya and Kandy districts of Sri Lanka. River surface water from 15 intakes and treated water from 14 Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) were tested for pH, water temperature, turbidity, EC, COD, 6 anions, 21 cations, 3 pesticides, and 30 antibiotics once every 3 months from June 2022 to July 2023. Except for turbidity and iron concentrations, all other parameters were within the permissible range as per the Sri Lanka Standard Specification for Potable Water (SLS 614:2013). The uppermost Kotagala WTP raw water had a high concentration of iron due to runoff from areas with abundant iron-bearing minerals. Turbidity increased as the river flowed downstream, reaching its highest value of 13.43 NTU at the lowermost Haragama. Four intakes had raw surface water suitable for drinking as per the Water Quality Index (WQI). Pollution increased gradually towards downstream mainly due to agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, and urbanization. Poor water quality at the upstream Thalawakale-Nanuoya intake was due to highly contaminated effluent water coming from Lake Gregory in Nuwara Eliya. Cluster analysis categorized WTP locations in the river segment into 3 clusters as low, moderate, and high based on contaminations. Principal component analysis revealed that the significance of the 41.56% variance of the raw water was due to the pH and the presence of heavy metals V, Cr, Ni, Rb, Co, Sr, and As. All treated water from 15 WTPs had very good to excellent quality. In general, heavy metal contamination was low as indicated by the heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and heavy metal evaluation index (HEI). The treatment process could remove up to 94.7% of the turbidity. This is the first attempt to cluster the river catchment of the Mahaweli River based on physicochemical parameters of river water. We present here the land-use pattern-based pollution of the river and efficacy of the water treatment process using the Mahaweli River Basin as a case study. Regular monitoring and treatment adjustments at identified points are recommended to maintain the delivery of safe drinking water.</jats:p>"

Through comparing different game scenario models, we find that when the reference price coefficient is relatively small, the optimal decisions for the manufacturer and the retailer are the same regardless of whether the RPE is considered. The manufacturer and E-tailer always benefit from RPE, while the traditional retailer (T-retailer) is uncertain. The numerical analysis revealed that the profits of supply chain members are inversely proportional to the proportion of consumers. The smaller the proportion of primary consumers, the more favorable the supply chain. In particular, the higher the channel preference coefficient, the higher the profits of the manufacturer and E-tailer, while the lower the benefit of the T-retailer.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. In the modern coal industry, air supply issues are key to the efficiency and safety of production processes. The technological process of air supply is a complex system of interrelated actions that begins with the emergence of initial data and ends with the achievement of the desired result. This process includes many aspects, from the selection and configuration of equipment to personnel training and process management in a constantly changing external environment. Research methodology and methods. The authors used the methods of artificial intelligence theory in their research. Discussion of research results. The article presents the results of research for the development of a method for constructing intelligent control systems for air supply systems for complex modeling and optimization of the air supply control system in the coal industry. It has been established that traditional control methods are often unable to adequately respond to changes in the process due to its complexity and uncertainty. In this regard, the use of artificial intelligence to automate the management of such processes is becoming an important area of research. Conclusion. The scientific basis and method for constructing intelligent control systems for air supply in coal mines are proposed for complex modeling and optimization of the air supply control system in the coal industry, which is an innovative approach to improving efficiency and safety in mines. Unlike existing safety management systems for air supply, the architecture and algorithms of the proposed system contain elements of a preliminary assessment of the threat of an emergency based on information, the technical condition of the control object and the mining and technical conditions of the air supply, which made it possible to use the data in a decision support device to predict and prevent the threat of an emergency. The research results can be used in the management of air supply technological processes in coal mines. Conclusions on the article. 1. Despite the achieved progressive results in the field of application of artificial intelligence methods in various fields of activity, there is a gap in the conceptual approach to their use for managing air supply technological processes in the coal industry. This circumstance emphasizes the need to develop and implement the concept of intelligent control of air supply technological processes. 2. It is necessary to create a system of intelligent control of TPV as the most effective approach, allowing to take into account the features of these TPV. Despite the achieved successes, the methods of artificial intelligence are used for control of technological processes of air supply insufficiently effectively. This complicates the modeling of such systems and limits the possibilities of their practical control.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a model of supply chains combining a centralized structure with independent behavior of individual nodes. The peculiarity of this model is that it finds application in the modeling of decentralized big data systems, which have become widespread recently. To build the model, existing architectures and approaches, in particular from the theory of automatic control, were considered. These approaches made possible to choose the most appropriate approach to represent the big data network dynamics and, accordingly, its behavior in time. In the proposed model, this is achieved by using a centralized approach to the construction of network architecture and modeling the behavior of network nodes and individual chains with a model predictive control. As part of the study, the problem of the three-dimensional forecasting horizon is posed, which consists in the need to describe the dynamics in three coordinates, which are responsible for the spread of the solution in depth, width and time, which clearly affects the complexity and the possibility of its solution in an acceptable time. In order to solve this problem, we propose to split the model into separate coordinates, which allows solving the spatio-temporal representation of nodes and, accordingly, the state space model by separate systems of dynamics equations - in space and time. To test the model, an experimental implementation was created, which implements the tasks of modeling network dynamics of the model with the involvement of neuro-optimal regulators, based on Pontryagin’s principal of maximum - for temporal dynamics and a predictive control model for spatial network dynamics, respectively. As a result of the experimental tests of the model, an assessment of the adequacy of the model was given and general recommendations for the development of supply chain models were given, as well as possible potential advantages of using neuro-optimal regulators compared to the predictive control model were indicated.</jats:p>",

It reveals precipitation trends: increase 1980s–1990s, decline, and then rebound in the 2000s, especially in rainstorms. A 2008 turning point marked a shift from decreasing to increasing trends. Annual variation correlates with intensity, while moderate-to-torrential rain changes are linked to days. Beijing's precipitation exhibits multi-timescale periodicity, with similar trends in annual and rainstorm precipitation. Future predictions suggest a decrease. Spatially, northeast receives more rain than southwest, mountains more days than plains/cities, and east has stronger intensity than west. Moderate rain dominates total precipitation, with occurrence declining as intensity increases. Annual precipitation positively correlates with grades but negatively with days. These insights deepen our understanding of Beijing's complex precipitation patterns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Foxtail millet is an important cereal crop in the North China Plain. However, excessive nitrogen fertilizer application over the years has led to declining yield and soil quality. This study investigated nutrient management strategies for foxtail millet based on crop yield levels and soil nutrient availability. In a field where targeted fertilization was conducted over six seasons, nitrogen fertilization effects and the dynamics of soil-available nitrogen were monitored continuously for two consecutive years (2022–2023) across five different foxtail millet varieties with varying yield levels. The study aimed to determine the optimal nitrogen application rate for achieving a high yield of foxtail millet, the minimum soil nitrate threshold required to maintain soil fertility, and the effective nitrogen application rate range for sustaining soil-available nitrate levels. Results showed that fertilization significantly affected dry matter weight during flowering, while variety affected dry matter weight at maturity. The average nitrogen application rate for achieving high yield across all five millet varieties was 141.3 kg·ha−1. Specifically, the average nitrogen application rate of nitrogen-efficient varieties achieving high yield (5607.32–5637.19 kg·ha−1) was 151.5 kg·ha−1, while the average nitrogen application rate of nitrogen-inefficient varieties achieving high yield (4749.77–4847.74 kg·ha−1) was 134.5 kg·ha−1. Soil NH4+-N and NO3−-N content increased when nitrogen application rate exceeded 360 kg·ha−1, posing environmental risks. To achieve high yield, soil nitrate levels would be maintained at an average of 17.23 mg·kg−1 (before sowing) and 9.75 mg·kg−1 (at maturity). A relationship between soil nitrate and nitrogen application rate was established: y = 867.5 − 50z (where y represents the optimal nitrogen application rate for high yield (kg·ha−1), and z represents soil NO3−-N content in the 0–20 cm layer before sowing, ranging from 10.0 to 17.35 mg·kg−1), which provided a practical method for nitrogen fertilization to achieve high yield of foxtail millet. In this study, the fertilization strategy was optimized according to soil nutrient level and yield targets, and the nitrogen application rate was controlled within 360 kg·ha−1 based on the soil nitrate nitrogen content, which will be instructive for reducing fertilizer use, maximizing fertilizer efficiency, and increasing yield.</jats:p>"

Precise hog supply forecasts are essential for both government to ensure food security and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions. This study proposes an integrated framework for hog supply forecast. Granger causality analysis is utilized to simultaneously investigate the causal relationships among piglet, breeding sow, and hog supply, as well as to ascertain the uncertain time lags associated with these variables, facilitating the extraction of valuable time lag features. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is leveraged to decompose hog supply into three components, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are utilized to forecast the trends, i.e., seasonality and residuals, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted using monthly data from all the large-scale pig farms in Chongqing, China, covering the period from July 2019 to November 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the other five baseline models with more than 90% reduction in Mean Squared Logarithm (MSL) loss. The inclusion of the piglet feature can enhance the accuracy of hog supply forecasts by 42.1% MSL loss reduction. Additionally, the findings reveal statistical time lag periods of 4–6 months for piglet and 11–13 months for breeding sow, with significance levels of 99%. Finally, policy recommendations are proposed to promote the sustainability of the pig industry, thereby driving the sustainable development of both upstream and downstream sectors of the swine industry and ensuring food security.</jats:p>"

Therefore, based on the background of carbon emission reduction, this paper explores the impact of different low-carbon subsidy methods of government on supply chain decision-making. Through analysis and solutions, the main research conclusions are as follows: the government’s subsidy model will not affect the retailer’s low-carbon publicity level and the manufacturer’s cost-sharing rate. However, the government subsidy coefficient will affect the carbon emission reduction level, carbon emission reduction yield, low-carbon goodwill, the manufacturer’s profit and the retailer’s profit. If the manufacturer and the retailer aim only to maximize profits, the government subsidies based on carbon emission reduction yield will not be the optimal choice, which is mainly because the government only considers carbon emission reduction yield and not carbon emission reduction cost. On the contrary, if both take into account carbon emission reduction, the government subsidy to consumers will not be the optimal choice. Finally, according to the analysis and discussion, we can get some management enlightenment and suggestions. </jats:p>"

This study addressed the impact of eCO2 and a N supply on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) growth and the soil microbial community in auto-controlled growth chambers. In doing so, two ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2, daytime/nighttime = 410/460 ppm; eCO2, 550/610 ppm) and two N supplement levels (without a N supply—N0—and 100 mg N as urea per kg of soil—N100) were applied. The results indicated that eCO2 mitigated the inhibitory effects of a N deficiency on legume photosynthesis and affected the CO2 assimilation efficiency, in addition to causing reduced nodulation. While the N addition counteracted the reductions in the N concentrations across the faba beans’ aboveground and belowground plant tissues under eCO2, the CO2 concentrations did not significantly alter the soil NH4+-N or NO3−-N responses to a N supply. Notably, under both aCO2 and eCO2, a N supply significantly increased the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and Nitrosomonadaceae, while eCO2 specifically reduced the Rhizobiaceae abundance with no significant changes under aCO2. A redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted that the soil pH (p &lt; 0.01) had the most important influence on the soil microbial community. Co-occurrence networks indicated that the eCO2 conditions mitigated the impact of a N supply on the reduced structural complexity of the soil microbial communities. These findings suggest that a combination of eCO2 and a N supply to crops can provide potential benefits for managing future climate change impacts on crop production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. Analysis of obtained data and integration of previous hydroecological data and statistical information for the preparation of scientific and biological rationale and development of the regime for rational and environmentally sustainable fishery exploitation of the Khrystoforivske Reservoir.  Methodology. Hydrochemical and hydrobiological methods of sampling, laboratory and statistical processing of the material were used in the water area of the Khrystoforivske reservoir of the Bokovenka river during comprehensive studies in the summer of 2022. We studied the hydrochemical parameters of the water body, species composition, quantitative parameters of the main groups of hydrobionts, including fish forage organisms (macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos), the biological productivity of the reservoir was measured based on the main groups of hydrobionts. To determine the state of the main groups of hydrobionts, two samples of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected. Macrophytes were studied, water samples were taken from different parts of the water body for hydrochemical analysis. The biomass of phytoplankton was calculated based on the biomass of standard volumes of algae, the biomass of zooplankton – by multiplying the quantity of organisms by their individual weights, zoobenthos – by weighing individual groups of hydrobionts on torsion scale and recalculating and summing up.  The reservoir feeding capacity was assessed by the quantitative development of zooplankton according to known classifications.  Findings. The main parameters of the chemical composition and properties of the water of the Khrystoforivske reservoir, which condition the bioproductivity and fish farming performance, were determined: pH, content of dissolved gases, organic substances, biochemical demand of O2, nutrients content, as well as general mineralization and hardness, concentration of the major ions. According to the hydrochemical classification, water is bicarbonate type II and is referred to fresh water. The degree of water saturation with easily-oxidizable organic matter has decreased over the past 15 years and is within standards for aquaculture. Considering all environmental and sanitary parameters, water of the Khrystoforivske reservoir is characterized by fair or average quality, it is eupolytrophic. The water characteristics indicate that the fishery exploitation at the reservoir during previous Special Commodity Fish Farming Regimes (SCFF) (1996–2021) has produced no adverse effects on the general ecological and sanitary condition of water.  Aquatic phytocoenoses of the Khrystoforivske reservoir are represented by associations of submerged and aerial-aquatic plants, with a total area of 5.2 hectares. The total production of aquatic plants is 36.245 tons.  The phytoplankton of the reservoir includes 51 species of algae (six groups). In terms of quantity, small-celled Cyanoprokaryota predominated (about 70%). Diatoms, green and euglenic algae dominated in biomass. In 2022, the average biomass of phytoplankton in the Khrystoforivske reservoir was up to 1.80 g/m3, the total annual production of phytoplankton reached 201.06 tons.  In total, 16 species of organisms have been identified in the zooplankton of the reservoir: Rotatoria, Cladocera and Copepoda. The average abundance of zooplankton in the reservoir was 31,390 ind./m3, and its average biomass reached 0.41 g/m3. The value of primary production of zooplankton is 123.9 kg/ha, and the total stock in the reservoir is 7.687 tons. The fish food supply in terms of zooplankters in the Khrystoforivske reservoir are low. The reservoir itself, based on the group of zooplankton, can be referred to fishery class III (the lowest class).  The bottom fauna is represented by 40 taxonomic groups of invertebrates. The Chironomidae and Oligochaeta assemblies are most developed in terms of density, but molluscs dominate in biomass. There is a general trend towards a decrease in the quantitative parameters of macrozoobenthos, in particular, Mysidacea. The average biomass of soft benthos (2.17 g/m2) and the average biomass of the entire zoobenthos (33.62 g/m2) indicate that the reservoir preserves its fishery potential due to macrozoobenthos. The primary production of zoobenthos of the Khrystoforivske reservoir is 130.2 kg/ha. The total stock of zoobenthos is up to 8.072 tons. The values of the fish food supply are quite high due to zoobenthos in the reservoir, the water body in terms of benthos biomass is referred to fishery class II (medium productive reservoirs).  The obtained comprehensive data on the food supply of the Khrystoforivske reservoir indicate the availability of sufficient bioproduction potential for its continuous effective fish-farming on the basis of the special commodity fish farming regime.  Originality. For the first time in the last 10 years, comprehensive data on the food supply of the Khrystoforivka reservoir, which is used in special commodity fish farming regime (SCFF), have been obtained and analysed.  Practical value. The results obtained are of practical importance for the development of scientific and biological rationale for fish farming in the Khrystoforivske Reservoir.  Keywords: Dnipropetrovsk region, Bokovenka River, Khrystoforivske reservoir, macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos, food supply, fish farming.</jats:p>",

The research employs various models, including Oprobit, Ologit, IV-2SLS, and moderated mediation. The research results show that (1) both Government Embedment and the Cultural Environment within the Organizational Context significantly enhance Farmers’ Credible Commitment in regard to the Collective Governance of Rural Residential Land. Notably, the quality of the Cultural Environment, when improved by Government Embedment, boosts this commitment further. (2) Endogeneity issues can lead to an overestimation of the effects of these factors. (3) Punishment intensity only positively moderates the impact of the Cultural Environment on Farmers’ Credible Commitment. (4) The moderating effect of punishment intensity correlates positively with its strength, exhibiting a threshold value. In conclusion, our research underscores the need to establish a robust regulatory framework for Rural Residential Land use, foster a conducive village cultural atmosphere, and consistently enhance the punishment intensity for illegal Rural Residential Land use. These measures will encourage farmers to adhere to Credible Commitment in regard to Rural Residential Land use, thereby facilitating the effective implementation of Collective Governance over Rural Residential Land.</jats:p>"

This study integrates bibliometric analysis, knowledge mapping, and the ABCDE framework to conduct a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of 742 relevant articles from the Web of Science core database spanning January 2009 to July 2023. Initially, bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping reveal the annual progression of research on the sustainability of global agricultural produce supply chains, the collaborative networks among research institutions and authors, and the geographic distribution of research activities worldwide, successfully pinpointing the current research focal points. Subsequently, the ABCDE framework, constructed from the quantitative findings, helps us identify and comprehend the antecedents, barriers and challenges, impacts, and driving forces affecting the sustainability of these supply chains. The study identifies globalization and technological advancement as the primary forces shaping the sustainability of agricultural produce supply chains, despite them also posing challenges such as resource constraints and environmental pressures. Moreover, the application of innovative technologies, the optimization of organizational models, and active stakeholder engagement are key to propelling supply chains toward more sustainable development, exerting a profound impact on society, the environment, and the economy. In conclusion, this study suggests future research directions. The integrated methodology presented offers new perspectives and deep insights into the complexities of sustainable global agricultural produce supply chains, demonstrating its potential to foster knowledge innovation and practical applications, providing valuable insights for academic research and policy formulation in this domain.</jats:p>"

This requires combining corporate social responsibility (CSR) and circular economy (CE) within sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). However, the interplay between CSR, CE, and SSCM remains underexplored, especially in the context of I5.0. Therefore, this article proposes a framework for integrating CSR and CE principles within SSCM, serving as a transition to I5.0. The framework is derived from a comprehensive scoping review and experts' input, with a backdrop of the business legitimacy theory. It comprises several key constructs, including the supply chain structure and promoters, organized around four pillars representing the components of CE and embracing the triple bottom line dimensions. With 12 guidelines, the framework stands as a practical tool for organizations aiming to seamlessly integrate CSR and CE within SSCM, facilitating the transition to I5.0 and promoting a sustainable, socially responsible ethos.</jats:p>",

Design/methodology/approach: A deep learning approach is employed, combining the RoBERTa pre-training model, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to form a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The model takes the pre-training model trained by the deep network model as input, mitigates the scarcity of annotated datasets, leverages the strong advantage of BiLSTM in learning the context information of words, and combines the CRF model to infer the ability of labels through global information. Findings: The RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF model has shown satisfactory results in the experiment. It enhances the reasoning ability between characters, allows the model to fully learn the feature information of the text, and improves the model performance to a certain extent. Originality/value: This paper proposes a RoBERTa medical named entity recognition model for the scarcity of annotated data in medical named entity recognition tasks and BERT’s inability to obtain word-level information. The model is not limited to medical entity recognition tasks and shows potential for other medical natural language processing tasks, considering data enhancement, data optimization, and domain transfer on the model to improve model performance and generalization capabilities. </jats:p>",

The orifice height under the weir is changed by adjusting the chord length and rotation angle of the weir. This paper uses three airfoil weir-orifice facilities for comparative study. The facilities have three flow forms under different rotation angles and flow conditions. Orifice discharge in combined outflow form is related to weir crest height but not upstream water depth. Flow formulas for three discharge forms are derived using dimensional analysis and incomplete self-similarity theory. The results show that the relative error of the formula is within ±6.34%. The Froude number is less than 0.4 under all working conditions; the critical submerged range is between 0.7 and 0.95; and under the premise of the unified weir crest height, the head loss decreases with the increased orifice height. The hydraulic jump location analysis yields the airfoil weir-orifice facility under the combined outflow as a submerged orifice outflow, and the hydraulic jump energy cancelation efficiency under the same flow condition is consistent with the upstream water depth change trend.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relevance of developing integrated lighting systems in conditions of unstable power supply via general-purpose networks is beyond doubt. This article discusses original technical solutions for LED modules that ensure system operation within a wide range of input supply voltages for direct and alternating currents. The effectiveness of the proposed circuit approach is demonstrated using the example of a developed LED lighting device with an electronic LED power system with a driver built using the concept of flyback topology, capable of working with input voltages of both direct (20…300 V) and alternating (36…300 V) currents. The results of experimental studies of electro-optical parameters and characteristics of the manufactured prototypes of the developed lighting systems are presented. It has been shown that the LED modules demonstrate a stable luminous flux and a high luminous efficiency (more than 150 lm/W) at various values and types of supply voltage. The developed lighting systems can be effectively used in domestic and industrial environments, including special-purpose facilities, namely, shelters and warehouses for various purposes, etc.</jats:p>",
