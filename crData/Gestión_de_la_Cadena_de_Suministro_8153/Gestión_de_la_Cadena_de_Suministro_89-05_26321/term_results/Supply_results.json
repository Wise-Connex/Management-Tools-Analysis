Historically, the reserves additions rates of both crude oil and natural gas have decreased over time and consequently the marginal supply costs have increased. Extrapolations of these historical trends indicate that significant volumes of conventional crude oil and natural gas, which could be economically recovered, remain to be discovered.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Assessments of future supplies of crude oil and natural gas from western Canada are essential for the development of energy policy in Canada. The undiscovered hydrocarbon resources are a major determinant of these future supplies. The most authoritative source of information on these undiscovered resources is the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC)(1, 2). This agency last published its estimates of natural gas resources in 1983(1), These estimates were based primarily on geological evidence and no economic constraints were applied. The agency recently released a report of an assessment of the undiscovered conventional oil resources (light and medium) of western Canada(2). This report includes an assessment of the economic constraints.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Crude oil and natural gas prices and the costs associated with recovery are the major determinants of economic constraints which must be applied to geologically estimated petroleum resources. The work described herein is an attempt to use historical data for western Canada to determine the relationships between the costs of recovery of conventional crude oil and natural gas and the discovered volumes of these resources, and to use trend analysis to predict the relationships for the currently undiscovered portion of the western Canadian hydrocarbon resource base. These relationships are referred to as the supply functions for crude oil and natural gas.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>There is much uncertainty associated with estimates of resources. The GSC recognizes this by attaching probabilities to its estimates. At the 95% probability level, the GSC estimates that 2820 million m3 of conventional light and medium crude oil and 4834 billion m3 of marketable natural gas (186 exajoules) are technically recoverable from western Canada by conventional production practices. At the 5% probability level, the corresponding estimates are 3130 million m3 of conventional light and medium crude oil and 8220 billion m3 of marketable natural gas (317 exajoules). The GSC's average expectations for ultimate technical potentials are 2930 million m3 of conventional light and medium crude oil and 5794 billion m3 of marketable natural gas (225 exajoules)(1, 2). In addition to the geological uncertainties, there is also considerable uncertainty associated with the technical and economic determinants of future costs.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the methodology that is currently being researched by the staff of the National Energy Board. This methodology is illustrated by projecting the supply functions using average expectations for ultimate technical potentials and judgmental projections for the technical and economic determinants of costs. A complete sensitivity analysis, which would be required to fully define the ossible ranges of the projections of the supply functions, is not included.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

One noteworthy feature of these algorithms is that, due to the special structure of the problem, the restricted equilibrium for each supply market (or demand market) can be obtained explicitly in closed form; another feature is that they are intuitive and straightforward to implement. Moreover, the computational results demonstrate that the algorithms are efficient and suitable for large-scale problems. </jats:p>",

They consider a situation in which the lead time distribution is unaltered by the amount which is ordered, but is otherwise arbitrary, and characterize the optimal solution in terms of points at which there is zero inventory. Here we give a more precise characterization, and show that these results can be extended to a situation in which the demands are also stochastic, and in which there is uncertainty relating to quantity as well as to the timing of demands and order arrivals.

The purpose is to assess the suitability of price or regulations in solving various coordination problems. Special emphasis is given to the cooperatives as coordinating institutions. The theory in the study draws from Transaction Cost Economics, Economics of Public Choice, and Industrial Organization approach. The application used is termed Marketing Systems Analysis. It is applied to the dairy marketing system providing explanations to the surrent structure and analyzing four problems: (1) coordination of total supply and demand if milk, (2) coordination of milk components, (3) seasonal balancing, and (4) adaptation of new consumer preferences.</jats:p>"

Dopamine concentrations in dialysates increased transiently after tyrosine (50‚Äì100 mg/kg) administration. Pretreatment with haloperidol or the partial lesioning of nigrostriatal neurons enhanced the effect of tyrosine on dopamine release, and haloperidol also prolonged this effect. These data suggest that nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are responsive to changes in precursor availability under basal conditions, but that receptor‚Äêmediated feedback mechanisms limit the magnitude and duration of this effect.</jats:p>",

Estimates of price and income elasticities of demand for aggregate agricultural exports for all developing countries taken together ‚Äî as distinct from individual exporting countries ‚Äî are found to be low; moreover, export price as distinguished from non‚Äêprice factors plays a relatively insignificant role in increasing export supply. Hence, an attempt by all developing countries to expand traditional agricultural exports with low price elasticity of demand may not yield rising earnings for all; but in fact may result in falling export revenues. Insofar as individual exports of all developing countries (not individual countries) are concerned, income and price elasticities of demand for such tropical commodities as tea, coffee, cocoa and bananas are also found to be low, except for new, non‚Äêtraditional exports like pineapples. This indicates the importance of diversification of agricultural exports as a vehicle for their future growth.</jats:p>",

This approach uses a stochastic model whose error term is composed of two elements‚Äìthe usual two‚Äêsided error and a one‚Äêsided error. Our method has several strengths. First, we are able to explicitly model the universally held view that there is a nonzero lower bound on unemployment. Second, we can easily determine whether each region's unemployment rate is caused primarily by excess supply or frictional forces. We illustrate our technique on a data set comprised of all 50 states over the period 1960‚Äê1979. Finally, estimation of the frictional rates of unemployment allows us to analyze, in the last part of the paper, the underlying economic and demographic determinants of differences in frictional unemployment rates across states and over time.</jats:p>",
