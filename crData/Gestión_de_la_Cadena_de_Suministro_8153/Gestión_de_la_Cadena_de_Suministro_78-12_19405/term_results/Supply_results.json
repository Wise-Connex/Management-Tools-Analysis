Grain and other starchy staples constitute the major component of urban food supply, followed by vegetables and meat. In terms of weight or volume, far more vegetables than meat are consumed by city dwellers, though in terms of value meat may have the edge. The focus here is on vegetables, in particular the ecology of production, the organization of procurement and the structure of the marketing system. The logistics of feeding urban populations is critical in any complex society, indicative <jats:italic>inter alia</jats:italic> of priorities and procedural preferences in the social system. To examine the organization of urban vegetable supply therefore offers clues to these social priorities as well as to prevailing levels of organizational sophistication.</jats:p>",

The objective of this article is to estimate the sources of instability in U. S. feed grains supply and utilization. Because of the inelastic demand for feed grains, changes in the quantities produced, stored, and utilized, both domestically and abroad, are influential in determining price and income. Identifying past sources of instability provides background for possible future policy considerations to reduce price and income variation. The latter step is not considered here, although commodity stock levels necessary to offset variation in domestic production and export demand are estimated.</jats:p>",

This fumarate reductase system plays an important role in the metabolic energy supply of\n            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>\n            , grown under so-called “glycolytic conditions,” as is indicated by the growth yields and maximal growth rates of mutants impaired in electron transfer or adenosine triphosphatase (\n            <jats:italic>uncB</jats:italic>\n            ). In mutants deficient in menaquinone, cytochromes, or fumarate reductase, these values are considerably lower than in mutants deficient in ubiquinone or a functional adenosine triphosphatase. Electron transfer in this fumarate reductase system leads to the generation of a membrane potential, as is indicated by the uptake of the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium by membrane vesicles prepared from cytochrome-sufficient and\n            <jats:italic>uncB</jats:italic>\n            cells. The generation of a proton-motive force by the fumarate reductase system was also demonstrated by the uptake of amino acids under anaerobic conditions in membrane vesicles of cytochrome containing and\n            <jats:italic>uncB</jats:italic>\n            cells grown under glycolytic conditions. Membrane vesicles of cytochrome-deficient cells failed to accumulate triphenyl-methylphosphonium and amino acids under these conditions, indicating that cytochromes are essential for the generation of a proton-motive force. Using glutamine uptake as an indication of the generation of ATP and proline uptake as an indication of the generation of a proton-motive force, it was demonstrated in whole cells that the proton-motive force is formed by ATP hydrolysis in cytochrome-deficient cells and by electron transfer in the\n            <jats:italic>uncB</jats:italic>\n            cells. In cytochrome-containing cells it was not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities, but the growth parameters suggest that, under glycolytic conditions, the proton-motive force is generated via electron transfer in the fumarate reductase system rather than via ATP hydrolysis.\n          </jats:p>",
