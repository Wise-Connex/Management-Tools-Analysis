      "abstract": "<jats:p>Connecticut to date has a record of freedom from waterborne disease. The natural surface and groundwater supply sources in the state are free from sewage pollution. Treatment by chlorination and filtration provides safeguards against the danger of chance contamination, which always exists. The natural water supplies of Connecticut are generally soft and of reasonably good physical quality. A considerable number of filtration plants is now in operation in the state. Filtration will be provided to an increasing extent to improve water of poor physical quality. Such treatment will also furnish an additional barrier against waterborne disease. Some further development of surface sources in clean watersheds can and should be made in the future, where possible. It does not appear necessary for several decades to contemplate obtaining supplies from large rivers, but the time may come and efforts in pollution abatement on these rivers should continue. Studies of groundwater potential for water supplies in the state should be undertaken on a greatly expanded basis, and unquestionably a cooperative survey of groundwater resources by the state and U.S. Geological Survey should be planned over the next decade.</jats:p>",

Plants were grown in sand and the essential elements supplied by daily sub-irrigation. Nectar secretion in red clover was comparatively sensitive to the availability of calcium and magnesium, the best factorial combination (intermediate calcium and high magnesium) producing almost twice as much nectar per unit of inflorescence weight as the poorest (low calcium and low magnesium). Nectar production was not correlated with vegetative growth or flower production. Inter-treatment variation was less extreme in snapdragon. In one crop the combination of high calcium and high magnesium, which supported the best growth and flower production, also gave the best nectar yield; in another crop the lowest level of calcium, sub-optimal for growth, produced the most nectar. The effects of nutrition on secretion were not related to the influence of pH, which was constant, or to the content of calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium in the red clover or snapdragon shoots. </jats:p>",
