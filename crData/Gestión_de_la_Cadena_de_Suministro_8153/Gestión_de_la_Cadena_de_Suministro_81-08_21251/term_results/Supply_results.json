      "abstract": "<jats:p>Balance trials were made with adult Finnsheep rams to obtain more information on the mineral supply when the animals arc fed on grass silage based diets. The experimental silages were prepared with three different preservatives: 1) AIV I solution (25% formic acid and 20 % hydrochloric acid), 2) formic acid and 3) Viher solution (26 % formic acid and 70 % formalin). Together with the silage the animals received sucrose, starch and cellulose supplements at the levels of 0 %, 15 % or 30 % of the dry matter of the daily rations, representing 0, 2 ½ and 5 g/kg animal liveweight per day. Data were obtained on the Ca, P Mg, K, Na, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn intake by the animals and on the excretion of these minerals in the faeces and urine. The levels of these minerals in the blood were also determined. The mineral contents of the silage were sufficient for animals fed at the maintenance level, except in the case of Na and P. Suckling ewes and growing lambs on silage based feeding may suffer from a deficiency of Ca as well as Na and P. The silage preservatives did not differ in their effect on the mineral balance. The mineral balances of the animals receiving the various carbohydrate supplements were also fairly similar to those of animals on pure silage diets.</jats:p>"

The technique is in some ways a standard iterative market method, and, in fact, the convergence to the optimal solution is achieved when the marginal benefit at each demand point is equal to the marginal cost of delivering water to that point. The possibility of applying this technique to a given problem can immediately be ascertained from the pattern of the links between supply and demand units. An example is presented in which the method is applied to analyze the possible interbasin water transfer in the Northwest Water Plan in Mexico.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>: In general, the choice among reservoirs for water supply or flow augmentation is a multiobjective problem. Choices are based in part on the yield available from water supply reservoirs or, in the case of flow augmentation reservoirs, on the increase in low flows at downstream locations. Detailed estimates of these effects may be too costly for basin planning purposes. Thus this paper presents methods for rapid estimation of those quantities for New Hampshire. For water supply reservoirs, a composite empirical relation between Y95 (the draft available 95 percent of the time) and storage ratio, S*, is developed from previous studies in the region. For flow augmentation reservoirs, empirical relations between S* and degree of regulation, R*, are applied to each upstream regulating reservoir. Values of regulation arc then summed and divided by the mean flow at the downstream reach of interest. This parameter, (ΓR)*, is then related to increase in flow available 95 percent of the time by an empirical relation.</jats:p>",
