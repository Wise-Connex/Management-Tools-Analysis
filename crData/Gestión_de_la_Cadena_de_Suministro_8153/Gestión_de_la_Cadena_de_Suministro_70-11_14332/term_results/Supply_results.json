As indicated in its “Principles of a National Water Policy,” AWWA believes that such control of water systems should rest with the state. On this basis, it opposes direct federal control of water system operations not only as impractical, but as improper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Clear Lake, a small Canadian Shield lake that has been influenced little by human activity, was found to be more productive than expected from chemical and optical properties and geological surroundings. Production during the ice-free season ranged from 0.10 to 2.57 g C/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> per day and averaged 250 g C/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> per year for the lake as a whole. Other limnological factors studied (phytoplankton standing crop, oxygen, temperature, and nutrient regimes) were typical for an oligotrophic lake.The high production values are partially explained by the high correction for filtration error, which averaged 3.2 times for all occasions tested.Atmospheric precipitation is undoubtedly the major source of supply of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus to Clear Lake. Calcium and magnesium also appear to be largely carried in by precipitation, although most of the sodium, potassium, and silica entering the lake is weathered from the terrestrial watershed. </jats:p>",

More weight of leaves and stems was produced during early growth with ammonium-N than with nitrate-N, but the two forms gave similar yields of grain. The grain:straw ratio with ammonium-N was smaller than with nitrate-N, and more N was retained in the straw. Both forms of N increased the weight per spike but not the number of spikes per unit area (tillering). Applied at the boot stage of growth, N increased dry matter much less than when applied at sowing, but increased the percent N in the grain. Divided dressings, half at sowing and half during growth, increased yield and N uptake by the same amount as applying all the N at sowing. Drought during spike formation or floret development led to smaller spikes and yields of grain, and also to a smaller grain:straw ratio; up to three-quarters of the extra N taken up from fertilizer-N remained in the straw. </jats:p>",
