More recently, demand management has emerged as a new dimension at the customer interface. Although it has become increasing popular in industry, it has not yet been analyzed in depth with respect to its impact on supply chain performance. Both distribution management and demand management entail customer‐facing processes and practices and that are interrelated and (may) jointly determine supply chain performance. In this paper we seek to extend the stream of research in supply chain management by systematically investigating the impact of customer‐facing supply chain practices on supply chain performance. Specifically, the paper examines the relative impact of relevant practices associated with demand and distribution management. To this end, we collected data from 116 multi‐national companies based in Europe and analyzed it using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results suggest that (i) high demand management performance has a substantial positive impact on the overall supply chain performance, (ii) this effect is stronger than that of distribution management performance, and (iii) there is no evidence that demand management might be an enabler for effective distribution management. Among the individual practices that constitute demand and distribution management, adherence to the demand and distribution management processes and demand segmentation emerged as the strongest performance levers. Based upon additional in‐depth interviews conducted with selected companies from our sample, we shed light on some of the most important findings that emerged from our survey analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The main aim and objective of this workis to find the most suitable off-grid system for rural electrification, i.e. in the form of technical feasibility, acceptable purchasing/installation and maintenance cost, as well asreliability. The selected system should be able to provide continuous electricity supply, particularly in areas where main grid connection is not a viable option. The result from this work has concluded that hybrid renewable energy systems are the best approach in solving some of the problems related to electricity shortage in the countryside. Hybrid systemsconstruction means that sustainable energy and environmental protection will be part of the overall commercial and non-commercial applications for off-grid electricity supply</jats:p>"

Four categories of two-stage supply chain structures consisting of multiple suppliers and a single retailer are considered. Two categories of auction mechanisms, single-winner or multi-winner auction, are used in this paper. A multi-agent model is developed to study these four categories of supply chains. The results of experiments show that, with the decrease of safety stock, the tendencies of the retailer’s profit are changed under different structures. Also, the optimal (near-optimal) safety stock, corresponding to the maximum profit, shows significant difference under different structures. The results of this paper demonstrate that the safety stock can be significantly changed and financial benefits can be achieved while working under different supply chain structures with (T, S) strategy.</jats:p>"

A successful coordination has been shown and a numerical analysis demonstrates that such an option contract brings a Pareto improvement to each party, especially to the retailer. At last, the analysis of market uncertainty effects on the profits of both sides illustrates that, as the increasing of market demand uncertainty, the retailer’s ordering quantity of options will increase but his profit will reduce, and supplier’s profit will add.</jats:p>"

Whilst this planning is generally involved with investigations of source water abstraction security and the need to build dams or to increase the recharge rate of groundwater aquifers, planning for water efficiency gains occurs at annual intervals. Most water utilities in Australia are heavily engaged in water efficiency initiatives with rebate schemes for domestic water-efficient devices being ubiquitous across the industry. Wide Bay Water Corporation (WBWC) also engages in these activities but is increasingly interested in the concept of Time of Use Tariffs (TOUTs) to target high water users in order to reduce their demand on the system. In 2006, WBWC introduced smart metering technology across the city which captures hourly use data. Interrogation of this data has led to the ability to identify water use patterns for every domestic and commercial water customer and to design specific interventions to encourage water efficiency, such as a TOUT for domestic customers. A TOUT has been developed that imposes a penalty on all individual consumption greater than 600 L in any hourly interval of any day in the year. The tariff was designed to reduce both the annual peak hour and peak day demand. The ability to reduce both of these infrastructure design parameters may have the potential to deliver substantial savings in infrastructure planning and deployment. This paper details the design process of this tariff, examines the infrastructure savings potential derived by network modelling and explores the regulatory framework hurdles to be overcome in order to implement such tariffs in the water industry.</jats:p>",

Synthetic NO3-N water was prepared in accordance with the groundwater quality of the study area: Chyasal in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The results show an increase in denitrification efficiency with H2 flow rate and HRT. Further, for effective denitrification, the dissolved hydrogen (DH) during operation should be maintained at greater than 0.1 mg/L. A sharp decrease in the denitrification efficiency from ∼96% (under excess IC) to 10–35% (under no IC) suggested occurrence of denitrification inside the attached growth reactor by a hydrogenotrophic process (using H2) as well as heterotrophic process (using internal organic carbon).

The ratio of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC/DON) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total dissolved nitrogen (DIN/TDN) were higher in the hydrophobic fraction from both sources. Similarly DOC, colour and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) also presented higher values in the same fraction. Chitosan achieved the better results in the removal of NOM from Boaco water, whole and fractionated, whereas aluminium sulphate achieved better removal from Juigalpa water. DON and DIN were removed by aluminium to about 30%. The DOC/DON and DIN/TDN ratios decreased with both coagulants in whole waters from both sources. The hydrophobic fraction contributed most to the formation of trihalomethanes, slightly hydrophobic acid being the biggest contributor. Lake water led to less THM formation than river water.</jats:p>",

A bottom-up approach is constructed to determine N losses from livestock farming systems and to relate these losses to the supply of fresh milk, pig and beef to Paris. First, the three products are expressed in terms of their nitrogen content; then, their fodder equivalent is determined by modelling feed formulas for swine, beef and dairy cows to meet their energy and protein requirements. Fodder deficits in livestock farms are determined by comparing the nutrient requirements of the livestock with the fodder production on the livestock farms. This allowed determining the geography of the livestock systems according to the imports of fodder to the livestock farms from external crop farms. Then we assessed the \"farm-gate\" N budgets in all crop and livestock farms of the entire livestock systems using data on total N fertilization, atmospheric deposition and manure management practices to finally derive N losses in relation to fodder cultivation and to manure management. Measured in N, the supply of milk, beef and pig to Paris sum 1.85 kg N/cap and the corresponding N losses from the farming systems total 8.9 kg N/cap. N losses per unit of product differ among the three livestock systems according to where and how the fodder is grown and to what densities the livestock is reared.\n                        </jats:p>"

The conclusion of our analysis is that probably none of them is able to explain the full franchising occurrence, but each theory explains different parts of the franchising phenomenon, so they should be perceived as complementary theories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Bio-energy plays an essential role in the current mix of renewable energy technologies. In Germany, the state fosters insistently biogas technology within the concert of bio-energy options. Literature suggests that long-term stable economic ties with supplying farmers are the pivotal managerial challenge of bio-energy plant operators to secure a constant and competitively priced feedstock supply. Biogas plant operators are generally in a vulnerable position vis-à-vis their suppliers due to their substantial specific capital investment and a rather restricted economically viable catchment area. Transactional uncertainty due to volatile agricultural market prices, changing yield quantities, and unpredictable behaviour of suppliers makes biogas plant operators aim for effective governance. The study aims by means of in-depth interviews to explore how biogas plant operators perceive their specific situation of transactional uncertainty and which instruments (concerning formal and relational contracts) they use for securing stable and constant feedstock supply. Findings indicate that mutually reinforcing interaction of formal contracts, business partnerships, and equity participation with relational contracts proves to be successful in establishing long-term stable feedstock supply. While the specific rural societal culture has an ambiguous impact on governance design, local rootedness of biogas plant operators provide high levels of social capital and thus clearly facilitate the search for effective solutions that satisfy all parties.</jats:p>",

The degradation of HS was studied with an EM (effective microorganisms) bacteria community, and solutions of fulvic acid, sodium humate furthermore extracts of sandy soil were investigated. EM products are widely used but their effect on HS has not been investigated before. The combination of EM and AC methods in the case of fulvic acid resulted in higher performance than any of these methods alone. Humic substances were analyzed using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer and by total organic carbon (TOC) measurements. The carbon/nitrogen ratio was also determined, which enabled conclusions to be made for the nutrient supply.

This will not only have a favourable effect on the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>concentration in the atmosphere, but will also help preserve fossil fuels—important as raw materials in the chemical industry—for future generations. Nevertheless, associated with the concomitant massive shift to regenerative energy forms, there will be a strong demand for other exhaustible raw materials, in particular metals, some of which are already regarded as scarce. After reviewing the debate on mineral depletion between “cornucopians” and “pessimists”, we discuss the meaning of mineral “scarcity”, particularly in the geochemical sense, and mineral “exhaustion”. The expected drastic increase in demand for mineral resources caused by demographic and societal pressures, that is, due to the increase in in‐use stock, is emphasised. Whilst not discussing the issue of “strong” versus “weak” sustainability in detail, we conclude that regenerative energy systems—like nearly all resource‐consuming systems in our society—do not necessarily satisfy generally accepted sustainability criteria. In this regard, we discuss some current examples, namely, lithium and cobalt for batteries, rare earth‐based permanent magnets for wind turbines, cadmium and tellurium for solar cells and copper for electrical power distribution.</jats:p>",

The basic model of the proposed method and the general rule for analog fault detection were described in detail. At first, the principal component model of fault-free circuits was constructed. Then the circuits-under-test was compared with the principal component model to calculate the statistic for fault detection. The features of power supply current in both time and frequency domain were combined by PCA, and it could overcome the difficulty to determine threshold by empirical knowledge. The proposed method was applied to detect faults of the signal filtering and amplifying circuit, which is used in the ultrasonic liquid-level sensor. The results show that the power supply current contains information about the circuit’s faults, and can be used for fault detection of analog circuits by analyzing this signal.</jats:p>"

Existing water supply systems in the study area consist of bucket-drawn water wells, mini water tower systems, rainwater harvesting, and public piped water. Daily domestic water consumption in the study area compared well with findings on water uses per capita from Sub-Saharan Africa, but was well below daily water usage in developed nations. Based on the surveys, participants thought highly of a large scale community water tower and expressed interest in maintaining it.

Experimental results show that the power supply system could have good performance on extending the continuous working period of the transmission line inspection robot.</jats:p>"

Using security-level data on Treasury prices and quantities during the course of this program, we document a &amp;amp;#x27;local supply&amp;amp;#x27; effect in the yield curve—yields within a particular maturity sector responded more to changes in the amounts outstanding in that sector than to similar changes in other sectors. We find that this phenomenon was responsible for a persistent downward shift in yields averaging about 30 basis points over the course of the program (the &amp;amp;#x27;stock effect&amp;amp;#x27;). In addition, except at very long maturities, purchase operations caused an average decline in yields in the sector purchased of 3.5 basis points on the days when those operations occurred (the &amp;amp;#x27;flow effect&amp;amp;#x27;). The sensitivity of our results to security characteristics generally supports a view of segmentation or imperfect substitution within the Treasury market during this time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The importance of power is underlined by many scientists who view it as a key behavioural construct. Power distinguishes itself as an effective tool in coordinating and promoting harmonious relationships, solving conflicts, and enhancing performance. An important challenge is to find out what role power plays in managing supply chain networks, paying specific attention to its effects on coordination and cooperation. The aim of our work is to investigate the role of power in supply chain networks in order to work out a strategy that enables supply chain managers to select an effective mix of power mechanisms. We critically examine the existing literature and elaborate on the role of power in supply chain relationships. We work out and test a theoretical model of the effects of power on cooperation and coordination and discuss possible managerial implications of using power as an effective tool for promoting supply chain management. To verify our research hypotheses we conducted semi-structured in-depth expert interviews via telephone about relationships of international food processing companies with their suppliers in Russia and tested the model using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. Depending on the origin of power, it may have different effects on cooperation and coordination. Based on the results of the survey we worked out a special ranking system for the use of power depending on its expected effect on coordination and cooperation. Expert power has the highest ranking among the other types of power for improving coordination. Therefore, we recommend using this strategy as a first priority for improving coordination. The data in our PLS analysis represent only a single perspective in the dyad: food processing companies. Gathering data from other companies’ perspectives, such as retailers or agricultural producers, could have produced different (presumably more realistic or complete) findings. Our study offers recommendations for managers about the use of different types of power in managing the Russian agri-food supply chains, with specific attention paid to coordination and cooperation issues. In order to manage supply chain networks successfully, knowledge of different types of power is essential. The developed ranking of different types of power according to their effects on coordination and cooperation is designed to help managers make the right decisions in choosing the appropriate type of power for coordination purposes.</jats:p>",

The results exhibit a positive and significant relationship between remittances and aggregate labor supply. The effect is clearly driven by men in each of the three regions. Three potential explanations are put forward to explain these empirical findings: (1) non‐migrating household members are likely to increase their labor supply in order to defray migration‐related expenses; (2) neighboring households increase their labor supply to help family members migrate after they become more aware of the benefits of remittances; and (3) remittances overcome credit constraints, thus generating employment.</jats:p>",

The results for the Voëlvlei WTP raw water and the Berg River water with ferric sulphate as the coagulant showed an optimum Fe3+ dosage of 3.0–4.0 mg/L and 4.0–6.0 mg/L, respectively, with an optimum coagulation pH range of 6.6–9.5 and 5.0–10.0, respectively.

This study concluded that the Berg River water cannot be effectively treated at the Voëlvlei WTP using the plants treatment parameters, even if it is blended with the Voëlvlei WTP raw water.

The pilot-scale RBF effectively reduced low ng/L concentrations of most compounds by greater than 90% following a 36-day experiment. Breakthrough of the conservative tracer occurred after 10 days and reached 90% recovery after 28 days. Only four compounds (diazepam, meprobamate, phenytoin and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) were between 20 and 80% removed, and three compounds (atrazine, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole) were less than 20% removed by the pilot. Removal of compounds through the pilot-scale RBF is consistent with results from two full-scale RBF systems: atrazine, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and sulfamethoxazole persisted through infiltration into drinking water, whereas caffeine, DEET, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, TCEP, triclosan and trimethoprim were removed. Removal during RBF was attributed to (1) microbial degradation for compounds which were either negatively charged or were neutrally charged and had low log KOW values (such as acetaminophen, caffeine, and trimethoprim), or (2) adsorption for neutrally-charged compounds with high log KOW values (including estradiol, estrone, ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine, oxybenzone, progesterone, testosterone, and triclosan).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rapid expansion of global business, newer suppliers with cheaper but possibly unreliable technologies have entered the marketplace to win orders from buyer firms by beating the price of their perfectly reliable (but expensive) competitors. We model the procurement problem as a Nash game where the buyer has to allocate its purchases between an expensive but reliable supplier, and a cheaper but unreliable supplier. The suppliers specify prices for different proportions of the order awarded to them. Our analysis shows that, when perfect information is available about the reliability level of the unreliable supplier, the Nash equilibrium is a sole-sourcing allocation and that the supplier selection decision depends on the reliability and cost differentials between the two suppliers. In addition, we model the case when the buyer and the reliable supplier have limited information about the reliability of the unreliable supplier. Even in such an asymmetric scenario, the buyer's equilibrium allocation is a sole-sourcing outcome, but depending on system conditions either a separating or a pooling equilibrium is possible. An interesting insight into the effect of information asymmetry is that it can result in higher or lower profits/costs for the channel partners (compared to the perfect information case). As such, the buyer may even benefit from information asymmetry regarding unreliable supplier due to its impact on the degree of competition between the two suppliers. </jats:p>",

Therefore, a spreadsheet based WSP tool was designed to facilitate the implementation of the WSP approach at these small supply units. The WSP tool comprises the relevant national Austrian guidelines, which include the key components of the WSP by the WHO. The tool provides an overview of the required steps, explains how to carry out each step and guides the user through the three key components: system and hazards assessment, control measures and operational monitoring, and management. The practical application of the WSP tool was tested at 12 water utilities over a period of three months.

However, recent studies suggest that the operational challenges associated with meeting this objective may be heavily dependent not only upon a firm's internal modification, mix, and new product flexibilities, but also upon the flexibility of its inbound and outbound supply chain partners. Drawing upon the theory of Complementarity, we examine if simultaneous utilization of both internal and external flexibilities does in fact create synergies that can improve a firm's delivery performance. Based on a sample of 158 U.S. manufacturing plants, we find that the extent to which performance enhancing synergies are generated is primarily dependent upon the type of internal flexibility that is paired with supply chain flexibilities. Additionally, we find that when synergies do exist, external supplier and logistics flexibilities generally tend to enhance the scope of flexible response, while internal flexibilities generally tend to enhance the achievability of a flexible response. Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of firms to actually reap the synergistic benefits of an integrated system of supply chain flexibility is much more complex and nuanced than previously believed or expected.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Models are widely used in many fields related with WDN planning and operation. Therefore, the main contribution of this work is to provide an automatic procedure to build models with the well-known EPANET tool in a manner that, with a small amount of input data and a few clicks, the user can build a network topology and assign suitable pipe diameters. For that purpose, a new application, called WaterNetGen, was designed and implemented as an extension to the EPANET software. WaterNetGen can be used to generate synthetic models of WDN, with several hundred nodes and pipes, within a few minutes. The sizing capability allows the selection of commercial diameters, such that the final network design satisfies certain user-defined design constraints, like minimum diameter, maximum velocity and minimum pressure. The total water demand is allocated to the pipes taking into account their length and a demand coefficient. The water demand of each pipe is then assigned to its start and end nodes and follows a specific demand pattern.</jats:p>",

With the advanced development of computer technology, it is getting easier to derive an acceptance sampling plan satisfying both the producer's and consumer's quality and risk requirements. However, all the available <jats:italic>QC tables</jats:italic> and computer software determine the sampling plan on a noneconomic basis. In this paper, we design an economic model to determine the optimal sampling plan in a two-stage supply chain that minimizes the producer's and the consumer's total quality cost while satisfying both the producer's and consumer's quality and risk requirements. Numerical examples show that the optimal sampling plan is quite sensitive to the producer's product quality. The product's inspection, internal failure, and postsale failure costs also have an effect on the optimal sampling plan.</jats:p>",

Thus, provitamin A carotenoids from plants represent an additional major dietary source of vitamin A for most of the world's population. Our aim was to estimate the contribution of β‐carotene to vitamin A supply in industrialized countries using available data from the literature. A total of 11 studies from 8 countries were used, representing data of 121 256 participants. Intakes of total vitamin A, provitamin A carotenoids, including β‐carotene were retrieved and used to calculate the retinol activity equivalents (RAE) utilizing current conversion factors. Mean total daily dietary intake of RAE was 1083±175. The mean β‐carotene intake was 3.9 mg/day. Preformed vitamin A accounts for nearly 65% of total vitamin A intake, carotenoids make up 35%. No statistical differences between men and women in total intake of retinol were observed. We conclude that a safe vitamin A intake in general cannot be reached by consuming only one component (vitamin A or β‐carotene) alone, even in Western countries where animal products are commonly available.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this type of market, resources are perishable and auctions are repeated over time with the same or a very similar set of agents. In this scenario it is advisable to use recurrent auctions: a sequence of auctions of any kind where the result of one auction may influence the following one. Some problems do appear in these situations, as for instance, the bidder drop problem, the asymmetric balance of negotiation power or resource waste, which could cause the market to collapse. Fair mechanisms can be useful to minimize the effects of these problems. With this aim, we have analyzed four previous fair mechanisms under dynamic scenarios and we have proposed a new one that takes into account changes in the supply as well as the presence of alternative marketplaces. We experimentally show how the new mechanism presents a higher average performance under all simulated conditions, resulting in a higher profit for the auctioneer than with the previous ones, and in most cases avoiding the waste of resources.</jats:p>",

The results of a hydroxyl radical scavenger experiment using spin-trapping/EPR technology to identify hydroxyl radicals (•OH) confirm that •OH were the main active species in the removal of oCNB during the ozonation process catalyzed by iron silicate. The catalytic activity of the iron silicate was related to a highly hydroxylated surface. It was confirmed that the surface hydroxyl groups on the iron silicate were the reaction sites between ozone and oCNB.</jats:p>",

Nesse contexto, as nascentes de água podem contribuir como solução alternativa para o abastecimento doméstico, por se encontrarem próximas ao consumo e sob o controle do usuário Isto é evidenciado no estudo das nascentes situadas no Assentamento Serra Grande, no município de Vitória de Santo Antão, Zona da Mata de Pernambuco. Foram identificadas, cadastradas e selecionadas nascentes perenes, para caracterização da qualidade e vazão das águas, objetivando avaliá-las para usos múltiplos, com prioridade ao abastecimento doméstico. Evidenciou-se que a vazão, mesmo em períodos de estiagem, possui potencial de atender às necessidades básicas dos agricultores, para beber, preparo de alimentos, banho, lavagem de utensílios e roupas e descarga em sanitários. Quanto à qualidade para uso doméstico, em geral a água atende aos limites sanitários, embora em alguns casos a presença de Escherichia coli exija recuperação da nascente e cloração cuidadosa da água. Pelos resultados, a produção de água em nascentes situadas em solos e clima predominantes na Zona da Mata do Nordeste brasileiro, permite atender às necessidades básicas de abastecimento doméstico de agricultores familiares isolados ou em pequenas vilas rurais, sendo uma alternativa aos sistemas convencionais de abastecimento, já identificada pelo governo federal em seus recentes planos de abastecimento de populações rurais difusas. Palavras-chave: recursos hídricos; gestão ambiental; desenvolvimento rural  The Springs as Supply Source of Rural Diffuse Population  ABSTRACTThe universalization of the water supply in Brazil is still a challenge that it seeks to be supplant, especially in relation to the service to rural diffuse population, where conventional systems do not respond to the demands of farming families dispersed. In this context, the water springs may contribute as a workaround for domestic supply, because they are close to consumption and under user control. This is evidenced in the study of springs located at Settlement Serra Grande, located in the city of Vitória de Santo Antão, Zona da Mata de Pernambuco. It has been identified, registered and selected perennial springs, to characterize the quality and water flow, aiming to evaluate them for multiple uses with priority to domestic supply. It was evident that the flow even during drought periods, has potential to meet the basic needs of farmers, for drinking, preparing meals, baths, wash utensils and clothes and flushing toilets. As for the quality for home use, generally water meets health limits although in some cases the presence of Escherichia coli, requires careful recovery of the source and chlorination of water. According to the results, the production of water in springs located in soils and climate prevailing in Zona da Mata of Brazilian northeastern, it allows to meet basic needs for domestic supply from family farmers in small villages or isolated rural villages, being an alternative to conventional supply, already identified by the federal government in their recent plans for the supply of rural diffuse population.  Keywords: water resources; environmental management; rural development</jats:p>"

Based on the classic formulation of travelling salesman problem (TSP), a mixed‐integer liner programming (MILP) is developed, whose objective function considers the profit, inventory deviations from the desired trajectories and price changes simultaneously. Model predictive control (MPC) approach is adopted to tackle the uncertain issues, as well as the inventory and price maintenance. The applicability of the proposed model and approach was illustrated by solving a supply chain example.

We asked how sediment supply varied among sites burned 2‐months to 5‐years previously, in comparison to unburned sagebrush steppe, across 500 km of southern Idaho, USA. We measured potential dust emissions (PM10, particles &lt;10<jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m diameter) in response to step changes in friction velocity (<jats:italic>u</jats:italic><jats:sub>*</jats:sub>), with a field‐based wind tunnel analog (PI‐SWERL, Portable In Situ Wind Erosion Laboratory). We evaluated how emissions, sediment supply, and a proxy of erodibility varied among the microsite soil patterning in these sites (shrub islands and interspaces). Emissions were three orders of magnitude greater on burned compared to unburned surfaces, especially where shrubs had existed and sites burned more recently. Greater emission rates were due to greater sediment supply, whereas the proxy of erodibility did not vary among the surfaces for dry conditions that prevail during large wind erosion events (near −150 MPa at the surface). Wetter surface conditions, similar to those after precipitation or snowmelt, resulted in less dust emission on a recently burned site. Dust supply increases in initial postfire years especially on microsites that previously had shrubs. Abundance of shrubs is responsive to management practices that affect prefire vegetation, and grazing‐induced increases in shrubs might, for example, render a site more vulnerable to dust emissions following fire.</jats:p>",

The CMI value for the Democratic Republic of Congo (CMIDRC = 0.347) as well as for Angola (CMIAngola = 0.351), ranged between 0.25 and 1, characteristic of a humid region, whereas CMI values for Botswana (CMIBotswana = 0.027) and South Africa (CMISouth Africa = 0.075) ranged between −0.6 and 0 or 0 and 0.25, characteristic of semi-arid to sub-humid regions. Namibia (CMINamibia = −0.125) has been experiencing drier conditions. The findings of this linear correlation analysis confirm a strong and significant relationship between DRC-Angola (r = 0.837), and a weak but significant relationship between Botswana–Namibia (r = 0.554) and South Africa–Namibia (r = 0.445) with regard to CMI, and suggest the possibility of transferring water from wetter to drier regions in the SADC study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We model the impact of information visibility in a two-level supply chain consisting of independent retailers who share upstream supply. The manufacturer supplies similar products to the two retailers and each retailer serves its independent end market. Retailers face one period of demand and satisfy the demand by ordering in the first period or back-ordering some of the demand and satisfying it in the second period. The wholesale price in the second period is decreasing in the total order size across the two retailers in the first period. This decrease in wholesale price captures the market learning effect of aggregate orders that has been extensively documented in empirical literature. We use a game-theoretic framework to investigate the ex-ante incentives for retailers to share their private demand information. We show that: (1) retailers have no incentives to share information about their private values when equilibrium order quantities are interior, i.e., the order size is between zero and the demand; (2) partial information sharing may be the equilibrium strategy for retailers when equilibrium order quantities are binding on the demand. Finally, numerical examples are provided for illustration. This paper thus identifies conditions under which different levels of information sharing may be the equilibrium outcomes in a supply chain. </jats:p>",

Risk management studies often ignore the wider supply chain context in which individual transactions take place. However, risk management strategies which are suitable to use when only a single transaction is considered may be inappropriate when other transactions in the supply chain are taken into account. This study addresses this issue by examining: (1) how risks arise as a result of interdependencies between the various transactions making up the supply chain; and (2) what types of contractual-based strategies actors can use to manage their risk exposure. To realize these aims, the study applies an extended Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) framework with a supply chain orientation. The framework illustrates how different types of interdependencies – pooled, sequential and reciprocal – expose companies to different sources of risk. Three strategies companies can use when facing barriers to risk minimization in sequentially interdependent supply chains are analyzed: risk transferring, risk altering and risk sharing. Examples from the agri-food sector are discussed to demonstrate the functioning of these strategies.</jats:p>",

We investigated the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and imports demand as well as between foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports supply of Pakistan for the time span of 37 years range from 1973 to 2009. Our analysis emphasized on the existence of long run equilibrium relationship between FDI and imports demand &amp; exports supply of Pakistan using econometric techniques (Co-integration Analysis and Error correction mechanism). The co-integration analysis of import demand showed stable long run equilibrium relation-ship between real import and FDI results of export expressed that FDI has positive relation with real exports in the long run, but the coefficient is statistically insignificant. It suggested that the inflow of FDI has largely been directed toward import-substitution industries or production for the domestic market while little has gone toward export-oriented industries. That is long run policies will be fruitful to be implemented. While the short term dynamics as analyzed by the error correction mechanism (ECM) revealed that the short term discrepancies were significant enough to not to converge toward equilibrium and will require a longer time to adjust back in both model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Internet is becoming increasingly important as a sales channel. Thus, most large retail firms have adopted a multi-channel strategy that includes both web-based channels and pre-existing offline channels. In this paper, we consider joint pricing and inventory/production decision problems for members in a monopoly two-stage dual-channel retailer supply chain. For a dual-channel retailer, pricing in one channel will affect the demand in the other channel. This subsequently affects the retailer's replenishment (ordering) decisions, which have an impact on the producer's inventory/production plans and wholesale price decisions. It is clear then that pricing decisions and inventory/production decisions are interacting in each member of the supply chain and among the members in the chain as well. In this paper, we analyze joint pricing and inventory/production problems under three scenarios by incorporating intra-product line price interaction in the EOQ model. We show that a unique equilibrium exists under certain realistic conditions. We also provide numerical results that offer insights for pricing strategies for the dual-channel retailer supply chain and for product design for different channels. </jats:p>",

Biological treatment of AsIII (major specie in groundwater) using AsIII-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) can be used as an effective pre-oxidation step followed by As removal onto zero valent iron-coated sand. However, the efficiency of As sorption could be affected by a possible development of the bacterial communities in the ZVI-coated sand system. The aims of this work were to study the role of the AOB communities on the filling material (sand or ZVI-coated sand) and to estimate simultaneous biological AsIII oxidation and As sorption onto ZVI in a single fixed-bed reactor. Thiomonas arsenivorans, an autotrophic AOB was inoculated in only one of two parallel fixed-bed reactors filled with sand mixed with 1% iron (wFe/wsand). Both reactors were then continuously fed with synthetic water containing 10 mg L−1 of AsIII under a high Hydraulic Residence Time (HRT) (4 h) for 23 days and then under lower HRT (1 h) for 10 days. 80% of total As were removed in the non-inoculated reactor under high HRT while only 15% were removed under HRT of 1 h. Hence HRT was a key operating parameter in the fixed-bed system. The inoculated AOB bacterial community could disturb the As sorption under high HRT, while the As removal efficiency under low HRT was better than in the absence of the inoculums. At the end of the experiment, ZVI (and/or its oxide products) was collected at different layers in both reactors. Residual adsorption capacities were evaluated with batch experiments which showed that some layers were not saturated and continued to remove As. PCR-DGGE of aoxB gene was also used to identify the distribution of AOB among these different layers.</jats:p>",

Leaf B concentration in the B– treatment decreased by 33% and 40% in young fully expanded and mature leaves, respectively. Larger differences were observed in the soluble B fraction that decreased by 65% in mature leaves. However, both total and soluble B concentrations in developing leaves were almost equal for both treatments exhibiting a pattern commonly observed in B‐remobilizing plants. On the other hand, amounts of B export in the phloem sap were small compared to other species in which B is highly mobile. The B export rate from source leaves was slightly increased under low B supply while that of sucrose was not affected. We conclude that the root concentrating mechanism contributes to the alleviation of B deficiency in eggplant under low B supply while B remobilization may also contribute to a lower degree.</jats:p>",

Postponement is important in this context because it is necessary to consider international transfers and tariffs, and it is important to appropriately account for the impact of postponement on total costs. Consideration of several key variables such as shipping point, customs tariff, and cost differences between countries is essential to derive full benefits from postponement strategy in global supply chains. International transfer of goods among countries in global automobile industry is complex and dynamic because of the multitude of factors that must be considered.

These firms attempt to address supply risk and threat to the triple bottom line through managing suppliers and inputs, and at the same time need to overcome the uncertainty raised by the unfamiliar host environment. An exploratory qualitative case study of two multinational food processing corporations in China finds their SSCM practices are impacted by the nature of the raw material inputs as well as local stakeholder expectations. In particular, government policy and media attention seems to influence the direction and choice of SSCM activities engaged in by the focal firms. Furthermore, the discussion also suggests a possible permanent effect may occur as stakeholder expectations and host country institutions evolve. The implication of this study is that food processors preparing to enter emerging markets should be aware that local stakeholder expectations may affect operations significantly more than previously expected. As such, these firms need to carefully evaluate their operations in the host market and seek balance between SSCM practices and local stakeholder expectations. This study extends existing research on SSCM, exploring practices among the agri-food industry in a developing economy, and points out a theoretical extension to the existing sustainable purchasing portfolio matrix.</jats:p>",

Different criteria—technical, economic, and financial—are highlighted in the farmers’ decision to adopt this production. A farm‐level model is proposed and incorporates these decision criteria. The objective is to test several incentive scenarios to encourage risk‐averse cereal farmers to plant trees. A multiperiod model of investment is built and tests possible adoption by farmers based on financial and structural parameters and according to the outlook of agricultural markets. The simulations show that if the cash crop prices fluctuate in the future and if farmers are risk averse the strategy of on‐farm diversification toward woody crops under contractual arrangements could be relevant for farmers to mitigate the risks in the long run.</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Cet article présente une analyse et une modélisation de la décision d’un agriculteur céréalier qui souhaite convertir une partie de sa surface en grande culture en Taillis à Courte Rotation (TCR). Un modèle multi‐périodique d’investissement est construit et incorpore différents critères techniques, économiques et financiers qui entrent dans la décision d’adopter ces nouvelles cultures pérennes. Le modèle permet de tester le rôle de différents types de soutiens, proposés aujourd’hui dans le cadre de la Politique Agricole Commune européenne, permettant d’encourager les agriculteurs averses au risque à planter des arbres. Les simulations montrent que si les prix des grandes cultures annuelles fluctuent à l’avenir, si la plantation d’arbres est soutenue et si les agriculteurs sont averses au risque, la stratégie de se diversifier vers la plantation d’arbres à croissance rapide, sous contrat, peut permettre d’atténuer le risque à long terme.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

A temperature and pressure sensing guide wire was used to derive microvascular resistance using the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), defined as the hyperemic distal pressure multiplied by the hyperemic mean transit time. Lesion severity was assessed using fractional flow reserve. For comparison, evaluation of an angiographically normal reference vessel from the same subject also was undertaken. Both simple IMR (sIMR) and IMR corrected for collateral flow (cIMR) were calculated. When collateral supply was not accounted for, there was a significant difference in IMR values between the culprit, the post PCI, and nonculprit values (culprit sIMR 26.68±2.06, nonculprit sIMR 18.37±1.89,\n              <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n              =0.002; post percutaneous intervention sIMR 18.5±1.94 versus culprit sIMR 26.68±2.06,\n              <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n              &lt;0.0001).

Outputs include the quantity of product manufactured, net returns and component values of milk (protein and fat) per month of year. Two milk supply profiles representative of mean calving dates of mid-February and mid-March were evaluated across three milk processing plants with differing capacities for cheese and casein. The analysis was carried out based on average Dutch National quotations over the period 2008–10. The mid-February mean calving date resulted in a lower peak supply with proportionately more milk produced in the months of January–March and October–December, which resulted in higher net returns across the three capacities analysed. Increasing the cheese and casein processing capacity resulted in higher net returns being generated.</jats:p>",

However, the lack of micro‐level data, as well as computational requirements, necessitate the aggregation of individual producers into representative units when working at the sectoral level. This usually leads to unrealistic extreme specialization in supply responses. In 1982, McCarl introduced the “historical crop mixes” approach to avoid extreme specialization. We extend this approach by generating additional synthetic crop mixes using supply response elasticities and systematically varied commodity prices. In addition to avoiding extreme specialization, this approach provides flexibility when future supply responses can be vastly different from past responses. An application to U.S. biofuel policy analysis is presented.</jats:p>",

A strong negative correlation between stomatal size (\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            ) and stomatal density (\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            ) was observed, suggesting that factors that control\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            also affect\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            . Under some but not all conditions, mutant plants exhibited abnormal stomatal density responses to CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            concentration, suggesting that the EPF signalling pathway may play a role in the environmental adjustment of\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            . In response to reduced water availability, maximal stomatal conductance was adjusted through reductions in\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            , rather than\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            . Plant size negatively correlated with\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            .

The growth of these plants was also less adversely affected by reduced water availability than plants with higher\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            , indicating that plants with low\n            <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>\n            may be well suited to growth under predicted future atmospheric CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            environments and/or water-scarce environments.\n          </jats:p>",
