      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Europe, there is a greater tendency to use groundwater than in the United States. Treatment is thereby restricted to the removal of iron and manganese by aeration and to rapid sand filtration. Where surface water is used, the trend is towards a rapid prefiltration followed by slow sand filtration, in general avoiding the use of chemicals except for final chlorination. Such treatment of surface waters requires large areas, and it remains to be seen whether in the future there will be a tendency to restrict the area devoted to water treatment, and thus require introduction of chemical coagulation. Methods of waste treatment seem to be much the same as are employed in the United States; however, high degrees of treatment are required and conventional treatment is generally adopted, with so‐called high‐rate treatment not in general use. Integrated water management, with regard to both flow and quality, in the Netherlands and Germany are of special interest to engineers in the United States who will soon face problems of intense water development.</jats:p>",
