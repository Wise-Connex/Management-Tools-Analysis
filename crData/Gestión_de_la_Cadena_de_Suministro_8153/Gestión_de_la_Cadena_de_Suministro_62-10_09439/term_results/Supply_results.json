This occasion is serving at wofold purpose for me; en opportunity to fraternize with many of my old friends and colleagues, end the honor of addressing en organization of which I am a card-carrying member. It is always a pleasure to meet with an engineering group because, in my opinion, there are more men of genius, pluck and determination to win, engaged in engineering then in any other profession.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The word \"interdependence\" has perhaps been too widely used recently, but whether we like it or not, the problems of oil are entwined with broader problems everywhere.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The petroleum industry of the Free World today is deeply influenced by two dominant sets of factors that give rise to severe stresses within the industry's structure and create major uncertainties as to the future direction of its development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first of these elements is the worldwide excess in the capacity to produce, to refine, and to transport oil. This progressive imbalance between world consumption of petroleum products and ability to produce is generating intensive, and sometimes disruptive, competition in oil marketing. It is creating instability in the entire world petroleum price structure.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The second cause of stress is far more complex. It is a reflection of the new trend in world affairs characterized by the fading of the colonial system end the emergence of a succession of new, inexperienced, end sometimes unstable political units. Radical changes are occurring in many areas where established social end economic patterns are being put aside or are under attack.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Some of the fundamental problems relating to petroleum are revealed by examination of the contrast between the location of the major consuming area send the location of the major oil reserves of the Free World. The consumption of oil, of course, is concentrated in the industrially developed areas such as the United States and Europe, whereas most known reserves are located in less developed areas such as the Middle East.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A versatile RC-filtered power supply and a calibrated direct-coupled amplifier are described. The power supply furnishes operating power to various electronic devices developed for two large introductory laboratories. It provides about 250 V dc at its rated output of 70 mA, and 2.5 A at 6.3 V ac. The direct-coupled amplifier has 6 output ranges, from 0.5 to 150 V full scale. Its normal input resistance is 22 MΩ, with stable operation at input resistances of 125 MΩ being practical. Output is displayed on an external 100-μA meter. The method of achieving calibration accuracies of ±2% or better, using ±10% tolerance carbon resistors is described. Both instruments are stable and extremely reliable, requiring only standard commercial components and conventional tools and techniques for construction. The cost for parts is $16.26 and $22.05, respectively. The article contains full information regarding construction.</jats:p>",
