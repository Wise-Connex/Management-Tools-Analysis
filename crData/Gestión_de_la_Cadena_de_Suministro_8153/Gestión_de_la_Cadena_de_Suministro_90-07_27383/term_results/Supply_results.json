Yet global or theatre based manufacturing strategies are lengthening lead times, extending supply chains and increasing risk of both excessive inventory and poor customer service. Logistics strategies to manage the conflicting interests of manufacturing and marketing and distribution have proved difficult to evolve. Strategic Lead Time Management is a computer modelling approach designed to identify and maximize the value added: cost added ratio in supply chain design. It is based on simulating the relationship between organisational process and procedure and the flow of inventory through the supply chain. This paper describes the approach and the results that can be achieved.</jats:p>",

Results from a major survey of shippers, warehousers and transportation providers are used to illustrate the risks and benefits. Means of minimizing the potential risks are also suggested. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues in supply chain management that would benefit from further analysis and research. These issues include determination of whether a firm should use a supply chain management approach, the management structure to use in supply chain management, and modelling supply chain management systems.</jats:p>",

Myocardial oxygen supply and oxygen consumption were determined during baseline and atrial pacing conditions 30 days after New Zealand White rabbits were prepared as one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive or uninephrectomized sham control rabbits. Coronary blood flow and cardiac output, using radioactive microspheres, and small vessel oxygen saturations, using microspectrophotometry, were measured in hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied hearts. After 30 days, baseline blood pressure was significantly higher in the Goldblatt rabbits compared with sham controls, and hypertension was maintained during pacing. The myocardium was hypertrophied in the Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits compared with sham controls. Baseline heart rates were not different between animal groups (242 +/- 32 and 244 +/- 24 beats/min, respectively). Both groups were paced 35% above baseline heart rates; during pacing, cardiac output was similar to baseline values in the sham controls (304 +/- 99 versus 321 +/- 116 ml/min, respectively) but reduced in the hypertensive rabbits (248 +/- 43 versus 325 +/- 62 ml/min). Myocardial oxygen consumption increased twofold in both nonhypertrophied and hypertrophied ventricles during tachycardia. Oxygen extraction was significantly elevated, but coronary blood flow was not altered during pacing in either animal group. Therefore, at the pacing level chosen the diminished function in cardiac hypertrophy was not associated with reduced oxygen consumption. Conversely, reduced efficiency during pacing in the hypertrophied myocardium was suggested.</jats:p>",

A principal consequência tem sido a aceleração da concentração da renda nacional, em relação à parcela do trabalho. Para resolver esse problema e aumentar os salários reais, o governo deve adotar um programa na direção do desenvolvimento econômico. Para que isso seja possível, é necessário: (a) concentrar o investimento na produção de bens de consumo; (b) estimular a demanda de bens salariais e (c) utilizar os preços externos “normais” como indicador de preços ao produtor agrícola brasileiro.</jats:p>"

In Expt 1, two groups (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 6) of ewes were fed on diets that were either high (15 g crade protein (N × 6.25; CP)/MJ metabolizable energy (ME)) or low (10 g CP/MJ ME) in protein content, and concurrent N and mineral balance studies were made at intervals during lactation with <jats:sup>45</jats:sup>Ca and <jats:sup>32</jats:sup>P being used to monitor faecal endogenous calcium and phosphorus losses. Ewes fed on the high-protein diet maintained a positive N balance during early lactation, whereas those fed on the low-protein diet were in negative N balance. Both groups, however, showed the same degree of negative Ca and P balance, with the amounts lost being directly related to milk yield. This indicates that loss of mineral from the skeleton at this time is not secondary to a loss of bone matrix due to a shortfall in dietary protein supply. In Expt 2, two groups of ewes (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 4) were fed on diets in late pregnancy that were either just adequate or generous in Ca and P supply relative to requirement (TCORN, 1990). After parturition both groups were fed on a diet which was formulated to meet their estimated Ca and P requirements for lactation. As in the previous experiment both groups were in negative Ca and P balance in early lactation and variation in dietary Ca and P supply during pregnancy had no effect on the extent of this loss. Alternative explanations for the cause of this loss of mineral from the skeleton are discussed.</jats:p>",
