      "abstract": "<jats:p>As South Africa strives to be a major force in global markets, it is essential that South African supply chains achieve and maintain a competitive advantage. One approach to achieving this is to ensure that South African supply chains maximise their levels of efficiency. Consequently, the efficiency levels of South Africa’s supply chains must be evaluated. The objective of this article is to propose a model that can assist South African industries in becoming internationally competitive by providing them with a tool for evaluating their levels of efficiency both as individual firms and as a component in an overall supply chain. The Composite Supply Chain Efficiency Model (CSCEM) was developed to measure supply chain efficiency across supply chains using variables identified as problem areas experienced by South African supply chains. The CSCEM is tested in this article using the Sishen-Saldanda iron ore supply chain as a case study. The results indicate that all three links or nodes along the Sishen-Saldanha iron ore supply chain performed well. The average efficiency of the rail leg was 97.34%, while the average efficiency of the mine and the port were 97% and 95.44%, respectively. The results also show that the CSCEM can be used by South African firms to measure their levels of supply chain efficiency. This article concludes with the benefits of the CSCEM.</jats:p>"

But recently, a number of studies have begun to take a dyadic perspective, acknowledging that both parties in a buyer–supplier relationship may possess divergent perspectives on many issues. Unlike existing dyadic‐view studies that have examined perceptual differences in general, we extend this dyadic‐view stream of the literature and examine perceptual differences in the face of an impending supply disruption event. Using a scenario‐based experiment, our results suggest that suppliers seem to have a greater expectation of both buyer opportunism and relationship continuance than what the buyers actually reported. Our results also indicate that the supplier seems to underestimate the influence of relational norms on relationship continuance more so than the buyer. Also, our results indicate that there is no significant difference between the supplier's and buyer's perceptions of the impact of buyer dependence on opportunism. Our findings suggest that both members of an exchange relationship should carefully manage the expectations and norms with their counterparts, particularly when the relationship might be strained by a supply disruption.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Orientation: In today’s globalised and complex business environment, firms are ever more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, originating both internally and externally from the supply chain. Supply chain resilience minimises the impact of a disruption through design approaches, which allows the supply chain to respond appropriately to disruptive events.Research purpose: This article investigated the supply chain risks faced by grocery manufacturers in the South African fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry and explored supply chain design approaches that enable supply chain resilience.Motivation for the study: South African grocery manufacturers are faced with distinct risks. Whilst supply chain risk management studies have provided firms with certain guidelines to mitigate risk, supply chains are still vulnerable to unanticipated risks. Literature on supply chain resilience in the South African context is scant. The concept of supply chain resilience provides firms with strategies that are built into the supply chain that allow firms to react and recover swiftly from disruptions. Furthermore, supply chain resilience strategies assist firms in becoming less vulnerable to possible disruptions.Research design approach and method: This study was conducted by using a descriptive qualitative research design. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with senior supply chain practitioners specifically within the South African FMCG grocery manufacturing industry.Main findings: The study found that labour unrest is the most common risk faced by the industry. Furthermore, strategic stock and supply chain mapping are of the most useful design approaches to enhance supply chain resilience.Practical/managerial implications: The study provides managers with new insights in guiding supply chain design decisions for resilient supply chains. Through the identification of risks and appropriate solutions linked to the various risks, the study allows managers an array of options to choose from when enforcing a resilient supply chain.Contribution/ value-add: The study contributes to the body of knowledge by being one of the first empirical studies conducted on supply chain design approaches for supply chain resilience in the South African context. The study also adds to the scarce literature on supply chain resilience in the FMCG industry, both globally and in a South African context.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: In this dynamic business environment, manufacturers are focusing primarily on delivery performance and competitive pricing to win orders. It is essential that manufacturers adopt flexible procurement systems (FPSs) in such an uncertain environment for business sustainability.Objectives: The purpose of the study is to identify the elements of FPSs and model the interrelationships between elements of FPSs and, finally, to understand how FPSs are linked with supply chain sustainability.Method: Besides providing a brief conceptual review of FPSs, the study largely illustrates the use of an innovative multi-criteria decision-making approach called total interpretive structural modelling (TISM).Results: The total interpretive structural modelling–based model evaluates the causality and illustrates elements with interpretation of relations and suggests that bottom-level elements are vital for sustainability in FPSs and avert risks. Secondly, strategic sourcing is positively influencing supplier integration. Thirdly, supplier integration positively influences supplier responsiveness. Fourthly, skills of flexible procurement workforce positively influence supplier integration. Fifthly, it is found that supplier integration positively influences flexible transportation. The sixth finding suggests that supplier integration positively influences eco-friendly packaging. The seventh finding highlights that supplier integration positively influences ISO 14001 certifications. The eighth finding explains that supplier responsiveness positively influences customer satisfaction. It is also observed that flexible transport reduces operational cost and environmental costs. The second last finding explains eco-friendly packaging and reduction in environmental cost by careful selection of packing material and chemicals. Lastly, it is found that ISO 14001/environmental certifications reduce environmental costs by greening suppliers and pressurises them to follow environmental norms. This helps in reducing wastage and developing alternate raw materials, which are eco-friendly in nature. Environmental certifications of suppliers help in improving the image of the buyer firm in the business environment and attract more customers.Conclusion: It is found that FPSs have a positive relationship with supply chain sustainability. In the end, the author highlights implications for supply chain practitioners and researchers.Keywords: Flexible Procurement; Sustainability; Supply chain network; TISM</jats:p>"

The more reliable and efficient SC, the more profits a company can generate and the easier to compete globally. This research aims to explore Northern Minnesota enterprises strategies, practices, and information systems technologies that are used for managing their supply chains. An online survey is used to collect information on three questions: What are the major challenges with the use of information systems for SCM in Northern Minnesota? What is the level of satisfaction of current strategies and practices that are used in SCM? What are the actual needs for the effective use of SCM information systems? The reliability of the survey has been insured by conducting a polite study of the survey by three companies. SPSS program is used to analyze the collected data. Descriptive analysis is used to present and explain the results. This research may help managers to determine the needs to improve their supply chains.

For electronic device manufacturers, it is important that processes are in place to facilitate the seamless integration of both forms throughout the engineering, production, distribution and support stages of the product lifecycle. This chapter examines the role of physical and virtual supply chain innovation strategies in electronic device supply chains by exploring the commonalities and differences between the design, manufacturing, and distribution models of digital and physical elements.

Therefore a strong supply chain policy for the distribution of such food in various parts of country, a proper plan for optimal distribution of the procured food grains among such population is required. Any failure in any of the channel of this system procurement-transportation-warehousing-transportation-distribution system can lead to large scale famine in the effected region of country. Therefore, it is very important to maintain entire supply chain from farmers to the beneficiary is managed in an integrated manner.</jats:p>"

Qualitative interviews where conducts with five (5) professionals which were part of the construction supply chain team that completed the DEA project in South Africa. Findings summary were that the South African construction industry exists in a very dynamic and volatile environment with common challenges as evident in other countries. This challenge, necessitates the use of collaborative means of managing the various phases of the supply chain. It was also found that the use of collaborative models such as Public Private Partnership (PPP) can prove rewarding when stakeholders involved in a project have an understanding of the model and its dynamics. This chapter contributes to the use of PPP collaborative models in construction project delivery in South Africa. </jats:p>"

The first question is “What is a resilient supply chain?” The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of resilience and to distinguish a supply chain which is resilient from one which is not. The second question is “Why companies should build a resilient supply chain?” Some factors have increased firms' vulnerability and the losses associated with unpredictable events. Companies should understand that the advantages linked to building resilience do not become evident only in case of disastrous events, but also during the ordinary operations execution. The third question is: “How to build resilience?” The most relevant ways to build resilience will be illustrated by drawing on some short case studies that were purposefully chosen in order to present a practical implementation of some of the different techniques used to create resilience. At the end of the chapter, conclusion, managerial implications, limitations and directions for future research will be provided. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Although conveyancing is a legal term, business management and specifically operations management principles also apply to the processes involved in conveyancing. From a business perspective, each organisation is usually concerned with its own profit margins and processes. In our global market, however, organisations now realise that they can no longer compete successfully on the basis of their internal operational efficiencies alone. They are therefore constantly aware of the need to improve not only their internal processes but also their alignment with other supply chain linkages in an effort to optimise the performance of the whole supply chain. Such alignment, in the conveyancing environment, includes government departments that are generally less willing to adopt business principles, which in turn makes optimisation of the whole supply chain more difficult.Objectives: The article describes a supply chain perspective of the conveyancing processes in South Africa and reports some of the factors that influence and delay conveyancing transactions. It explores possibilities of collaborative relationships between different role players in the conveyancing supply chain. It aims to show that a supply chain approach, as opposed to a singular organisational approach, can help to reduce process bottlenecks and delays in order to improve overall process efficiency.Method: The research, on which the findings are based, was exploratory in nature and followed a mixed-methods (quantitative or qualitative) approach and included both structured questionnaires and personal interviews.Results: The results of the study revealed that many different types of delays occur at various entities across the whole supply chain involved in property transfers. These delays are presented in a table and diagram.Conclusion: It is recommended that greater adoption of electronic technology across the whole supply chain would improve overall efficiency, eliminate bottlenecks and contribute towards efforts to optimise the conveyancing supply chain in South Africa. In addition, it is also recommended that the South African deeds registry implement an electronic system which would allow for the electronic lodging of property transfers.Keywords: e-conveyancing; electronic processes; digitisation of data; supply chain management; integration</jats:p>"

First, it expands on the Fisher framework by empirically establishing the link between the firm's environmental characteristics and the firm's level of supply chain fit (SCF). The results indicate a negative relationship between environmental uncertainty and SCF indicating that, as the level of environmental uncertainty increases it becomes increasingly challenging to match a product's supply and demand characteristics with its supply chain design characteristics. Second, the key contribution of this research is the introduction of supply chain agility as a capability that helps mitigate the negative relationship between aspects of environmental uncertainty and SCF. Finally, this research contributes to theory development and managerial practice by exploring the complex relationship between SCF, supply chain agility, and financial performance. Developing high levels of supply chain agility and SCF requires deployment of resources for the focal firm. This manuscript provides a better understanding of how such expenditures can generate financial benefits for organizations.</jats:p>",

But it is especially written for those who desire an intricate and detailed knowledge of how and why these policies worked with respect to the supply of adequate credit for economic development. A thorough examination of key credit institutions and their specific powers, functions, mechanisms, context, and economic impact brings the reader to a recognition of which policies and institutions were successful and unsuccessful in supporting the economy and preventing crisis. \r\n\r\nIts extensive use of primary sources, period literature, and carefully chosen quotations allows the reader to participate in the original discussion and issues that faced Americans in each era. This vivid account leads to a unique grasp of relationships between essential facts, ideas, and time periods. The reader is rewarded with the rare experience of seeing the evolution of three hundred years of policy development as an integrated process. \r\n\r\nThe book’s content will be new and provoking to the academic, policy maker, and economist, but is presented in a manner and style ensuring comprehension for a general audience and those new to the topics involved. Many of the lessons learned in the course of the investigation are relevant and applicable to modern economic and financial policies. \r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

A systematic literature review was carried out to identify relevant examples of both successful and unsuccessful knowledge management systems. These are analyzed in terms of process, people and technology aspects, and the activities in the knowledge life-cycle (create, acquire, store, use, refine, transfer) that they support. These include systems used within a single organization, systems shared with supply chain partners, and systems shared with customers, the latter being the least common. Notable features are that more systems support knowledge exploitation than knowledge exploration, and that general-purpose software (e.g., internet search, database) is used more than software specific to knowledge management (e.g., data mining, “people finder”). The widespread use of mobile devices and social media offers both an opportunity and a challenge for future knowledge management systems development. </jats:p>"

This article outlines supply chain collaboration, which is a critical strategy for the field of supply chain management. While firms have traditionally operated in a manner that only considers their own well-being, a transition is occurring where open market relationships are diminishing and cooperation, coordination, and collaboration are becoming much more common. There are several key dimensions of collaboration that serve as drivers to its success, and firms that engage in these activities should experience closer relationships with channel partners and ultimately achieve higher levels of success. While this issue has been thoroughly covered in the logistics and supply chain management literature, its limited implementation and lack of widespread success provides evidence that the topic should continue to be a focal point in future research. </jats:p>"

In other words aim here to identify the key indicators for measuring retail supply chain performance. A qualitative approach is adopted. Published literature from refereed journals on supply chain performance measurement has been considered. Besides the need for organizations to adopt a holistic approach, firms remain focused on traditional financial measures (gross profit margin, Interest coverage, and debt and equity ratios). The chapter identifies key indicators for performance measurement and classifies them into four major categories: transport optimization, information technology optimization, inventory optimization and resource optimization. These key indicators are arranged precisely for retail industry. From a supply chain perspective, the non financial measures such as on-time delivery, training of employees, warehouse layout, etc. are also important aspects of measuring supply chain performance. Further research can be carried out to validate the relevance and applicability of identified indicators. The study can be further conducted to measure the interrelationships between the KPIs and their impact on financial performance of the firm. In this chapter the author attempts to identify the performance indicators specifically for retail supply chain. The identified measures are further categorized based on its operations.</jats:p>"

If the carbon emissions are not reduced, they will continue to grow exponentially. South Africa’s emissions are placed in the top 20 in the world when considering per capita emissions.Objectives: The aim of the research article was to investigate how the impact of implementing environmental initiatives on business profitability and sustainability can best be quantified in a South African business.Method: Various methods, theories and best practices were researched to aid in the development of the green business profitability framework. This framework was applied to two case studies in different areas of the supply chain of a South African fast-moving consumer goods business.Results: Results indicated that the green profitability framework can be used successfully to quantify both the environmental and profitability impact of green supply chain initiatives. The framework is therefore more suitable for the South African company than other existing frameworks in the literature because of its ability to quantify both profitability and sustainability in short- and long-term planning scenarios.Conclusion: The results from the case studies indicated that the green business profitability framework enabled the tracking of environmental initiatives back to logistics operations and profitability, which makes it easier to understand and implement. The developed framework also helped to link the carbon emissions to source, and to translate green supply chain actions into goals. </jats:p>"

The overall results highlight the importance of a holistic approach to international supply chain management. Findings from Samsung's smart phone production network and Tesco's global distribution suggest that firms are able to be successful when they exploit specific opportunities wherever they are located in the world. Whilst Samsung have been successful with keeping in-house production, Airbus are doing well with outsourcing. The Airbus case highlights the importance of risk management in global supply chains.

Like most of start-up entrepreneurs in other industries, food entrepreneurs have their challenges of identifying market opportunities, building a trusted management team, and securing funding sources to run the businesses. They also need facilities to produce their foods, the facilities needed to be certified by local food authorities, securing product liability insurance, and marketing channels to distribute their food products.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Majority of research conducted in Supply Chain Management worldwide relates to areas of supply chain like, definitions, its frameworks and strategies, supply chain design, achievement of competitive advantage through its successful implementation etc. But, vast part of this research is limited to only large scale enterprises and very limited research is done in supply chain related to SMEs sector. Also, the strategies and frameworks of SCM that are developed for these large enterprises are found to be not suitable and implementable in small scale enterprises. This lack of research with special focus on SCM is more pertinent to Indian SMEs and its much more less in small enterprises belonging to manufacturing sector. It is found that most of the strategies of SCM applicable and implementable in large enterprises are either difficult to implement or SMEs do not view those strategies seriously due to lack of understanding, implementation feasibility and awareness. Thus, there are many differences in the way the SCM is viewed and understood in SMEs when compared to that of large enterprises. This paper focuses on these differences of SCM with reference to challenges and difficulties in implementations when compared with large enterprises with the help of literature review. It is found that there exists a huge gap in understanding, appreciating and utilizing the practices of SCM in SME sector. The research is limited only to the secondary data available in published national / international journals. It is identified that SCM can be a potential tool for competitive advantage, cost minimization and optimal decision-making, risk-sharing in SMEs also. The paper identified the gaps, challenges and opportunities for SMEs in the implementation of SCM. </jats:p>"

Based on this deficit, the authors developed the Supply Chain Improvement System (SCIS). This chapter will present the theoretical concept of the SCIS and provide the reader with two case studies that consider how to apply it in entrepreneurial practice.

This chapter analyzes the costs and benefits from the perspective of suppliers in SCSIs by focal companies. Furthermore, impact of suppliers-specific characteristics (firm size, resources dependence setting and self-sustainability) on SCSIs are investigated. According to the findings, we propose a performance implication-based conceptual model of SCSIs from the perspective of suppliers. We conclude that costs of SCSIs happen immediately to suppliers in implementation, but the benefits are expected in long run. These suppliers-specific characteristics are the decisive factors if suppliers can survive over short-run costs and reach the long-run benefits.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management involves efficiently integrating suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, stores, and customers. To survive in a highly competitive business environment, manufacturing, resource planning and scheduling and distribution operations are the significant drivers that need to be optimized within supply chain management. In this chapter, we design the supply chain system considering dual demand management strategies simultaneously for the same company, both engineer-to-order (ETO) and make-to-order (MTO). This research has been inspired from the window manufacturer which manufactures and distributes vinyl windows to meet new construction and replacement/remodeling sector demand in the State of Ohio. The company manufacturers windows based on make-to-order strategy for new construction projects and at the same time builds replacement windows to individual customer specifications in very small quantities to be used for replacement in homes. In this study, a total of 174 individual customers and six big contractors are considered throughout the State of Ohio. This paper proposes to separate products based on demand management strategy and develop different supply chain networks for each group. The idea is to design bigger facilities for high volume (make-to-order products) as transportation cost per unit is reduced due to economies of scale whereas to place smaller and more facilities for low volume engineer-to-order products to be closer to the clients where it may not feasible to carry a only few products over long distances. All in all, this study provides nested models to integrate both design and operational aspects of supply chain system in the presence high-volume and low-volume of window products. Moreover, all location, design and manufacturing operations are performed by considering new mathematical models (mixed-integer and integer mathematical models) and heuristics in engineer-to-order demand management environment. Normally-distributed, probabilistic demand environment is considered in our design and operational phase of the study. Preliminary results show that, each design has its own strategic advantage and outcome and the ultimate objective has been accomplished in our design in this study. Briefly, four manufacturing facilities are established to meet the demand of replacement/remodeling sector and two manufacturing facilities are situated to meet the demand of new construction sector. The results revealed that, 29 layered-cells and a total of 200 machines are opened and utilized for replacement/remodeling sector. Additionally, 15 layered-cells and a total of 104 machines are needed to cover the entire demand of new construction sector. Also for the new construction sector, three distribution centers are needed to facilitate the products over the region. In terms of daily cell loading and scheduling phase, the results are almost doubled in replacement/remodeling sector demand compared to new construction sector demand volume due to having more cells and machines in the new construction design strategy. The supply chain work involves location and number of manufacturing facilities, number and location of distribution centers, detailed design of manufacturing systems and performing scheduling to confirm the validity of the manufacturing system design. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a supply chain network, facilities are the primary components where a product is manufactured or stored. During the phase of design of a supply chain network, a company decides how to configure the supply chain over the next several years. Key driver of supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency will be taken into consideration in the decision process and the decisions include the role assigned to each facility, its capacity to perform the assigned role, the number and location of the facilities. Since supply chain design decisions pertaining to facilities are typically made for the long term and are very expensive to alter on short notice, the decisions must take into account uncertainty in anticipated market conditions over the next few years. Decisions regarding facilities are therefore a crucial part of supply chain design. This chapter explains the practical application of theories, concepts and frameworks in the area of Supply Chain Design, Risk Mitigation and Social Networks. The practical application is based on a case study of ABC, one of the world's leading agribusiness companies with global operations that made a successful foray in emerging markets facilitated by sound decisions pertaining to the design of its global supply chain network.

As retailers choose to concentrate either on product leadership private-label or high touch customer intimacy or on cost leadership strategies, their supply chain priorities and investment decisions are tailored to the specific requirements. While retail is extremely diverse, but retailers across the globe share many priorities — balance the availability of the inventory; control the costs and customer service in order to maintain the retail strategy. Our effort has been to explore how retailers are managing these priorities and getting ready for future.</jats:p>"

Our findings argue the pertinence of a Hybrid Supply Chain model combining elements of the Lean, Agile and Leagile paradigms upstream and the Project Management paradigm downstream in the case of a Wind Turbine Manufacturer. We also find that, depending on the complexity of the market and supply diversity, multiple decoupling points emerge. Through the present Wind Energy Supply Chain case, we find that for effective management of a global supply chain characterized by a high number of references and multiple technologies, it is necessary to mix different manufacturing paradigms in order to provide a quick, agile and competitive response to the customer. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains today are, primarily, measured by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as order-fulfillment, availability to the consumer (percent in-stock) and cost reduction, as well as financial KPIs such as return on investment (ROI), return on brand equity and inventory. These KPIs measure the performance of supply chain as a whole. A supply chain is a network of nodes. The performances of individual nodes are measured with KPIs such as production rate, shipment rate, inventory and the like. These metrics may indicate the performance but may not indicate the cause of such performance. For example, a node whose production rate is below the desired level may be because of poor supply of inputs of production by its supplier node.Thus mere identification of KPIs and their evaluation will not enable to identify the root cause of a problem in a supply chain. Therefore, we need a business intelligence framework that will satisfy the objectives, namely, identification of outcome of each node of the supply chain and its cause. The existing Supply Chain Intelligence (SCI) frameworks aims at identifying metrics that reflect the performance of individual nodes and the total supply chain, but fail to identify the cause of such outcomes. It implies that the linkages or association between the KPIs of individual nodes are required to be identified and defined. In this paper, contingency and systems approach has been used to identify the dimensions of the firm, its internal environment, the complement and the external environment. A system dynamics based approach has been used to identify the causality and resulting behavior of the supply chain. The paper proposes a SCI framework and a System dynamics Model that help in identifying the reasons for supply chin performance and lead to the actions required to be taken for improvement in performance of the supply chain. </jats:p>"

The supply chain firms put an extra effort to develop and run in the most effective &amp; efficient ways possible. There are issues of concern that need attention, like huge losses in perishables (food) because of infrastructural deficiencies. The demand for food remains highly unfulfilled in most of the country and outside in spite of high production of food. This is because of highly ineffective, inadequate and very weak supply chains for food that require temperature controlled conditions to retain quality and safety of food and curb the decay process. An effective food retail supply chain thus becomes vital (Bourkakis and Weightman, 2004).Supply chains for perishable and time-sensitive products, pose specific and unique challenges. The temperature controlled supply chains or cold chains are a significant proportion of the retail food market which is still in the nascent stage. </jats:p>"

Evidence is provided from an unexplored area which is likely to bring new insights into export barrier literature primarily focused on lower emerging economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study identified four main export barriers; which are logistics, functional, marketing and financial barriers. The study concluded that management of firms have to be proactive in disassembling export barriers to enable a commanding role in pursuit for strong economic and industrial development in African and beyond. </jats:p>"

Any convenience store should have assortment which is more suitable for the local target customers but the company might receive the inventory from multiple sources. In this chapter we have proposed a new way to handle the supply chain for the convenience store, that is, Hub and Spoke model between Hypermarket/Supermarket/Supercenter and Convenience store. In this model Spoke (Convenience Store) receives all inventory from single source, that is, Hub (Hypermarket/Supermarket/Supercenter), hence there is a significant reduction in the logistics cost. This will allow the retailer to be more focused on customer service which in turn will make more loyalists for the store.</jats:p>"

Information security is a key component of supply chain security, and this study aims to identify the factors that influence the compliance behaviour with respect to information security. A related objective is to understand the extent to which compliance was substantive or symbolic. Adopting a qualitative approach, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders based in New Zealand who are involved in international supply chains. The interviews find that compliance behaviour is affected by the influence of other organizations, organizational perceptions of compliance, and the rules and norms of exchange in different contexts. The results also indicate that compliance behaviour is more symbolic than substantive in the supply chain environment.</p>",

The research design for this paper includes a combination of literature review and a survey of 220 and 170 practitioners from four and two automobile manufacturing companies located in Northern India and Western India, respectively. Structural Equation Modelling Techniques (SEM) has been used to examine the relationships among the variables and to test the goodness fit of the proposed model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In global, short-life-cycle supply chains, the Make-to-Order (MTO) principle of purchasing is dominant in securing the match between customers' commitment and ordered goods. Risk can be addressed by linking knowledge on inbound logistics to the market by use of e-business solutions. This chapter describes a multi-method approach using both traditional B2B and B2C methods of sales initiatives as an e-business system connecting inbound and outbound supply chains. Initiatives can be reverse auctions, time limited discounts, co-selling, bundling, short campaigns supported with letters, e-mails, giveaways, discount schemes, and payment conditions. Interlinking is to secure full transparency at any given point in time. The discussed solution has the potential of diverting goods to retailers instead of warehouses with the probable effect of increasing revenue of both wholesale and retail with 5 – 10%. Concurrently, the attention created from selling on-ship creates side effects like higher store replenishment rate and attracts frequent shoppers interested in continuously new offerings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A crystal ball methodology that foresees the future is probably one of the most sought-after tools by any organization operating in this ever-changing world. The ability to correctly navigate through uncertainties and drastic changes in the external environment is found to be limited when an inward perspective of the company is utilized. The measurement of performance indicator and the mining of usable information in a sea of big data, among other approaches, may provide limited results in guiding the company towards choosing effective strategic decisions that will sustain the company in the future. This chapter is an effort to pursue an alternative perspective in planning by using Scenario Planning, a group thinking process that encourages knowledge exchange and development of mutual deeper understanding of central issues important to the future of an organization. Applying Scenario Planning framework, a structured approach is elaborated to describe a replicable methodology for sensing critical uncertainties in the external environment. These uncertainties are then utilized as the foundations for creating scenarios, which are attempts at vivid visualizations of how the future may look like. In this research, the effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated on the supply chain of Clariant, a Specialty Chemicals Company headquartered in Switzerland, by developing three scenarios that are sample representations of a whole range of plausible futures. These scenarios are differentiated by combinations of high and low conditions of the three critical uncertainties identified: (1) Emergence of trading blocks, (2) Changing consumer needs/behavior, and (3) Changes in logistics infrastructure. These critical uncertainties are also used to further design a new breed of indicators that are used as ground-sensors to monitor which direction the future is heading to. In addition, Scenario Planning also provides a fertile platform on which organizational learning can organically grow. The steps used in the methodology forces users of the scenarios to challenge existing mental models resulting to a wider perspective and appreciation of the dynamics that surround and impact an organization in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable development with ecological protection has gained global significance across society because of continuing environmental degradation. It causes green supply-chain management to be an area of interest among researchers and practitioners. Existing literature related to green supply chain indicates that most of the scholarly works have been limited to the manufacturing context and retailing has not been paid enough attention. It signifies that integrating green policies into retail sector is a new potential area of research from academicians' and practitioners' point of view. This chapter discusses about the drivers, barriers, different dimensions, issues, existing environmental practices and policies adopted by leading retailers, future research avenues, different green polices adopted by various organizations and government bodies in the area of retailing. Thus it facilitates researchers, industry practitioners, policy makers to find the existing works, new research opportunities as well as to improve practices and policies. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The core object of this chapter is to develop efficiency measurement technique which links SC processes' efficiency (SCPE) to a firm's financial policy (FFP) through demonstrating and utilising the connection between SCPE and a firm's financial efficiency (FFE). The Dempster Shafer/Analytical Hierarchy Processes (DS/AHP) model is employed to link SCPE to the firm's financial efficiency through defining the relevant importance weights of SCPE measures regarding the preferences of FFE. The chapter also introduces a SC Financial Link Index (SCFLI) to examine the degree to which SCPE is linked to the FFE objectives. This index offers an effective supply chain management (SCM) tool to provide continuous feedback on SCPE and recognise the suitable employed remedial actions. Analysing this index offers opportunities for detailed evaluation of SCPE and empowers firms to trace SC processes that need improvement, causing in more control on daily SC operations. The proposed method permits the evaluation, monitoring, and control of SCPE to enhance SC policy for better alignment with the FFP. Linking SCPE to the FFP objectives empowers firms to gain competitive advantages and formulate strategies for improved SCM through linking such strategies to the focus area of improving the FFE. </jats:p>"

A multi-case study of three best-practice Austrian food SMEs examined the practices of horizontal collaboration in global supply chain management. Then, a survey of Austrian food SMEs assessed the horizontal collaboration facilitators and inhibitors. Findings demonstrate that e-business tools foster the creation of virtual alliances and help SMEs to increase export sales to new and/or niche foreign markets. SMEs have limited resources to overcome obstacles like cost restrictions to use advanced yet expensive e-business tools, managing food safety risks in global supply chains, and meet legal requirements of international trade.</p>",

In this chapter, the authors intend to empirically assess the effects of supplier buyer relations and human metrics on supply chain performance in the context of Indian manufacturing organizations. After rigorous literature review, total 18 variables have been identified which are later on reduced in number by factor analysis. As a pilot study, primary data is collected from 100 manufacturing organizations by means of a questionnaire and a scale is developed. On a sample size of 100, the proposed hypotheses are tested by applying two-tailed tests. t-test and factor analysis resulted in 5 factors, 2 related to supplier-buyer relations and 3 related to human metrics. The overall reliability of the scale comes out to be 0.697. The research work provides a new approach to the manufacturing organizations to understand the factors affecting supply chain performance. The present study is limited to Indian manufacturing organizations. </jats:p>"

It describes how to provide an approach to the security performance measurement. In order to get SI it is necessary to develop a systematization of Security Index Determination Model (SIDM). SI describes Supply Chain Security Management (SCSM) performance. SCSM implements, facilitates and maintains Security barriers, which are formed by a confluence of properly chosen and efficiently implemented security measures. The presented methodology is based on the General Model developed by Gutiérrez and Hintsa that was expanded according to research needs. The expansion was based on adding the specified barriers for each of the Sub-categories stated in the previously mentioned General Model. For this purpose different security initiatives such as AEO, C-TPAT and TAPA were analysed. SIDM is based on Objectivized Methodology for Technical Systems Conditions Assessment developed by Lansky. </jats:p>"

In order to enable the implementation of efficient and effective product-development support processes in the quest of achieving shorter product development lead-times and higher return on investments (ROIs). Engineer-To-Order (ETO) product capacity projects, including large electric machine, huge centrifugal pumps, Diesel/Natural fuel power plant engines, steam turbine, boiler, ship, etc., have challenges concerning their long product-development lead-times. The challenges confronting these enterprises industrial Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are enormous with one of the major ones being the effective and efficient network or flow of technical communication among the main stakeholders for complex / new product-development. Moreover, with all the industrial manufacturing complex product-development process improvements, in terms of complex engineering design and delivery, there are still a lot more variances to be addressed on the ‘better, faster and cheaper' paradigm. Furthermore, attention is needed on efficient information exchange systems as well as effective operational communication in their complex product-development processes for a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, this paper presents a proposed optimum conceptual information technology systems' architecture towards enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage: By employing social network theory (SNT) analysis to advise on a strategic and effective communication network for industrial supply-chain (SC) sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management has been used by businesses and the companies have attributed their success to effective supply chain management. But in case of healthcare sector, supply chain management is not that prominent since it deals with finished products. Supply Chain Management is a concept, strategy and approach that is proving its worth in hospital management all over the world. The pressures on hospital supply chains are changing. In response to these pressures some hospitals have initiated green supply chain management (GSCM) practices that provide tremendous opportunities to improve supply chain performance. This paper tries to provide empirical results in order to examine the impact of GSCM practices in building the positive image of the Indian hospitals incorporating two moderating variables namely regulatory and competition. In order to gain unique insights of current levels of awareness/adoption of GSCM and the potential impact GSCM could have in building organizational image, a survey was conducted among 53 hospitals from NCR (National Capital Region) India. Moderated hierarchical regression analysis has been used to arrive at the following results: (1) Indian hospitals have experienced increasing environmental pressure to implement GSCM practices; (2) The implementation of GSCM practices have helped in building positive organizational image (3) The existence of competitive and regulatory pressures influence hospitals to implement green supply chain practices that eventually help in building positive organizational image especially when these pressures cause adoption of green purchasing and green hospital services even though organizational image is most influenced by Internal environment management; (4) Hospitals implement green transportation policies under regulatory and competitive pressures. Implications for operations strategists from these relationships are also discussed. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The Ambient Groundwater Geochemistry (AGG) initiative of the Ontario Geological Survey is a regional high density groundwater sampling program, the purpose of which is to map and understand the existing groundwater geochemical conditions in Ontario's major rock\nand surficial sediment aquifers. Throughout the last decade, the study has amassed data for 2664 samples from 2095 stations across 96,000 km2 representing all of southern Ontario. \nThis one-time sampling program relies on existing well infrastructure sampled in a 10x10 km grid pattern. Monitoring and farm wells are used but the majority are domestic water supply wells with purging and sampling protocols adapted to the well type. Sites are randomly selected such that three\ncriteria are met: (1) the water source must be determined, (2) the full, untreated geochemical matrix must be characterized (3) data quality must be assured; i.e. it must be demonstrated that what was intended to be measured has been correctly measured. A combination of field protocols, laboratory\nmethods and a post acquisition QC auditing process, which collectively last for 6 months beyond a typical field season. \nWells are selected only if their well construction details can be ascertained and cross-checked. The sources, and therefore reliability, of this information are recorded in the database and used later in an audit of all station information collected in the field. The audit, which uses well logs,\nfield notes, well owner comments, continuous logs of field parameters (temperature, pH, etc) and field photos, typically lasts several months and scrutinizes well construction details, well-head security, plumbing details, integrity of water source and the geological origin of the water. In most\nyears, based on the audit, a small number of sampled waters do not meet one of the three criteria and are rejected for inclusion in the AGG database.\nAnalytical QC/QA procedures are rigorous. At least two analytical techniques are used to analyze many of the important parameters including the major ions, nitrate, iodide and many metals and these redundant analyses are checked against each other. Blind field duplicates, blanks and multiple\nreference standards are inserted at regular intervals in lab submissions and amount to 15% of all samples submitted and are used to confirm precision and accuracy for all parameters. Where data are found to fail the quality assurance tests, mitigation action is taken that may include\nre-analysis, resampling, or at worst, removal of the problem samples from the database. \nThese techniques provide the quality assurance required for publication of the database. All blind quality control data are published, along with 27 station attributes, which allows end-users many options in the way they use the data, including creating subsets of the data for particular uses. The\nbreadth of analysis, uniformity of coverage, areal extent and data quality of this dataset together far exceeds that of any previously existing groundwater geochemical databases in the province of Ontario.</jats:p>"

Their manufacturing processes are understood and the lead times are analyzed. The researcher arrived at the conclusion that immense number of shortages amount due to lack of information sharing and transparency. Hence, with the help of IT support an effective supplier network is introduced and implemented for the supplier PQR Incorporation. This is then used as a benchmark for another supplier: XYZ Motors.</jats:p>"

A methodological approach is suggested, in which mathematical models and methods for nodal evaluation of heat supply reliability for consumers are developed and the studies on the impact of different elements of fuel and heat supply systems on its level are described.

The market demands are assumed to be random variables with known distribution and the supply disruptions caused by some of the facilities faults or connection links interruptions are formulated by several scenarios with unknown occurrence probabilities. In particular, we assume the probabilities that the disruption scenarios happen belong to the two predefined uncertainty sets, named box and ellipsoid uncertainty sets, respectively. Through mathematical deductions, the proposed robust SCN design models can be transformed into the tractable linear program for box uncertainty and into second-order cone program for ellipsoid uncertainty. We further offer propositions with proof to show the equivalence of the transformed problems with the original ones. The applications of the proposed models together with solution approaches are investigated in a real case to design a tea supply chain network and validate their effectiveness. Numerical results obtained from model implementation and sensitivity analysis arrive at important practical insights.</jats:p>"

The paper uses rich data for municipalities in Brazil from 2000 to 2006, where federal transfers to local governments change discontinuously with given population thresholds. The results from a regression-discontinuity design reveal that larger federal transfers lead to a significant expansion of local public preschool services, but show no evidence of crowding out of private enrollment. This finding is consistent with a theory in which households differ in their willingness to pay for preschool services, and private suppliers optimally adjust prices in response to an expansion of lower-quality, free-of-charge public supply.</JATS1:p>"

The traditional way to generate a product contained the following stages: product design, raw material selection, material transportation, manufacturability, distribution and disposition at end of life. Product design for instance, is considered an extremely important stage of a product, being that, it directs the way the product can potentially be managed along the SC. It defines the raw material to be used, the possible supplier to select, the industrial processes involved in its fabrication, the packaging for its transportation and the newest stage where the product reaches its end of life and needs to be disposed. The Product design then becomes Green Product Design (GPD), where energy, time, resources become critical for a company. GPD takes into account the whole product life cycle. This chapter presents the importance of having a GPD process into the SC, the way to incorporate it, and the benefits of implementing it into the SC. </jats:p>"

The literature has evidence of important criteria for supply supplier selection process. However, there is a dearth of studies on service supplier selection process. To address this gap, this paper firstly systematically reviews the existing procurement literature, secondly, it argues for the use of alternative methods research to address questions related to ranking of selection criteria, and thirdly, it proposes and illustrates the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process to analyze the identified criteria. The paper concludes with limitations and further research directions.</jats:p>"

According to the results of the population survey found that 53% of respondents used for drinking spring water from tanker trucks, 30% of respondents prefer water sources that are close to their place of residence. The water from the city water supply system for drinking purposes only use 15% of the respondents, and 2% from other water supply systems. Monitoring of the quality of drinking water of the central water and spring water. For tap water set the deviation from existing standards for five of the twenty examined indicators, indicating the poor quality of water. The study of spring water samples has identified it as a \"clean\". Conclusions. Spring water in Kharkov advised the public as an alternative source of drinking water.</jats:p>"

However, as I show here on the basis of an analysis of cross-national time-series data for the past five decades, reducing the carbon intensity of overall energy use is associated with higher energy use, and reducing the carbon intensity of electricity production is associated with higher electricity production. These findings suggest that adding noncarbon and low-carbon energy generation capacity may be connected with processes that spur energy demand. This has important environmental implications, since alternative energy sources have serious environmental impacts of their own. The policy challenge is to ensure that clean energy sources replace rather than add to carbon-based energy.</jats:p>",

Several methods have been proposed for solving this problem, one of which is the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method with interval data. There is no doubt that the TOPSIS with interval data method is a powerful technique in uncertain decision-making context. Despite its usefulness, it is logical that when data are imprecise, weight is imprecise too. To overcome this limit, the extended Shannons Entropy method with interval data is used. The main findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid proposed models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) is a typical small modular reactor (SMR) that offers simpler, standardized and safer modular design by being factory built, requiring smaller initial capital investment, and having a shorter construction period. Thanks to its small size, the MHTGRs could be beneficial in providing electric power to remote areas that are deficient in transmission or distribution and in generating local power for large population centers. Based on the multi-modular operation scheme, the inherent safety feature of the MHTGRs can be applicable to large nuclear plants of any desired power rating. The MHTGR-based nuclear steam supplying system (NSSS) is constituted by an MHTGR, a side-by-side arranged helical-coil once-through steam generator (OTSG) and some connecting pipes. Due to the side-by-side arrangement, there is a tight coupling effect between the MHTGR and OTSG. Moreover, there always exists the parameter perturbation of the NSSSs. Thus, it is meaningful to study the model-free coordinated control of MHTGR-based NSSSs for safe, stable, robust and efficient operation. In this paper, a new model-free coordinated control strategy that regulates the nuclear power, MHTGR outlet helium temperature and OTSG outlet overheated steam temperature by properly adjusting the control rod position, helium flowrate and feed-water flowrate is established for the MHTGR-based NSSSs. Sufficient conditions for the globally asymptotic closed-loop stability is given. Finally, numerical simulation results in the cases of large range power decrease and increase illustrate the satisfactory performance of this newly-developed model-free coordinated NSSS control law.</jats:p>"

However at Ambrosia Limited, a renowned name in Poultry products, a simple supply chain dilemma has made it a regular affair. Though the policy of company officials of completely managing the C&amp;F’s has been smooth, there has always been a problem when it came to supply chain. Be it over stocking or excessive rejections from customers, such uncertain issues at times expose the weak link of poor supply chain policies in the company, thus creating potential rift between the company officials and the C&amp;F owner. Even last year the Zonal Sales Manager was greatly upset during the rainy season where great amount of products were not utilized thus creating losses, for which no body was ready to take the responsibility. The upcoming monsoon season might bring a whole new set of problems as the particular problem could again play a critical role in damaging profits.</jats:p>"

Five Hypotheses were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The results show that PPP efficacy in humanitarian logistics enhances the sustainability of local economy. Implementation of Public Private Partnership (PPP) as a new strategy in managing disaster, the study suggest that they should complement each other with certain characteristics such as: (1) Mutual Coordination; (2) Shared Risk and Profits/ Benefits; and (3). Organizational Arrangement and it should also support the sustainability of Tourism industry. </jats:p>"

A regional supply chain is firstly introduced based on the biggest WCO-for-biodiesel company in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, and it comprises three components: WCO supplier, biorefinery, and demand zone. And then a robust mixed integer linear model with multiple objectives (economic, environmental, and social objectives) is proposed for both biorefinery location and transportation plans. After that, a heuristic algorithm based on genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Finally, the 27 cities in Yangtze River delta are adopted to verify the proposed models and methods, and the sustainability and robustness of biodiesel supply are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large amounts of carbon emissions and pollution are generated during the manufacturing process for consumer goods. Low carbon manufacturing has been increasingly enquired or requested by stakeholders. However, international trade blurs the responsibility for carbon emissions reduction and raises the questions of responsibility allocation among producers and consumers. Scholars have been examining the nexus of producer versus consumer responsibility among supply chains. Recently, there have been discussions on the share of producer and consumer responsibility. Both producer and consumer responsibility approaches have intrinsic shortcomings and are ineffective in curbing the rise of carbon emissions in supply chains. Shared responsibility based on the equity principle attempts to address these issues. This chapter relates a case study of carbon impact on China's export and economy with scenarios which show that the benefits of carbon reduction by producers can trickle down along the supply chain and motivate the sharing responsibility under certain circumstances. The share of producer and consumer responsibility for low carbon manufacturing can be enabled when embodied carbon emissions in goods and services are priced and such accurate information is available. A mechanism engaging the global participation is recommended. The author calls for further research on the system pricing embodied carbon emission, the universal standard to calculate the embodied carbon emissions and to disclose the information, and the way to secure global cooperation and participation. </jats:p>"

The knowledge integrated in the supply chain management (SCM) systems affects both supply chain and organizational performance. But since there is no single entity on performance an effective systematically approach to performance measurement could not be established. Generally in previous studies, organizational performance hasn`t been measured within the terms of SCM but if integral unit endeavor performance can be judged by so the overall performance can be judged by its departments` efforts. So SCOR model is chosen because important supply chain characteristics and their associated interactions aren't ignored. And organizational performance is reciprocal that performance measurement is taken a system for integrating the management of supply chain and knowledge. Therefore the objectives of the study were appeared to be correlation levels and relationships between knowledge sharing, SCM and organizational performance. This study is unique in terms of the dimensions that are being investigated in Turkey. While there are studies on SCM and knowledge sharing, each examined alone, this study tried to undercover the relationships between these two terms. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this twenty-first century, our country is still incurring significant post-harvest losses. Most of the cold storage facilities are based on conventional energy intensive process with outdated technologies. Improper storage and cold treatment infrastructure reduces the life and deteriorates the quality of perishable products. Supply chain practitioners adopted the green cold chain management practices to overcome numerous challenges associated with developing the cold chain network. Literature review reported that green cold chain management is under-developing phase in India, but these practices have gained huge popularity in the western world. The purpose of the paper is to identify necessary barriers, determine hierarchical and contextual relationships between variables influencing green cold chain practices in India. Here researcher used interpretive structural methodology that uses systematic application of some elementary notions of graph theory approach and Boolean algebra to construct directed graph. Further the dependence and driving power of variables are categorized using MICMAC analysis. The formulation of strategy considers barriers of green cold chain management, i.e.: (1) High capital costs of renewable projects, (2) Outdated technology, (3) Poor cold chain network, (4) Lack of skilled manpower, (5) Poor cold storage Infrastructure, (6) Cold chain sterilization with chemicals, (7) Lack of reverse logistics, (8) Lack of information system infrastructure, (9) Lack of government support, and (10) Non-recyclable packaging. The findings suggest that cold chain infrastructure and government support are key drivers of green cold chain practices.</jats:p>"

The utilization of cloud computing is necessary for modern organizations that seek to serve suppliers and customers, increase business performance, strengthen competitiveness, and achieve continuous success in global business. Therefore, it is essential for modern organizations to examine their cloud computing applications, develop a strategic plan to regularly check their practical advancements, and immediately respond to the cloud computing needs of customers in global supply chain. Applying cloud computing in global supply chain will extremely improve organizational performance and reach business goals in the digital age.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to present this fractal supply network and also proposes a new mathematical model through which replenishment; transportation, production and handling time can be optimised at different stages of the fractal supply network. Both the proposed Fractal Supply Network and the mathematical model are implemented and validated using Supply Chain GURU Software. Application of the proposed mathematical model has led to a reduction in the total replenishment time and enables practitioners to systematically decide upon the optimum replenishment time at different stage of the network.</jats:p>"

In spite of grim statistics for youth in foster care related to graduation, teen pregnancy, drug use and imprisonment, these children develop many positive resiliencies around adaptability, emotional intelligence, empathy and efficiency. Working with a non-profit serving youth in foster care in Watts, Los Angeles, called Peace4Kids, whose motto is “community as family,” the concept of a “mobile village” was born. Following their lead, paired with a deep understanding of consumer culture’s collective intelligence around moving goods through cities, an innovative strategy was used to create a literal delivery platform for educational programming, in partnership with other non-profits, around food equity, social justice and eventually other vocational skills such as apparel arts, machine arts, fine arts and early education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent years there has been a growing interest in electric systems which integrate communication, control, and sensing technologies to efficiently shape the electricity consumption also known as smartgrids. It has been shown that if such a system is organized into a network of interconnected microgrids there is a vast number of positive effects. The basic idea of this approach is to separate the electrical grid into smaller, highly independent subsections (microgrids). This approach has resulted in novel types of typologies for electrical grids and new aspects of such systems that should be considered. In this way many problems can be localized. For example when a high level of renewable energy sources are added to the system the fluctuations in the voltage and frequency that occur, can be to, a certain extent, isolated from the main grid. The new topology has made it crucial to optimize several important properties like the self-adequacy, reliability, supply-security and the potential for self-healing. Many of these practical issues can be modeled using graphs. Previous research has shown that the problem of the maximal partitioning of graphs with supply and demand (MPGSD) is closely related to electrical distribution systems, especially in the context of interconnected microgrids. The advantage of using this type of graph model is the possibility of solving large scale problems in reasonable time. The use of MPGSD is essential in analyzing the optimal division of the whole grid into microgrids. Here the term optimized is used for the case when there is a minimum of power exchange between the connected microgrids, which is generally referred to as the maximization of self-adequacy. Another important property of such interconnected systems is the fault resistance. In this work we present a new version of the MPGSD, suitable for maximizing failure resistance in such systems. To be exact we develop a model that attempts to maximize the self-adequacy but with an additional constraint of providing that the system maintains stability even in the case of some failures. To accomplish this, the original problem has been extended in two directions. The first one corresponds to fault tolerance in individual microgrids. In this case a new constraint is added that to each of the subgraphs (microgrids) must be Hamiltonian. By doing so it is guaranteed that no islanding will occur inside a microgrid even if some connections brake. The second adaptation is used to maximize the resistance of the entire distribution system to failures of entire microgrids. To be more precise we wish to guaranty that the system as a whole will be stable even if some of the microgrids fail. In practice we are minimizing the number of articulation points of the graph in which each of the subgraphs represents a node. For the proposed problem a mathematical model is developed that makes it possible to find optimal solution for small systems. These results are used to develop a heuristic method for finding near optimal solutions for large scale problem instances. We also explore the relation between the maximization of failure resistance on the level of individual microgrids and the whole system.</jats:p>"

Our objective is to study the risk management in the GI rice supply chain of a community enterprise called “Ban Khao Klang”, which produces Sang Yod Muang Phatthalung. From the literature review and in-depth interview of the president of the group, the risk identification, risk measurement, assessment and evaluation for farmers and the enterprise are performed. Then, the priority list of risk management is descending sorted according to the index of severity, probability and cost. The result indicates that the first priority risk for farmer is flood, being in debt, high input cost and inadequate knowledge for organic farming and high production cost for an enterprise. In addition, the group needs support from government in term of subsidy in water pond. Finally, we suggest the improvement of productivity by using proper techniques. Furthermore, the enhancement of community enterprise could be implemented in human skill, teamwork and network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Community enterprise; geographical indication rice; risk management &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> is based on high advanced Green technologies and methodologies, and tightly related to the Qatar comprehensive National Progress AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> is specially designed for Qatar demographic and climate conditions, regarding National Strategic Grand Challenge Pillars: 1Water Security and Water Sustainability &amp; 2Energy Security and Energy Sustainability &amp; 3Food Security and Food Supply, throughout the year. It is an environmentally friendly and water &amp; energy &amp; natural resources high efficiency system with new agricultural approaches. AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> uses ∼92–95% less water than traditional and modern agricultural and fishery methods. Farming is based on new approaches of the water independent &amp; recycling system, on the high sensitivity &amp; efficient technology, which creates “Stabilized water”. The new-formed state of water, the sub-atomic oriented structure, have higher levels of energy, which scientifically transfers to the growth cells of vegetables and fish, boosts their Genome and Growth Hormones, promotes rapid growth of the plants and the fishes for the time period, bringing yield several times higher compared the conventional and modern agriculture and fishery, and without any genetic harnesses. The energy efficiency of the AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> is achieved by using renewable energy operating systems such as solar panels, windmills, geothermal system and underground heating &amp; cooling systems, thus following Qatar's national security strategy in implementing economical alternates and renewable low carbon energy technologies. AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> is based on Green, sustainable technologies for smart, intelligent buildings, with the highest processing and operational standards, natural, recycled building materials, combination of sustainable vertical &amp; horizontal farming, multiple space efficient cultivation and Greenhouse Gas emission reduction. AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> does not require the use of pesticides, steroids or fertilizers, antibiotics, GMO seeds and feed and avoids generation of environmental pollutants. AQ System<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> is software driven technology of the advanced Greenhouse farming. The AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> exhibits no points of failure, and as such can operate continuous hours throughout the year and continue producing forever. AQ System – Z1<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> offers high economically and profitable production of vegetables and fish, with both great taste and high nutritional values.</jats:p>"

The research divulges empirical results on the foundation of data collected from 44 small scale industries functioning in District Udhampur of J&amp;K State. The primary data so collected were subjected to factor analysis in order to reduce the unwanted statements. The KMO and Cronbach Alpha values revealed significance of the construct. The results of CFA confirmed all the statements so obtained from EFA. The results of hierarchical linear regression revealed that commitment among business partners ensures timely performance of business activities, commitment paves way for business success and commitment leads to development of trust &amp; cooperation among business parties. The upcoming monsoon season might bring a whole new set of problems as the particular problem could again play a critical role in damaging profits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study aims at determining the core variables of demand chain management (DCM) which should ideally be the focus of senior management in order to accomplish higher organizational performance through improved supply chain practices. The research follows development survey based on descriptive-analytical research design. It initially involves identification and analysis of influential factors of implementation of DCM practices. Then these variables are organized into interpretive structural questionnaire given to ten experts-five academics and five retail supply chain experts. Subsequently, in order to obtain the enablers and outcomes the factors are analyzed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The study concentrates upon identifying the enablers and outcomes of the DCM practices implemented by the retailers in a supply chain. The major findings of the paper are: top management commitment and support in SC is the most significant enabler with the highest driving power i.e., they must be committed to and support the adoption of DCM practices. Besides this, the variables that management must consider significant are collaborative relationship with suppliers, internal integration, coordination, and information management. Further marketing orientation seems to be playing key role as enabler. The novelty of the paper lies in the study of an emerging SC philosophy i.e. DCM and its key practices per se. It has rarely been studied from a theory building perspective hitherto. Moreover, ISM-based approach is applied for the first time to study the DCM practices and its drivers vis-a-vis dependents. The variables possessing higher driving power in ISM needs to be dealt meticulously with on top priority because sooner or later they are going to influence the variables dependent on them.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Negotiation outcomes are broadly classified as Distributive/Competitive and Integrative/Collaborative. Substantial academic and research negotiation literature of the past two decades commend adoption of a collaborative style for almost all real-life conflict situations. Business negotiation materials and relational self-construal psychology studies present a picture of contrast. Negotiations being at the heart of buyer-supplier interactions drive value sharing and value co-creation aspects of modern Supply Chains. Pricing, product selection, delivery terms, shipment schedules, carrier selection, volume discounts, product training, and quality standards are all more often than not subject to negotiation between supply chain members. Negotiation interactions ensuing preparation and determination of BATNA, entail use of Competitive or Collaborative Tactics. Buyers are the protagonists in procurement organizations. And procurement often accounts for the lions share of an organizations budget. Small wonder, they drive cost competitiveness together with the firms partners. Indeed this is true of the overall Supply Chain. An Indian pharmaceutical company was chosen for the qualitative research in the form of a case study. The most popular competitive negotiation tactics were chosen for this study and buyers were asked to spell out the negotiation techniques that they deployed, material-wise (with the corresponding suppliers). This data when plotted material-wise and grouped Kraljic category-wise circumstantiates the use of competitive tactics in all Kraljic categories, marked by a refreshing nuanced approach for different categories, with intensity varying for different categories. Interviews with buyers and the key informant to discern the rationale behind use of those negotiation tactics, however, brought out a pattern despite the refreshing tendency not to straight-jacket.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to develop an intelligent data query algorithm for a manufacturing supply chain through the use of semantic web technologies. This research demonstrates the benefits of using ontologies for a manufacturing data query by comparing three different search mechanisms based on multiple criteria. The best results are obtained by introducing a hybrid technique of having ontology and a data repository in place. This has been demonstrated by developing simulation software based on a real case study of a distributed manufacturing system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article seeks to explore the relationship between procurement in the public sector and corruption. Corruption in the procurement process is one of the biggest challenges facing the South Africa government. Procurement in the South African public sector through the tendering process has been used with a particular aim of addressing the past discriminatory practices and policies by empowering the previously disadvantaged majority. It ought to operate within a certain legislative and regulatory framework. However, the article argues that in the process of implementing the good intentions of the government, corruption illegitimises the process. There are also challenges that are associated with public sector procurement, with corruption being the main protagonist. The article also seeks to suggest possible solutions that could be used to address the anomalies. The article further concludes that the main reason for the rife corruption in the public sector is that there is nonadherence to policy prescripts including the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act 1 of 1999) and the Municipal Finance Management Act, 2003 (Act 56 of 2003). This enormous predicament may only be addressed if the government were to show will and commitment by punishing offenders who do not comply with the said legislative framework.</jats:p>"

The results shown: first, green practices in restaurants in Taiwan have an indirect effect on firm performance through green capability; second, when the ability of suppliers of green and green capability is at a higher degree, it will contribute to organizational performance, namely environmental and economic performance. Finally, green practices could be a key driver of green capability and it should be a priority in restaurants.</jats:p>"

The recent growth of hybrid energy systems in remote areas across the world added to the increasing cost of renewable energy has triggered the inevitable development of hybrid energy systems. Hybrid energy systems always pose a problem of optimization of cost which has been approached with different perspectives in the recent past. This paper proposes a framework to guide the techniques of optimizing hybrid energy systems in general. The proposed framework comprises four stages including identification of input variables for energy generation, establishment of models of energy generation by individual sources, development of artificial intelligence, and finally summation of selected sources. A case study of a solar, wind, and hydro hybrid system was undertaken with a linear programming approach. Substantial results were obtained with regard to how load requests were constantly satisfied while minimizing the cost of electricity. The developed framework gained its originality from the fact that it has included models of individual sources of energy that even make the optimization problem more complex. This paper also has impacts on the development of policies which will encourage the integration and development of renewable energies.</jats:p>"

Financial crises are recurrent systemic phenomena, often triggering deep and long-lasting recessions with large reductions in aggregate welfare, output and employment Importantly for policy, systemic financial crises are typically not random events triggered by exogenous events, but they tend to occur after periods of rapid, strong credit growth. Moreover, a credit crunch tends to follow in a financial crisis with negative aggregate real effects Macroprudential policy softens the credit supply cycles, with important positive effects on the aggregate real economy in crisis times.</jats:p>",

Big data and analytics are critical to the future of business sustainability. The demand for data scientists is increasing with the dynamic nature of businesses, thus making it indispensable to manage big data, derive meaningful results and interpret management decisions.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to provide a brief conceptual review of big data and analytics and further illustrate the use of a multicriteria decision-making technique in selecting the right skilled candidate for big data and analytics in procurement management.Method: It is important for firms to select and recruit the right data analyst, both in terms of skills sets and scope of analysis. The nature of such a problem is complex and multicriteria decision-making, which deals with both qualitative and quantitative factors. In the current study, an application of the Fuzzy VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method was used to solve the big data analyst selection problem.Results: From this study, it was identified that Technical knowledge (C1), Intellectual curiosity (C4) and Business acumen (C5) are the strongest influential criteria and must be present in the candidate for the big data and analytics job.Conclusion: Fuzzy VIKOR is the perfect technique in this kind of multiple criteria decisionmaking problematic scenario. This study will assist human resource managers and procurement managers in selecting the right workforce for big data analytics.</jats:p>"

Determination of location of LBBs is a key factor in the selection of alternatives in the blood store networks. In this paper, we first develop a new multi-objective possibility mixed integer linear programming model (MOPMILP) for blood bank location problem considering distinctive contradictive goals at the same time and additionally the loose way of some basic parameters, for example, requirements of hospitals and number of emergency referrals for clinics or hospitals. At that point, in the wake of applying legitimate procedures for changing over this possibilistic model into a precise novel multi-objective linear model (MOLP), we propose a novel intelligent fuzzy method to understand this MOLP and find a proper trade off arrangement. Eventually, we propose a careful analysis and will see the performance of the proposed model.</jats:p>"

This study overcomes the gap in research regarding the most important practices that organisations can implement to overcome operational barriers in reverse logistics.Objectives: The study aims to identify operational barriers preventing the efficient performance of the reverse logistics process, matching them to applicable practices by means of a theoretical framework and prioritising the implementation of appropriate practices with the inputs of practitioners.Method: The study used a survey method, and data were collected by means of a questionnaire based on a theoretical framework that was sent to organisations that offered reverse logistics as a service or specialised in reverse logistics in South Africa. The study used descriptive statistics to conduct a gap-and-opportunity analysis.Results: Respondents were asked to indicate the importance of the practices and how difficult they would be to implement. Results showed that all the practices are important to at least a moderate extent but some are more difficult to implement.Conclusion: The framework developed in this article will enable organisations to identify the operational barriers they experience in reverse logistics and the practices they can implement on a priority basis to overcome these barriers.</jats:p>"

For instance, power that is generated by wind turbines is time-varying and dependent on the weather. Electric vehicles will become increasingly important in the development of smart grids with a high penetration of renewables, because their flexibility makes it possible to charge their batteries when renewable supply is available. Charging of electric vehicles can be challenging, however, because of uncertainty in renewable supply and the potentially large number of vehicles involved. In this paper we propose a vehicle aggregation framework which uses Markov Decision Processes to control electric vehicles and deals with uncertainty in renewable supply. We present a grouping technique to address the scalability aspects of our framework. In experiments we show that the aggregation framework maximizes the profit of the aggregator, reduces cost of customers and reduces consumption of conventionally-generated power.</jats:p>"

It bridges the global trends affecting the mobile industry as a whole, with the creation and distribution of contents, emphasizing the new patterns of production and distribution. It shed light on the drivers of the changes taking place. The first part of this chapter identifies and sums up the main trends in a global landscape, namely the role of mobile communications (devices, networks) combined with the rise of the “app economy”, the spread of “Big Data”, and the move toward a multiscreen / cross-media paradigm. It provides a synthesis of available data. The first section tracks the evolution of the global market and the emerging geography with the rise of Asia as a leading player in the mobile world. The second section analyses the smartphone phenomenon. The third section deals with the rise of the “app economy”. The fourth section reviews the new modes of data driven management, stemming from “Big Data”. The fifth section follows the move a multi-screen world. The second part investigates some of the impacts of this fast evolving environment on the production of an array of mobile contents (portable movies, video, video games…) tracking the way content industries, while standing at the nexus of technology and content, are rapidly changing. The section documents the way mobile industry is indeed an innovation platform for new services. The section delineates the growing role of the consumer in a mobile world, its various modes of involvement in the production and distribution of digital content. We conclude with some elements about the new challenges brought by these trends, by the entry of new players in both the content and the mobile field.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon emission is a concern across the industry due to its environmental impact. In order to reduce carbon emissions, industry have to look not only at their processes but also in the generation of emissions in the whole supply chain that it belongs to. This is more necessary when various forms of carbon emissions policies are faced by the industry. The current focus on research is either in the economics of supply chain or mainly on the forward or reverse supply chains when it pertains to the carbon emissions. However, as lifecycle of the product is also becoming important, the isolated treatment of supply chains should be avoided for an integrated (forward and reverse) supply chain, also called the closed loop supply chain (CLSC). The complexity arises when the supply chain is faced with different kind of carbon policies implemented by the governments, for example, carbon tax, carbon cap, and carbon-cap and tax. The design of CLSC may change with the change in the carbon emission policy. In this research, a stochastic model is developed for the design of a CLSC by considering carbon emission policies. This work is one of the first attempts to understand the implication of carbon emission policy on the design of a CLSC. The model is applied to a sample case of aluminum industry with a life cycle assessment of emission.</jats:p><jats:p>Our preliminary findings include:</jats:p><jats:p>(1) When the more scenarios are taken into account, the total cost and emission would increase, because more uncertain information is considered in CSSC design.</jats:p><jats:p>(2) Given the same carbon cap, in a broad sense, the amount of emission credit traded in market changes in line with the total emission. It indicates that the emission trading is determined by the actual emission rather than the carbon price, even the uncertain carbon price is considered. However, a higher emission does not always lead to a bigger amount of emission to be traded.</jats:p><jats:p>(3) The network structure obtained by the deterministic formulation is not able to be easily adapted to changes in demand and supply.</jats:p><jats:p>(4) In order to deal with the uncertain demand, the CLSC has to enlarge its handling capacity by using the facilities with a higher capacity or incorporating more facilities with the same function. With the same purpose, the supplier selection decisions are also changed associate the increasing scenarios.</jats:p><jats:p>(5) The fuel of diesel is selected regardless of the scenarios. It means the current carbon price level would not motivate the firms to gain profit or reduce costs by employing future fuels in transportation. This conclusion is also proved by the further investigation when the total cost and emission are observed under decreasing cap. A further investigation reveals the transportation mode doesn't change when the carbon price increase from 9 to 234. Consequently, the future fuels would be attractive to firms only when the transportation price reduced or other policy environment changes, such as government subsidy. The efforts in reducing the transportation cost with future fuels have never ceased and the advanced technologies in automobile industry provide opportunity for green transportation promoters.</jats:p>"

Findings- From both supply side and\n   demand side, it drew how the disruptions affect the closed-loop supply chain.\n   When the disruptions have less effect on the forward and reverse cost of\n   closed-loop supply chain, the impact of the closed-loop supply chain is\n   controllable; when the disruptions have lager effect on the forward and\n   reverse cost of closed-loop supply chain, the impact of the closed-loop\n   supply chain is uncontrollable. Research limitations/implications- In this\n   paper, the contract costs are ignored for zero. While in actual situation, to\n   maintain the efficient implementation of this contract must spend\n   considerable cost. Sometimes the cost may be too high to become hinder\n   between manufacturers and retailers. This paper also does not make in-depth\n   study on this issue, so it will be further study in the future.\n   Originality/value- This paper also designed a set of differential profit\n   sharing contract based on revenue sharing contract mechanism. The contract is\n   easy to be managed, easy to be operated, making the closed-loop supply chain\n   system can achieve coordination whether in steady state or under disruptions.</jats:p>"

In this framework, certain nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) work alongside other supply chain firms, going beyond technical roles to serve as coordinators, conveners, organizers, brokers, and negotiators who facilitate multiparty agreement on sustainability issues within and across supply chains. We describe a set of roles consisting of third-party facilitators (3PF), fourth-party facilitators (4PF), and fifth-party facilitators (5PF) serving in increasingly strategic roles with increasing numbers of actors, and with increasing potential for co-creation of value in global supply chains. Reframing nongovernmental organizations as members of supply chains instead of outsiders provides a dramatically different perspective. This explicit acknowledgement of membership can help business and NGO managers to rethink their own roles and motivations and to find collaborative solutions in the steady transition to more sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>",

By the end of 2011, more than one-third of the population, i.e., 2.3 billion people were online, and this growth has provided the impetus and the opportunities for global and regional e-commerce. However, all countries are not likely to benefit equally from the virtuous circle of Internet diffusion created by globalization and multiple revolutions in information and communication technologies. The e-commerce can reduce the economic disparity between the developing and developed countries. Despite the promises made by various international organizations, the developing countries are encountering difficulties in realizing the benefits of e-commerce. It is argued that many factors are still confound and challenging the adoption of e-commerce. In order to derive the benefits of e-commerce, region specific/country specific diagnosis of the associated factors and barriers leading to the problem is an immense necessity. Keeping in view the various initiatives undertaken by the Syrian government viz., E-Signature Legislation Project, Intellectual Property Protection Project, and the National Programme for Promoting Information Technology Initiatives etc., and considering the multifaceted issues relating to e-commerce in Syria viz., formation of contracts, cyber contracts, validity of e-transactions, dichotomy of offer and invitation to treat, mutual mistake, identity of parties etc., a study on e-commerce adoption in Syria is fascinating academic focus. Hence, the paper is an attempt to identify the barriers of e-commerce in Syria.</jats:p>"

Contemporary business modeling grammars should allow each enterprise taking part in a supply chain to develop its own information system and at the same time support the creation of system interoperability and information sharing amongst business partners in the supply chain. This paper presents a conceptual modeling grammar for representing business scripts in a way that is both observer-dependent and independent. That is, value chain information should be represented in a format that is suitable for the perspective of any partner in the supply chain (e.g., enterprise, supplier, customer, customer's customer, supplier's supplier) and for the perspective of a completely neutral third party (e.g., government). The proposed observer-independent conceptual-modeling grammar, which is given strength by grounding it in the mature Resource-Event-Agent model, is shown to represent information about business phenomena of diverse supply chain partners such that it can be integrated across enterprise boundaries</jats:p>"

The numerical model resolves the energy equations for a cooling tower and a centralized water-cooled chiller simultaneously. It requires inputs that are readily available. The user-inputs are the ambient conditions, the cooling tower air flow rate, the condenser water flow rate, the evaporator water flow rate, the superheat and sub-cooling associated with the refrigeration cycle, and the full load design conditions. The model utilizes an empirical relationship for the compressor power as a function of load and temperature, and gives the user an option to select between a constant speed chiller and a variable speed chiller. The outputs include the chiller coefficient of performance, compressor input power and compressor isentropic efficiency. This talk will discuss the results of the assessment conducted of the effect of chilled water supply temperature on the performance and energy efficiency of the chiller system. The findings and recommendations on how to optimize chiller systems for best energy performance will also be presented.</jats:p>"

Although the South African government implemented various initiatives for the development of small businesses in townships, the full advantage of such initiatives has not yet been experienced.Objectives: To investigate how formal, independent small retail businesses operating in Soweto manage transportation as a logistical supply chain driver to be financially sustainable.Method: During 2014, a survey was conducted among a sample of 556 formal, independent small retail businesses in Soweto to determine if these retailers focused on responsiveness or cost-efficiency when managing their logistical supply chain driver of transportation.Results: The results showed that the retailers manage transportation decisions by focusing on either cost-efficiency or responsiveness, depending on the type of transportation decision and the industry in which the retailer operates. In terms of the profile of the older businesses (5 years and older) that showed a growth pattern in income (turnover) over the past year, responsive transportation decisions based on having inventory available (either by direct delivery by suppliers or by using own transportation) was a higher priority than considering cost.Conclusion: The type of transportation decisions made by the older, growing businesses could serve as an example to younger businesses showing a stagnating or contracting growth pattern.</jats:p>"

Then, we conduct an in-depth interview to gain better understanding of farmer and the community enterprise. Next, the business process analysis is analyzed using Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). For farmers and the community enterprise, the key performance indicators are productivity, cost and quality. Then, the proper controls and mechanisms are proposed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: On a national level, South Africa’s freight logistics industry is inefficient. The country ranks 36th out of 40 countries in terms of transport productivity (tonne kilometres as a ratio of gross domestic product, or GDP); the ratio of freight logistics costs to GDP measured 11.1% in 2013, compared to that of developed regions which measures in the order of 9%; and rail tonne-km market share on the two most dense long-distance corridors, namely, GautengDurban and Gauteng-Cape Town, is only 12.8% and 4.4%, respectively, whereas rail is globally acknowledged as a more efficient provider of long-distance freight solutions, given appropriate investments and service commitments.Objectives: A cornerstone of improved national freight logistics performance is the availability of reliable indicators to quantify the efficiency and capacity of the logistics network over the intermediate and long term, thereby enabling an evidence-based policy and investment environment. The objective of this article is to describe the foundation framework (i.e. phase 1) for South Africa’s freight corridor performance measurement system (CPMS). Once populated, the CPMS will be a key generator of indicators to facilitate the systemic management of corridors as a national production factor and thereby contributing to South Africa’s competitiveness.Method: The design of South Africa’s CPMS was informed by desktop research and refined through an extensive stakeholder consultation process. A distinction was made between South Africa’s dedicated bulk corridors and the multi-modal corridors.Results: Facilitating both stakeholder involvement and agreement on key indicators, as well as the eventual development of a system supporting the population, aggregation and dissemination of the CPMS are critical outcomes for the management of corridors as a national production factor. Three overarching corridor indicators were defined, relating to increased throughput, lower costs and optimal modal application – the key rationale to improve the competitiveness of South African industry. This is supported by three corridor measurement perspectives, that is, a policy, customer service and infrastructure perspective. The purpose of the policy perspective is to support the role of national government in facilitating logistics competitiveness and equitable access through appropriate policy instruments. The customer service perspective should track service reliability and efficiency as contracted, at costs and cycle times that facilitate the competitiveness of the freight owner. The infrastructure perspective indicates whether sufficient capacity is provided, and whether this capacity is both available when required and utilised optimally.Conclusion: Elevation of logistics to the macroeconomic realm through the development of appropriate indicators will enable the management of logistics as a national production factor, thereby contributing to reducing national freight logistics costs and improving industry competitiveness.</jats:p>"

So, the application of a Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) model, particularly TOPSIS and Boards function approach for solving an supplier selection problem, while, each expert have own criteria set is the aim of this paper. Finally, a simple example is provided in order to demonstrate its feasibility and practicability of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Even though the benefits of using social analysis have are widely accepted at both academic and industry/services context, there is still a lack of solid frameworks that allow decision-makers to connect the usage and obtained results of social network analysis – mainly both information and knowledge flows and derived results- with supply chain management objectives and goals. This paper gives an overview of social network analysis, the main social network analysis metrics, supply chain performance and, finally, it identifies how future frameworks could close the gap and link the results of social network analysis with the supply chain management decision-making processes. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Consumers cannot fully evaluate the product quality before purchase. To reduce consumer risk, some manufacturers offer consumer warranty. Up to now, there are many studies investigating this role, but they seldom consider from the perspective of consumer utility. Consumers view remanufactured products as being of lower quality and are less willing to pay for them. It is important to incorporate the manufacturer's service and consumer heterogeneity in the model. Those employed in the remanufacturing industry are advised to increase the level of warranty associated with their remanufacturing products in order to command higher prices for their products in the marketplace. This paper firstly considers consumer utility, then develops three marketing settings to examine the impact of warranty services, and finally compares the optimal prices and profits among them. The results show that the manufacturer's warranty policy can enhance profit, and the profit is highest when both new and remanufactured products provided differentiated warranty.</p>",

Its focus is on identifying how each organization within the supply chain developed its OLC as a result of taking part in a one-year supplier innovation development program which tasked the supply chain companies to collaborate to develop a new and innovative product. The companies within the supply chain had not previously worked with each other and so the project monitored the level of collaborative activity as well as innovative output from the supply chain. The results suggest that organizational learning capability and innovative capability of the supply chain are strongly linked. The paper concludes with an identification of a number of factors which are considered useful for managers and engineers to consider when implementing innovation projects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent years, interest in Sustainable Supply Chain Management has grown as the effects of global warming can be seen through various scientific researches. In a global economy as supply chains are spreading across continents – economic, social and environmental sustainability – commonly referred as triple bottom line (TBL) assumes significance. Focal firms in supply chain are held accountable for their economic performance by shareholders, social and environmental performance by society. Even the actions of members of their extended supply chain come under scrutiny. Growing global supply chains facilitate economic growth, improve standard of living of people and provide business opportunities to distant locations across the world. However, they have unfavorable environmental impact. In order to preserve natural resources for future generations, sustainability needs to be embedded across the supply chains. This literature review - covers different aspects of greening the supply chain. Supply chain is viewed as a system consisting of focal firm, chains of suppliers, distributors, logistics partners, retailers etc. Role of each member of supply chain in sustainability goals is discussed in detail. Extant literature has covered individual parts of supply chain, whereas this paper integrates this knowhow to facilitate learning all interrelated concepts in SSCM. Some of the supply chain companies have already taken proactive steps towards SSCM and have certified in ISO14000. Through extensive literature review, important factors which contribute for better environmental performance for an organization are studied and a model for designing and implementing SSCM strategy is presented.</jats:p>"

The data size in the world is multiplying rapidly - the amount of information in the world doubles every 12 months. Therefore, the authors analyzed Big data in the food supply chain. The methodology used in the paper consists of a review of global competitiveness reports and secondary data analysis together with document-based literature synthesis; a competitiveness maximization methodology was modelled referring to a case of small markets. The supply of food industry is complicated, because of various regulations and a demand for high quality products just on time. Various companies are transporting partial freight; therefore, the visibility, lead-time and cost minimization is essential for them. However, they are unable to use all the gathered information and are not utilizing the potential that is possible. The problem of data analysis is a bigger concern to the smaller markets. Many of the small markets are less developed countries that still are not using Big data in their enterprises. In addition, new technologies are developing in the Big data industry. Therefore, the gap of technology will increase even more between large and small markets. The analysed innovation level and technology usage indicated a need for the food industry to change competitiveness strategies. Therefore, the authors developed a competitiveness strategy that is orientated to the food industry of small markets.</jats:p>"

It is dependent on other disciplines, of which organizational theories are of tremendous importance. One such theory that has great relevance to SSCM is Institutional Theory. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that relates the enablers of SSCM to Institutional Theory. This is achieved in three steps: First, SSCM enablers were identified through a literature review. These internal enablers go through certain external challenges when supply chain players practice Sustainability. Second, an attempt is made to explain these challenges from the perspective of Institutional Theory. The role of Institutional Isomorphism in regulating and creating a direction for achieving the sustainability goal is identified. Finally, a theoretical model is developed to describe the link between supply chain players, institutional isomorphism, and the support and participation of the top management in creating an enabling environment for legitimization of sustainable supply chain.</jats:p>"

First, they integrate internally in order to prepare a cohesive organizational response and to ready the ground for external integration. They then seek to integrate with both customers and suppliers which can increase the breadth and depth of resource endowments. Internal and external integration are posited to improve manufacturing related competitive capability. This study examines whether internal integration and external integration impact manufacturing related competitive capability. The findings indicate significant positive effects of internal integration on both supplier and customer integration. Each supply chain integration dimension has a significant direct effect on competitive capability. Testing for mediation effects indicates that customer integration and supplier integration partially mediate the effects of internal integration on competitive capability.</p>",

This paper employed system dynamics as an effective methodology to grasp the regulation rules for sustainable freshwater management of the Bosten Lake. Results show the following. (1) Changing of lake water salinity is not only affected by the salinity of water entering and leaving, but is mostly a result of water exchange rate (WER) and the lake level fluctuation. (2) According to the estimated regime of lake level regulations, it is attested that surface water inflow must be larger than outflow about 10.6 × 108 m3 every year. Thus, the Bosten Lake can keep its normal water level. (3) A nonlinear equation was fitted between WER and average salinity of the Bosten Lake. This equation quantifies that when WER equals, or is larger than, 7, the Bosten Lake can be kept as a freshwater lake at all times.</jats:p>",

These concepts are very important in today’s interorganizational business world, and therefore in supply chains. In theoretical part of this article we presume that establishment and development of relationships in supply chain depends on development of trust. Trust is defi ned as a willingness to rely on a partner in a supply chain in whom one has confi dence. The stress is on expectation that another partner can be relied on to fulfi ll obligations and at the same time previous experience with partners in exchange relationships are taken in the consideration. Collaborative behavior is defi ned as a concept where two or more organizations, which work together in a supply chains, can through complementary characteristics gain shared means and goals that could not be achieved individually. Logistics managers, purchase and sales managers, project managers and employees in logistics department were included in our survey made on primary, secondary and tertiary sector of Slovene economy. We included companies of all sizes, both local and foreign companies present in Slovenia. 118 questionnaires were completed and involved in our research. According to the demographic data, our sample is comparable to population in terms of economy branch and size of companies. The Pearson correlation coeffi cient and linear regression analysis demonstrate statistically signifi cant strong correlation between trust, shared values and communication and strong negative correlation between trust and opportunistic behavior. At the end we can confi rm that there is a statistically signifi cant infl uence of trust on collaborative behavior in supply chains. The results clearly indicate that all factors included in research are very important for today’s supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Mountain Vranica is a popular tourist destination that provides many opportunities for the development of various forms of tourism throughout the whole year. Vranica includes central parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and belongs to the area of the Central Dinarides, as a part of so called Vranica rayon. The variety and attractiveness of the geological structure, relief, hydrological phenomena, flora and fauna, as well as the attractiveness of the landscape, are the primary factors for the development of tourism in this area. However, despite the significant tourism potential, tourism is insufficiently recognized in this area. The aim of this paper is to determine the characteristics of tourism trends, the impact of tourism development on the local community, as well as differences in the perception of tourist motives of Vranica by the local community and tourists. The research is based on an analysis of the results of direct surveys conducted during 2016 at multiple locations on Vranica, on a sample of 210 tourists and residents (106 local residents and 104 tourists). The survey included respondents older than 18 years and statistical analysis was conducted in SPSS. Its results can be used for better identification of visitors’ profile, and as a starting point in conception of tourist supply of higher quality in the future, with greater integration of local communities and residents’ opinion in the process of tourism planning of this area.</jats:p>"

It also includes how diffusion of innovation theory can be related to green marketing in a new way. This paper begins with the literature review of corporate social responsibility and green marketing strategies, and value is added to the paper by including the innovation theory to address the gap in the literature. Various strategies that could be adopted by marketers in order to act to the changes in the external environment have also been discussed. Propositions were developed in the current paper to reflect the relationship of green marketing strategies with types of innovations and competitive advantage. In addition, the paper also includes some of the managerial implications which can be used effectively. Managerial recommendations are suggested related to diffusion of innovation characteristics in the study.</jats:p>"

There is also a lack of information about the challenges these operators face in participating in the public transport industry.Objectives of the research: The main objective of the research was to conduct a survey among SBOs to obtain a better understanding of the challenges that they face in participating in the public transport industry.Method: A telephone survey of operators was undertaken to ensure an adequate response to a structured questionnaire. In analysing the data, we made use of Factor Analysis and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to undertake general statistical analysis.Results: The main results of the survey indicate that SBOs face significant financial and operational challenges. There is also a perceived lack of government support for SBOs. Major conclusions are that the Department of Transport (DoT) ought to address issues related to the complex governmental reporting and legal requirements for small business. In addition, government ought to be creating ‘space’ for SBOs in the design of contracts and actively encouraging the formation of consortia’s or partnerships, among the SBOs and/or between SBOs and established bus companies. Government, and especially the DoT, ought to more actively market the governments’ small-business support systems and procedures together with financial aid schemes to assist SBOs in acquiring or replacing buses.</jats:p>"

This study therefore sought to address this knowledge gap. A survey approach was adopted for conducting this study and questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze data, and findings were presented using tables. Findings suggest that the implementation of the Public Procurement Act has enhanced the procurement structure of academic libraries in Ghana. Effects of the Act were however found to be weak with regards to development of capacity of procurement personnel, dealing with issues of transparency and accountability, and achieving value for money. It was recommended that the Public Procurement Act and the procurement system should be revised and strengthened, and training and development be improved and should target the attitude and morality of the procurement personnel.</jats:p>"

An emerging area in supply chain practice is green SCM, which integrates environmental management with traditional SCM. Green supply chain management is seen as an important step companies need to take on the road to sustainable practices. SCOR Model (Supply Chain Operations Reference) has been developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC now merged with APICS) in order to guide companies applying SCM principles. The GreenSCOR model was also developed as an integrated green SCM tool that allows companies to manage their supply chain's environmental impacts, resulting in more efficient operations which have minimal impact on the environment. This chapter will talk about how SCM principles can be modified to reduce the adverse effects of company operations on the environment, especially using the GreenSCOR model. </jats:p>"

The distribution capability of a firm can influence both effective and efficient handling of external stocks and internal distribution of products in response to changing market demands. Although firms rely on distribution capability to manage their supply chain to ensure the right products are in the right place at the right time, few studies examine the underlying factors that support distribution capabilities for a firm’s upstream and downstream supply chain activities especially in uncertain environments.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– In the context of retail firms, a review of the literature shows that distribution capability can be conceptualized as an interfirm phenomenon based on theoretical insights from the resource-based view, market orientation and network structure.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Data from a sample of 247 small- and medium-sized grocery retailers operating in three major Chinese cities highlight a salient and positive relationship between a retailer’s distribution capabilities and its performance in uncertain environments.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– However, a retailer’s strong interfirm relations in a distribution network are negatively associated with retailer performance. Similarly, the influence of interfirm market orientation on retailer performance cannot be established in the supply chain. The study suggests that SME grocery retailers would benefit from understanding their numerous supply chain relationships and managing them (rather than relying on centrally ingrained relationships), and developing behavioral norms of interfirm market orientation among different supply chain partners.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the field of machining difficult-to-cut materials like titanium or nickel-based alloys, the use of a high-pressure lubricoolant supply may result in a significant increase of productivity and process stability. Due to enhanced cooling and lubrication of the cutting zone and thus reduced thermal tool load, tool wear can be decreased which allows higher applicable cutting speeds. Furthermore, the process stability can be increased as a result of effective chip breaking and chip evacuation. Since energy efficiency is very crucial, pressure and flow rate have to be adjusted carefully and in accordance with the cutting parameters to guarantee best results with less energy. For this purpose, experimental investigations were carried out under variation of the flow rate in order to find the minimum required value for a certain machining task with the overall aim to prevent waste of the media used. To maximize the positive effect of high pressure lubricoolant supply strategy on productivity and process stability, specially designed lubricoolant jet guidance geometry on the rake face was also investigated and compared to conventional turning inserts. To study the effect of high-pressure lubricoolant supply on tool temperature, reference tests also carried out using conventional overflood cooling (CoC). The results suggest that the tool temperature can be significantly decreased compared to CoC by applying the high pressure lubricoolant supply and using specially designed jet guidance geometry in turning the investigated aerospace materials TiAl6V4 and Inconel 718.</jats:p>"

The results of competition are becoming severe enough to determine the survival of company. To survive global competition, each firm must focus on achieving innovation excellence and operational excellence as core competency for sustainable competitive advantage. Supply chain management is now regarded as one of the most effective innovation initiatives to achieve operational excellence, and its importance has become ever more apparent. However, few companies effectively manage their supply chains, and the greatest difficulty is in achieving supply chain visibility. Many companies still suffer from a lack of visibility, and in spite of extensive research and the availability of modern technologies, the concepts and quantification methods to increase supply chain visibility are still ambiguous. Based on the extant researches in supply chain visibility, this study proposes an extended visibility concept focusing on a process capability perspective and suggests a more quantitative model using<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>score in Six Sigma methodology to evaluate and improve the level of supply chain visibility.</jats:p>"

Indian handicraft products have great opportunities both in the domestic and international markets. Main products of handicrafts consist of art metal wares, embroidered and crocheted goods, shawls and art wares, and Zari goods, woods wares, hand printed textiles and imitation jewelry. Indian Handicrafts, which constitutes a significant segment of the decentralized sector of the economy, its export has reached at a commendable height. Indian folk art and crafts which are the integral parts of the Indian culture and tradition are in high demand among the western consumers. A lot of manufacturing units are established in rural and small towns, which generate employment for a million of artisans. Indian exports are showing a growing trend. Like every coin has two sides, globalization is not separate from this point it also not only have positive impact on artisans industry but there are some negative consequences too on which this chapter is trying to put some light. </jats:p>"

This paper also studies the impacts of carbon emission abatement, subsidy and the factors of subsidy on the supply chain and the government, so as to compare the two kinds of subsidy strategy. This study shows that the coefficient of environmental benefits has a positive impact on the two kinds of subsidy. The subsidy can stimulate the carbon emission abatement, and the fixed cost has a negative impact on the will of the carbon emission abatement for the enterprises. Besides, the low-carbon preference of the consumers has a positive impact on the carbon emission abatement under the subsidy of low-carbon technology. Furthermore, the government under takes the main costs of the low-carbon technology under the subsidy of low-carbon technology. The environmental benefit also has a positive impact on the subsidy and profits of the government and the profits of the supply chain under the recycling subsidy. Both kinds of subsidy strategies can achieve supply chain coordination.</jats:p>"

As a result, many companies have a single policy, strategy and structural arrangements to manage enterprise development and supplier development programs and activities, thereby conflating the two concepts.Objectives: The aim of this conceptual article was to propose an implementation framework for enterprise and supplier development and to show the rationale of keeping enterprise development and supplier development as two distinct but related activities.Method: The conceptual article provided an overview of the policy context regarding enterprise development, followed by a discussion on enterprise development and its complexities. The article drew from the literature on supplier development and from the supplier adaptation, relational view, and learning and knowledge perspective theories in the development of its argument.Results: The article presented an implementation framework for enterprise and supplier development and then concluded with some recommendations and direction for future research.Conclusion: The implications of this research have great value for organisations as they prepare to implement Enterprise and supplier development (ESD) programmes. The proposed framework will also contribute to a better understanding of the ESD process and the link between enterprise development and supplier development processes.</jats:p>"

Bangladesh has a great potentiality to earn huge foreign exchange by exporting marine dry fishes. The present study was designed to analyze the supply chain and to examine marketing efficiency of marine dry fish in Bangladesh. Data were collected from 170 stakeholders and 9 export oriented firms/agencies using face to face semi-structured interviews considering 9 major species of marine fishes. A number of FGDs were conducted to supplement the information collected through survey method. The study areas were purposively selected. Three types of market such as primary market, secondary market and consumer market were considered for data gathering. High priced fish demanded high marketing cost resulting higher marketing margin and profit compared to low priced fish. Processing and transportation costs were also higher for high valued species compared to the low valued ones. Marketing margin and marketing profit were very high in export market compared to domestic market. However, shorter supply chains (channels) were more efficient than longer supply chains.The Agriculturists 2015; 13(1) 53-66</jats:p>"

Goat meat is sought for its high lean meat content, but current production is inadequate, resulting in the highest price in most countries, followed by mutton. Discussions focus on the distribution across agro-ecological zones (AEZs), factors influencing meat production, transportation, types of markets (assembling, distribution markets and weekly markets), characteristics; marketing channels and outlets; buyer preferences for live animals and meats and major market players. Goat skins are core products due to 20 times value addition. Rural markets have numerous advantages and reduce current constraints to marketing. Three factors requiring urgent attention are: (i) economic opportunities to participate in improved marketing systems and value chains, (ii) increased profits and improved livelihoods will benefit the poor, and (iii) potential development of less favoured areas. Strong interdisciplinary R and D and supportive policies can directly enhance socio-economic benefits and reduced poverty among poor farmers and the landless.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South African government’s supply chain management (SCM) system is not adequately implemented in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). There are weaknesses in the SOEs SCM enablers, strategies, policy implementation and poor enforcement of government SCM rules and regulations. This is resulting in governance and compliance failures, waste and fraudulent activities. Also, top management of SOEs still do not see SCM as strategic enough to deserve their attention, and therefore, there is little support from senior management, thus making it even more difficult for SCM practitioners to execute their day-to-day functions, let alone deliver the letter and spirit of the relevant legislation. In most SOEs Senior SCM practitioners have not been involved in the corporate strategy development. This has led to supply chain and organisational strategies being misaligned. The misalignment has resulted in service delivery backlog, high levels of corruption and continuous strikes across the country for better services. Given the massive expenditure and the financial challenges facing government, an effective public-sector SCM becomes a primary requirement. Government leaders should be more strategic around using SCM as a tool to improve service delivery. This article explores supply chain practices in SOEs. It is based on a conceptual review of SCM practices in the South African SOE environment and suggests that the supply chain and organisational strategies of SOEs must be aligned to ensure efficient delivery of public services.</jats:p>"

The challenges cannot be met by any individual enterprise but it requires concerted actions and coordination of initiatives within an effective food chain management. By utilizing basic concepts of innovation management techniques (IMTs), and developing an innovative management (M.I.) process we have applied innovation in two enterprises of the same traditional food chain for a three year period and evaluated the results based on the 12 different parameters developed by the innovation radar. The results show that the applied methodology had a major impact to the growth of both companies and the upgrade of their innovation capacity. In terms of the impact of the methodology within the food chain itself the success is evaluated based on the new, innovative, \"BACK TO THE FUTURE\" foods which were developed and promoted in the market by these companies and their close collaboration. Thus, we have developed a useful and valuable innovation practical tool available to managers of companies and to policy makers which can be used effectively for local development and regional growth of the agri food sector. Further research applying the methodology in agri food chains of other sectors such as dairy, meat etc., in bigger companies in the traditional and non-traditional sector is required in order to better evaluate its validity and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: In a number of countries, buses are a critical element of public transportation, providing the most inclusive and sustainable mode of transportation to all forms of citizenry, including staff and students of universities.Objectives: The study examines the determinants of satisfaction with campus bus transportation. The article is primarily discursive and based on the synthesis of existing service literature supported by data obtained from a survey of 847 respondents.Method: Structural equation modelling is undertaken using AMOS 19, allowing for the examination of compound relationships between service engagement variables.Results: Results show statistically significant differences between perceived service quality and travel routes. The authors argue that managerial attention to service user experiences does not only hold the key to ongoing competitive success in campus transportation services but also that those services can be significantly enriched through greater managerial attention to the interface between risk of financial loss (which increases when the campus bus transportation service provider becomes less able to compete) and service quality.Conclusion: The authors argue that if providers of campus bus transportation services are to rise to their service delivery challenges and also maintain or improve upon their market positions, they must conceptualise their services in a manner that takes into consideration the two-way interrelationship between risk of financial loss and service quality. It must also be noted that, although this study may have relevance for firm–firm scenarios, its focus is primarily on service supplier firm–customer service engagements.Keywords: Modelling; Transportation; Service</jats:p>"

This article examines and ranks the effects of internal and external SCI on operational performances. Pairwise interactions among components of SCI were also studied. Expert interviews followed by a survey on 172 shipping companies in Singapore were conducted. Based on the results from regression analysis, it was found that external SCI contributes more positively to operational performances. Positive interactions between similar internal and external SCI components were also noted. The result indicates that firm performances can be maximized from establishing closer relationships with supply chain partners. Additional performances can also be realized from synergies that are generated from performing similar internal and external SCI activities. The current article has provided explanations for the sources of synergies in SCI and their role in driving firms' performances.</jats:p>",

Green supply chain is capable of increasing corporate value while considering its impacts on all processes of physical distribution, production, and environment. Managing a green supply chain is about finding the balance between economic and environmental benefits in global supply chain. GSCM recognizes the disproportionate environmental impact of supply chain processes in an organization. GSCM practices can manifest themselves from the process of selecting raw material to final consumption based on the aspects of reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery. The chapter argues that the multifaceted applications of GSCM have the potential to enhance organizational performance and gain sustainable competitive advantage in global supply chain.</jats:p>"

Water eutrophication has compelled authorities to improve the water quality in its upstream catchment. However, a water-quality survey of the entire catchment was lacking. A total of 52 monitoring sites covering the entire catchment were sampled approximately monthly from July–September 2013, in response to rainfall and runoff. Six water nutrient concentrations were used to characterize the eutrophication, which was relatively severe. The total nitrogen pollution was classified as the worst grade of the water-quality standard. The water quality of Bai River was superior to that of Chao River, while the quality of tributaries was better than that of main rivers. The upstream and downstream reaches of main rivers and small tributaries usually had cleaner water than the middle reaches. The worst pollution mainly appeared in the middle reaches in Hebei Province. Spatial variations in water quality were closely related to land use quantitative characteristics of sub-watersheds. We suggest that a balanced, transparent compensation mechanism focused on Hebei Province would assist to improve water quality.</jats:p>",

Leanness correlates negatively with agility, as can be expected, however, these attributes do not stand opposed to each other. Most supply chains seem to exhibit both lean and agile attributes simultaneously. Sugar, various types of tomatoes, avocado and onion supply chains are discussed and compared. Although a large amount of data were analysed, there exists an opportunity to widen this study significantly. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper presents a unique and simple approach to quantify the degree of supply chain leanness and agility. Although these terms are often used, only a few authors have made attempts to quantify these attributes and in most cases the approaches are relatively cumbersome. The relatively simple indexes create an opportunity for supply chain management to measure, evaluate and communicate their strategies along the supply chain and between different chains.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Their growth has been attributed to their distinctive flexibility, stylistic simplicity and modest operational costs. In Johannesburg, the tuk-tuk represents a relatively new mode of public transport which stemmed from suggestions made by the local area residents association and other stakeholders to revamp the neighbourhood. The objective of the paper is to determine the operational and user travel characteristics of tuk-tuks as well as assessing their impacts. In Johannesburg, where competition from private transport operators can result in serious confrontation, the paper ascertains whether tuktuks pose a threat to other operators. Data was collected through telephonic interviews and electronic questionnaires. The results reveal that the tuk-tuk has filled a public transport gap by providing a much needed ‘first mile’/‘last mile’ service to community members.</jats:p>"

The challenge, therefore, for supply chain and operations managers is to design and develop an operations strategy that ensures the firms investments in such ‘green' initiatives. We develop a theoretical framework for resource allocation strategies for sustainable manufacturing operations that can be characterized as speculative, responsible, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation. This can aid managers in characterizing and controlling the firm's underlying operational processes and guide resource allocation decisions at strategic level. </jats:p>"

To cope such challenges companies are nowadays considering forming a business network with the objective to achieve several business benefits. However, to execute such business network is not risks free but always facing some problems for its continuation successfully. In such situation, it is necessary to formulate risk mitigation plan and strengthen the resilience within business network. The objective of this article is therefore to identifying and sharing risks within the collaborative business network and proposing necessary mitigating plan and resilience for it. In this research, a framework is also highlighted that provides a structural approach for identifying and assessing potential risks and resilience in business networks and their possible impacts on different levels of collaboration.

GSCM is especially important in the construction industry, a project-based business that often results in heavy environmental pollution. For the successful implementation of GSCM in the construction industry to occur, contractors should make the best use of suppliers’ environmental capabilities based on shared understanding of the capabilities. This paper examines the shared understanding of suppliers’ environmental management capabilities between the contractor and suppliers by assessing the consistency between the contractor’s and suppliers’ evaluations of the capabilities. This explorative case study investigates a supply chain comprised of a major construction firm and 106 suppliers in Korea. The results of the case analysis show that the suppliers’ self-evaluation scores of environmental capability are higher than the contractor’s evaluation scores. Furthermore, from both evaluators, suppliers received the lowest scores in the evaluation item rating the relationship with second-tier suppliers and the highest in the evaluation item rating the relationship with the contractor. The consistency between the suppliers’ and contractor’s evaluation is related to several characteristics of suppliers, such as industry type, firm size and partnership duration with the contractor. This study contributes to the literature of GSCM and strategic alignment amongst supply chain partners for the construction industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Obtaining substantial financial benefits from supply chain management initiatives is of central importance to senior management. In this study we empirically investigate the impact of the basic drivers of profitability that are influenced by supply chain initiatives (i.e., revenues, costs, fixed assets and working capital) on the profitability of more than 20,000 large and mid-size European manufacturers. The existence of correlations among the basic drivers of profitability indicates that supply chain initiatives can have multiple (sometimes unintended) consequences, and points to the importance of managing and controlling all basic drivers simultaneously. In particular, our analysis reveals that despite the growing importance of supply chain management, the surveyed companies were not able to improve their operating profit margin and cash-to-cash cycle time simultaneously, resulting in their inability to increase profitability as fast as their revenues. This suggests that top-line initiatives cannot improve profitability, without effective supply chain initiatives to manage costs and assets.</jats:p>"

In this study, back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), radial basis function artificial neural network (RBFANN) and Kriging methods were applied and compared to predict the monthly precipitation of Liaoyuan city, China. An autocorrelation analysis method was used to determine model input variables first, and then BPANN, RBFANN and Kriging methods were applied to recognize the relationship between previous precipitation and later precipitation with the monthly precipitation data of 1971–2009 in Liaoyuan city. Finally, the three models' performances were compared based on models accuracy, models stability and models computational cost. Comparison results showed that for model accuracy, RBFANN performed best, followed by Kriging, and BPANN performed worst; for stability and computational cost, RBFANN and Kriging models performed better than the BPANN model. In conclusion, RBFANN is the best method for precipitation prediction in Liaoyuan city. Therefore, the developed RBFANN model was applied to predict the monthly precipitation for 2010–2019 in the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The automotive industry is truly a global industry. Manufacturing plant of the company is set up in one corner of the earth, sourcing the automobile parts from many companies located all over the globes, and selling the final product in another country. This leads to complex supply chain. Production strategies like just-in-time (JIT) and just-in-sequence (JIS) creates testing times but presents opportunities for the logistics management. But currently, the industry is going through a rough phase. Manufacturing costs are increasing, rise in fuel prices is having its own affect on the industry, competitive landscape is changing, and globalization presents new political and economic challenges. Currently, the company needs to manage its supply chains efficiently, reduce cost and improve the accuracy of processes delivery. Today, the automobile industry is facing significant other challenges due to complex logistics. Logistics is about co-coordinating various activities like materials handling, storage, inventory management, freight transport and the related information flow and processing in a way that meets customer requirements at minimum cost. This paper will talk about the current challenges, opportunities, growth drivers and future strategies of the companies' logistics management. It will also cover how companies are adapting to the changing economic environment. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of secondary data. The challenges and opportunities for the companies exist from the current operations management and risks of globalization. Authors have looked at the challenges and opportunities in detail in this chapter. Improving the organization's performance and securing competitive advantage over others greatly depends on the supply chain management as it is seen that the competition is no longer between the organizations, rather they are amongst supply chains. From the research, it has been found that companies believe that for sustainable transportation and logistics, green supply chain is a must for long term sustainability of the company. Companies finds export compliance to the emerging markets as another major challenge. Transport and warehouse systems are, more or less, stabilized and companies are looking to get most out of them. Though there is connectivity between automobile companies and its suppliers but information is not available real time and hence it's difficult to collaborate. Visibility into logistics has come out as the biggest need for the companies. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Ports provide vital links in the maritime supply chains on which the trading of countries depend, and their efficiency and performance can contribute largely to the international competitiveness of those countries. However, to achieve and maintain such a contribution, port operators need to understand their role in a national economy and the factors that underlie the efficiency of the intermodal link that ports constitute in international supply chains. One such factor is the capacity of specialised cargo terminals.Objectives: This article described a possible technique for forecasting the throughput of grain imports through the bulk grain terminal at the Port of Cape Town. It determined whether the capacity in the bulk grain terminal is sufficient to handle current and forecasted volumes of imported grains or whether the volumes justify expansion or upgrading of the bulk grain terminal in the Port of Cape Town.Method: The Box–Jenkins methodology for autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was applied. An ARIMA model – 2 parameter, 1 difference – was selected to do the forecast.Results: The average tonnage of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 90 000 tons. The maximum tonnage of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 180 000 tons.Conclusion: The analyses show that the demand for imports of grain products at the multipurpose terminal in the Port of Cape Town is not growing substantially. The analyses also identify that the current upper limits of grain imports are within the existing handling and storage capacities of the bulk grain terminal.</jats:p>"

Our analysis shows that the retailer’s incentive to share information strongly depends on nonlinear production cost, competition intensity, and whether the retailer can offer a contract to charge a payment for the information. Without information contracting, the retailer has an incentive to share information for free when production economy is large but has no incentive to do so when there is production diseconomy. With information contracting, the retailer has an incentive to share information when either production diseconomy/economy is large or competition is intense. We characterize the conditions under which the retailer shares information with none, one, or both of the manufacturers. We also show that the retailer prefers to sell information sequentially rather than concurrently to the manufacturers, whereas the manufacturers’ preferences are reversed.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</jats:p>",

In particular the chapter focuses on the use of software agents to assist decision making across the supply chain, for example in raw material procurement. The chapter describes a framework for supply chain scenarios in multi-agent based simulation games. The agents' behaviour is governed by business rules, based on the concept of normative knowledge representation and its reasoning mechanism (known as rule-based reasoning, RBR) and that also come closer to the task that confronts the supply chain operational manager – the analysis of current case in hand in terms of previously decided business problem solutions, known as case-based reasoning (CBR). The aim is to introduce more realistic behavior of the supply chain actors and improve understanding in operational management of supply chains. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cold Chain refers to the transportation of temperature sensitive products like perishable goods from the point of origin to point of consumption in the food supply chain, which keeps it fresh and edible for a much longer period than in normal conditions. Cold Chain helps in transporting seasonal products and also making it available throughout the year. Two main parts of cold chain are transportation and storage systems. The key Indian industries where cold chain logistics play very important role are fruits and vegetables, milk and milk products (ice cream), Poultry and processed meat, marine products, pharmaceutical (mainly vaccines) and chemicals. An efficient cold chain industry ensures availability of food products as well as prevents spoilage of medicines. Country like India, where infrastructure is one of the major challenges, cold chain plays a critical role. Analysis for this study shows that cold supply chain network does not differ significantly from products to products at least in Indian scenario. Some of the challenges to the growth of sector in India are high energy cost, power deficit, rising real estate cost, lack of logistical support and uneven distribution of capacity. All these challenges bring down the operating margin of a company and makes it not so attractive business sector. But during last couple of years there is a positive environment being created for this sector in India. The growth in organized retail, growing interest in horticultural crops, demand for cold chain logistics from Pharmaceutical industry and various initiatives by government are some of the reasons why there is a renewed interest in this sector especially by private sector players. This study, which is focused on Indian cold chain logistics, analyzes the industry on PEST (Political, Economy, Social and Technology) model and presents top 3 factors on each of these 4 parameters. </jats:p>"

The relative simplicity of these two models has made them commonly used tools of consultants and practitioners. However, what is often overlooked or ignored in practice is that these models may or may not provide accurate projections, and that there are limitations to the range of problems which these models can address. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of projections made by the SQRTN and portfolio effect models under a variety of network conditions, and we provide guidance on when and how practitioners can both use and supplement these models. Our evaluations are based on the results of simulation studies which we conducted for this paper as well as many years of inventory management practice in private industry. </jats:p>"

In the pursuit of excellence, many firms have embarked on CSR programs, considering that it is not a financial burden but a strategic roadmap to increase and maintain their brand reputation, to overcome competitive pressures successfully and to efficiently and effectively lower operating cost with profit maximisation through innovation and supply chain partnership. However, in the process of becoming good players of CSR to society, innovative dimension for sustainability as well as an organisation’s supply chain partnership may be essential determinants to enhance good firm business processes and performance activities. In other words, to realise CSR, firms should have a strong environmental measure and well-integrated supply chain practices closely related to their business objectives and structures. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the influence of CSR on innovation, supply chain partnership and firm competitiveness on firms around Vanderbijlpark, South Africa. Through a quantitative method using smart PLS, this study tested the relationships among the four variables, which are CSR, innovation, supply chain partnership and firm competitiveness. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between the four proposed hypotheses. H1: There is a positive relationship between CSR and innovation; H2: There is a positive relationship between CSR and supply chain partnership; H3: There is a positive relationship between innovation and firm competitiveness; H4: There is a positive relationship between supply chain partnership and firm competitiveness. The proposed study is expected to have practical and theoretical implications to policy makers and managers. In addition, it will provide added insights and new knowledge to the existing body of literature hitherto not studied extensively in South African firms.</jats:p>"

Function of this system is to disconnect and reconnect the electricity supply to consumers. The introduction of the GSM technology and particularly the use of hand-held mobile phones has brought the innovative distance communication to remote locations. This utilization of this technology for the remote control of systems and appliances will make life easier, safe and quick from anywhere. GSM module was used for receiving short message service (SMS) from user’s mobile phone that automatically enable the controller to take any further action such as to switch on and off the consumer load at the incoming power supply. The system was integrated with microcontroller and GSM network interface using assembly language. AVR Studio 4 software was utilized to accomplish the integration. The system is activated when user sends the SMS to GSM controller circuit at electric meter consumption panel board. Upon receiving the SMS command, the microcontroller unit then automatically controls the incoming power supply by switching on or off the device according to the user command. In other words, the developed system reads message from the mobile phone and responds to control the devices according to the received message. The system can also give feedback to the user to inform the status of switching operation if such command is received.</jats:p>"

Inventory consignment allows an upstream firm (e.g., a manufacturer) to own and control inventory at a downstream firm (e.g., a retailer), representing a structural change in supply chain governance. Motivated by cases in pet toy and electronics component industries, we formulate principal–agent models based on the newsvendor framework to capture the strategic interactions in a supply chain. We find that consignment can be effective in reducing stockouts because the ownership and control of the product by the manufacturer allows better prevention of stockouts, which complements stockout recovery and leads to fewer stockouts. However, the lower level of stockout under consignment does not necessarily translate into profitability—when the manufacturer is highly opportunistic, that is, readily exploring outside opportunities for its product, consignment may lead to lower profitability for both the manufacturer and the supply chain. On the other hand, consignment will improve profitability for the manufacturer and the supply chain, if both the manufacturer opportunism and the retailer opportunism are moderate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>World population has reached to 7.2 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 (United Nations 2014). In order to feed this growing population, global food production needs to increase by 70 per cent (FAO 2009). At present, about 800 million people are living with hunger; which means one in nine is undernourished (FAO, IFAD &amp; WFP 2015). In addition, due to increasing urbanization, changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns, the demand for certain types of products such as meat, milk and eggs will steadily increase. (World Health Organization 2003). Food security is among the topics high on the agenda for many governments around the world. For countries with limited available natural resources such as land, water, forests and so on, increasing their food production will be a challenge. In addition, climate change will pose another constraint, as extreme weather events such as floods, storms, and drought will not only become more frequent, but also more severe in the near future (IPCC 2014). As a result, this is expected to overall negatively affect food production and all dimensions of food security. A food supply chain or food system refers to the processes that include agricultural production, post harvest handling and storage, processing and packaging, distribution and consumption. Each process in the food supply chain is connected, hence changes on one part will be reflected on other parts in particular as changes in price of end products. Both push and pull processes are in place: while growers, processors or retailers push the food products to the market, the consumers initiate “pull” processes by demanding food that can satisfy their needs and preferences. We report preliminary findings from the Safeguarding Food and Environment in Qatar (SAFE-Q) project, funded by the Qatar National Research Fund, and jointly undertaken by Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar, Cranfield University and Brunel University in the UK and Western Sydney University in Australia. The project involves undertaking a detailed analysis of supply and demand sides, examining the causes of food waste occurring during distribution, transportation and storage as well as during food preparation, cooking and consumption. Here, we report findings from interviews we conducted with the stakeholders on the supply side. We conducted interviews in October and November 2015 with distributors, restaurants, hotels as well as non-governmental organisations. In these interviews we asked whether the food was being discarded in the day-to-day operations of the company, followed by the main reasons for this food waste. We also presented the participants with factors that were identified in an earlier stage of the research as being contributors to the food waste and asked the cause and effect relationships between these factors. Following the factor-specific questions, we inquired about initiatives to reduce food waste in the company, as well as the relevant stakeholders that should be reached out to minimise food waste in general. Finally, we asked about potential solutions to food waste situation, and how the participant observes the future of food waste in Qatar. The factors that we have asked to the participants on the supply side were as follows: Packaging, Government legislation, Arab culture, Certification, Competition, Planning, Food safety standards/regulations, Import controls, Food labelling, Logistics infrastructure, Food handling, Promotions, Quality control, Seasonality of demand, Shelf life management, Stock management, and Temperature management. Throughout these interviews we gained insights into the previously identified factors leading to waste in Qatar. For example, food handling was elaborated as staff's lack of knowledge about the food product, lack of knowledge about the storage conditions of the food product. In relation to the seasonality of demand, inability to anticipate market demand was highlighted together with lack of skills for forecasting the demand. Another interesting finding was related to the shelf-life of products, the retailers commented that the shelf-life regulations were different from the rest of the countries in the Gulf region. For example, a canned food item would have a shelf-life of 1.5 years in Qatar whereas its shelf-life would be 2 years in other Gulf countries. Such discrepancies lead to food items being discarded in Qatar although they may still be fit for sale elsewhere in the region. This also had impact on what is being imported into the country, for example it was difficult to convince some producers to prepare the same product with two different expiry dates; one for the Gulf region and one specific to Qatar. One possible explanation to this discrepancy of expiry dates was suggested to be the legislator's desire to prevent bulk-buying on the consumption side, but this is yet to be confirmed with further research. Food labelling was one of the factors elaborated in many of the interviews in different aspects. For example, a significant amount of food is being wasted due to poor labelling; lack of the necessary information on the label. Sometimes the importers were unaware of the sensitivities in Qatar: a reported incident included the suggestion to eat the food with wine for example, and this resulted in the food products' being rejected at the port even though the product itself did not contain any alcohol. Another case mentioned involved a product's brand name familiarity with bacon, although the product did not contain any meat. In terms of suggested solutions to the food waste problem on the supply side, the preliminary data analysis found that the sector in general would benefit from training in food handling, purchasing, procurement, and storage conditions. The participants acknowledged a general lack of expertise in supply chain management and logistics. Another aspect was related to legislation and a single responsible authority for food control in the country. Although the interviews focused on the supply side, participants also commented in general on the awareness raising campaigns, particularly targeted at schools and young people.</jats:p><jats:p>References</jats:p><jats:p>FAO. 2009.

Between 1990 and 2012, the number of people that gained improved access to improved drinking water reached 2.3 billion people, while the number of children that have died from diarrheal diseases has fallen from 1.5 million deaths to just above 600,000 deaths (1, 2). However, it is estimated that there are still 1.8 billion people using a fecally contaminated source of drinking water (3). In addition, 748 million people continue to lack clean water, 1 billion continue to practice open defecation, and 2.5 billion people still lack adequate sanitation (3). In response to this global issue, Engineers Without Borders USA (EWB-USA) began with a mission to build a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs and equip leaders to solve the world’s most pressing challenges. Their 15,000+ members work with communities to find appropriate solutions to improve water supply, sanitation, energy, agriculture, civil works and structures. Their development approach is based on standard engineering methodology, including problem identification, assessment, alternatives analysis, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. EWB-USA began in 2002 and currently has members working in over 40 countries around the world. The majority of their work is focused in Latin America and Africa, but their programs are expanding to Asia and the Pacific Basin. Currently, EWB-USA members are working in 17 programs in six countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Nepal, and Fiji. Success in these programs is defined by measuring overall impact and learning from failure. Impact is measured through Standard Monitoring Indicators and learning is accomplished by documenting failures and lessons learned. Through this work, the organization has impacted 2.5 million lives through primarily water supply and sanitation projects by focusing on sustainable engineering solutions, community-education, capacity building, and appropriate technologies and local resources.</jats:p>",

Application of this system is to disconnect and reconnect the electricity supply which is operated by power utility company. Radio frequency (RF) remote control consists of a transmitter and receiver, which is the main module of the developed system. The transmitter will send a control signal through the module equipment transmitting antenna and the signal will be received by the antenna radio frequency transceiver module. Then, the recipient will control the electrical signals through the contactor as an interface with all electrical equipment. The operation of this system is at a fixed frequency of 315 MHz and distance control of electrical equipment is up to 10m at open space and subject to any restriction, antenna and supply of power. The results of this system are successfully demonstrated in the prototype of the remote control system for residential AC power supply. Some modifications have been proposed to improve the function of remote control system.</jats:p>"

When selecting a supplier, firms have to balance between benefits of production efficiency and costs of transactional integrity. To minimize the supplier's opportunism, firms devise formal and informal governance mechanisms that match with characteristics of the relationship at the firm level, sourcing strategy of the buyer, at the industry level, competition among suppliers, and at the country level, national culture where the supplier's operations are located. While concurrently employing both formal and informal governance mechanisms may be more effective in suppressing the supplier's opportunism, it may be too costly in the design and implementation. The best strategy for the buyers is to adopt the governance mechanism that matches with characteristics of the relationship at different levels. </jats:p>"

Majority of their products placed on their shelves are promoted to boost sales, compete efficiently and gain market share. Retailers have a natural tendency to keep a very close watch on various costs in whichever way they can be curtailed or controlled. Costs like Labor, Transportation, Vendor Deals and Inventory reduction are some of the key areas that are tracked and renegotiated very frequently by retailers worldwide. Safety Stock holding is one critical area where a lot of work can be done “empirically” by retailers and distributors to create stock efficiencies across their established supply chain networks. Application of appropriate statistical techniques on the right set of products can help us getting a trimmed down safety stock numbers which are still capable in addressing the demand and supply variability while holding much lesser stock and still achieve greater customer service levels.</jats:p>"

Despite a great deal of public and scholarly attention, this question remains largely unresolved. We demonstrate that the narrow focus on the relationship between white voters and minority representation is inadequate to understand why we do not see more minority-elected officials in the United States. We use a matching technique to investigate three theoretical perspectives of descriptive representation using a unique dataset from the 2012 general elections for state legislative seats in 14 states, the first elections after the 2010 redistricting process. Our findings challenge the venerable notion that minority candidates consistently underperform in white districts, and complicate our understanding of the political expression of bigotry in the voting booth.</jats:p>",

In this direction recently, Yu (2014) proposed some operators to aggregate the two types information described above effectively. In this paper, the weighted confidence level is used instead of simply confidence levels as used by Yu (2014) to enhance MCDM method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. So, two operators such as intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator under weighted confidence level (IFWAOUWCL) and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator under weighted confidence level (IFWGOUWCL) are introduced to aggregate the two types of information.

A biomass supply chain simulation model developed on the ExtendSim 8 simulation environment is presented in this paper. A number of sequential operations are applied in order biomass to be mowed, harvested, and transported to a biorefinery facility. Different operational scenarios regarding the travel distance between field and biorefinery facility, number of machines, and capacity of machines are analyzed showing how different parameters affect the processes within biomass supply chain in terms of time and cost. The results shown that parameters such as area of the field, travel distance, number of available machines, capacity of the machines, etc. should be taken into account in order a less time and/ or cost consuming machinery combination to be selected.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The economic deregulation of the airline industry in South Africa in 1991 was a landmark event and brought about various changes in the air transport market, both locally and internationally. One important after-effect of deregulation was the entry of low-cost carriers (LCCs) in 2001, which increased competition in the market and offered passengers the freedom to choose between full-cost carriers and LCCs. It is generally accepted that LCCs have been very successful across the globe, and the main reason for this lies in their simplified lower cost business models. One way of achieving lower costs is for LCCs to operate from secondary or alternative airports. This trend is observed in most regions of the world. In South Africa, and more specifically the Gauteng province, Lanseria International Airport is considered as an alternative airport to OR Tambo International Airport (the main international airport of South Africa and located about 30 km east of the Johannesburg Central Business District [CBD]). Currently, two LCCs operate from this airport with a third LCC airline indicating that it will shortly begin operations from this airport.Objectives: The research presented here reflects on the aspects passengers consider when selecting a secondary airport for their travel needs. It also compares the research findings of passenger attributes when choosing Lanseria Airport as a secondary airport in 2010 to a similar study in 2013 after another LCC commenced operations from the airport.Method: In this exploratory research a face-to-face survey was used as the quantitative data collection method in order to identify the factors that influenced passengers’ airport choice decisions at Lanseria International Airport.Results: From this research it emerged that when airports in a metropolitan area are close to one another, one of the main considerations for passengers is access time when selecting an airport. Even after a second LCC started operating from Lanseria International Airport, the attributes passengers regard as important in their decision to fly from the airport remained unchanged.Conclusion: The aim of the research is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors involved in secondary airport selection and, building on this knowledge, to assist airport owners and managers in positioning their airports in a multi-airport competitive environment. Similarly, the findings of the research could assist airlines in their decision-making process to operate from secondary airports</jats:p>"

This paper aimed to assess the relative role of e-SCM systems as consumer demand orders cascading upstream supply chain network. The study’s population, consisting of the managers (senior and functional levels) including supervisory level (non-managerial) from retail sales, logistics, warehousing, marketing, manufacturing and IT hubs organisations, comprised of 460 respondents. In order to achieve the paper’s objective, the researcher developed and distributed a survey questionnaire and collected and analysed the data using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The empirical results from the study reveal that business-to-business information technology (B2BIT) diffusion frequencies have an effect on supply chain performance and e-SCM implementation promotes connectivity among supply chain partners to entrench commitment of the exchanged demand order information to mitigate the bullwhip effect.</jats:p>"

Therefore, in this study, basic conditions for RGB image acquisition are derived for tracking roundwood by means of biometric features on log end faces within the wood supply chain from stump to sawmill. For this purpose, 24 logs were initially photographed in the forest after felling and photographed a second time 8 weeks later in the sawmill. Difficulties in image acquisition were analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing the images made in the forest with those made in the sawmill. The quantitative evaluation was carried out using different measures that are well established with respect to digital image processing. Tracking efforts solely by means of these measures turned out to be unsuitable. However, the shape measures performed best and are assumed to be supportive in combination with other methods. Therewith, conditions for a practical implementation in the future can be deduced.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper deals with the importance and need of using solar photovoltaic (PV) system as a stand-alone system instead of diesel generators for electrical energy supply of a communication tower owned by Celcom (Malaysia) Berhad at G0422 Batu 18, Ulu Langat, Selangor, Malaysia. It can be considered as a commercial renewable energy application in Malaysia, addressing the potential and possibility of adopting solar energy resources, particularly for sectors with high energy consumption. The electric power generation system, which consists of solar PV system hybrid with diesel generator, has the ability to provide 24 hours electricity to the load. To optimize the system design, this work compares a wide range of equipment with different constraints and sensitivities. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) was utilized for designing the system in the early phases of planning and decision making in rural electrification projects due to its flexibility. The analysis is based on the technical properties and life cycle cost (LCC) of the system. The initial capital cost, cost of installation and operation costs over the system’s life span is comprised in the LCC. This system offers a better reliability, efficiency, flexibility of planning and environmental benefits compared to the diesel generators systems by saving the environment from the burning of fossil fuels. The proposed system is able to supply 3.5kW of power which is suitable for actual site loading requirement of around 3kW. The economic output from HOMER exhibits that the tower without diesel generator, total net present cost is RM 610,639, the highest compared with a tower with diesel generator; RM 421,244.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Making concurrent decisions on assembly plans and supply chain configurations (SCCs) is a desirable strategy in today's competitive global market. Such concurrent decisions help reduce decision iterations for shortened lead time and lower the total cost for manufacturers and their supply chains. However, there lacks deep understanding of the interaction between assembly plans and SCCs, as well as methodologies for integrating them. In this paper, we consider an assembly planning problem that simultaneously decomposes an assembly product to modules and assigns the modules to suppliers. The joint decision is formulated as an optimization problem of finding the assembly decomposition and the corresponding supply chain network with the lowest total supply chain cost. We develop a coordinated decision-making method by integrating assembly AND/OR graphs with supply chain cost information. A dynamic programing (DP) based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the combined optimization problem. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can find optimal solutions for the integrated decision-making problem efficiently and provide a tool to plan assemblies from the perspective of the total supply chain cost in the early stages of product development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: South Africa has a disproportionately high freight transport demand owing to industrial development far from ports, low domestic beneficiation and improper modal use. Historical freight transport policy supported primary economic development, failing to preempt the changing economic structure and the resulting freight transport needs, resulting in excessive transport costs and externalities.Objectives: To share the macroeconomic freight transport challenges revealed by South Africa’s Logistics Barometer, and to identify key interventions to address these.Method: Freight flows are modelled by disaggregating the national input–output model into 83 commodity groupings and 372 geographical areas, culminating in a 30-year forecast at 5-year intervals for three scenarios, followed by distance-decay gravity modelling to determine freight flows. Logistics costs are calculated by relating these flows to the costs of fulfilling associated logistic functions.Results: Long-distance transport remains the largest general freight typology and is, due to inefficient macro logistics design, extremely costly, both in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic costs.Conclusion: South Africa’s freight task will grow 2.5-fold by 2043. Logistics and externality costs are already untenable at current levels. The development of domestic intermodal solutions will support the drive towards sustainable freight mobility.</jats:p>"

Most previous studies on variability of water supply in sub-Saharan Africa have largely focused on large urban settlements such as cities and towns. Thus, this chapter therefore presents findings from a study conducted to assess the causes and effects of erratic water supply in Kamwaza Township in Zimbabwe as well as to establish and evaluate coping strategies to the problem of erratic water supply. From the study, it was also observed that erratic water supply has socio-economic effects and these include high incidences of diseases, disruption of service delivery at institutions such as the hospital, clinic and schools and retarded infrastructural development. The study recommends a collaborative approach from all stakeholders in solving the problem of erratic water supply by upgrading the pumping station, repairing leaking pipes, employing people with technical expertise and sinking boreholes. </jats:p>"

The related hypotheses are developed and tested. The major findings include- marginalized and small farms, literacy and poor awareness level are the main causes for the backwardness of Indian farmers. Also, lack of funds forces farmers to ignore the use of cold storage. Further, multi-intermediaries and fluctuating consumer prices result farmers in not getting fair share of the consumer rupee. One of the major challenges in front of fresh food industry in India is to reduce postharvest losses across the chain through increasing awareness level of famers towards cold chain, building market information systems to assist farmers in decision-making and improving food safety and quality of farm produce available in the market. </jats:p>"

University management is not satisfied with the performance of transport wing in terms of profits and operational efficiency. This study is intended to examine the operational costs and optimal bus facility network allocation. For this study, data are collected from both primary and secondary sources. Data are analyzed on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. The results revealed that variations taken place in operating costs, transit operations could save better to management by reallocate resources as per operational cost changes. Transit network setting is one of the causes for incurring high costs. The data analysis reveals that there is a scope for increasing the profits by operational efficiency enhancement.

In step one, a classification of potential suppliers is performed in order to determine the optimal portfolio of suppliers. This is delivered by using the fuzzy multicriteria proposed ABC classification method. Uncertainties in relative importance of criteria and their values are described by linguistic expressions. Modelling of linguistic expressions is based on the fuzzy sets theory. In the second step, ranking of optimal portfolio of suppliers is performed by using the modified ELECTRE method. The obtained results represent valuable input for determining the long time purchasing strategy and building partnership with the best suppliers. The developed two-step model is verified on real life data. The obtained results indicate good compliance with the opinions management in this type of industry.

The weakness of Italian logistics, as reported in institutional and international documents, depends on: inadequate infrastructures; problems for connections; fragmentation of operators; inefficiency in single transportation services, lack in programming and regulation framework. This paper focuses on these subjects by presenting the results of a survey conducted on a sample of national and global forwarders. In the forwarders' view, priority should be given to the rail Trans European Network completion, which is crucial to implement cross border services; other works considered relevant by the forwarders regard the rail connections between the Northern and the Southern part of the country and the local intermodal connections. Last mile in ports areas and intermodal services represent other problematic issues. Logistics centres received a sufficient evaluation but their territorial distribution is considered too fragmented. Forwarders express adequate considerations for tariffs, timing and operators' efficiency and reliability, but not for the rail service. The supply-chain organization is not optimal due to lack of programming and to the fragmentation of operators. Endowment and use of ICT are adequate, but integration between different operators' systems is scarce. Our survey reveals some policy suggestions. Firstly, operators ask the public legislator to address innovation in the regulation framework and to select few realizable targets (in order to be selective in investments and to implement adequate incentives). Secondly, operators themselves could possibly concentrate and rationalize their supply and, where necessary, implement the logistics outsourcing. Finally, national and local logistics associations should enhance an integration of different ICT systems and promote the respect of minimum standard services. </jats:p>"

Empirical studies have been conducted in many countries to investigate the relation between e-loyalty and its antecedents in the online retail business. However empirical research on these lines is virtually non-existent in India. This chapter describes a theoretical model for investigating the influence of the antecedents: e-satisfaction, e-trust, e-service quality, and fulfilment on e-loyalty in the online retail context in India. The theoretical model is used as a basis to formulate hypotheses. The hypotheses are tested with data collected from a survey of online customers. The output from these tests show that e-satisfaction is the variable which affects e-loyalty to the maximum followed by e-service quality variables. E-trust directly affects e-loyalty and also indirectly through e-satisfaction. It is also established that e-service quality variables indirectly affect e-loyalty through e-satisfaction and e-trust. Fulfilment indirectly affects e-loyalty through e-satisfaction. </jats:p>"

On the basis of their own research and descriptions of specific examples, the authors think that future strategies will be more oriented on the use of “soft” competences of employees. This direction is confirmed by the quoted research conducted by independent companies. For the purposes of building the strategy of sustainable supply chains it is necessary to engage appropriate leaders who, to a larger degree than previously, will be able to motivate and encourage employees to creative thinking. An additional challenge is presented by generation Y and Z entering the labour market and their co-operation with generation X or even Baby Boomer. The challenged is met, in the authors' opinion, by consistent implementation of the CSR concept providing the basis for creating Lean Management model. </jats:p>"

It bridges the global trends affecting the mobile industry as a whole, with the creation and distribution of contents, emphasizing the new patterns of production and distribution. It shed light on the drivers of the changes taking place. The first part of this chapter identifies and sums up the main trends in a global landscape, namely the role of mobile communications (devices, networks) combined with the rise of the “app economy”, the spread of “Big Data”, and the move toward a multiscreen / cross-media paradigm. It provides a synthesis of available data. The first section tracks the evolution of the global market and the emerging geography with the rise of Asia as a leading player in the mobile world. The second section analyses the smartphone phenomenon. The third section deals with the rise of the “app economy”. The fourth section reviews the new modes of data driven management, stemming from “Big Data”. The fifth section follows the move a multi-screen world. The second part investigates some of the impacts of this fast evolving environment on the production of an array of mobile contents (portable movies, video, video games…) tracking the way content industries, while standing at the nexus of technology and content, are rapidly changing. The section documents the way mobile industry is indeed an innovation platform for new services. The section delineates the growing role of the consumer in a mobile world, its various modes of involvement in the production and distribution of digital content.

More specifically, they should take into account the endogenous features (e.g., available means of transportation, and the variety of products) and exogenous criteria (e.g., the environmental uncertainty, and transportation system conditions). In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem. The numerical results show the applicability of the proposed model and the capabilities of the solution approaches to the MINLP problem.</jats:p>"

The refrigeration equipments like cold storages and cold storing devices. They can keep the food quality cum safety intact and enhance food items shelf life. The information technology enables the tracking and tracing through data loggers etc. Despite the huge fresh produce availability in India, food inflation and food security issues are major concerns for policy makers. The food wastage in India is close to US$ 8309 million annually (US$ 60.17) due to lack of processing and cold storage facilities. The aim of this paper is to discuss status of food cold storage in India. The chapter is based on extensive review of existing literature, studying novel cold storage status and presenting benefits of cold storage. The outcome of research will be that FCCM can play vital role in supplying quality, safe food products and instrumental in reduction of food wastages. </jats:p>"

The benefit of the coordination between a buyer and a vendor is considered as the vendor requests to the buyer for changing the ordering quantity such that the vendor can be benefited from lower inventory costs. After accepting the buyer’s condition, the vendor compensates the buyer for his increased inventory cost and gives consent for additional savings by offering a quantity discount. The centralized decision making is examined for the effect of this strategy with the presence of backorder for buyer and inspection cost for the vendor. The quantity discount strategy, with the presence of variable backorder and inspections, can allow more savings for all players of supply chain. Some numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations are given to illustrate more savings from existing literature and comparisons between the several demand values.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter addresses the role of e-communication in international collaborations by examining its usage, cultural implications, and impact on trust building. Theoretically, this study is informed by social constructionism (Gergen, 1999; Goffman, 1959). Empirical insights were generated from the qualitative case study of WinCo which was an international collaboration between a UK-based wine and spirits multinational company and their distributors. The findings suggest that different e-communication channels are often used by collaborating partners to enhance the breadth and depth of their communication. New participants tend to enhance the skills of e-communication usage through self-learning, formal educational programs, and support from the company's employee development team. The widespread usage of e-communication impacts on partners' trust building in terms of their mutual perceptions of one another's competence and social bonding. National culture also affects partners' use of e-communication in international collaborative practice.</jats:p>"

One important area of corporate diversity management is supplier diversity, which is an inclusive growth program designed to help develop under-represented businesses into competitive suppliers of corporations. A major challenge of supplier diversity is that many minority suppliers lack the capability to deliver products which the corporate buyers need. Another major challenge is that few minority suppliers have the ability to participate in the global markets opportunities. We address these two problems by proposing an innovative “Flying High, Landing Soft” platform for international education in supplier diversity to help multinationals manage their global supplier diversity. </jats:p>"

The student's evaluation about an institute/college is based on multiple criteria. Realizing the need a focused review on the literature was made to understand the subject. The review highlighted that conventional methods for B-school evaluation are inadequate for dealing with the imprecise, uncertain or vague nature of linguistic assessment. To overcome this difficulty, due to MCDM problem, Fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods are proposed. The aim of this study is to use fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Analytical Hierarchal process (AHP) methods for the selection of better B-school. The proposed methods have been applied to a B-School selection problem of the students of NCR and results are presented. This chapter contributes to previous researches by adding a new avenue, where the MCDM technique can be useful. The selection of an institution for getting a professional degree is a very tough task for the students and as well as for their guardians. This method can help them to find a better solution by providing a quantitative framework. </jats:p>"

This chapter presents and comments from a sustainability perspective several IT concepts that can optimize the modern ECM (end-consumer movements) related logistics. They rely on the intelligent coordination of end-consumers demands (ranging from short-term to long-term), the resulting reduction of supply-chain-related traffic, and the networking of social resources involved in such city supply chains. The focus is placed on the creation of multidimensional synergies among the involved actors on all scales and the support of the participative supply-chain networks, which are driven by end-users. </jats:p>"

The model, taken from the literature, involves a multi-echelon, multi-facility and multi-product supply chain in a dynamic environment. Our bees algorithm, the first to be applied to this kind of problem, was adapted specifically to the optimization problem, and its performance was benchmarked against the genetic algorithm (GA) provided by commercial optimization software MATLAB R2011b. This is in order to test its effectiveness in an already known supply chain design problem, which has not been solved yet in optimized way. Several configurations of the algorithm were tested and analysed; the bees algorithm performs better of 10% in quality of solution respect to the GA with equivalent calculation time. The better quality of their solutions and the good calculation time performances have encouraged towards more accurate studies on tuning parameters and an extended utilization of the methodology on problems of logistic systems configuration and supply chain design. </jats:p>",

Facing uncertainty in supply and demand, firms have strived to achieve greater collaboration to leverage the resources and knowledge among supply chain partners. Supply chain collaborative firms gain more benefits by satisfying customer’s requirements as compared with firms those work individually and having no collaborative relation within partners of supply chain. Therefore there must be a proper understanding of the collaboration and its application within supply chain. One of the best methods to understand and create interest in collaboration is the understanding of the benefits which are come out from supply chain collaboration. Therefore in this study we indentify various benefits of supply chain collaboration from literature and design a relation between these benefits with each others, so those decision makers understand these benefits and proceed towards collaborative supply chain. In this study ISM methodology is used for modeling the benefits and MICMAC analysis is used for classifying these benefits according to driving and dependence power. The study is helpful for supply chain decision makers to implement collaboration in supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a power system, the basic physical law states that the total production is always exactly the same as total consumption. This physical law is always fulfilled no matter the type of power plants in the power system. In a power system with large shares of solar and wind power, this means that the other power plants have to fill the gap between actual solar plus wind power and the demand during each second/minute/hour. However, if there are large amounts of solar and wind power, then sometimes the available power from solar and wind exceeds the demand. In a future system based on large shares of solar and wind power, all these different situations have to be handled, and the question is how to analyze this. Three different methods concerning how to analyze systems with large shares of solar and wind power will be presented. The methods are applied to a Swedish case with close to 100% renewable power based on hydro, solar, wind and, bio‐fuelled combined heat and power (CHP). This study shows that there are limited balancing costs for this case. The costs for curtailment of surplus as well as to keep enough capacity to cover a high load combined with low solar and low wind is comparatively small, below 0.3 Eurocent/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">kWh</jats:styled-content>. However, more detailed studies are needed to quantify the exact cost under different conditions, but this study indicates the size of the challenges. <jats:italic>WIREs Energy Environ</jats:italic> 2016, 5:401–412. doi: 10.1002/wene.194</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy Infrastructure &gt; Systems and Infrastructure</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy Policy and Planning &gt; Systems and Infrastructure</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy and Development &gt; Systems and Infrastructure</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

The challenge to electronics manufacturers and designers is to make complex electronics work at the high temperatures, vibration, and extreme pressures encountered in these locations. Among the more critical electronic systems required for high temperature down-hole operations is high efficiency switching mode power supplies (SMPS). The use of high frequency switching permits not only decreasing the size of inductors and capacitors in the circuit design, but also obtaining typical power efficiencies up to 90%. Generally a SMPS is composed of a controller, a converter and silicon carbide (SiC) power switches. High temperature down-hole gauges operate with low voltages either 3.3V or 5.0V; however, wire-line surface power equipment utilizes higher voltages above 250 V CD. Hence, SMPS requires efficient power dissipation circuits to reduce the DC input voltage. This work describes a high temperature SMPS that has a DC input range from 150 V CD to 300 V CD, ± 6 V CD output voltages and 12 W total power. The SMPS design uses a CA start up pulse provided by a programmable surface power supply via a mono-conductor wire-line cable; subsequently, the SMPS sustains its operation by powering itself using one of the voltage outputs. The obtained laboratory tests results of the down-hole SMPS, using changes in temperature from 25 °C – 200 °C, provide a firm basis for testing and evaluating the DC-CD power supply in high temperature gauges in the field.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Debris flows have been recognized to be linked to amounts of material temporary stored in torrent channels. Consequently, sediment production, debris supply and storage changes from low-order channels of the Manival catchment (French Alps) were surveyed periodically during 16 months using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to study the coupling between sediment dynamics and torrent responses in terms of debris flow events, which happened twice during the monitoring period. Sediment transfer in the main torrent was monitored with cross-section surveys. Sediment budgets were generated seasonally using sequential TLS data differencing and morphological extrapolations. Debris production depends strongly on rockfall occurring during winter–early spring season, following power law distribution for volumes of rockfall events above 0.1 m3, while hillslope sediment reworking dominates debris recharge from spring to autumn. Both debris flows originate in channels exclusively, but their occurrence is linked to recharge from previous debris pulses coming from the hillside and from bedload transport. Headwater debris sources display an equivocal behaviour in sediment transfer: despite of rainstorms inducing debris flows in torrent, low geomorphic activity occurred in production zone. Still, a general reactivation of sediment transport in headwater channels was observed in autumn without new debris supply, suggesting no exhaustion of debris storages. The seasonal cycle of sediment yield seems therefore to depend not only on debris supply and runoff (flow capacity), but also on geomorphic conditions that destabilize remnant debris stocks. This study shows that a monitoring of torrent in-channel storage changes coupled to debris supply can readily improve knowledge on recharge threshold leading to debris flow, so their prediction.\n                        </jats:p>"

More importantly, when the platform acts as an e-tailer, the manufacturer and the traditional retailer can form a “win-win” situation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impacts of high technology industries have been growing increasingly to technological innovations and global economic developments, while the concerns in sustainability are calling for facilitating green materials and cleaner production in the industrial value chains. Today’s manufacturing companies are not striving for individual capacities but for the effective working with green supply chains. However, in addition to environmental and social objectives, cost and economic feasibility has become one of the most critical success factors for improving supply chain management with green component procurement collaboration, especially for the electronics OEM (original equipment manufacturing) companies whose procurement costs often make up a very high proportion of final product prices. This paper presents a case study from the systems perspective by using System Dynamics simulation analysis and statistical validations with empirical data. Empirical data were collected from Taiwanese manufacturing chains—among the world’s largest manufacturing clusters of high technology components and products—and their global green suppliers to examine the benefits of green component procurement collaborations in terms of shared costs and improved shipping time performance. Two different supply chain collaboration models, from multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) and universal serial bus 3.0 (USB 3.0) cable procurements, were benchmarked and statistically validated. The results suggest that the practices of collaborative planning for procurement quantity and accurate fulfillment by suppliers are significantly related to cost effectiveness and shipping time efficiency. Although the price negotiation of upstream raw materials for the collaborative suppliers has no statistically significant benefit to the shipping time efficiency, the shared cost reduction of component procurement is significantly positive for supply chain collaboration among green manufacturers. Managerial implications toward sustainable supply chain management were also discussed.</jats:p>"

The findings of this study show that customer-vendor partnership has a significant and positive relationship on safety behaviour. This approach to be examined for improved safety ownership and the possibility that enhancements would become an essential part of the vendor's processes, systems, and culture. This customer-vendor partnership approach will develop safety improvements for next heights of success. SPSS was applied for processing the data.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Bowersox Daugherty (1987) logistics strategy typology (Process Strategy, Market Strategy, and Information Strategy) is an important conceptual framework for studying logistics/supply chain management strategy and its role on logistics/supply chain management outcomes. The purpose of this research is to empirically apply the typology in Peru and compare the findings with the previous research conducted in Guatemala. The three Bowersox/Daugherty dimensions are used to define the construct Overall Logistic Strategy (OLS), and then, the OLS was used to measure Organizational Competitiveness (COMP) through two intervening variables LCE (Logistics Coordination Effectiveness) and CSC (Customer Service Commitment). The results indicate that generally the logistics strategy in Peru is fundamentally similar to Guatemala’s. In other words, the direction of the relationships among the conceptualized constructs tested in the SEM model was significant and explained a sizable variation in COMP in both countries. This provided additional support for the robustness of the structural model in different cultural environments. However, some differences are apparent. First, the importance of the three independent variables and three dependent variables appear to be greater to the Peruvian respondents than Guatemalan respondents. Second, on closer inspection Peruvian logistics data indicates relatively greater emphasis on information, coordination, customer service, and relatively less emphasis on cost efficiency, than Guatemalan managers. Managerial insights and suggestions for future research and discussed.</jats:p>"

In particular, increasing interest is recently being paid to the huge potentials &amp;ndash; in terms of benefits for the society at large &amp;ndash; that might result from the adoption of cloud computing technology by critical infrastructure (CI) operators. This is of course putting special emphasis on the need for dependable and trustworthy security mechanisms in cloud technology based services, since a critical infrastructure is vital for essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damages to a CI have serious impacts on the economy, and possibly make essential services unavailable to the communities it serves. In this paper we present the proof-of concept of a cloud-based Water Supply Network Monitoring (WSNM) application, named RiskBuster (RB), that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of SCADA monitoring data collected from dam sensors and stored in the cloud by using the innovative Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX) technology.</jats:p>"

In centralized organizations, the measurement data is often collected through reporting, but the trends in modern organizations with empowered teams, globalized development, and needs to monitor continuously longer supply chains requires shift in the design and use of measurement systems. In this chapter, we present a study of evolving measurement systems at three companies with global businesses – Ericsson, Volvo Cars, and Axis Communications. The results of the study include the identification of the timeline of the evolution, distinct generations of measurement systems and information needs in the different phases of the evolution. The experiences show how to evolve centralized decision support systems to support global and distributed decision support. </jats:p>"

Tests were conducted at a semi-industrial pilot plant, using groundwater with a high content of NOM (5.1 ± 0.8 mg C/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC); 0.211 ± 0.007 cm−1 UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254)) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP (273 ± 73 μg/L)). It was determined that both coagulants showed similar efficacy in reducing DOC (∼50%), UV254 (∼60%) and THMFP (∼65%). Application of pre-ozonation enhanced total coagulation efficiency (up to 61% and 80% for DOC and UV254, respectively), probably due to its microflocculation effect. THMFP in the treated water fluctuated depending on ozone dose, coagulant type and pH. The pre-treatment resulted in NOM oxidation to lower molecular weight hydrophilic organic substances. PACL1 coagulation did not efficiently remove these new THM precursors, whereas PACL2 was able to reduce THMFP to 77 μg/L at a low ozone dose of 0.4 mg O3/mg DOC, suggesting differences in the coagulation mechanism for the two coagulants. This difference confirms the necessity of optimizing the combined treatment depending upon the choice of coagulant applied.</jats:p>",

Six indicators representing four key eco-hydrological attributes of sustainable water supply namely vegetation and soil at the riparian buffer zone, the hydrology and water quality of the stream, were assessed. Tree basal area was found to be high ranging from 56.08 m2 ha-1 to 65.46 m2 ha-1 in undisturbed sites. These values are higher than other tropical forests in Southeast Asia. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were at critical levels. Mean streamflow was significantly declining at 0.101 m3 s-1 yr-1(p&lt;0.001) suggesting the possibility of diminishing water supply in the coming years. The annual mean water turbidity was significantly increasing at 2.572 NTU yr-1 or 22.48% yr--1(p&lt;0.001) hinting at higher frequency of chemical treatment and increasing risk of exposure to disinfection by-products  in  drinking  water.  Annual  high  turbidity  day  count  occurred  more  than  90  days from 2007 to 2013 with the highest at 181 days in 2011. The overall ecological integrity rating of Pasonanca Natural Park is poor. The withdrawal of the riparian buffer zone from strict protection status and its reclassification to special use zone to pave the way for active management should be considered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Port-centric logistics clusters are considered as intermodal gateways and/or hubs of international trade, which connect national economies with global production networks. These clusters are spatial agglomeration of logistics related interconnected and interdependent companies. Singapore, Dubai and Rotterdam are world class exemplary of port-centric logistics clusters. The formation of these clusters is a derivative of conducive business environment generated within a geographically defined area. Despite the recognition of port-centric approach to economic development there is insufficient evidence to empirically assess the functional and spatial characteristics of port centric logistics clusters. There is also disagreement on three key questions: how port-centric logistics clusters are defined and identified, what industry types do they constitute and what methods are appropriate to delineate the boundary of port centric logistics cluster. In this paper, a spatial approach is adopted to geographically delineate the spatial congregation of port-centric logistics employment using three major container ports in Australia. Using the Census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS 2006), analysis has been conducted on employment data containing information about where people work and what industry they work within the close vicinity of case study seaports. The results show that the spatial extent Australian port centric logistics clusters, which tend to vary both in size and shape. Overall size of employment in port-related industries in Australia has grown substantially. Road freight is dominating industry in the port-centric logistics cluster with a contribution of 23.02% and 37.54% in 2001 and 2006 respectively. The range of port-centric logistics cluster in Melbourne is towards western suburbs and in Botany Bay the port-centric logistics cluster is discerned mainly around eastern suburbs and in Brisbane the spread of port-centred logistics cluster is towards southeast inner Brisbane and Northwest Inner Brisbane suburbs. This shows the impact of land use consolidation by the State Government in their effort to boost transport and warehousing employment closer to Australian container ports. The establishment of port-centric logistics clusters, we argue, could mean the opportunities for organisations to achieve agglomeration economies, increase rivalry among organizations to promote competition, access to greater pool of customers, availability of skilled labour force, closer proximity between customers and supplier, sharing of public infrastructure and resources, increased inter-firm interactions, and knowledge spill-over. </jats:p>"

In this respect, with increasing globalization and ever-expanding supply chains, interdependencies between organizations have increased and the selection of suppliers has become more important than ever. This exploratory research study intends to develop a novel approach for a specific type of supplier selection problem which is supplier pre-evaluation. A two-staged multi-layered feed forward neural networks (NN) algorithm for pattern recognition was used to pre-evaluate suppliers under strategy-based organizational and technical criteria. Data for training, validation and testing the network were collected from a global Tier-1 manufacturing company in the automotive industry. The results show that the proposed approach is able to classify candidate suppliers into three separate groups of risky, potential or preferred. With this classification, it becomes feasible to eliminate risky suppliers before doing business with them. </jats:p>"

The dominant power between manufacturer and retailer and the effect of channel competition strategy on price are mainly discussed. In addition, dynamic system concepts are integrated into Stackelberg game model based on bounded rational mechanism. We analyze the local stability and find that the stability level of the dual-channel supply chains depends crucially on the price adjustment speed, the level of demand uncertainty, and the risk preference. The outcome shows that, under the master-slave game model, the profits of manufacturers are greater than that under decentralized decision-making mode, and the profits of retailers under master-slave game model are less than that under decentralized decision-making mode. The profits of manufacturers and retailers in the stable region are greater than that in unstable region. Finally, the delay feedback control method is utilized and effectively controls the chaotic behavior of dual-channel supply chain model. The results have theoretical and practical significance for the game models in terms of advertising and price competition.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sustainability issue has been acknowledged as a universal contemporary challenge within an entirely new, unprecedented and irreversible global economic, social, cultural and physical contemporary environment. Critical role plays the interdisciplinary Supply Chain Management (SCM) and its advance to sustainable SCM and more recently to green SCM. The field of sustainability in the wine industry appears as a breeding ground for the development of multidisciplinary collaborations, as well as for the application of innovative practices in the framework of entrepreneurship, in both forward and reverse agrifood chains. In such a context, this paper studies the exploitation of the opportunities derived from the wine production and waste management, within the totally new business, economic, social and physical environment. More specifically, it presents a start-up business plan conducted by Agricultural University in collaboration with the Harokopio University of Athens, Greece; it regards a wine waste management company in the island of Crete, Greece, highlighting the transformation of challenges to opportunities for innovation to more efficient use of by-products and wastes. It is noticed that this industry has shown historically exceptional innovative capability and flexibility, for climate privileged quality products in East Mediterranean region. The conclusions and recommendations drawn in this study, provide useful insights and directions for future research that are expected to enrich the available knowhow in the wine industry which is particularly suitable for research on sustainability and in any way, must proceed to commitment for protecting the environment. The empirical case study in the island of Crete is expected to facilitate the attempts to transform the crisis to continuing sustainability performance of wine industry under contemporary world market conditions, along with potential broader managerial implications towards environmental protection and strengthening the social consensus through further future research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management is a popular practice in any world class organization. The traditional supply chain was managed with the objectives to reduce cost without focusing on environmental and social dimensions. However with passage of time institutional pressures has directed firms to design supply chain network which takes care of environmental and social dimensions as well. Green supply chain management concept has evolved gradually over a period of time. The main reason behind evolution of green supply chain management is conservation of natural resources which human beings ignored for long. Published reports show that major portion of the energy is supplied by fossil fuels and thereby depletion of natural resources is occurring at an accelerating rate with time. Industrial manufacturing report also suggest that demand for manufacturing products is likely to double by the year 2050. This will result in high generation of pollutants and gases. If the greenhouse gases emissions remain unchecked, then it will create a catastrophic effect by 2050. Globally manufacturers and industry associations are now acting proactively to conserve the natural resources and curb greenhouse gases emissions. The level of popularity of green supply chain management can be estimated from the high research output in leading operations journals such as IJPE, IJPR, Resources, Conservation and Recycling Journals. Green supply chain management is a concept that is also gaining popularity in the South African region. For many organizations in this region it is a process to exhibit their sincere commitment to sustainability. However, if green supply chain management practices are to be fully adopted by all mining and minerals industry in South Africa, a demonstrable link between such measures and understanding the role of associated variables is necessary. This paper endeavors to develop a green supply chain management model for mining and minerals industry in the South African region. The approach extends the domain of green supply chain research and produce theories that have greater explanatory power than the current practices. For this purpose a conceptual model was developed from literature review and data collected using a structured questionnaire mailed to a sample of 174 firms which are leading edge ISO14001 certified mining companies in South Africa. Data analysis is further performed through exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis. This paper presents the first empirical evaluation of the link between green supply chain management practices amongst a sample of mining and minerals companies in South Africa.</jats:p>"

Identification of supply chain strategy of the organization, determination of decision criteria, and methods of supplier selection are appearing to be the most important components in research area in the field of supply chain management. In this paper, evaluation of suppliers is done based on the balanced scorecard framework using new distance measure in fuzzy TOPSIS by considering the supply chain strategy of the manufacturing organization. To take care of vagueness in decision making, trapezoidal fuzzy number is assumed for pairwise comparisons to determine relative weights of perspectives and criteria of supplier selection. Also, linguistic variables specified in terms of trapezoidal fuzzy number are considered for the payoff values of criteria of the suppliers. These fuzzy numbers satisfied the Jensen based inequality. A detailed application of the proposed methodology is illustrated.</jats:p>"

So it needs scalable distributed system rather than a centralized one. The cloud computing has become a great solution for providing a flexible, on-demand and dynamically scalable computing infrastructure for many applications. It provides significant technology trends and it is reshaping and blooming the IT industry.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-known combinatorial optimization problem had been presented by Dantzing and Hamser in 1959. The problem has taken its inspiration from the transport field. In real field environment, a lot of variants of the problem exist that actually belongs to the class of NP-hard problem. Dynamic Vehicle routing problem (DVRP) is one of the variant of VRP that varies with respect to time. In DVRP, new customer orders appear over time and new route must be reconfigured at any instantaneous time. Although, some exact algorithms such as dynamic programming methods, branch and bound etc. can be applied to find the optimal route of a smaller size VRP. But, These Algorithms fail to give the solution of existed model of VRP in real field environment under given real time constraints. Courier services, dial a ride services and express mail delivery etc. are the few examples of real field environment problems that can be formulated in the form of DVRP. In this chapter, A novel variants of DVRP named as DVRP with geographic ranking (DVRP-GR) has been proposed. In DVRP-GR, geographical ranking, customer ranking, service time, expected reachability time, customer satisfaction level have been optimized. A solution of DVRP-GR using seed based particle swarm optimization (S-DVRS-PSO) has been also proposed. The simulations have been performed using customized simulator developed in C++ environment. The data sets used in the simulations are OMK-01, OMK-02 and OMK-03 generated in real vehicular environment. The solution of the proposed algorithm has been compared with the randomized solution technique. Analysis of the simulation results confirms the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of various parameters considered viz. number of vehicles, expected reachability time, profit and customer satisfaction. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work proposes a new approach, based on Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), to configure Supply Chains (SC) so as to deliver orders on due date and at the minimum cost. For a set of orders, this approach determines which supplier to acquire components from and which manufacturer will produce the products as well as which transportation mode must be used to deliver products to customers. The aforementioned decisions are addressed by three modules. The data module stores all data relating to SC and models the SC. The optimization engine is a multi-agent framework called SC Configuration by ACO. This module implements the ant colony algorithm and generates alternative SC configurations. Ant-k agent configures a single SC travelling by the network created by the first agent. While Ant-k agent visits a stage, it selects an option to perform a stage based on the amount of pheromones and the cost and lead time of the option. We solve a note-book SC presented in literature. Our approach computes pareto sets with SC design which delivers product from 38 to 91 days. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n<jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> The European Commission's Single Market for Green Products initiative proposes a set of actions to overcome the problems companies and consumers face with the diverse amount of environmental information and methods available on the market. Amongst the proposed actions are the establishment of a Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology and a three year Pilot phase to develop product specific rules through a multi-stakeholder process. The aim of proposing the EU-wide PEF methodology is to measure the environmental performance of products and to encourage Member States and the private sector to take them up. VITO is involved in three building related pilots: hot and cold water supply piping systems in buildings, insulation materials used in buildings and metal sheets applied in buildings. In 2017 the Commission will make an in-depth evaluation of the results of this three-year testing period and the results of additional actions related to communication and recommendations. Based on this evaluation, the Commission will decide on further policy applications of the PEF methodology.</jats:p><jats:p>PEF pilot on hot and cold water supply piping systems in the building</jats:p><jats:p>The Pilot on hot and cold water supply piping systems, submitted by The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association (TEPPFA), the European Copper Institute (ECI), the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), the European Association of Plastics Manufacturers (PlasticsEurope) and the Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE) is one of the Pilots accepted by the Commission for the three-years testing PEF Pilot phase. During the Pilot phase Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for hot and cold water supply piping systems need to be developed. The PEFCR helps directing the focus of future PEF studies on hot and cold water supply piping systems to the most important parameters, thus also reducing time, efforts and costs. To foster the development of a PEFCR, PEF screening studies have been carried out. The representative product used in these screening studies is a virtual product based on the market shares of PEX (cross-linked polyethylene), Multilayer (Polymer/Aluminium/Polymer) and Copper hot and cold water supply piping systems. The weighted PEF environmental profile shows that the most relevant life cycle stages, having a contribution of &gt;10%, are the acquisition and pre-processing of the raw materials for pipes, fittings and other components, manufacturing of pipes together with the ‘end-of-life treatment’. Based on expert knowledge it has been decided to consider as important also the life cycle stages related to the manufacturing of the fittings.</jats:p><jats:p>The PEF screening studies looked at 15 different life cycle impact categories. After normalisation of the results, the categories resource depletion (mineral, fossil), resource depletion water and human toxicity cancer effects are found to be the most important impact categories for the hot and cold water supply systems. Besides the above conclusions, the screening studies revealed that publicly available datasets for many processes and materials are missing. Moreover, the available data are often of poor quality which influences the outcome of the study. Also taking into account or not level III toxicity substances influences the outcome of the screening studies.</jats:p><jats:p>Currently PEF supporting studies are performed together with specific producers of PEX, Multilayer and Copper piping systems for hot and cold water supply in the buildings. The PEF supporting studies needs to be compliant with any specific requirement included in the draft PEFCR that has been developed, comprising all environmental impact categories and having a full coverage in terms of life cycle stages and processes. The PEF supporting studies are based on existing products as currently sold in the European market. The goal of the PEF supporting studies is to support evidence to the PEFCR development and the intended audience. The studies will be carried out under the assumption that the result will be used to contribute to the development of a PEFCR that could support comparisons or comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public. The results of these studies will be used to test the pertinence and implementability of the draft PEFCR including, but not limited to, the identified most relevant environmental impacts, issues related to data collection and quality, verification requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty analysis carried out on the results of the the PEF supporting studies may contribute to the identification of appropriate performance classes (where relevant and appropriate).</jats:p><jats:p>Presentation at the ARC conference 2016</jats:p><jats:p>The presentation at the ARC 2016 conference will focus on the results of testing the PEF methodology as published by the EC in 2013, step by step. In addition the presentation will illustrate the application of the methodology and illustrate the assessment results of the screening studies. By March 2016 when the ARC 2016 conference will take place, it is expected that the first results of the supporting studies will be ready, so that we can also present first results on the outcome of these studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a hybrid method for modeling and solving supply chain optimization problems with soft, hard, and logical constraints. Ability to implement soft and logical constraints is a very important functionality for supply chain optimization models. Such constraints are particularly useful for modeling problems resulting from commercial agreements, contracts, competition, technology, safety, and environmental conditions. Two programming and solving environments, mathematical programming (MP) and constraint logic programming (CLP), were combined in the hybrid method. This integration, hybridization, and the adequate multidimensional transformation of the problem (as a presolving method) helped to substantially reduce the search space of combinatorial models for supply chain optimization problems. The operation research MP and declarative CLP, where constraints are modeled in different ways and different solving procedures are implemented, were linked together to use the strengths of both. This approach is particularly important for the decision and combinatorial optimization models with the objective function and constraints, there are many decision variables, and these are summed (common in manufacturing, supply chain management, project management, and logistic problems).

Additionally, the proposed hybrid transformed model is compared with the MILP-Mixed Integer Linear Programming model on the same data instances. For illustrative models, its use allowed finding optimal solutions eight to one hundred times faster and reducing the size of the combinatorial problem to a significant extent.</jats:p>"

Triple Bottom Line (TBL) is considered as framework in order to establish the relevant measures in an effective and comprehensive manner. The measures for performance measurements are classified in the three aspects of TBL known as economic, environmental and social. Therefore, 6 measures with 26 indicators, 8 measures with 31 indicators and 3 measures with 23 indicators were identified for economic, environmental and social aspects respectively. To establish the importance and applicability of developed measures, a survey will be conducted among the experts from academics and industries.

In this context, we have identified the factors relating to self-concept, like the need for uniqueness and clothing interest are insignificant, but the perceived quality of foreign brand apparel is a significant factor in determining the purchase intention. The construct of perceived quality forms a significant component in the modified Ajzen (1991) Model, which along with its traditional constructs suit the Indian consumer. We also find that perceived behavioural control (PBC) if split into external PBC and internal PBC become insignificant to the model. We therefore recommend that foreign entrants into the Indian market adopt suitable segmentation, distribution and operational strategies to leverage on the high quality perception of foreign brand apparel in the Indian market.</jats:p>"

The soils used in the study were taken from Kibangay, Bukidnon; Mapayag, Bukidnon; Kapatagan, Davao del Sur; Claveria, Misamis Oriental and Cabintan, Leyte representing the acid soils of southern Philippines planted to vegetables. Results of the nutrient omission trials showed that the three vegetables tested have varying responses to five different soils as affected by nutrient availability. In most soils, regardless of vegetable planted, nitrogen (N) availability was the most critical nutrient affecting vegetable production followed by phosphorus (P) in the case of Cabintan and potassium (K) for Mapayag, Kibangay, Kapatagan and Claveria, respectively. This valuable diagnostic tool offers a cheap and simple method of assessing the nutrient supplying capacity of the various soils tested.</jats:p>"

Next, the most-effective QM system within international suppliers is analyzed by the means of a new application based on LDA. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The results reveal that international suppliers perform worse for all quality factors compared to domestic USA suppliers, which may leave the door open for reshoring activities. Furthermore, it is shown that Lean and Six Sigma within international suppliers lead to superior levels of quality because they are aligned along the most opposite directions against reshore vector. Therefore, it is claimed that Lean and Six Sigma within the international suppliers can inhibit reshoring activities of US companies. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The willingness of US textile companies to assist their international suppliers and the challenges on this subject are discussed on the basis that supplier development (or quality management) programs can be strong alternatives to reshoring activities. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – QM systems in suppliers are analyzed with a new method within a new context based on reshore phenomenon, which provides an essential point of view for academic and industrial environments.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The main objective in designing a supply chain is to keep the cost as low as possible. However, the modelling of a supply chain requires more than single-objective such as lead-time minimization, service level maximization, and environmental impact maximization among others. Usually these objectives may cause conflicts such as increasing the service level usually causes a growth in costs. Therefore, the aim should be to find trade-off solutions to satisfy the conflicting objectives. The aim of this chapter is to propose a new method based on a hybrid version of the Bees Algorithm with Slope Angle Computation and Hill Climbing Algorithm to solve a multi-objective supply chain network design problem. A real case from the literature has been selected and solved in order to show the potentiality of the proposed method in solving a large scale combinatorial problem.</jats:p>"

However, WTG and PV have an inconstant power production problem. To solve this problem, multi-state models have been proposed. The electricity generated from these units varies with different time scales: hourly, daily and seasonally. Since planning an optimal size generates cost losses to the customer, three models should be built: a load model, generation model, and service cost model. Loss of energy expectation (LOEE) and loss of load expected (LOLE) are calculated for the load and generation model. The reliability value is calculated to determine the number of required renewable generators. As a result, the system is constructed to have sufficient capacity, and the utility cost became the main objective of the total service costs. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Optimally selection of an appropriate mix of renewable sources for supplying electricity of remote areas has been always an important challenge for policy makers. Also, in recent years, the great advantages of Demand Side Management (DSM) programs such as postponing investments in construction of new plants and/or desirably modification of electricity consumption pattern has turned great attention of energy planners to these programs. Moreover, the issue of global warming has caused the need for reduction of human use of fossil fuels and switching to employing green energy sources. To address the mentioned concerns, in this paper, an integrated mathematical formulation for selecting the best mix of renewable energy technologies is proposed. In this study, DSM considered as a competitive option against supply-side alternatives for making energy planning decisions. Additionally, by considering real data from a case in Iran, the effects of considering energy import and export has been taken into account. To validate the model, for smaller-scaled test problems the model has been solved by Lingo 8.0 software while for solving larger instances of problems (real scale of case study) a novel genetic algorithm (GA) is devised. The numerical results indicate that DSM policies have made use of their maximum capacity and resulted in significant improvements, especially in terms of reducing consumption and suitably changing the load shape.</p>",

We present estimates that are corrected for this bias and find that it is comparatively small. Second, we show that the effects of twin-birth-induced variation in family size, as well as characteristics of the compliers, varies substantially with time passed since birth, which has consequences for the interpretation of estimates across samples and time.</jats:p>",

Ongoing discussions on APC reimbursement and costs might lead to a potential shift in pooled PC (PPC)/APC production. Objective of this analysis was to build a comprehensive model from the societal perspective to evaluate consequences associated with shifts in platelet supply and demand. &lt;b&gt;Methods: &lt;/b&gt;Literature search, desktop researches on platelet supply and demand. Model calculations, time horizon one year: model input from the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, data 2013. Base case: 19.2% of annual whole blood donations (WBDs) were used for production of 38.5% PPCs, decay of 46,218 PCs (8.0%). Scenarios calculated: variation in PPC proportion of 10-100%. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Base case: during PPC production 41,957-83,913 red blood cell concentrates (RBCCs) are estimated to be lost, which corresponds to 1-2% of annual RBCCs in Germany. Scenarios were calculated for a production of 60-100% PPCs: loss is estimated to be 1.5-5.0% of annual RBCCs (65,430-218,099), decay 54,189-69,022 PCs (9.4-12.0%). &lt;b&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/b&gt;Production of different blood components is interlinked and sensitive to unidimensional decisions. Increasing PPC proportion has negative impact on the RBCC production and on the antigen-matched APC donor pool. Completion of the model calculations to predict the optimal PPC/APC proportion would require evidence on the number of refractory patients, donor pool sizes, and incidences of diseases requiring platelet transfusions.</jats:p>"

Previous analysis has suggested that with low fertiliser input, yields of sorghum increased as temperatures increased. We used the wide range of tropical environments in the small mountainous island country of Timor-Leste to evaluate the impact of global warming on maize (Zea mays) yields with (i) no fertiliser input and (ii) increased nitrogen (N) supply. We calibrated the well-tested APSIM-Maize model for the cultivar of maize grown throughout Timor-Leste. We simulated maize yields at four locations with 8 years of reliable weather records, at present temperatures, +1.5°C and +3.0°C, with 0, 40 and 80 kg/ha of added N, with 1.2, 1.9 and 3.8% soil organic carbon (SOC), and with increased duration of the vegetative phase. With no added N, higher temperatures increased yields at the cooler, higher elevation sites and decreased yields at the warmest site near the coast. With fertiliser application, warming temperatures decreased yields or induced no change in simulated yield at all locations. Simulations with three levels of N supply for the four sites, which differed in temperature, showed a strong temperature × N supply interaction on yield. At maximum growing-season temperatures &gt;31°C, yields decreased with increasing temperature at all levels of fertilisation. At maximum growing-season temperatures of 23−31°C, yields increased with increasing temperature with no added fertiliser, were unchanged with the application of 40 kg N/ha, and decreased with increasing temperatures with application of 80 kg/ha N. The changes in yield with temperature and N supply were associated with N uptake by the maize, which showed the same interaction with maximum temperature and N added. SOC acted as a source of N, so that changes in yield induced by temperature and N were similar whether the N was from an organic or an inorganic source. Increasing the duration of the vegetative phase resulted in lower or no change in yields at all sites. We conclude that global warming will increase the yield for low-input smallholder farmers growing maize at maximum growing-season temperatures &lt;31°C, but that micro-dosing with N will increase yields at all locations with mean maximum temperatures of 20−35°C.\n</jats:p>"

Rethinking and realigning existing business processes has been touted to offer significant potential in reducing the ecological footprint. Specifically, the role of logistics and supply chain has come into prominence in this regard. In this chapter, a supply chain with a single vendor and multiple retailers has been considered. Initially, we assume that the retailers take care of their respective replenishment decisions. Then, it is shown that by adopting vendor managed inventory, the organizations involved can benefit through cost reduction, and at the same time reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, thereby highlighting the role of supply chain coordination in meeting the twin objectives. Managerial and policy insights based on our numerical analysis have also been provided. </jats:p>"

However, little is known about how players in petroleum industry operate in those business environments. The purpose of this chapter is to explore establishment of a relationship between supplier-logistic firms in a post planned economy. The study employed case study interview with two petroleum products distributors in Tanzania to achieve its objective. Data were analyzed by thematic analytical techniques. Three major findings regarding buyer-suppliers relationships in developing economies are presented: actors do not prefer to enforce contract that they sign, discretional relationships exist in petroleum business among actors and ‘undugunization' is the strongest criteria in selection of actors. Study implies that for a supplier-logistic relationship to exist government has a great role to play in enforcement of laws. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a computer simulation model of a thermally activated roof (TAR) to cool a room using cool water from a wet cooling tower. Modeling was achieved using a simplified 1-D resistance-capacitance thermal network (RC model) for an infinite slab. Heat transfer from the cooling pipe network was treated as 2-D heat flow. Only a limited number of nodes were required to obtain reliable results. The use of 6th order RC-thermal model produced a set of ordinary differential equations that were solved using MATLAB - R2012a. The computer program was written to cover all possible initial conditions, material properties, TAR system geometry and hourly solar radiation. The cool water supply was considered time dependent with the variation of the ambient wet bulb temperature. Results from RC-thermal modeling were compared with experimental measurements for a second story room measuring 5.5 m x 4 m x 3 m at Amarah city/ Iraq (31.865 ˚N, 47.128 ˚E) for 21 July, 2013. The roof was constructed of 200 mm concrete slab, 150 mm turf and 50 mm insulation. Galvanized 13 mm steel pipe coils were buried in the roof slab with a pipe occupation ratio of 0.12. The walls were constructed of 240 mm common brick with 10mm cement plaster on the inside and outside surfaces and 20 mm Styrofoam insulation on the inside surface and covered with PVC panel. Thermistors were used to measure the indoor and outdoor temperatures, TAR system water inlet and outlet temperatures and temperature distribution inside the concrete slab. The effect of pipe spacing and water mass flow rate were evaluated. Agreement was good between the experimental and RC-thermal model. Concrete core temperature reaches the supply water temperature faster for lower pipe spacing. Heat extracted from the space increased with water mass flow rate to an optimum of 0.0088 kg/s.m².&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is considerable year‐to‐year variability in the supply of cellulosic biomass used in the production of cellulosic biofuels, yet strategies to mitigate these variations in biofuel development are not well understood. Biorefineries and farmers venturing into the cellulosic biofuel industry will require biomass supply and contracting strategies that can minimize the impact of these large variations. Some studies have proposed biomass pre‐treatment and storage to address biomass supply variations. Other studies have used transportation modeling approaches to manage supply variations and select the optimal location of a cellulosic biorefinery. However, storage, pre‐treatment, and similar engineering approaches lead to higher costs and have other limitations such as additional infrastructural requirements. There is a gap in understanding how contracting strategies between biorefineries and the biomass suppliers (farmers) can reduce the risks with biomass supply variations. In this study, the contracting structure between biorefineries and biomass suppliers is studied under different market structures for the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> Corn Belt. A theoretical framework is then developed to use contracting strategies for mitigating the impact of biomass supply variations. First, the trade‐offs between intricately linked components of biomass cost, such as biomass transport, biomass price (incentive) to suppliers, variation in biomass supply, biorefinery size, and alternative feedstock availability are examined. Next, an optimal contracting structure is developed between biorefineries and biomass suppliers using game theoretic analysis. Results show that both the impact of biomass supply variations and the overall biomass cost can be significantly reduced through the use of the optimal contracting strategy between biorefineries and suppliers. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Even though this problem is widespread, there have been limited attempts to implement risk‐based approaches for testing and supply chain management. Supply chain risk management tends to focus on the highly visible disruptions of the supply chain instead of the covert entrance of counterfeits; thus counterfeit risk is difficult to mitigate. This article provides an overview of the complexities of the electronics supply chain, and highlights some gaps in risk assessment practices. In particular, this article calls for enhanced traceability capabilities to track and trace parts at risk through various stages of the supply chain. Placing the focus on risk‐informed decision making through the following strategies is needed, including prioritization of high‐risk parts, moving beyond certificates of conformance, incentivizing best supply chain management practices, adoption of industry standards, and design and management for supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

Through the activity, students learn the basics of SCI and then analyze an SCI event to better appreciate the need for collaboration and information sharing. In courses that address supply chain management, instructors can use the activity early in the semester to introduce students to the complexities of supply chain networks. Alternatively, instructors may use the simulation later to provoke a more nuanced discussion.</jats:p>",

A hybrid forecasting method was proposed based on support vector regression (SVR) model-optimized particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. Due to the interaction of meteorological conditions and the heating parameters of heating system, it is extremely difficult to forecast dynamic heat supply. Firstly, the correlations among heat supply and related influencing factors in the heating system were analyzed through the correlation analysis of statistical theory. Then, the SVR model was employed to forecast dynamic heat supply. In the model, the input variables were selected based on the correlation analysis and three crucial parameters, including the penalties factor, gamma of the kernel RBF, and insensitive loss function, were optimized by PSO algorithms. The optimized SVR model was compared with the basic SVR, optimized genetic algorithm-SVR (GA-SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) through six groups of experiment data from two heat sources. The results of the correlation coefficient analysis revealed the relationship between the influencing factors and the forecasted heat supply and determined the input variables. The performance of the PSO-SVR model is superior to those of the other three models. The PSO-SVR method is statistically robust and can be applied to practical heating system.</jats:p>"

Based on adenylate data, P-stressed nodules maintained their P status better than P-stressed roots. V. divaricata was able to alter C and N metabolism differently in roots and nodules under P stress. This was achieved via internal P cycling by possible replacement of membrane phospholipids with sulfolipids and galactolipids, and increased reliance on the pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent metabolism of sucrose via UDP-glucose (UDPG) and to fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P). P-stressed roots mostly exported ureides as organic N and recycled amino acids via deaminating glutamate dehydrogenase. In contrast, P-stressed nodules largely exported amino acids. Compared with roots, nodules showed more P conservation during low P supply. The roots and nodules of V. divaricata metabolised N differently during P stress, meaning that these organs may contribute differently to the success of this plant in soils from forest to fynbos.</jats:p>"

If the original manufacturers or suppliers of parts end their supply, this may have large impacts on operating costs of firms needing these parts. Existing end‐of‐supply evaluation methods are focused mostly on the downstream supply chain, which is of interest mainly to spare part manufacturers. Firms that purchase spare parts have limited information on parts sales, and indicators of end‐of‐supply risk can also be found in the upstream supply chain. This article proposes a methodology for firms purchasing spare parts to manage end‐of‐supply risk by utilizing proportional hazard models in terms of supply chain conditions of the parts. The considered risk indicators fall into four main categories, of which two are related to supply (price and lead time) and two others are related to demand (cycle time and throughput). The methodology is demonstrated using data on about 2,000 spare parts collected from a maintenance repair organization in the aviation industry. Cross‐validation results and out‐of‐sample risk assessments show good performance of the method to identify spare parts with high end‐of‐supply risk. Further validation is provided by survey results obtained from the maintenance repair organization, which show strong agreement between the firm's and the model's identification of high‐risk spare parts.</jats:p>",

Without assessing whether the BHFS malfunction occurred in those studies, we constrain the possible underestimation of emissions associated with the BHFS-based results by excluding potentially affected measurements. Assuming leak emission rates are similar for sites with low and high methane content, U.S. methane emissions from equipment leaks and chemical injection pumps in recent studies could be underestimated by up to 40–80% due to a malfunctioning BHFS. We discuss uncertainties associated with this estimate. While a 40–80% underestimation is important when characterizing individual source categories, the potential implications are attenuated when aggregating emissions across the five sources examined in the recent studies (&amp;lt;12–24%), across all sources in the natural gas production segment (&amp;lt;7–14%), or across the entire supply chain (&amp;lt;2–5%). Therefore, potential errors caused by BHFS malfunction in recent studies would not substantially alter estimates of methane emissions from the U.S. natural gas supply chain. The possible malfunction of such a widely-used instrument deserves further attention to ensure that its use in quantifying emissions from individual supply chain components is not compromised.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil seedbanks play a key role in the post-fire recruitment of many plant species. Seedbank diversity can be influenced by spatial variability (e.g. geographic location), environmental variability (e.g. soils) and temporal disturbance heterogeneity (e.g. time since fire, TSF) across the landscape. Unlike for aboveground vegetation, relationships between these factors and soil seedbank diversity remain largely unknown. Partitioning the influence of spatial and environmental variability from that of TSF, and explaining how these factors interact with seedbank diversity, will assist conservation managers in their application of prescribed burning. We germinated soil seedbank samples from sites ranging from 1 to 75 years since fire in a heathy-woodland ecosystem across the Otway Ranges in Victoria, Australia. We also measured spatial and environmental variability across sites to partition the influence of these variables and TSF on propagules available for recruitment. We found weak positive relationships between seedbank richness and TSF; however, these relationships varied across the landscape. We found composition did not change considerably over time, suggesting, in this ecosystem, pre-fire age is not strongly influencing propagules available for recruitment post-fire. Our results suggest that spatial and environmental variability influence seedbank composition more than TSF.</jats:p>"

Users are divided into two categories in this paper: users with no optional service and users with optional services. We derive the equilibrium decisions between the manufacturer and the retailer under the following two cases: (i) the optional after-sales service level and the wholesale price determined by the manufacturer and the retail price determined by the retailer; (ii) the wholesale price determined by the manufacturer and the optional after-sales service level and the retail price determined by the retailer.</jats:p>"

The applications of these policies to determination of the direction, composition, and volume of exports and imports have affected on the price and income elasticities of exported and imported goods. Therefore, the export and the import policies must be analyzed with regards to the price and income elasticities. Considering the studies done so far, econometric analysis of supply and demand functions of export and import are generally seen analyzed based on a single equation model. Also simultaneous relationship between the supply and demand is mostly ignored. For this reason, the major aim of this study is to examine the simultaneous relationship between the supply and demand functions of export and import of manufacturing industry by using Two Stage Least Squares Method. According to results of estimation income and price elasticities for supply and demand of import are found compatible with the theory. Both in export and import demand equation of manufacturing, income and price elasticities are found positive and negative respectively. And also export and import supply elasticities for manufacturing are compatible with the theoretical expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Özet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ekonominin büyümesi ve yapısal değişiminde, dış ticaret politikalarının önemli bir yeri vardır. İhracat ve ithalatın yönü, hacmi ve kompozisyonunu belirlemek amacıyla alınan kararlar, malların fiyat ve gelir esnekliklerine etkide bulunmaktadır. Bu nedenle bir ülkenin ihracat ve ithalat rejimi incelenirken, fiyat ve gelir esneklikleri de dikkate alınmalıdır. Bugüne kadar yapılan çalışmalar gözden geçirildiğinde, genellikle ihracat ve ithalat arz ve talep fonksiyonlarının ekonometrik analizinin tek denklemli model temel alınarak incelendiği görülmektedir. İhracat arz ve talep fonksiyonları arasındaki eşanlı gelir ve fiyat ilişkisi çoğunlukla göz ardı edilmektedir. Bu nedenle bu çalışmanın temel amacı; ihracat arz ve ithalat talep fonksiyonları arasındaki eşanlılık ilişkisini imalat sanayi özelinde, eşanlı denklem sistemlerinden iki aşamalı en küçük kareler yöntemi kullanarak incelemektir. Tahmin sonuçlarına göre, imalat sanayi ithalat arz ve talebine ait gelir ve fiyat esneklikleri ile imalat sanayi ihracat talebine ait gelir ve fiyat esnekliği ve ihracat arz denklemine ait gelir ve fiyat esnekliklerinin işareti teoriyle uyumlu bulunmuştur. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The scientific and methodical base for its description and research offers to accept the fundamental principles of the theory of hydraulic circuits, bi-level programming, principles of economics in the energy sector. Distinctive feature of the developed mathematical model is that it, along with traditionally solved tasks within the bilateral relations heat sources – consumers of heat, considers a network component with physics and technology properties of a heat network inherent in it, and also the economic factors connected with costs of production and transport of heat energy. This approach gives the chance to define the optimum levels of load of heat sources, providing the set demand for heat energy from consumers taking into account receiving with heat sources of the greatest possible profit and performance thus of conditions of formation of the minimum costs in heat networks during the considered time period. Practical realization of the developed mathematical model is considered by the example of the heat supply system with two heat sources, working for single heat networks. With the help of the developed model are carried plotting optimal load heat sources during the year, as well as a nomogram for determining the average tariffs for heat energy heat sources. </jats:p>"

The data are obtained from relevant Sudanese ministries and directorates and Sudan Central Bank. “e!Sankey 4 pro” software is used to develop the Sankey diagram. The main primary types of energy in Sudan are oil, hydro, biomass, and renewable energy. Sudan has a surplus of gasoline, petroleum coke, and biomass and deficit in electric power, gasoil, jet oil, and LPG. The surplus of gasoline is exported; however, the petroleum coke is kept as reserve. The deficit is covered by import. The overall useful energy is 76% and the loss is 24%.

A broad range of biological and mineralogical mechanisms allow marine calcifiers to cope with ocean acidification, however these mechanisms are energetically demanding which affect other biological processes (trade-offs) with important implications for the resilience of the organisms against stressful conditions. Hence, food availability may play a critical role in determining the resistance of calcifiers to OA. Here we show, based on a meta-analysis of existing experimental results assessing the role of food supply in the response of organisms to OA, that food supply consistently confers calcifiers resistance to ocean acidification.</jats:p>"

The uncertainty in time, location, and severity of disaster during predisaster phase and poor conditions of available infrastructure during postdisaster phase make HSC operations difficult to handle. In order to overcome the difficulties during these phases, we need to assure that HSC operations are designed in an efficient manner to minimize human and economic losses. In the recent times, several mathematical optimization techniques and algorithms have been developed to increase the efficiency of HSC operations. These techniques and algorithms developed for the field of HSC motivate the need of a systematic literature review. Owing to the importance of mathematical modelling techniques, this paper presents the review of the mathematical contributions made in the last decade in the field of HSC. A systematic literature review methodology is used for this paper due to its transparent procedure. There are two objectives of this study: the first one is to conduct an up-to-date survey of mathematical models developed in HSC area and the second one is to highlight the potential research areas which require attention of the researchers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Capacity-building plans for transportation systems must be resilient to disruptions and erroneous assumptions to protect performance outcomes as well as schedule and cost. An example is the future supply chain of aviation biofuels for industry, government, and military applications. The challenges include balancing the aims and assumptions of diverse stakeholders, including regulators, agencies, manufacturers, airlines, fuel companies, and agricultural and husbandry producers. Resilience analytics of the strategic plans should characterize both the influential trends and stressors and the robust initiatives. This paper demonstrates resilience analytics to address varied, evolving, and potentially conflicting stakeholder preferences in the life cycle of supply chains for aviation biofuels. Heterogeneous feedstocks can be converted to aviation biofuel, although several are more attractive across technological, environmental, and economic criteria. The choice of feedstocks for conversion to biofuel depends on balancing desired outcomes, including life-cycle costs, availabilities, proximities, environmental impacts, and the like. Resilience analytics enables prioritization of feedstocks and other supply chain initiatives, with prioritization that varies by scenario. A technology road map for near- and midterm investment horizons to establish aviation biofuels is described. Poultry waste products are explored by using the above methods for a particular region in the mid-Atlantic area of the United States. </jats:p>",

Source water total organic carbon (TOC) is especially important due to the potential for production of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) reservoir model is used to evaluate the difference between daily pre- and post- urbanization nutrients and TOC concentration. Post-disturbance (future) reservoir total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), TOC and chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to be higher than pre-urbanization (base) concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). Predicted future median TOC concentration was 1.1 mg·L−1 (41% higher than base TOC concentration) at the source water intake. Simulations show that prior to urbanization, additional water treatment was necessary on 47% of the days between May and October. However, following simulated urbanization, additional drinking water treatment might be continuously necessary between May and October. One of six ENSO indices is weakly negatively correlated with the measured reservoir TOC indicating there may be higher TOC concentrations in times of lower streamflow (La Niña). There is a positive significant correlation between simulated TN and TP concentrations with ENSO suggesting higher concentrations during El Niño.</jats:p>"

The work will involve installation of a 139.45-mile-long, 60-inch-diameter water pipeline from northcentral San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, to Deanville, Burleson County, Texas. The report details the findings of investigations from June 2015 to December 2015, on the alignment dated December 8, 2015 (December 8th). The Vista Ridge Project is subject to review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 USC 306108) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800), in anticipation of a Nationwide Permit 12 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the work is subject to compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit Number 7295, as the Vista Ridge Project will be ultimately owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas.\n\nThe cultural resources investigations included a background review and intensive field survey. The background review identified previous investigations, recorded archaeological sites, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, cemeteries, standing structures, and other known cultural resources within a 0.50-mile radius of the project area. The field investigations conducted from June 2015 through December 2015 assessed all accessible portions of the proposed December 8th alignment as of December 25, 2015. Approximately 101.8 miles of the 139.45-mile alignment has been surveyed. Approximately 24.42 miles were not surveyed based on the results of the background review and extensive disturbances as confirmed by vehicular survey. The remaining 13.23 miles that require survey were either unavailable due to landowner restrictions or part of a newly adopted reroute. SWCA also surveyed additional mileage, which includes rerouted areas that are no longer part of the December 8th alignment.\n\nThe inventory identified 59 cultural resources, including 52 archaeological sites and seven isolated finds. In addition to newly recorded resources, two previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited, and two cemeteries were documented. Of the 52 newly recorded archaeological sites, seven are recommended for further work or avoidance. Of the two revisited archeological sites, one is recommended for further work or avoidance within the project area. Avoidance is recommended for both documented cemeteries. The resources with undetermined eligibility require additional testing or other avenues of research before SWCA can make a firm recommendation about their eligibility for nomination to the NRHP and designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). As part of a management strategy, the resources with undetermined eligibility may also be avoided by reroute or boring beneath. The remaining 45 cultural resources are recommended not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as SALs and no further cultural resources investigations or avoidance strategies are recommended.</jats:p>"

In spite of that, high penetration of PV systems into the power grid can cause grid voltage and frequency stability problems. Also, the growth of the EV market will create an extra electricity load (for charging the EV fleet), leading to an increase in power utility fuel costs. In this research, we proposed the usage of the PV‐EV system as a method of mitigating the impact the spread of residential PV systems and EV on the power grid. We built an PV‐EV system simulation model and investigated the PV‐EV system contribution to the balance of power supply and demand and to reducing the total cost of the household under different electricity pricing scenarios. We also evaluated the effect of uncertainty in the forecasting of load and PV output on the performance of the PV‐EV system.</jats:p>",

This paper concludes that at least there are 8 methods that are most used to optimize operations and in this study are shown which ones are used most frequently and which are used moderately and which never used by the respondents. And depending on the situations to optimize, you can identify and / or develop different algorithms for optimization of operations (in companies, manufacturing and supply chains).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bikesharing systems have been expanding rapidly. They are recognized as a strategic tool to integrate transit and to foster sustainable transportation in urban areas. A critical problem that arises in the planning and deployment of a bikesharing system lies in demand–supply imbalance as the result of the spatiotemporal dynamics of demand patterns. The problem manifests itself in situations in which no bikes are available to rent and no docks are available for bike return at certain popular stations. This study developed a framework for modeling user behavior in response to such situations. Particular emphasis was placed on user on-site choice behavior and the behavioral aspect related to wait time if a decision to wait for the next bike or dock was made. These behaviors were approached with the use of a discrete choice model and a duration model, respectively. Further, a discrete-continuous process was proposed to address the potential interrelation that existed between the choice to wait and the length of waiting time to be endured. Within the developed framework, the models were estimated on the basis of the data from a revealed preference–stated preference survey conducted on the YouBike system in Taipei, Taiwan. The estimation results provided insights into user familiarity and uncertainty toward the system, travel situation, or environment and the associated effects on user behavior of a bikesharing system under a demand–supply imbalance. </jats:p>",

First, the suggested operation rules consists of a two-point type time-varying hedging policy for a single reservoir and a simple proportional allocation policy of common water demand between two parallel reservoirs. Then, the NSGA-II is employed to derive enough noninferior operation rules (design alternatives) in terms of two conflicting objectives (1) minimizing the total deficit ratio (TDR) of all demands of the entire system in operation horizon, and (2) minimizing the maximum deficit ratio (MDR) of water supply in a single period. Next, the SEABODE, a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) procedure, is applied to further eliminate alternatives based on the concept of efficiency of order k with degree p. In SEABODE, the reservoir performance indices and water shortage indices are selected as evaluation criteria for preference ordering among the design alternatives obtained by NSGA-II. The proposed methodology was tested on a regional water supply system with three reservoirs located in the Jialing River, China, where the results demonstrate its applicability and merits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two financing modes can be considered for manufacturer’s production capital constrained: RPFM (retailer’s prepayment financing mode) and PCFM (procurement contract financing mode). Under the RPFM, the retailer places order in advance for a discount price and makes prepayment; manufacturer is able to finance from a bank as production quantity cannot satisfy the second-order quantity of retailer. By contrast, manufacturers make financing from commercial banks based on the procurement contract with upstream supplier under the PCFM. Taking into account the relation between production volumes with the manufacturer’s own capital and retailer’s order quantity, the optimal production and financing decision model for manufacturer under these two financing modes are built. Moreover, the profits of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the supply chain are compared and discussed. Results show that both of the two modes can create new value and profit for the supply chain with capital constraint and achieve optimal production under “newsvendor” mode; the supply chain has the better performance under the RPFM than that achieved under the PCFM. Also, under the RPFM, the manufacturer’s production and the profit of the whole supply chain would be increased when the manufacturer makes the second financing. Similar conclusion is reached under the PCFM. Finally, numerical study was given to demonstrate the conclusions.</jats:p>"

Water samples from drinking water and deep-drilled wells were also collected. These specimens were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the VP1/2A region of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) genome. The entire genome sequence of one of the fecal specimens was determined and phylogenetically analyzed with those of known HAV sequences. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results and Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Eleven of 24 fecal specimens collected from acute viral hepatitis patients were positive as determined by semi- nested reverse transcription PCR targeting the VP1/2A region of HAV. The nucleotide sequence of these samples had an identical genotype IB sequence, suggesting that the same causative agent was present. The complete nucleotide sequence derived from one of the samples indicated that the Thai genotype IB strain should be classified in a unique phylogenetic cluster. The analysis using an adjusted odds ratio showed that the consumption of groundwater was the most likely risk factor associated with the disease.</jats:p>"

In this study, we provide a framework to jointly optimize these three levers in a periodic review infinite horizon setting, and in particular we examine how one can reduce inventory and capacity investments through proper diversification strategies. Observing that a modified base‐stock inventory policy is optimal, we find that the capacity‐diversification problem is well behaved and characterize the optimal mix of safety stock, excess capacity and extra number of supply sources. We find that higher supply uncertainty results in higher safety stock, more excess capacity, and higher diversification. But safety stock and diversification are non‐monotonic in demand uncertainty. Our results can be extended to situations in which suppliers are heterogeneous, and can be used to develop effective heuristics. </jats:p>",

The picking system, typical workflows of manual picking procedures and theoretical considerations of optimal picking quality are given. Using a quality cost as well as a process cost analysis and a cause and effect analysis, the picking process is investigated in this scenario. It turns out that the optimal picking quality is surpassed in the case, which requires a systematic process re-design in order to cut costs.

Integrating total asset visibility (TAV) technology into the supply chain structure can provide excellent visibility of a product. This kind of visibility complemented with various packaging schemes can assist in accommodating optimization strategies for visualizing the movement of a product throughout the entire supply chain pipeline.

We derive the optimal investment and operating decisions. Both the centralized and decentralized supply chains are studied. We show that the optimal investment and operating decisions in the decentralized setting may deviate from that in the centralized setting. To avoid the profit loss caused by such a deviation, we develop a coordination mechanism by introducing a combined policy of revenue-sharing policy and investment cost-sharing policy.

Although, the soil and climatic conditions of  Bangladesh are favourable for potato cultivation, every year production is hampered due to use of low quality seeds. Seed potato industry is developing in Bangladesh. However, only 5-10% quality seeds are being produced and used by the potato farmers. Quality seeds alone can contribute to increased yield by 15-20%. Both public and private sectors together supply only 5% quality seed potato and the rest 95% is almost of low quality produced by the farmers themselves. In prioritizing different issues of agriculture, challenges of production and supply of quality seed to the farmers should be considered as a top priority issue. For increasing quality seeds, the whole seed system needs to be reviewed. The present work was an attempt to review the seed potato production systems, supply system  and also to identify the possible challenges and policy implications in regards of the problems on seed potato in Bangladesh.The Agriculturists 2015; 13(1) 173-188</jats:p>"

Based on the actual data, this paper constructs an international supply chain model using system dynamics method. And it simulates the reconstruction trend of the supply chain after 3D printing application. The conclusion shows that the universal application of 3D printing will lead to the worldwide transport volume shrinking dramatically. The manufacturing activities will gradually outflow to the countries which are closer to the final customers. The relevant countries should carry out feasible measures to face this opportunity and challenge. The measures include the reform of logistics facilities, the logistics cooperation with the origin of 3D printing materials, and the matched transportation of 3D printing materials and traditional processing ones.</jats:p>"

For a given option contract, in decentralized case, each risk-averse retailer decides the optimal order quantity and the promotion policy by maximizing the conditional value-at-risk of profit. Based on the retailers’ decision, the supplier derives the optimal production policy by maximizing expected profit. In centralized case, the optimal decision of the supply chain system is obtained. Based on the decentralized and centralized decision, we find the coordination conditions of the supply chain system, which can optimize the supply chain system profit and make the profits of the supply chain members achieve Pareto optimum. As for the subchain, we also find the coordination conditions, which generalize the results of the supply chain with one supplier and one retailer. Our analysis and numerical experiments show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium between two retailers, and the optimal order quantity of each retailer increases (decreases) with its own (competitor’s) promotion level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A systematic approach is presented for the assessment of (i) bacterial growth-controlling factors in drinking water and (ii) the impact of distribution conditions on the extent of bacterial growth in full-scale distribution systems. The approach combines (i) quantification of changes in autochthonous bacterial cell concentrations in full-scale distribution systems with (ii) laboratory-scale batch bacterial growth potential tests of drinking water samples under defined conditions. The growth potential tests were done by direct incubation of water samples, without modification of the original bacterial flora, and with flow cytometric quantification of bacterial growth. This method was shown to be reproducible (ca. 4% relative standard deviation) and sensitive (detection of bacterial growth down to 5 µg L−1 of added assimilable organic carbon). The principle of step-wise assessment of bacterial growth-controlling factors was demonstrated on bottled water, shown to be primarily carbon limited at 133 (±18) × 103 cells mL−1 and secondarily limited by inorganic nutrients at 5,500 (±1,700) × 103 cells mL−1. Analysis of the effluent of a Dutch full-scale drinking water treatment plant showed (1) bacterial growth inhibition as a result of end-point chlorination, (2) organic carbon limitation at 192 (±72) × 103 cells mL−1 and (3) inorganic nutrient limitation at 375 (±31) × 103 cells mL−1. Significantly lower net bacterial growth was measured in the corresponding full-scale distribution system (176 (±25) × 103 cells mL−1) than in the laboratory-scale growth potential test of the same water (294 (±35) × 103 cells mL−1), highlighting the influence of distribution on bacterial growth. The systematic approach described herein provides quantitative information on the effect of drinking water properties and distribution system conditions on biological stability, which can assist water utilities in decision-making on treatment or distribution system improvements to better control bacterial growth during water distribution.</jats:p>",

For different requirements, it guarantees the power capacity with several smaller high‐frequency transformers and a smaller filter by a PSMFB with proper design. With the control strategy of only one phase‐shifted controller, all the modules can fulfil the output change with the phase‐shifted angle. The effectiveness of the proposed converter was verified using simulation and experimental results of a 1 kW converter system.</jats:p>",

Some of these threats are terrorism, piracy and theft. Within the food industry, food terrorism has gained relevance due to the extreme consequences it may have on both public health and the market. Food terrorism refers to the intentional contamination of food in any link of the supply chain, which covers everything from production to consumption.

Centralized and decentralized supply chain coordination models are studied based on asymmetric information. Optimal strategy of supply chain in dealing with retail price perturbation is caused by emergency events. The research reveals robustness for optimal production planning, wholesale price for distributors, wholesale price for retailers, and retail price of three-level supply chain about fresh agricultural products. The above four factors can keep constant within a certain perturbation of expectation costs for retailers because of emergency events; the conclusions are verified by numerical simulation.

A community based cross-sectional study design method was employed in the study in 588 households of Wolaita Sodo town inhabitants. Face-to-face interview to household owners, in-depth interview to key informants, reviewing secondary data, and observational check lists were used to collect data. Districts were selected using simple random sampling techniques, while systematic random sampling technique was applied to select households. Data was analyzed using Epi Info version 3.5.4 and SPSS version 16 statistical software. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were carried out.<jats:italic> Results</jats:italic>. The community has access to improved water supply which was estimated to be 67.9%. The main water sources of the town were tap water within the yard, which was estimated to be 44.7%, and tap water in the community was 40.0% followed by private protected well which was 14.5%. Ninety-one percent of the households had at least one type of latrine in their homes. The most common type of latrine available to households was pit latrine with superstructure which was estimated to be 75.9% followed by a pit without superstructure, 21.3%, and more than half of the respondents had hand washing facilities in their compound. Occupational status, educational status, and training on water, sanitation, and hygiene related topics were significantly associated with use of improved water source, improved sanitation, and hygiene facilities.<jats:italic> Conclusion</jats:italic>. In order to address the demand of the town, additional water, sanitation, and hygiene programs are required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many industrial applications, tilting pad journal bearings (TPJBs) are increasingly used because they are very suitable both for high-speed and high external loads. Their study is fundamental in rotating machines and a compromise between accuracy and numerical efficiency is mandatory to achieve reliable results in a reasonable time. This paper mainly focuses on the development of efficient three-dimensional (3D) models of TPJBs, in order to contemporaneously describe both the rotor dynamics of the system and the lubricant supply plant in long simulations (from the initial transient phase to the steady-state condition). Usually, these two aspects are studied separately, but their interactions must be considered if an accurate description of the whole system is needed. The proposed model architecture considers all the six degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) between supporting structures and rotors and can be applied to different types of TJPB layout with different lubricant supply plants. In this research activity, the whole model has been developed and validated in collaboration with Nuovo Pignone General Electric S.p.a. which provided the required technical and experimental data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding different aspects of sustainability, supply chain management (SCM), and decision making policies and relating them to performance measurement have been increasingly investigated in the last decade. In contrast to traditional SCM, which typically focuses on economic and financial business performance, sustainable SCM (SSCM) is characterized by explicit integration of environmental or social objectives which extend the economic dimension. For evaluating the sustainability of SCM as well as its greenness, we have to consider many and different index and criteria. One of the best tools for assessing the SSCM and GSCM is multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. Many studies have been conducted in this area. Moreover, there are many uncertainty factors which may reduce the accuracy of MCDM result. Actually, Uncertainty is always a worsening factor in any decision support models, and dilutes the planned objectives of such models. For decreasing this uncertainty, fuzzy logic has been combined with MCDM approach. In fact, the main purpose of this chapter is considering the recent studies in area of SSCM and GSCM regarding to applications of fuzzy MCDM techniques. At the end of this chapter, based on out investigations in applications of fuzzy MCDM in SSCM and GSCM and regarding to research gaps, some suggestions for future studies have been proposed. </jats:p>"

By assuming that the retailer himself bears the effort cost, coordination is achieved by implementing revenue-sharing contract based on rebate and penalty policy in one transaction or two transactions of three-level supply chain, and the former is a special case of the latter. When the disruptions induce the changes of the market demand, the revenue-sharing contract could not coordinate the supply chain. To deal with the problem, this essay introduces two forms of improved revenue-sharing contracts which have antidisruption ability. The model of improved revenue-sharing contract is optimized when the market demand is in the additive form with effort dependent demand. Formulas are given to calculate the optimal contract parameters. Finally, this essay demonstrates the accuracy of the model of improved revenue-sharing contract with the help of numerical examples.</jats:p>"

We analyzed 10 years of fish diet data from Chesapeake Bay, USA, to (1) evaluate the effects of environmental variables on trophic interactions of 12 common predatory fishes, (2) infer dynamics of four key prey groups (mysids, bay anchovy, bivalves, and polychaetes), and (3) evaluate whether interannual dietary trends were coherent among predators and regulated by prey availability. Based on delta generalized additive mixed models (delta-GAMMs), predator length was the most important covariate in modeling prey consumption. When latitude, temperature, and depth effects were statistically significant, the effects of each variable were largely similar across predators for a given prey. Annual patterns of mysid and bivalve consumption each showed a single, dramatic peak shared by multiple predators with varied feeding preferences and distributional characteristics, but annual trends were not correlated with available survey-based measures of prey availability, likely due to methodological differences. Overall, the coherence in consumption patterns across predators was consistent with supply-driven dynamics controlled by regional and annual changes in prey availability. Also, the novel application of delta-GAMMs to fish diet data was useful in characterizing the dynamics of poorly sampled prey groups and the trophic interactions for ubiquitous species from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. </jats:p>",

Reaching these targets by 2020 will reduce the HIV epidemic to a low‐level endemic disease by 2030. However, moving the global response towards this universal test and treat model will pose huge challenges to public health systems in resource‐limited settings, including global and local supply chain systems.

For instance, ensuring that 90% of HIV‐infected persons know their status will require a large increase in access to HIV tests compared with what is currently available. To ensure that there are enough anti‐retrovirals available to treat the nearly 25 million people that will require them by 2020 represents a near doubling of the ARV supplied to treat the 13 million currently on treatment.

Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is innovatively introduced into the study on consumer electronics supply chains. A data-driven model is also established, the parameters of the method and kernel functions are optimized and selected, and an LS-SVM algorithm of consumer electronics supply chains is proposed to deal with the limited number of samples. Then, an empirical analysis of the top 10 smartphone supply chains in the Chinese market is conducted, and the LS-SVM model and other forecasting methods are compared. Results suggest that the LS-SVM model achieves a good predictive accuracy. This study also analyzes the value-adding structure of supply chains from the perspective of interaction and enriches the theory of value creation among supply chains. This study is conducive to helping consumer electronics enterprises to conduct market analyses and determine value growth points accurately.</jats:p>"

It is legally prohibited from practice because of earlier findings that it leads to predatory behavior by either eliminating competition or stealing market share. This study shows that a stochastic exchange rate can create incentives for a profit‐minded monopoly firm to set price below marginal cost. Our result departs from earlier findings because the optimal pricing decision is based on a rational behavior that does not exhibit any malicious intent against the competition to be considered as violating anti‐trust laws. The finding is a robust result, because our analysis demonstrates that this behavior occurs under various settings such as when the firm (i) is risk‐averse, (ii) can postpone prices until after exchange rates are realized, (iii) is capable of manufacturing in multiple countries, and (iv) operates under demand uncertainty in addition to the random exchange rate. </jats:p>",

Country‐level decision makers need to consider whether cost‐effectiveness analysis used to inform global guidelines are sufficient for their situation or whether to use models that adjust cost‐effectiveness results taking into account setting‐specific epidemiological and cost heterogeneity. However, demand and supply constraints will also impact cost‐effectiveness by influencing the standard of care and the use and implementation of any new technology. These constraints may also vary substantially by setting. We present two case studies of economic evaluations of the introduction of new diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis control. These case studies are used to analyse how the scope of economic evaluations of each technology expanded to account for and then address demand and supply constraints over time. We use these case studies to inform a conceptual framework that can be used to explore the characteristics of intervention complexity and the influence of demand and supply constraints. Finally, we describe a number of feasible steps that researchers who wish to apply our framework in cost‐effectiveness analyses.</jats:p>",

Achieving this goal is possible in management both the demand and supply side of electric power system. In this article, two methods of forecasting for electricity demand have been presented. Gray Model (GM) and trigonometric gray prediction approach. These two methods are used to forecast total electricity demand of Kerman province for a period of 2012–2031.then electric power supply system of Kerman province for base year 2012 has been modeled using LEAP software. Then the electric power supply system has been developed for the target year 2031 based on two different scenarios, namely, status quo scenario and cooling loads management scenario (CLM). These scenarios have been evaluated in three sections viz. power generation, cost analysis, and environmental emissions. results indicate that, assuming the implementation of CLM scenarios from 2020, capacity requirement of power plants will be reduced up to 1000 MW in comparison with status quo scenario by the year 2031 which results in a significant reduction in the capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel costs, electricity generation, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption in power plants, and peak load of the electric power system by the year 2031. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 1177–1189, 2016</jats:p>",

This paper studies 351 small and medium enterprises in the Antofagasta Region in Chile between 2007 and 2008, where multinational and public mining companies are the drivers of the local economy and the government is promoting the formation of a mining cluster. Structural equation model is used to show that first-tier small and medium enterprise mining suppliers, directly related to large corporations, follow business practices that promote international certification, quality control, and investment in innovation, while in contrast second-tier small and medium enterprises are more focused on avoiding insolvency and client orientation. These results cast doubt on the formation of a mining cluster in the region and suggest the need for differentiated policies in these two groups of small and medium enterprises, especially those related to knowledge transfer. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Niche ports typically are smaller marine ports that specialize in handling specific commodities and can be the interface between import and export of bulk commodities from landside facilities, such as oil refineries. Specialization can make port-dependent industries and their customers particularly vulnerable to disruptions of port operations because the specialized handling facilities may be unique to the port. Industries may not be able to shift their supply to other modes, such as rail. This paper outlines the use of automatic identification system transponder data from oceangoing vessels, in concert with open source data, to quantify first-order impacts of a supply chain disruption at a niche port. Results are presented from a study of a Canadian niche port where a worst-reasonable-case scenario of a 1-week disruption to oil imports and exports would delay delivery of an estimated 246 million L of fuel to New England for at least a week; Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine, would be most affected. The approach used in this study could be a valuable screening tool for public safety agencies wanting a better understanding of vulnerabilities and interdependencies at niche ports in situations in which detailed simulations and modeling are impractical. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Rio Grande in the Big Bend region of Texas, USA, and Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, undergoes rapid geomorphic changes as a result of its large sediment supply and variable hydrology; thus, it is a useful natural laboratory to investigate the relative importance of flow strength and sediment supply in controlling alluvial channel change. We analyzed a suite of sediment transport and geomorphic data to determine the cumulative influence of different flood types on changing channel form. In this study, physically based analyses suggest that channel change in the Rio Grande is controlled by both changes in flow strength and sediment supply over different spatial and temporal scales. Channel narrowing is primarily caused by substantial deposition of sediment supplied to the Rio Grande during tributary‐sourced flash floods. Tributary floods have large suspended‐sediment concentrations, occur for short durations, and attenuate rapidly downstream in the Rio Grande, depositing much of their sediment in downstream reaches. Long‐duration floods on the mainstem have the capacity to enlarge the Rio Grande, and these floods, released from upstream dams, can either erode or deposit sediment in the Rio Grande depending upon the antecedent in‐channel sediment supply and the magnitude and duration of the flood. Geomorphic and sediment transport analyses show that the locations and rates of sand erosion and deposition during long‐duration floods are most strongly controlled by spatial changes in flow strength, largely through changes in channel slope. However, spatial differences in the in‐channel sediment supply regulate sediment evacuation or accumulation over time in long reaches (greater than a kilometer).</jats:p>",

In order to reduce carbon emissions, cap and trade policy is implemented by governments in many countries, which has significant impacts on the decisions of companies at all levels of the low carbon supply chain. This paper investigates the decision-making and coordination of a low carbon supply chain consisting of a low carbon manufacturer who produces one product and is allowed to invest in green technology to reduce carbon emissions in production and a retailer who faces stochastic demands formed by homogeneous strategic customers. We investigate the optimal production, pricing, carbon trading, and green technology investment strategies of the low carbon supply chain in centralized (including Rational Expected Equilibrium scenario and quantity commitment scenario) and decentralized settings. It is demonstrated that quantity commitment strategy can improve the profit of the low carbon supply chain with strategic customer behavior. We also show that the performance of decentralized supply chain is lower than that of quantity commitment scenario. We prove that the low carbon supply chain cannot be coordinated by revenue sharing contract but by revenue sharing-cost sharing contract.</jats:p>"

Regularities of the natural organic matter content decrease in terms of water color and permanganate oxidizability within individual segments of the water supply system. The most intensive organic matter transformation within the system reservoirs occurs in the slow-flow Uchinsk reservoir where the color and permanganate oxidizability values maximum is observed during spring period. On the basis of the many-year observations results obtained in the water supply system water bodies a scheme of statistic forecasting of water color and oxidizability at water treatment facilities intake points with tree months lead time has been developed. The forecast is based on multiple linear regression equation linking the organic matter values in the Ivankovo reservoir tributaries and the same at the water treatment facilities at the closure link of the system (Uchinsk reservoir). The carried out comparison of the forecast results with the independent observation data shown a quite satisfactory agreement between the forecasted and observed organic matter values. A possibility to control the Volga River water color with low-color waters discharges from Vazuza reservoir was demonstrated with a simple balance model. As a result of the model calculations we obtained a nomogram enabling to compute the color decrease in a tribute to Ivankovo reservoir in dependence on the color difference between the Volga water and waters discharged from Vazuza reservoir provided we have pre-set proportion of water flow from these sources.</jats:p>"

Calculation of efficiency of Thr utilization was based on N-balance data and an exponential N-utilization model, and Thr dehydrogenase (TDG) activity was determined. According to the results, no significant effect on TDG activity was observed in the liver of chicks who received diets containing from 5.5 up to 16.5% CP. However, significantly elevated TDG activities were observed, despite limited supply of Thr in protein, with diets containing from 22.0 up to 33.0% CP. At the levels of CP content from 5.5 up to 27.5%, no significant change in efficiencies of Thr utilization was observed. However, a significant decrease in efficiency was observed with diets containing from 27.5 to 33.0% CP. In chicks, the relationship between oxidation of Thr and Thr efficiency was observed with graded CP levels. In addition, elevated TDG activities in rat liver were observed with diets containing from 6.0 to 12.0% CP. At the levels of CP content from 6.0 up to 24.0%, no significant effect on efficiency of Thr utilization was observed in rats. In addition, no relationship was observed between Thr oxidation and efficiency of Thr utilization with graded CP levels in rats. Taken together, reactions for TDG appear to be animal species-dependent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the effect of item-level RFID on inventory shrinkage in the retail supply chain, which consists of a risk-neutral manufacturer and a risk-averse retailer. Under conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion, two different supply chain settings are discussed as follows. In the centralized setting, we develop the models in both RFID case and no RFID case, respectively. Comparisons between the two cases are made. In particular, a sufficient condition is given to judge whether to adopt item-level RFID. In the decentralized setting, we focus on discussing two different contract types including wholesale price contact and revenue sharing contract. Finally, number examples and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed models. The results show that, for the centralized system, the sales-available rate, the recovery rate, and the tag cost are mainly the driving factors in evaluating the benefit of an item-level RFID. In particular, when the sales-available rate and the tag cost are quite small and the recovery rate is higher, the supply chain partners’ profits obtained by investment for RFID are improved significantly. For the decentralized system, under revenue sharing contract, Pareto improving outcome and coaffording risk can be achieved if the retailer sets an appropriate parameter for the manufacturer.</jats:p>"

In\n   particular, a significant portion of the analysis is devoted to the\n   constraints that can be induced by inadequate drinking water supply and its\n   quality in households.

The empirical\n   analysis is based on survey data that describe conditions in the households,\n   whereas the econometric framework is employed in order to determine\n   structural relationships. The null hypothesis that drinking water supply and\n   quality do not affect the likelihood of the household participating in the\n   tourism industry is tested and accepted based on the probit model estimates.\n   The difference between the public urban and local water supply systems that\n   provide drinking water to the households is statistically confirmed, but it\n   does not affect the likelihood of the household participating in the tourism\n   industry.</jats:p>"

For comparison, a chain with a risk-neutral retailer is also analyzed.

In the simulation study, we investigate the significance of various factors including the old-for-new policy, collection and remanufacturing, their interactions and the type of their impact on bullwhip, and profitability through sensitivity analysis. Our results instruct that the old-for-new policy and three electronic products recovery ways can reduce the bullwhip effect in the retailers and the distributors and increases the profitability in the closed-loop supply chain distribution network.</jats:p>"

Here we present time series of neodymium (Nd) isotope signatures of the detrital sediment fraction during the past ∼45,000 years, to reconstruct climate‐driven changes in the provenance of clays deposited along the Mozambique Margin. Coherent with the surface current regime, the Nd isotope distribution in surface sediments reveals mixing of the alongshore flowing Zambezi suspension load with sediments supplied by smaller rivers located further north. To reconstruct past changes in sediment provenances, Nd isotope signatures of clays that are not significantly fractionated during weathering processes have been obtained from core 64PE304‐80, which was recovered just north of the Zambezi mouth at 1329 m water depth. Distinctly unradiogenic clay signatures (ɛ<jats:sub>Nd</jats:sub> values &lt;−14.2) are found during the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich Stadial 1, and Younger Dryas. In contrast, the Nd isotope record shows higher, more radiogenic isotope signatures during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and between ∼15 and ∼5 ka BP, the latter coinciding with the timing of the northern hemisphere African Humid Period. The clay‐sized sediment fraction with the least radiogenic Nd isotope signatures was deposited during the Holocene, when the adjacent Mozambique Shelf became completely flooded. In general, the contribution of the distinctly unradiogenic Zambezi suspension load has followed the intensity of precession‐forced monsoonal precipitation and enhanced during periods of increased southern hemisphere insolation and high‐latitude northern hemispheric climate variability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the byproducts generated in the cane sugar production is molasses, which is used for ethanol distillation. However, one of the problems of distilleries is vinasse. Vinasse is highly water pollutant and is dumped untreated in lakes or rivers and damages the environment. The company FALA developed a pilot plant that uses vinasse to produce a type of livestock feed called MD60. In this paper, the impact of the pilot plant’s scale-up in the key processes of the company’s supply chain is analyzed. With the help of a sensitivity analysis, this study finds the values that would allow the company to improve its order fulfillment indicator and to increase profits, assuming an expected demand by the introduction of this new product into the market. The results show that (1) the pilot plant fulfills 32% of the orders, (2) according to the current vinasse storage capacity, it is possible to fulfill up to 77% of the orders by scaling up the pilot plant, (3) to satisfy 100% of the orders, it is necessary to use all the vinasse generated, and (4) the highest profit is reached by processing all the vinasse and by considering the upper sale price.</jats:p>"

We assume that the first-stage inspection of the manufacturer is not perfect and makes inspection errors of Type 1 and Type 2. The second-stage inspection of the manufacturer is at the end of production period without inspection errors. Also, the demand is linear function of time. Once the retailer receives the lot, a 100% screening process of the lot is conducted without inspection errors, and the screening process and demand proceed simultaneously. The main objective is to determine the optimal inspection time and the optimal number of cycle such that the present value of the total cost is minimized. Finally, a numerical example and sensitivity analyses are provided to illustrate the proposed model using a proper algorithm. </jats:p>",

In a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer, the demand of the retailer is uncertain and meanwhile may suffer disruption with a probability. Taking the demand disruption probability as the retailer’s asymmetric information, an informed principal model with the retailer as the principal is explored to make the contract. The retailer can show its information to the manufacturer through the contract. It is found out that the high-risk retailer intends to pretend to be the low-risk one. So the separating contract is given through the low-information-intensity allocation, in which the order quantity and the transferring payment for the low-risk retailer distort upwards, but those of high-risk retailer do not distort. In order to reduce the signaling cost which the low-risk retailer pays, the interim efficient model is introduced, which ends up with the order quantity and transferring payment distorting upwards again but less than before. In the numerical examples, with two different mutation probabilities, the informed principal contracts show the application of the informed principal model in the supply chain with demand disruption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) are increasingly becoming popular for discrete photon counting applications due to the wealth of advantages they offer over conventional photo-detectors such as photo-multiplier tubes and hybrid photo-diodes. SiPMs are used in variety of applications ranging from high energy physics and nuclear physics experiments to medical diagnostics. The gain of a SiPM is directly proportional to the difference between applied and breakdown voltage of the device. However, the breakdown voltage depends critically on the ambient temperature and has a large temperature co-efficient in the range of 40-60 mV/°C resulting in a typical gain variation of 3%-5%/°C [Dinu et al., in IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and 17th Room Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (IEEE, 2010), p. 215]. We plan to use the SiPM as a replacement for PMT in the cosmic ray experiment (GRAPES-3) at Ooty [Gupta et al., Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. A 540, 311 (2005)]. There the SiPMs will be operated in an outdoor environment subjected to temperature variation of about 15 °C over a day. A gain variation of more than 50% was observed for such large variations in the temperature. To stabilize the gain of the SiPM under such operating conditions, a low-cost, multi-channel programmable power supply (0-90 V) was designed that simultaneously provides the bias voltage to 16 SiPMs. The programmable power supply (PPS) was designed to automatically adjust the operating voltage for each channel with a built-in closed loop temperature feedback mechanism. The PPS provides bias voltage with a precision of 6 mV and measures the load current with a precision of 1 nA. Using this PPS, a gain stability of 0.5% for SiPM (Hamamatsu, S10931-050P) has been demonstrated over a wide temperature range of 15 °C. The design methodology of the PPS system, its validation, and the results of the tests carried out on the SiPM is presented in this article. The proposed design also has the capability of gain stabilization of devices with non-linear thermal response.</jats:p>",

The model is aimed to minimize two objectives, the total supply chain cost and the greenhouse gas emissions generated mainly by transportation and warehousing operations. The demand forecast is known for the planning horizon and shortage of demand is allowed at a penalty cost. This scenario must satisfy a minimum service level. Two carbon emission regulatory policies are investigated, the tax or carbon credit and the carbon emission cap. Computational experiments are performed to analyze the trade-offs between the total cost of the supply chain, the carbon emission quantity, and both carbon emission regulatory policies. Results demonstrate that for a certain range the carbon credit price incentivizes the reduction of carbon emissions to the environment. On the other hand, modifying the carbon emission cap inside a certain range could lead to significant reductions of carbon emission while not significantly compromising the total cost of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Results suggest that, over <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 5 Myr, stratal geometry and facies were dynamically linked to tectonic activity in the adjacent Cordillera. Higher frequency modulation of accommodation is most reasonably ascribed to eustasy. The Harmon and Cadotte alloformations were deposited at the southern end of an embayment of the Arctic Ocean. The Harmon alloformation, forming the lower part of the succession, constitutes a wedge of marine mudstone that thickens westward over 400 km from &lt;5 m near the forebulge to &gt;150 m in the foredeep. Constituent allomembers are also wedge‐shaped but lack distinct clinothems, a rollover point or downlapping geometry. Ubiquitous wave ripples indicate that the sea floor lay above storm wave base. Deposition took place on an extremely low‐gradient ramp, where accommodation was limited by effective wave base. Lobate, river‐dominated deltas fringed the southern margin of the basin. The largest deltas are stacked in the same area, suggesting protracted stability of the feeder river. A buried palaeo‐valley on the underlying sub‐Cretaceous unconformity may have influenced compaction and controlled river location for <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 3 Myr. Adjacent to the western Cordillera, a predominantly mudstone succession is interbedded with abundant storm beds of very fine‐grained sandstone and siltstone that reflect supply from the adjacent orogen. Bioturbation indices in the Harmon alloformation range from zero to six which reflects the influence of stressors related to river‐mouth proximity. Harmon alloformation mudstone grades abruptly upward into marine sandstone and conglomerate of the overlying Cadotte alloformation. The Cadotte is composed of three allomembers ‘<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CA</jats:styled-content>’ to ‘<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CC</jats:styled-content>’, that represent the deposits of prograding strandplains 200 × 300 km in extent. Allomembers ‘CA’ and ‘CB’ are strongly sandstone‐dominated, whereas allomember ‘<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CC</jats:styled-content>’ contains abundant conglomerate in the west. The dominantly aggradational wedge of Harmon alloformation mudstone records flexural subsidence driven by active thickening in the adjacent orogen: the high accommodation rate trapped coarser clastic detritus close to the basin margin. In contrast, the tabular, highly progradational sandstone and conglomerate bodies of the Cadotte alloformation record a low subsidence rate, implying tectonic quiescence in the adjacent orogen. Erosional unloading of the orogen through Cadotte time steepened rivers to the extent that they delivered gravel to the shore. These observations support an ‘anti‐tectonic’ model of gravel supply proposed previously for the United States portion of the Cretaceous foreland basin. Because Cadotte allomembers do not thicken appreciably into the foredeep, accommodation changes that controlled these transgressive–regressive successions were probably of eustatic origin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agent-based models have gained wide acceptance in transportation planning because with increasing computational power, large-scale people-centric mobility simulations are possible. Several modeling efforts have been reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual’s day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model—SimMobility—for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. SimMobility integrates various mobility-sensitive behavioral models in a multiple time-scale structure comprising three simulation levels: ( a) a long-term level that captures land use and economic activity, with special emphasis on accessibility; ( b) a midterm level that handles agents’ activities and travel patterns; and ( c) a short-term level that simulates movement of agents, operational systems, and decisions at a microscopic granularity. In that context, this paper proposes several extensions at the short-term and midterm levels to model and simulate autonomous vehicle systems and their effects on travel behavior. To showcase these features, the first-cut results of a hypothetical on-demand service with autonomous vehicles in a car-restricted zone of Singapore are presented. SimMobility was successfully used in an integrated manner to test and assess the performance of different autonomous vehicle fleet sizes and parking station configurations and to uncover changes in individual mobility patterns, specifically in regard to modal shares, routes, and destinations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">With the rapid increase of the capacity of optical fiber transmission system, the mode division multiplexing (MDM) transmission system using few-mode fibers (FMFs) (which provides the multi-channel multiplexing, high efficiency of frequency spectrum, and low nonlinear effects) becomes a research focus to upgrade the capacity of the optical communication. In this paper, an analytical expression of bending loss for each high-order mode of parabolic-index FMFs is deduced based on the perturbation theory and verified by finite element method. Based on this expression, the influence of four key structure parameters of trench-assisted parabolic-index FMFs: i.e. the radius of fiber core, the distance between core and trench, the width of trench, and the refractive index difference of trench, on the bending loss performance are discussed in detail. It is found that, firstly, the sensitivity of the bending loss increases with the increase of mode order of FMFs. Secondly, the smaller the core radius, the smaller the bending loss of each mode-order is, since small core radius leads to a smaller effective mode area, which is beneficial for saving power leakage. Additionally, the effective mode area of LP02 mode is lower than that of LP21 mode, while the bending loss of LP02 mode is higher than that of LP21 mode, this observation is different from other mode-orders. Thirdly, an optimized distance between trench and core for each high-order mode is also investigated for obtaining minimum bending loss, which plays an important role in controlling the bending performance of FMFs. So the higher the mode-order, the smaller the optimized distance between core and trench is, and this observation could be used to optimize the bending loss of the fiber. With the increase of the distance between the core and trench, the effective mode area of high-order mode increases quickly at first, then it is approximately unaltered. The distance between the core and trench is a key factor that influences both the bending loss and the effective mode area of each mode. Finally, the bending loss of each mode decreases with the increase of the width of trench around the fiber core or the refractive index difference of trench. These results are helpful for understanding the mechanism of bending loss for FMFs and are of significance for designing and manufacturing of few-mode bend-insensitive fibers, especially for the optimization of the bending loss of specific high-order mode.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many studies examine information sharing in an uncertain demand environment in a supply chain. However there is little literature on cost information sharing in a dual-channel structure consisting of a retail channel and a direct sales channel. Assuming that the retail sale cost and direct sale cost are random variables with a general distribution, the paper investigates the retailer’s choice on cost information sharing in a Bertrand competition model. Based on the equilibrium outcome of information sharing, the manufacturer’s channel choice is discussed in detail. Our paper provides several interesting conclusions. In both single- and dual-channel structures, the retailer has little motivation to share its private cost information which is verified to be valuable for the manufacturer. When the cost correlation between the two channels increases, our analyses show that the manufacturer’s profit improves. However, when channel choice is involved, the value of information could play a different role. The paper finds that a dual-channel structure can benefit the manufacturer only when the cost correlation is sufficiently low. In addition, if the cost correlation is weak, the cost fluctuation will bring out the advantage of a dual-channel structure and adding a new direct channel will help in risk pooling.</jats:p>"

The performance-based contracting framework evaluates payments and profits for the support service by a game-theoretical approach with principal-agent model. We prove that the proposed framework is an effective tool in acquiring the balance between maximum profit and minimum payment for both parties in the coordinating problem without moral hazard issue. A numerical study consolidates the formulated schemes as contracting preference for both parties’ decision with a higher profit margin at a lower customer’s payment.</jats:p>"

Based on “Benchmarking” allocation mechanism, three policies are considered: carbon emission trading, carbon tax, and a new policy which combined carbon quota and carbon tax mechanism. The results show that, in the three models, the leader in the supply chain, even if he has advantages of carbon information, will not lie about his information. That is because the manufacturer’s misreporting behavior has no effect on supply chain members’ performance. But the retailer will lie about the information when he has carbon information advantage. The high-carbon-emission retailers under the carbon trading policy, all the retailers under the carbon tax policy, and the high-carbon-emission retailers under combined quotas and tax policy would like to understate their carbon emissions. Coordination of revenue sharing contract is studied in supply chain to induce the retailer to declare his real carbon information. Optimal contractual parameters are deduced in the three models, under which the profit of the supply chain can be maximized.</jats:p>"

It also has a great effect on the environment and resources protection. In the management of the closed-loop supply chain, the recycling of waste products and decision-making on pricing often directly affect the supply and demand of products and the operation efficiency of supply chain. Therefore, first we take waste glass bottles as an example and establish a mathematical model to solve the profit of manufacturers and retailers solely. Then, we analyzed whole supply chain profit under a dual-channel recycling condition which is directly recycled by consumers or by retailers. Finally, we concluded that no matter what product’s price, quality, profit, or operational efficiency of supply chain is, the overall recycling is better than the single node recycling model. Based on the analysis, we developed a new model to coordinate the profit of manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain with revenue-sharing contract. A numerical study shows that this approach is applicable and effective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies a buyer’s inventory control problem under a long-term horizon. The buyer has one major supplier that is prone to disruption risks and one backup supplier with higher wholesale price. Two kinds of sourcing methods are available for the buyer: single sourcing with/without contingent supply and dual sourcing. In contingent sourcing, the backup supplier is capacitated and/or has yield uncertainty, whereas in dual sourcing the backup supplier has an incentive to offer output flexibility during disrupted periods. The buyer’s expected cost functions and the optimal base-stock levels using each sourcing method under long-term horizon are obtained, respectively. The effects of three risk parameters, disruption probability, contingent capacity or uncertainty, and backup flexibility, are examined using comparative studies and numerical computations. Four sourcing methods, namely, single sourcing with contingent supply, dual sourcing, and single sourcing from either of the two suppliers, are also compared. These findings can be used as a valuable guideline for companies to select an appropriate sourcing strategy under supply disruption risks.</jats:p>"

We consider a model of one B2C e-commerce platform and two supply chains each consisting of a supplier and an online retailer. The problem is studied using a multistage game. Firstly, the e-commerce platform carries out the cooperative promotion and sets the magnitude of markdown (the value of e-coupon). Secondly, each retailer and his supplier determine the fraction of promotional cost sharing when they have different bargaining power. Lastly, the retailers decide whether to participate in the cooperative promotion campaign. We show that the retailers are likely to participate in the promotion if consumers become more price-sensitive. However, it does not imply that the retailers can benefit from the price promotion; the promotion decision game resembles the classical prisoner’s dilemma game. The retailers and suppliers can benefit from the cooperative promotion by designing an appropriate cost sharing contract. For a supply chain, the bargaining power between supplier and retailer, consumer price sensitivity, and competition intensity affect the fraction of the promotional cost sharing. We also find that equilibrium value of e-coupon set by the e-commerce platform is not optimal for all the parties.</jats:p>"

At low-<jats:italic>z</jats:italic>, we find that the specific SFR in BCGs is declining more slowly with time than for field or cluster galaxies, which is most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling ICM in relaxed, cool core clusters. At <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> ≳ 0.6, the correlation between the cluster central entropy and BCG star formation—which is well established at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> ∼ 0—is not present. Instead, we find that the most star-forming BCGs at high-<jats:italic>z</jats:italic> are found in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. We use data from the <jats:italic>Hubble Space Telescope</jats:italic> to investigate the rest-frame near-UV morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming BCGs, and find complex, highly asymmetric UV morphologies on scales as large as ∼50–60 kpc. The high fraction of star-forming BCGs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early times suggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in BCGs may have recently transitioned from galaxy–galaxy interactions to ICM cooling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the dynamic performance and optimization of a typical discrete production control system under supply disruption and demand uncertainty. Two different types of uncertain demands, disrupted demand with a step change in demand and random demand, are considered. We find that, under demand disruption, the system’s dynamic performance indicators (the peak values of the order rate, production completion rate, and inventory) increase with the duration of supply disruption; however, they increase and decrease sequentially with the supply disruption start time. This change tendency differs from the finding that each kind of peak is independent of the supply disruption start time under no demand disruption. We also find that, under random demand, the dynamic performance indicators (Bullwhip and variance amplification of inventory relative to demand) increase with the disruption duration, but they have a decreasing tendency as demand variance increases. In order to design an adaptive system, we propose a genetic algorithm that minimizes the respective objective function on the system’s dynamic performance indicators via choosing appropriate system parameters. It is shown that the optimal parameter choices relate closely to the supply disruption start time and duration under disrupted demand and to the supply disruption duration under random demand.</jats:p>"

The upside hotel rooms can be sold through the downside hotel alliance and online travel agency. The hotel alliance, selling rooms at a lower price, is a direct sale platform with a negligible entry fee. Notwithstanding, the online travel agency sells the room at a higher price with related personalized service. Customers will be refunded partially in case of their cancellation or no-show. An integrated model and two decentralized models based on Bertrand and Stackelberg games are developed, respectively. The results show that when the wholesale price is lower than a certain value, both the hotel and the online travel agency can gain more profit from the Stackelberg game than that from the Bertrand game. In the case that the hotel allows overbooking, the optimal overbooking quantity is obtained. If the overbooking proportion is too high, overbooking is profitable for the hotel only when the overbooking cost is lower than a certain value. At the end of the study, some experiments are conducted to analyze the sensitivity of the optimal prices and profits in the light of certain parameters.</jats:p>"

This paper studies different coordination performances of two types of contracts, two-part tariff (TTC) and reverse revenue sharing contract (RRSC), in a closed-loop system. Through mathematical analysis based on Stackelberg Game Theory, we find that it is easy for manufacturer to improve more profits and retailer’s collection effects by adjusting the ratio of transfer collection price through RRSC, and we also give the function to calculate the best ratio of transfer collection price, which may be a valuable reference for the decision maker in practice. Besides, our results also suggest that although the profits of the coordinated CLSC system are always higher than the contradictory scenario, the RRSC is more favorable to the manufacturer than to the retailer, as results show that the manufacturer will share more profits from the system through RRSC. Therefore, RRSC has attracted the manufacturers more to closing the supply chain for economic consideration.</jats:p>"
