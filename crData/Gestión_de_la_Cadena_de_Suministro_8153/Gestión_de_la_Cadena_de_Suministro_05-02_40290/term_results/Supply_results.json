This research explores a methodology to provide managerial insight into the general business cycle by tracking and forecasting cycle turns in the PMI. A regression model is developed based on inherent cycles in the PMI between 12 and 65 months to forecast turning points for the index and anticipate changes in the business cycle, which is superior to the more commonly used Box‐Jenkins forecasting technique. Strategic planning using this knowledge allows management to optimally adjust long‐term levels of production, inventory, employment and orders as necessary.</jats:p>",

This article, through literature review and case studies within the healthcare industry supply chain, explores the barriers to implementation of SCM practices. These barriers include: lack of executive support; misaligned or conflicting incentives; need for data collection and performance measurement; limited education on supply chain; and inconsistent relationships with group purchasing organizations and other supply chain partners. Practical recommendations are made for hospitals and supply chain partners struggling to implement workable SCM solutions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The East Asian economic turmoil of 1997 and its lingering effects belie the decade of unprecedented economic growth in the Southeast Asian region. This economic boom saw a significant increase in the per capita income of the population of the respective countries and a corresponding rise in the standards of living. The decade also saw increased government spending on infrastructural development of basic amenities, including irrigation extension and rural water supply. The demand for and consumption of water increased significantly in both cities and the rural areas. In contrast to the escalating demand for water by the economies of the Southeast Asian countries, available resources remain limited despite the fact that the region generally receives more rainfall than it loses through evaporation annually. Annual, seasonal, and spatial variations in the rainfall within and between countries on the one hand, and accelerated demands for water from the various sectors of the economy on the other, put a severe strain on the available water resource base. In addition, natural resources in the form of rivers, groundwater storage, and lakes are rapidly diminishing in quality as a result of domestic, agricultural, and industrial waste discharges. In the coastal plains, excessive groundwater abstraction resulting in salt-water intrusion has affected groundwater resources. Inland, and in the watershed areas, rapid and extensive development has been at the expense of forested land, which has given way to new urban centres and residential and industrial complexes, while uncontrolled logging and shifting agriculture have caused the deterioration of the remaining forested ecosystem and natural watersheds. Given these factors, the future water resources scenario of the region seems bleak unless urgent steps are taken to manage seriously the resources in a judicious and sustainable way. Water will certainly feature as an important issue of development in the region in the decades ahead, given that large population concentrations and economic development are located in the lower parts of river basins. This chapter describes the hydrological conditions of the Southeast Asian region and examines the nature and extent of water resources that have been put to use for rural and agricultural development.</p>",

Since the publication of the Gardiner and Blackstone research, spreadsheets with in‐built Linear Programming (LP) based optimizers allow for quick “what‐if” analyses that encourage efforts toward optimal solutions for complicated problems. This article is a review and update of the Gardiner and Blackstone methodology based on spreadsheet LP that provides enhanced solutions in complex environments with multiple products and bottleneck situations.

The model considers the filling/emptying dynamics of the manifolds (which represent the volumes between compressor, fuel cell stack, and valve), the dynamics of the compressor/E‐motor unit, and the inertial effects in the inlet manifold. Validation of the model is performed with measurements obtained from a 6 kW<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> 100‐cell stack test bench, which was designed and constructed with the objective of reproducing typical operating conditions for automotive applications. On the basis of this model, a model‐based controller can be designed to reduce the system response time to load changes.

In this paper we propose a model of vertical relationships between producers and retailers in order to analyze the consequences of such strategies. In particular, we analyze the interest of producers to commit to these new private labels, their effects on spot market prices, and the resulting market segmentation between the spot market and supply contracts.</jats:p>"

However, the risk of bacterial contamination remains and a variety of other agents including emerging viruses, protozoa and tick‐borne agents threaten blood supplies and undermine public confidence in blood safety. Traditional methods of donor screening and testing have limited ability to further reduce disease transmission and cannot prevent an emerging infectious agent from entering the blood supply. Pathogen inactivation technologies have all but eliminated the infectious risks of plasma‐derived protein fractions, but as yet no technique has proved sufficiently safe and effective for traditional blood components. Half‐way technologies can reduce the risk of pathogen transmission from fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. Traditional methods of mechanical removal such as washing and filtration have limited success in reducing the risk of cell‐associated agents, but methods aimed at sterilizing blood have either proved toxic to the cells or to the recipients of blood components. Several promising methods that target pathogen nucleic acid have recently entered clinical testing.</jats:p>",

The frequency (or risk) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infectious donations entering the UK blood supply during 1996-2003 has been estimated. These years span the introduction of nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HCV, HIV combination antigen and antibody test and NAT for HIV. \nThe frequency of an infectious donation entering the blood supply due to i) the window period, ii) assay failures and iii) human and technical errors in testing and processing, was estimated. The window period risk was estimated using the incidence of infection in donors and the length of the window period for tests in use, with an adjustment for atypical inter-donation intervals in seroconverting donors. \nThe estimated frequency of infectious donations entering the blood supply during 1996-2003 was 1.66, 0.80 and 0.14 per million for HBV, HCV and HIV respectively. HCV NAT resulted in an over 95% fall in the risk of HCV. Current usage of HIV combined antibody-antigen tests and of HIV NAT reduced the estimated risk of HIV by 10%.\nSince 1996, the risk of transfusion-transmitted HBV, HCV and HIV infection in the UK has been lowered by several improvements to donation testing, although the absolute reduction in risk has been small. Vigilance for errors and the affects of donor selection may be as or more important than further reductions to window periods of tests for improving blood safety with respect to HBV, HCV and HIV.</jats:p>",

Rework is an area that has received limited attention, yet it is a major contributor to time and cost overruns in projects. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Design/methodology/approach</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The research uses an interpretative case study approach to gain an understanding about how and why rework occurred. To determine the causal variables of rework the traditional scientific concept of causality founded on the <jats:italic>mono‐causal model</jats:italic> in the physical and biological sciences was subject to subtle changes, and adapted to a social context as construction projects are essentially complex social systems. In this instance causality was not considered to be linear, proportional or incremental, but multi‐dimensional whereby each factor is interrelated and multi‐causal in nature. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The findings reveal that the cause of rework in this case was poor information flow and the absence of a quality focus. This was exacerbated by the sequential procurement process and fixed power structure of the contract, and as a consequence poor decision‐making, communication, integration and co‐ordination were experienced. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Practical implications</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The research has highlighted the need to re‐design the structure of supply chains in construction projects, especially if information and communication technologies are to be effectively used. A conceptual model was developed from the case study findings to illustrate the interconnectedness of factors affecting rework. This model can be used by organisations for reducing the incidence of rework. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Originality/value</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The research has identified key variables that can contribute to the incidence of rework in projects. A pragmatic model for reducing the incidence of rework is proposed. The model that is propagated will be of use to practitioners and researchers working within project environments.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We examined whether hares change their foraging movements and browse site selection in response to manipulations of food addition and predator reduction during a cyclic low phase. Snowshoe hares on sites with supplemental rabbit chow ate fewer species per site and preferred to browse in slightly denser cover than unfed hares. Differences in foraging behaviour were linked to season and site characteristics. Snowshoe hares moved similar distances and spent similar amounts of time per browse site in the presence and absence of terrestrial predators. Hares protected from predators used slightly more browse sites in thick cover, but this pattern was partially due to differences in availability. The absence of terrestrial predators had little effect on snowshoe hare foraging behaviour; instead, browse distribution patterns explained most of the behavioural variation. Thus, the predicted patterns in response to the manipulations did not occur, and our results challenge the idea that changes in snowshoe hare foraging behaviour contribute to their cyclic dynamics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Demand variability increases as one moves up a supply chain. The demand for finished products is less variable than for subassemblies, which is less variable than for individual components. This phenomenon is known as the bullwhip or Forrester effect. It increases inventory unnecessarily and makes managing the capacity of equipment and personnel difficult. In 1999, Philips Semiconductors confirmed substantial bullwhip effects in some of its supply chains and began developing a collaborative-planning process and tool to reduce them. It sought to reduce inventory and increase customer-service levels by integrating its supply chain planning and control with those of its customers. By applying stochastic multiechelon inventory theory, it developed an advanced planning and scheduling system that supports weekly collaborative planning of operations by Philips Semiconductors and one of its customers, Philips Optical Storage. The project has brought substantial savings. A conservative estimate shows minimum yearly savings of around US$5 million from $300 million yearly turnover. More important, Philips Optical Storage now has a more flexible and reliable supplier that can virtually guarantee quantities and delivery times. Philips Semiconductor is rolling out its new approach to other customers. </jats:p>",

That is, the model develops both demand and supply sides of the market. The authors model the demand side through a latent utility framework that allows for a no-purchase option. Accounting for both sides of the market enables the authors to check for any endogeneity problems on the demand side. They model the supply side through the profit-maximizing decisions of the manufacturers and a multiproduct retailer. Accounting for both the retailer and the manufacturer decisions enables the authors to evaluate the degree of manufacturer competition, retailer–manufacturer interactions, and retailer product-category pricing. Given the model assumptions and the market being studied, the authors find that not accounting for demand endogeneity can create bias in the estimation, the retailer seems to price below the static profit-maximizing prices for two of the three brands, and the inferred marginal wholesale prices are below the equilibrium uniform wholesale prices for two brands. The authors discuss the results with regard to channel bargaining, quantity discounts, and retailer category pricing. </jats:p>",

We assessed if skeletal muscle mitochondrial enzymes changed (1) acutely in response to changes in erythrocyte abundance, or (2) seasonally when we altered the age profile of erythrocytes. Rainbow trout were treated with pheynylhydrazine,causing a 75% reduction in hematocrit within 4 days. After erythropoiesis had returned hematocrit to normal, treated and control fish were subjected to a seasonal cold acclimation regime to assess the impact of erythrocyte age on skeletal muscle remodeling. Anemia (i.e. phenylhydrazine treatment) did not alter the specific activities (U g-1 tissue) of mitochondrial enzymes in white or red muscle. Anemic pretreatment did not alter the normal pattern of cold-induced mitochondrial proliferation in skeletal muscle,suggesting erythrocyte age was not an important influence on seasonal remodeling of muscle. Anemia and cold acclimation both induced a 25–30%increase in relative ventricular mass. The increase in relative ventricular mass with phenylhydrazine treatment was accompanied by a 35% increase in DNA content (mg DNA per ventricle), suggesting an increase in number of cells. In contrast, the increase in ventricular mass with cold temperature acclimation occurred without a change in DNA content (mg DNA per ventricle), suggesting an increase in cell size. Despite the major increases in relative ventricular mass, neither anemia nor seasonal acclimation had a major influence on the specific activities of a suite of mitochondrial enzymes in heart. Collectively, these studies argue against a role for erythrocyte dynamics in seasonal adaptive remodeling of skeletal muscle energetics.</jats:p>",

Large manufacturing firms are radically reducing the amount of their product that they both produce and design themselves. Instead they are turning to suppliers for key design, component, and even system inputs. This shift has created a great deal of business for specialized suppliers in a vast array of areas throughout the global manufacturing economy. But it has also created an entirely new and challenging-often quite contradictory-terrain of relations between suppliers and their customers. Our claim in this chapter is that relations between suppliers and customers in manufacturing are becoming systematically more heterogeneous within all advanced industrial societies.</jats:p>",

The buyer's forecasting behavior is characterized by the frequency and magnitude of forecast revisions it requests (forecast volatility) as well as by the fraction of orders that were forecasted but never actually purchased (forecast inflation). The supplier's delivery performance is measured by its ability to meet delivery dates requested by the customers. Based on a duration analysis, we are able to show that suppliers penalize buyers for unreliable forecasts by providing lower service levels.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Okmok volcano, located in the central Aleutian arc, Alaska, is a dominantly basaltic complex topped with a 10‐km‐wide caldera that formed circa 2.05 ka. Okmok erupted several times during the 20th century, most recently in 1997; eruptions in 1945, 1958, and 1997 produced lava flows within the caldera. We used 80 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images (interferograms) to study transient deformation of the volcano before, during, and after the 1997 eruption. Point source models suggest that a magma reservoir at a depth of 3.2 km below sea level, located beneath the center of the caldera and about 5 km northeast of the 1997 vent, is responsible for observed volcano‐wide deformation. The preeruption uplift rate decreased from about 10 cm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> during 1992–1993 to 2 ∼ 3 cm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> during 1993–1995 and then to about −1 ∼ −2 cm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> during 1995–1996. The posteruption inflation rate generally decreased with time during 1997–2001, but increased significantly during 2001–2003. By the summer of 2003, 30 ∼ 60% of the magma volume lost from the reservoir in the 1997 eruption had been replenished. Interferograms for periods before the 1997 eruption indicate consistent subsidence of the surface of the 1958 lava flows, most likely due to thermal contraction. Interferograms for periods after the eruption suggest at least four distinct deformation processes: (1) volcano‐wide inflation due to replenishment of the shallow magma reservoir, (2) subsidence of the 1997 lava flows, most likely due to thermal contraction, (3) deformation of the 1958 lava flows due to loading by the 1997 flows, and (4) continuing subsidence of 1958 lava flows buried beneath 1997 flows. Our results provide insights into the postemplacement behavior of lava flows and have cautionary implications for the interpretation of inflation patterns at active volcanoes.</jats:p>",

This model simulates granulocyte progenitor cell growth and oxygen consumption in a three‐dimensional (3‐D) perfusion bioreactor. Material balances on cells are coupled to the nutrient balances in 3‐D matrices to determine the effects of transport limitations on cell growth. The method of volume averaging is used to formulate the material balances for the cells and the nutrients in the porous matrix containing the cells. All model parameters are obtained from the literature. The maximum cell volume fraction reached when oxygen is depleted in the cell layer at 15 days and is nearly 0.63, corresponding to a cell density of 2.25 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> cells/mL. The substrate inhibition kinetics for cell growth lead to complex effects with respect to the roles of oxygen concentration and supply by convection and diffusion on cell growth. Variation in the height of the liquid layer above the cell matrix where nutrient supply is introduced affected the relative and absolute amounts of oxygen supply by hydrodynamic flow and by diffusion across a gas permeable FEP membrane. Mass transfer restrictions of the FEP membrane are considerable, and the supply of oxygen by convection is essential to achieve higher levels of cell growth. A maximum growth rate occurs at a specific flow rate. For flow rates higher than this optimal, the high oxygen concentration led to growth inhibition and for lower flow rates growth limitations occur due to insufficient oxygen supply. Because of the nonlinear effects of the autocatalytic substrate inhibition growth kinetics coupled to the convective transport, the rate of growth at this optimal flow rate is higher than that in a corresponding well‐mixed reactor where oxygen concentration is set at the maximum indicated by the inhibitory kinetics. ©2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

This exploratory study investigates re‐use issues and practices related to process industry firms—from the producer's perspective—with the objective of identifying important issues that need further research in the field. Site visits were conducted to identify and clarify re‐use issues unique to process industry firms for the purpose of developing a mail survey instrument. The mail survey provided detailed information about the sources of returned product and materials and the subsequent re‐use decisions made by 141 different manufacturing facilities in a wide variety of process industries including chemicals, food, rubber, and plastics. Results indicate that process industry firms are quite diverse, that some common beliefs about re‐use in process industry firms do not apply to all process types in these industries, and that research efforts are needed in the areas of network design and product acquisition; inventory; production planning and control; and scheduling. The paper concludes by identifying specific research questions important to re‐use in process industry environments.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of ecological stoichiometry has centered on organisms and their interactions, with less emphasis on the meaning or value of a comprehensive ecosystem stoichiometry at larger scales. Here we develop a conceptual framework that relates internal processes and exogenous factors in spatially‐ and temporally‐linked ecosystems. This framework emerges from a functional view of ecosystem stoichiometry rooted in understanding the causes and consequences of relative stoichiometric balance, defined as the balance between ratios of resource supply and demand. We begin by modifying a graphical model based on resource ratio competition theory that relates resource supply and demand to ecosystem processes. This approach identified mechanisms, or stoichiometric schemes, through which ecosystems respond to variable resource supply. We expand this view by considering the effects of exogenous factors other then resource supply that comprise a stoichiometric template that influences stoichiometric balance within ecosystems. We then describe a number of examples of patterns in organismal stoichiometry in several types of ecosystems that illustrate stoichiometric schemes and factors that impinge directly on stoichiometric patterns. Next, we conduct an initial analysis of the stoichiometric effects of spatial linkages between ecosystems, and how those relate to boundary dynamics and hot spot development. We conclude by outlining research directions that will significantly advance our understanding of stoichiometric constraints on ecosystem structure and function.</jats:p>",

Likewise, glutathione peroxidase activities decreased in plasma and kidney to 43% and 18% respectively of wild-type levels. This agrees nicely with data from SePP knockout mice, supporting a selenium transport role for hepatically expressed SePP. However, brain selenium levels remain unaffected and neurological defects do not occur in the liver-specific Trsp knockout mice, while SePP knockout mice suffer from neurological defects. This indicates that a transport function in plasma is exerted by hepatically derived SePP, while in brain SePP fulfils a second, hitherto unexpected, essential role.</jats:p>",

Forestry in New Brunswick has risen to a level of prominence in the public and professional consciousness that is unprecedented in recent decades; the public voice is louder and stronger, industrial concerns are greater, and the economic vulnerability of the province is clearly evident.

Hurricane Iris made landfall in Southern Belize on 8 October 2001, severely damaging a 52 hectare site where the behavioral ecology of a population of Central American Black Howlers (<jats:italic>Alouatta pigra</jats:italic>) had been under study for 2.5 yr. The hurricane resulted in a mortality rate of 35 percent for major food trees, which was primarily attributed to uprooting, snapping, and major delimbing. This damage accounted for 97 percent of the food tree loss between the two sample periods. Tree species differences were found in both the percentage loss and category of damage to food trees. Trees of different heights also experienced different percentage loss and levels of damage; subcanopy and emergent trees experienced higher loss than canopy trees, and subcanopy trees were frequently uprooted. This was partially attributed to a lack of buttressing on these subcanopy trees. Buttressing was found to decrease the frequency of uprooting. Tree size was the only factor that did not influence either damage or death. Trees from which fruit were eaten by black howlers died more than twice as often as did trees eaten for leaves.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>Archaeological excavation at the San Giusto site (Lucera, Italy) has unearthed a Late Antique kiln that was most certainly dedicated to the production of cooking ware. An archaeometric study of numerous specimens of cooking and painted ware found at this site was carried out using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, micro‐Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, X‐ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma mass and optical emission spectrometry and instrumental neutron activation analysis. The integration of historical–archaeological data with archaeometric data has revealed that these specimens can be attributed to the San Giusto site. Furthermore, the production cycle of this ware can thus be reconstructed: from the diversified supply of raw materials (fluvial and marine sediments), to the relatively complex preparation of the paste, to firing at variable temperatures (600–750°C for cooking ware; 850–1050°C for painted ware).</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>Plants grown in an environment of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and temperature often show reduced CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation capacity, providing evidence of photosynthetic downregulation. The aim of this study was to analyse the downregulation of photosynthesis in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (700 µmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in nodulated alfalfa plants grown at different temperatures (ambient and ambient + 4°C) and water availability regimes in temperature gradient tunnels. When the measurements were taken in growth conditions, a combination of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and temperature enhanced the photosynthetic rate; however, when they were carried out at the same CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration (350 and 700 µmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> induced photosynthetic downregulation, regardless of temperature and drought. Intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration measurements revealed that photosynthetic acclimation could not be accounted for by stomatal limitations. Downregulation of plants grown in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was a consequence of decreased carboxylation efficiency as a result of reduced rubisco activity and protein content; in plants grown at ambient temperature, downregulation was also induced by decreased quantum efficiency. The decrease in rubisco activity was associated with carbohydrate accumulation and depleted nitrogen availability. The root nodules were not sufficiently effective to balance the source–sink relation in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatments and to provide the required nitrogen to counteract photosynthetic acclimation.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",
