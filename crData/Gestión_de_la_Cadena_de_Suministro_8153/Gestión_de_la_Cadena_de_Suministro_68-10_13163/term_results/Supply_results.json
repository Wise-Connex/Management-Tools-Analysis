The high voltage supply is variable from 9 to 30 kV in steps of 0.58 V and has a peak-to-peak ripple of 50 mV and an instability of 4 ppm/h. A corona-free ``hot top'' provides ample space for circuits which are referenced to the high voltage output and includes a 0.6 to 1.6 kV supply for a field emission electron source. This supply exhibits an instability of 20 ppm/h and a peak-to-peak ripple of 10 mV. The use of rechargeable batteries as the energy source within the ``hot top'' eliminates noise and leakage problems which are typically encountered when using high voltage isolation transformers for this application.</jats:p>",
