The findings indicate that volume flexibility and launch flexibility are key responses to marketing practices uncertainty and product uncertainty, respectively, in the highly cyclical furniture industry. Volume flexibility is also positively related to all measures of overall firm performance and highly related to market share and market share growth. Overall, excellent performers on supply chain flexibility are rewarded at the bottomline. However, performance with respect to volume, launch, and target market flexibilities has the widest ranging impact on financial and market performance.</jats:p>",

Many information suppliers are specifically targeting end‐users and offering them direct document access, retrieval and delivery. Where does this leave the information service? This paper outlines some recent developments in end‐user document supply and discusses advantages and disadvantages from both the user’s and the information professional’s point of view, relating in particular to the situation in the author’s own library. A number of services offering end‐user document supply are described. The changing role of the information professional in response to new developments is discussed and a compromise solution proposed whereby new technologies can be harnessed for end‐user benefit while at the same time still employing the added‐value that an information service can offer.</jats:p>",

It also provides support for the claim that firms employing these practices have enhanced supplier and manufacturing performance. Most firms regard the use of supplier selection criteria as an important part of their supplier selection process. Supplier involvement in product design activities and continuous improvement efforts is much lower than the use of supplier selection criteria. The product quality and product performance dimensions of supplier selection criteria plus all of the dimensions of supplier involvement and supplier performance are positively correlated with manufacturing performance. When the sample is divided into high and low manufacturing performers, all the elements of supplier performance and supplier involvement and all but one of the four supplier selection criteria are significantly better for the high performing group than the low performing group. These results lend support to the statement that implementing supplier selection criteria and involving suppliers has a positive impact on performance.</jats:p>",

The customer firm (and its supply base) was chosen due to its national leadership in quality improvement achievements and forward thinking in supply management. It was believed that this electronic systems manufacturer would be most likely to have reached a common understanding with its suppliers regarding continuous improvement needs. Results indicate that buyers and suppliers are largely in agreement regarding the extent of the suppliers' total quality management (TQM) implementation. Little agreement was noted regarding the buyers' execution of supplier development activities. Recommendations to supply managers regarding enhanced communication with their suppliers and recognition of their suppliers' role in quality improvement are offered.</jats:p>",

Purchasing managers were asked to assess and describe both incoming and outgoing internal service quality and associated activities for their purchasing departments and the organization as a whole. The respondents were also asked to assess the service quality provided to their firm's external customers. This information was used to summarize performance in each area for respondents with high levels of internal service quality, from both an internal supplier and internal customer perspective. Comparative information is provided for firms having low‐to‐moderate levels of internal service quality.</jats:p>",

This is particularly true for those firms that use foreign suppliers. As a result, purchasing managers for U.S. apparel manufacturers and retailers have found themselves faced with the challenge of ensuring that their merchandise is produced under humane, equitable conditions, even though suppliers may be located in distant markets outside of the corporate umbrella. This study reviews industry responses to this challenge. Industry initiatives, such as the Apparel Industry Partnership Agreement and the National Retail Federation Statement of principles on Supplier Legal Compliance, are discussed, and the content of codes of conduct from major manufacturers and retailers are analyzed. The review indicates that while many firms have codes of conduct, there is only limited uniformity across codes, the codes lack substantial detail, and the codes are particularly lax in the area of monitoring and enforcement.</jats:p>",

Kitamura] to determine how fertilization affected plant growth and quality and nutrient leaching. Fertilization treatments included constant liquid fertilization until anthesis (LFA), constant liquid fertilization until disbud (LFD), slow-release resincoated fertilizer (SRF), and no-fertilizer control. Frequency of irrigation was determined gravimetrically, and leaching fractions maintained near 0.2. Plant growth and quality for LFA, LFD, and SRF met commercial crop standards. Nearly 60% of the total nitrogen applied with LFA was applied during the 4 weeks between disbud and anthesis, due to increased water demand. During the same period when liquid fertilization was discontinued for LFD, leachate electrical conductivity (EC) levels dropped from 4 to &lt;1 dS·m<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Leachate EC levels for LFA at anthesis remained high, but were &lt;1 dS·m<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> for the other treatments. LFD and SRF drastically reduced the total amount of nutrients applied during the course of production compared with LFA. Use of an appropriate slow-release fertilizer or discontinued use of liquid fertilizer at disbud allow soluble salt levels to decrease during the latter weeks of the mum production cycle, when nutrient demand is low and water demand is high.</jats:p>",

Retailers implement scheduled ordering policies: Orders occur at fixed intervals and are equal to some multiple of a fixed batch size. A method is presented that exactly evaluates costs. Previous research demonstrates that the supplier's demand variance declines as the retailers' order intervals are balanced, i.e., the same number of retailers order each period. This research shows that the supplier's demand variance will (generally) decline as the retailers' order interval is lengthened or as their batch size is increased. Lower supplier demand variance can certainly lead to lower inventory at the supplier. This paper finds that reducing supplier demand variance with scheduled ordering policies can also lower total supply chain costs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Economic and environmental concerns have increased the need for quantitative advice on fertilizer rates. In addition, it would aid researchers to be able to estimate the degree to which nutrient availability is affecting yield in a wide variety of field experiments. All of these needs can, in principle, be addressed using the new PARJIB model. PARJIB retains the functional simplicity of much earlier analytical models of crop responses to soil test values and fertiliser application rates. However, in a key departure from previous approaches, response to scaled nutrient supply indices is dictated by the potential yield adjusted for plant population and water stress. The version currently being evaluated simulates responses to supply of N, P, K and Mg, varying either singly or in combination. We have calibrated the model for sweet corn, carrots, and snap bean crops grown under temperate conditions in a wide range of soils. Simulated yields agreed well with observed values; the root mean square error was 8% to 13%, and regressions of observed against simulated yields passed through the origin with slopes that were not significantly different from 1. After calibration, the model predicted strong interactions between nutrient supply, plant population and water stress. PARJIB appears to have substantial potential to improve nutrient management for horticultural crops.</jats:p>",

Under demand certainty, the adjustment of space supply is shown to be affected by whether an exogenous shock is perceived as mild or disastrous.

If an enterprise is to view the product delivery process as part of a supply chain then it must also consider the product introduction process (PIP). The PIP can account for a considerable proportion of an enterprise's total costs. This paper presents the development of a supply chain view of a steel industry PIP so as to establish a framework for a software based Decision Support System (DSS) via a systems engineering approach. The systems engineering approach is used to ensure optimisation of the whole. The paper shows that there is limited evidence of a framework for considering the PIP from a supply chain perspective using IT or otherwise.</jats:p>",

The use of mental health services by rural people suffering from depression and the role that supply may play in explaining these differences are not well understood. Understanding these issues for rural Medicaid beneficiaries is important as Medicaid managed care for physical and behavioral health care is expanded to rural areas. This study compares the mental health service use of rural and urban Medicaid beneficiaries, ages 18 to 64, in Maine suffering from depression and examines what influence mental health and primary care supply have in explaining observed differences. Two models are used to estimate the use of ambulatory mental health services: (1) a logit likelihood estimate of whether a beneficiary uses any outpatient mental health services for depression; (2) an ordinary least squares regression estimating the number of annualized ambulatory mental health care visits among users. Rural beneficiaries suffering from depression have lower utilization than urban beneficiaries. Rural and urban Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)‐ and Supplemental Security Income (SSU‐beneficiaries suffering from depression rely more on mental health than on general health care providers to receive ambulatory mental health care. Rural beneficiaries (AFDC and SSI) rely relatively more on general health care providers than urban beneficiaries. Multivariate analysis suggests that mental health supply and patient‐level factors, but not primary care supply, account for utilization differences. This article describes the need to better understand factors limiting participation of primary care providers and to study the role of supply across multiple states</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

However, few prior studies have quantified the magnitude of this facilitating or enabling effect of family planning services, given existing demand for contraception. This study takes advantage of panel survey data and linked information on the supply environment for family planning services in Morocco in order to bridge this research gap. In the analysis, contraceptive use during the 1992–95 period is related to contraceptive intentions in 1992; individual‐, household‐, and community‐level determinants of contraceptive behavior; and family planning supply factors. Estimation procedures are used that control for unobserved joint determinants of contraceptive intentions and use. Evidence of a significant enabling or facilitating role of family planning services is found, and the results also suggest that family planning program factors influence contraceptive intentions in important ways.</jats:p>",

As market starts to be driven by other features (smaller systems and shorter projects, mass commercial products), it is necessary to examine how far current systems engineering practices support the new rules and whether these new rules affect established systems engineering practices. This is of course an ambitious and long‐term job but this article would like with other papers sharing the same concern and presented at INCOSE'99 to pave the way for this endeavor. We present herein the intermediate results of an experiment carried out by MGE UPS Systems, a world class provider of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems and that investigates the interface between marketing and engineering to identify if better work in this area can improve time‐to‐market.</jats:p>",

The links between UK retailers and Kenyan producers are investigated using the concept of the marketing chain. Two major chains are identified ‐ wholesale and supermarket – and, whilst having no direct investment in Kenya, it is the supermarkets who control production there, through intermediaries who ensure that standards of quality and presentation are met. Importers play a crucial role in facilitating this trade, acting as a vital link between farmers and exporters in Kenya and supermarkets in the UK. The need for quality and traceability dictates that contractual arrangements are made predominantly with large‐scale farms using productivist farming methods. The irony is that it is post‐productivist demands by ‘new consumers’ in the UK that are encouraging these productivist horticultural systems in Kenya.</jats:p>",
