When items fail, they require repair; the particular type of repair being governed by a probability distribution. As repairs may be lengthy, spares are kept on hand to replace failed items. System ineffectiveness is measured by expected weighted shortages over all items and locations, in steady state. This can be reduced by either having more spares or shorter expected repair times. Design consists of a provisioning of the number of spares for each item, by location; and specifying the expected repair times for each type of repair, by item and location. The optimal design minimizes expected shortages within a budget constraint, which covers both (i) procurement of spares and (ii) procurement of equipment and manning levels for the repair facilities. All costs are assumed to be separable so that a Lagrangian approach is fruitful, yielding an implementable algorithm with outputs useful for sensitivity analysis. A numerical example is presented.</jats:p>",

Ca. two‐fifths of the fat currently comes from fats and oils, including butter; over a third comes from meat (including fat pork cuts), poultry, and fish; and ca. one‐eight comes from dairy products. This large increase in nutrient fat is due mainly to the use of more vegetable fats—margarine, shortening, and salad and cooking oils. The per capita amount provided by animal fats actually has decreased, because the large decreases in consumption of butter and lard are only partly offset by increases in fat associated with greater consumption of meats. Despite the decrease in consumption of animal fats, they continue to provide ca. one‐fourth of the total calories. Although the proportion of calories from vegetable fats has increased, animal products still account for the largest share of the calories provided by fat. Shifts in sources of fat and the increased amount of fat have changed the fatty acid content of the food supply.</jats:p>",

Following dilution of these cells into fresh medium there is a large increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity, reaching a peak often several hundred times the initial level at about four hours. At least part of this stimulation is due to an increase in the apparent half‐life of the enzyme, to between 30 and 90 minutes. Evidence is presented that the supply of amino acids can control the turnover of ODC under some conditions. For example supplementing high density cells with glutamine, asparagine, serine, glycine and proline, either singly or together, increases ODC activity and decreases its apparent turnover. The stimulation by amino acids is enhanced by serum.</jats:p>",
