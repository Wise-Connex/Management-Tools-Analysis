      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Although rail transport appears to be well established and outperforming other transport modes in Europe and beyond, in the majority of developing economies it was observed that firms and travellers were, on the contrary, shunning from the rail. Despite considerable infrastructural investments in the African rail systems, the sector has been deteriorating over the years.Objectives: This study identifies the freight rail transportation problems faced by African developing economies, focusing on Namibia, and examines the potential actions and factors for minimising such problems, drawing lessons from some of the developed world’s success stories.Method: The objectives of this study are achieved through a survey of Windhoek-based industrial and logistics firms operating in Namibia. Self-administered survey questionnaires were distributed through the aid of trained research assistants.Results: The study’s results show that some of the reasons of shunning rail transport are a matter of attitude, whereas some are related to operational challenges. The study confirms that the transport mode used and ownership of the freight transport services used can affect the degree of satisfaction for the transportation of goods in Namibia.Conclusion: Namibian industrial and logistics firms avoid using rail, owing to its low level of satisfaction obtained from its use. Besides engaging in Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in rail transport operations, the study contends that rail transport should receive attention similar to that given to other transport modes for African economies such as Namibia to overcome the costs associated with the increasing road congestion.</jats:p>"

Although much research was done on the various impacts of the airport industry, very little research was done on the air cargo industry in airport regions.Objectives: This article specifically explored the unique spatial relationships, impacts, trends and movement patterns of the air cargo industry within a typical airport region.Method: The article focused on the OR Tambo International Airport in Gauteng, South Africa, as a case study and was informed by an extensive quantitative spatial and land use analysis and modelling of the study area.Results: The article presented findings and insights on the movement patterns and relationships between (1) the airport facility and (2) the spatial configuration of air cargo industries in the particular airport region. These findings also provided some framework for a possible spatial model and guideline that could assist in steering and managing development and movement patterns in airport regions.Conclusion: The article provided new insights and understanding on the spatial dynamics of airport regions and the air cargo industry, ultimately addressing some gaps in this knowledge field. The article in the end highlighted the need for a different and novel approach to the planning and management of the air cargo industry in airport regions and a basis for further research. </jats:p>"

Green products are resulted from the application of green supply chain management strategies to the organizations' performance strategies, so that we can reduce environmental pollutants and wastes and take a step towards saving energy with limited resources.Methodology:  In this paper, the effect of reducing energy consumption in green supply chain is examined by using queuing theory and transportation models. Data was generated and solved by a commercial optimization epackage.Findings:  The findings indicate that suitable assignment of existing transportation fleet with specified capacity, and using queueing theory in a closed-loop network to reduce the queue length and handle congestion, can cause a reduction in energy consumption by optimizing transportation and waiting times in a green supply chain.Originality/value: Adopting investment strategy in improving the environmental performance of the supply chain, will yield in many advantages and benefits. This article investigates the effect of queuing theory on reducing waiting time, optimizing energy consumption in green supply chain, and consequently decreasing pollution.</jats:p>"

This shall be demonstrated through field data results and benefits of using motion-based GPS technology in oil and gas supply chain logistics to monitor the movement and location of offshore equipment and materials through findings of a pilot project.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Over the past few years, the adoption of asset tracking technology in oilfield operations has provided operators and service companies with increased visibility of the supply chain leading to a reduction in operational costs.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>New motion-based GPS technology is more advanced than a time based locator (traditional GPS technology provides one-way communication every 12-24 hours) to a movement based locator providing two-way communication.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This has the potential to provide an overview of when materials are transported and has the ability to accurately illustrate events such as arrival at an offshore platform, vessel movement or onshore at quayside/ remote locations which triggers customer billing.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods, Procedures, Process</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>100 cargo carrying units (CCUs) were tagged for a pilot project to test this technology. Each of the CCUs processed through a cycle of leaving customer site onshore, being transported to port/quayside, shipped offshore and returned to the original onshore site. The GPS unit reports based on motion of the unit progressing through the cycle, as opposed to daily pre-set time scheduled reporting, providing customers with a complete overview of their CCU movement cycle. The accuracy of this turnaround was compared to results gained using current RFID infrastructure which is generally accepted as being a more accurate technology.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results, Observations, Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The pilot confirmed that motion-based GPS is more accurate and can replace RFID for the automated logistical control over consignment stock movement globally.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The following results were obtained from the 205 entry and exit events: RFID reported 75% accuracy, reporting 164 events and missing 41Motion-based GPS reported 99.01% accuracy, reporting 203 events and missing 2</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Novel, Additive Information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Motion-based GPS technology has been illustrated to be a consistent, viable approach to controlling consignment stock on a global basis providing two-way communication, greater control and oversight to the customer as conveyed through our pilot project. The adoption of this new technology is also cost-effective to implement compared with the current complex infrastructure set up required through RFID.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Infections in pregnant women can cause serious health problems in the child such as mental retardation and blindness. Infection with T. gondii in immunocompetent adults can lead to impaired eyesight. Toxoplasmosis has ranked very highly in two studies of death and disability attributable to foodborne pathogens. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat containing T. gondii tissue cysts and the consumption of raw vegetables or water contaminated with T. gondii oocysts from cat feces is most frequently associated with human illness. The risk of acquiring a Toxoplasma infection via food varies with cultural and eating habits in different human populations.</jats:p>"

We developed an audit methodology that can be performed to assess the organization’s readiness in K-SCM. The developed framework consists of KM dimensions and Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) components. The proposed audit methodology is subsequently illustrated through a case of a manufacturing company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents a fully-integrated and universal DC/DC converter to minimize cost and size of power supply systems in wireless nodes for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The proposed converter avoids the use of inductors and is made by a cascade of switching capacitor stages, implementing both step-down and step-up converting ratios, which regulate input sources from 1 V to 60 V to a voltage of about 4 V. Multiple linear regulators are placed at the end of the cascade to provide multiple and stable output voltages for loads such as memories, sensors, processors, wireless transceivers. The multi-output power converter has been integrated in a Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) 180 nm technology. As case study, the generation of 3 output voltages has been considered (3 V, 2.7 V, and 1.65 V with load current requirements of 0.3 A, 0.3 A, and 0.12 A, respectively). Thanks to the adoption of a high switching frequency, up to 5 MHz, the only needed passive components are flying capacitors, whose size is below 10 nF, and buffer capacitors, whose size is below 100 nF. These capacitors can be integrated on top of the chip die, creating a 3D structure. This way, the size of the power management unit for IoT and CPS nodes is limited at 18 mm2. The proposed converter can also be used with changing input power sources, like power harvesting systems and/or very disturbed power supplies.</jats:p>"

Two game scenarios (Manufacturer Stackelberg and Retailer Stackelberg) are examined under different channel structures. Furthermore, we introduce government subsidies as an impact factor of low-carbon strategy adoption. In the single-channel (Case 1), we mainly examine the influence of consumers’ price-sensitivity on channel members’ optimal decisions. In the dual-channel (Case 2), we focus on the joint impact of product substitutability and different channel power structures on the optimal decisions under asymmetric related channel status. The analysis suggests that the Stackelberg leaders always perform better than their corresponding followers before emission reduction, while they may not necessarily yield more benefits after emission reduction. The implementation of low-carbon strategy depends on parameters like product substitutability and channel base demand. Finally, all the supply chain members will encounter a Prisoner’s Dilemma when the product substitutability is relatively high.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article considers legal interventions to facilitate an affordable housing market in New Zealand. In particular, it focuses on meaningfully increasing supply and facilitating intensification and options in growing cities. It analyses the measures currently proposed by central government, including deregulation and reforms to the Resource Management Act 1991 and assesses whether these measures can achieve density and increased options and housing choices. It proposes measures such as making full use of the RMA's effects-based model, releasing National Policy Statements and carefully drafting cohesive and strategic City Plans which focus on outcomes and quality. These measures should be supported by a range of incentives, disincentives, regulations and supplementary measures to ensure the implementation of transformative town plans.A plethora of interconnected issues have contributed to the current housing problem; economic issues like demand and social issues like immigration and NIMBY-ism (Not in my backyard). While this article focuses on meaningfully increasing supply, it acknowledges that legal interventions and supply increases are not a silver bullet solution. A smorgasbord of legal reforms as well as economic and social changes must occur to truly address affordability challenges.</jats:p>"

However, significant uncertainties do appear during the analysis and design of these systems, such as the equivalent pipe roughness and the actual internal diameters of the pipes. To study these uncertainties, the water supply and the looped water distribution systems are studied separately. For the water supply system, these uncertainties are incorporated in the analysis of the system, using the extension principle of the fuzzy sets and a new operation of the fuzzy subtraction. Based on the calculation of head losses for each branch of the system, the nodal heads are obtained as fuzzy numbers. In regard to the looped water distribution system, a methodology is developed and proposed, based on the extension principle and leading to several optimisation problems with respect to the branches of the system. The aim of the proposed methodology is to determine the α-cuts and finally produce the shape of the membership function of flows in the branches of the system. Both methodologies are illustrated by numerical examples.</jats:p>",

As a result, approaches of sustainability growth is threatened to become less capable for contributing to improving livelihood of most of the communities. Nowadays, appear the approach of inclusive business by the for-profit organizations and not-for-profit organizations, as to contribute to reducing poverty and ignorance, through the inclusion of low income communities in the value chain of such organizations. This paper uses a probability approach that relies on purposive sampling to predict a concurrent contribution of inclusive business to both problematic organizational culture and low income communities, and to expect the benefits to be exchanged between the two parties, and for the purpose to help improve the supply chain of organizations and raise the quality of organizational culture as well. Results show that 0.87 is the probability for the success of inclusive business by 100%, based on my vision’s analysis.</jats:p>"

Among the various methods used for nitrate removal, denitrification, a process in which nitrate is biologically reduced to elemental nitrogen, is relatively reliable and inexpensive as compared to other physical and chemical nitrate removal processes. Denitrification is generally conducted with biofilters in which bacteria are either immobilized to the surface of insoluble carriers or are entrapped within an immobilization matrix. We examined the use of non-toxic and biodegradable natural hydrocolloids for entrapment of denitrifying bacteria. Gel beads containing starch and alginate were used for this purpose. Three types of gel beads were examined: (1) wet gel beads; (2) porous wet gel beads; and (3) freeze-dried gel beads. With respect to nitrate removal, wet and dried gel beads showed similar removal capacities. Porous beads demonstrated an advantage over regular gel beads only during the first of the approximately 3-month incubation period. The viability of the immobilized bacteria was only slightly affected during prolonged refrigerated storage of the beads. Compared to freeze-dried beads, production costs of wet beads are significantly reduced, so it is anticipated that such carriers will eventually lead to a method that can be applied on an industrial scale.</jats:p>",

It results in significant decline in decomposition of toxic target contaminants when other non-toxic organic compounds such as natural organic matter (NOM) compete in the reaction. Previously, size exclusion of large NOM onto the mesoporous structure of TiO2 photocatalyst was proven to improve the selective decomposition of small size target chemicals. In this study, manipulation of reaction pH as a crucial parameter in governing the adsorption and decomposition of organic chemicals was combined with the size exclusion of NOM. The effects of size-based adsorption/exclusion and pH-dependent electrostatic attraction/repulsion were investigated by using humic acid as model NOM and ibuprofen and methylene blue as model target contaminants. Adsorption and decomposition of the targets were dependent on their hydrodynamic size and ionization state. Mesoporous TiO2 suppressed physical access of large NOM onto its surface while reaction pH influenced the surface charge of TiO2 and the speciation of the chemicals and thus controlled their adsorption and decomposition. The results imply that selecting a proper pH can significantly improve selective decomposition of a target onto porous TiO2 in the presence of NOM.</jats:p>",

From the contingency perspective, we used hierarchical regression to determine the impacts of individual GSCI dimensions (green internal, customer and supplier integration) and their interactions on firm performance. From the configuration perspective, we used cluster analysis to develop patterns of GSCI, which were analyzed in terms of GSCI strength and balance. Analysis of variance was used to examine the relationship between GSCI pattern and firm performance. We used data collected from manufacturing firms in Shanxi, Shandong, Beijing, Guangdong and Jiangsu to test hypotheses. The findings from both the contingency and configuration perspective indicate that GSCI was related to both operational and financial performance. Furthermore, the interaction between green internal integration and green customer integration was positively related to both operational and financial performance, while the interaction between green internal integration and green supplier integration was negatively related to financial performance. The interaction between green customer integration and green supplier integration was positively related to financial performance.</jats:p>"

Tests on slow-releasing oxygen materials that could be used to change the reductive environment in groundwater by slowly releasing oxygen were carried out. Oxygen-releasing laboratory experiments were conducted to monitor changes in DO concentration, pH, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in aqueous solutions. The adsorption of the materials on total Fe and Mn were also analyzed. The experimental results showed that the oxygen-releasing status of materials was stable at 15 mg/L after 20 d for fixed-shape materials. Paraffin wax shells and a KH2PO4 pH regulator facilitated the lowering of pH. The oxygen-releasing process followed the quasi-second-order kinetic model, and the oxygen-releasing rate constant K was 1.28, 1.51, and 1.97 (mg/(L·h)) for silt, silty sand, and fine sand medium, respectively. The larger the seepage medium particles were, the faster the pH and TDS dropped. Adsorption experiment results showed that adsorption on total Fe and Mn were well simulated by the Langmuir nonlinear isothermal adsorption equation. The maximum adsorption capacities of the materials on total Fe and Mn were found to be 0.708 mg/g and 0.438 mg/g, respectively.</jats:p>",

In the article there are presented results of the analysis of preoperative angiographic studies of 94 patients with primary and recurrent sarcomas of soft tissues of the extremities. The features of blood supply and internal angioarchitectonics of tumor were revealed depending on the size, histological type and localization. The features of blood supply of tumors in patients with primary and recurrent sarcomas of soft tissues of extremities were described in detail. The results of further surgical treatment of patients included in the study showed that information on the number and size of blood supply sources of the tumor zone, supplemented by selective embolization of vessels, made it possible to select the optimal plan and minimize trauma, reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, and perform organ-preserving and functionally beneficial operations.</jats:p>"

To cope with this problem, Murakawa’s Simulation for Water Consumption (MSWC), which utilizes the Monte Carlo method to calculate water usage dynamically has been developed. In this study, we evaluated the validity of MSWC on water consumption of an office building. Actual water consumption data were collected from a six story office building.

The ADF test is delved to examine the Stationarity of the variables and the correlation between them. The descriptive analysis is used to check the normality of the variable whether the variables is normally distributed or not. The survey bases on time series data ranging from the year 1974 to 2014. The variables as the gross domestic product (GDP), exchange rate (ER), inflation (INF), consumer price index (CPI), money supply (M2), total reserves (TR) and the foreign direct investment (FDI), price indices (PI). The research findings are Foreign direct investment, Exchange rate, Inflation rate, Consumer Price Index has the positive impact on the GDP while the Private Investment, Total reserves, and Money supply have the negative impact on the GDP. The value of the R square is 0.99874 which is very good. It means that the 99 percent variations exist in dependent variable due to independent variables. </jats:p>"

With the increase of overhead contact line transmission, the generated harmonics increased the communication interference. Therefore, on the basis of analyzing the generation and spectrum of harmonics in power system, an improved S transform method is introduced in order to propose a harmonic measurement and analysis method based on improved S transform for power supply system of high speed railway in this paper. The proposed method can effectively realize the harmonic measurement and analysis of power supply system. In order to testify the effectiveness of the proposed harmonic measurement and analysis method, Yingkou substation of Harbin-Dalian high speed railway is selected in here. The actual analysis calculation and experiment results show that the proposed method can effectively measure and analyze the harmonic in the power supply system of high speed railway. It provides a theoretical basis for solving the practical engineering problem of power supply.</jats:p>",

Box–Behnken design was found effective in defining the operating conditions for fluoride sorption onto Z-Al. Confirmatory experiments were conducted to examine the reliability of the regression equation. The predicted (2.261 mg g−1) and experimental (2.289 mg g−1) capacities were found to be similar, demonstrating the accuracy of the model. The fluoride adsorption onto Z-Al was well described by the Freundlich model. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order reaction. Thermodynamic parameters depicted that the fluoride adsorption on the alumina modified zeolite was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The co-existing ions affected the defluoridation performance significantly. Regeneration of exhausted Z-Al was achieved with H2SO4.</jats:p>",

Implementation of such measures affects the behaviour of the water pipe systems during the operation stage. The research work presented herein presents a model simulating the behaviour of urban water distribution networks (WDNs) under normal operating conditions, as well as during a period of IWS operations. The modelling and analysis, based on an eight-year dataset (2003–2010) from a local Water Board, takes into account information related to breakage incidents within the WDN as well as external factors to perform vulnerability assessment of the pipe network. The results of the performed survival and cluster analysis show that during the implementation period of IWS operations, and right after that period, there is a significant increase in the deterioration rate of the affected network. Further, there is a change in the comparative importance of the factors affecting the network condition and their contribution to the WDN vulnerability.</jats:p>",

In particular, HABs associated with cyanobacteria have been of great interest because of their potential to generate and release biological toxins, especially, lethal microcystins (MCs). The overall goal of this study was to develop a new sustainable approach to decompose MCs, preferably on-site and in real-time with minimal effort, fewer chemicals, and low energy inputs. To achieve the goal, a high efficiency nitrogen-doped TiO2 photocatalytic film immobilized onto a glass substrate was fabricated via integrated sol-gel synthesis employing nitrogen-containing surfactants as pore-templating agent and nitrogen-dopant. The film exhibited visible light-activated, nanoporous, and transparent properties. Effects of surfactant type, calcination temperature, coating layers, and reaction pH on the photocatalytic decomposition of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) were investigated under visible light. Eventually, the TiO2 film was able to successfully decompose MC-LR on-site in a lake under solar radiation in real-time. This study implies the high potential of the TiO2 film for on-site and real-time decomposition of many organic contaminants in water by using sustainable solar energy.</jats:p>",

The Asmari karstic aquifer is formed within Oligo-Miocene carbonate rocks in the south of the oil reservoir. A mixing between fresh karstic groundwater and oil-field brines is to be expected because of underground migration of the brines toward the aquifer. This process can reduce the groundwater quality by both increasing the water salinity and by adding hydrocarbon and sulfur contaminants into the groundwater. Tembi river contains saline water that can affect groundwater resources. Leaking of these brines into the aquifer was distinguished using total dissolved solids, the relative concentration of major elements, bromide ion (as a trace element), total organic carbon, ion ratios, and mixing curve diagrams. The polluted zone was determined by tracking the hydrochemistry changes across the groundwater flow direction. The volume percentage of different water sources in mixed groundwater was calculated and validated using PHREEQC software. The results revealed that the contribution of the oil-field brine in the groundwater is much lower than the salty river brine, but even this low amount has a considerable impact on water quality by increasing water salinity and adding hydrocarbon and sulfur into the groundwater.</jats:p>",

The performance of the new system was evaluated against a conventional flood cutting fluid supply system during step shoulder milling of Ti‐6Al‐4V using vegetable oil‐based cutting fluid. The comparison was performed at different cutting speeds and feed rates. Comparison measures/indicators were cutting force, workpiece temperature, tool flank wear, burr formation and average surface roughness (Ra). The new system provided significant reductions in cutting fluid consumption of up to 42%. Additionally, reductions in cutting force, tool flank wear and burr height of 16.41%, 46.77%, and 31.70% were recorded, respectively. Smaller Ra values were also found with the use of the new system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a cost-efficient and reliable supply chain network design model for biomass to be delivered to biofuel plants. Biomass is bulky, so transportation modes such as rail and barge can be used to deliver this product. For this reason, this study focuses on multimodal supply chain designs for biofuel. Biomass supply is highly seasonal, but the high production seasons for biomass in the Southeast United States often coincide with or are followed by hurricanes, and drought seasons, both of which impact transportation. The dynamic multimodel transportation network design model this paper presents enables this supply chain to cope with biomass supply fluctuations and to hedge against natural disasters. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming model proposed is an 𝒩𝒫-hard problem, and we develop an accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm and a hybrid rolling horizon algorithm to solve this problem. We tested the performance of the algorithm on a case study using data from the Southeast United States. The numerical experiments show that this proposed algorithm can solve large-scale problem instances to a near optimal solution in a reasonable time. Numerical analyses indicate that, under normal conditions, the minimum cost model outperforms the reliable models. However, under disaster scenarios, the minimum cost model is 2.65% to 9.20% more expensive than the reliable and static model and 6.28% to 17.73% more expensive than the reliable and dynamic model. Thus, the reliable and dynamic multimodal network design decisions can aid biofuel supply chain management decisions, especially when considering the potential impacts of natural disasters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapidly changing environment has affected organizations' ability to maintain viability. As a result, various criteria and uncertain situations in a complex environment encounter problems when using the traditional performance evaluation with precise and deterministic data. The purpose of this paper is to propose an applicable model for evaluating the performance of the overall supply chain (SC) network and its members. Performance evaluation methods, which do not include uncertainty, obtain inferior results. To overcome this, rough set theory (RST) was used to deal with such uncertain data and extend rough noncooperative Stackelberg data envelopment analysis (DEA) game to construct a model to evaluate the performance of supply chain under uncertainty. This applies the concept of Stackelberg game/leader–follower in order to develop models for measuring performance. The ranking method of noncooperative two-stage rough DEA model is discussed. While developing the model, which is suitable to evaluate the performance of the supply chain network and its members when it operates in uncertain situations and involves a high degree of vagueness. The application of this paper provides a valuable procedure for performance evaluation in other industries. The proposed model provides useful insights for managers on the measurement of supply chain efficiency in uncertain environment. This paper creates a new perspective into the use of performance evaluation model in order to support managerial decision-making in the dynamic environment and uncertain situations.</jats:p>",

WD could be represented as a function of various variables such as climatic, socioeconomic, institutional and management factors to understand it better. Therefore, in the present study, GPR was used to predict daily WD by taking advantage of several socio-economic and climatic variables for Hamadan city, located in the west of Iran. The selected variables were comprised of daily weather data such as rainfall (R), maximum temperature (Tmax), mean temperature (Tmean), min temperature (Tmin) and relative humidity, Socioeconomic variables such as average monthly water bill (MWB), population (P), number of households (NH), gross national product, and inflation rate (I). The results indicated that GPR could predict the daily WD accurately in terms of statistical evaluations criteria. Sensitivity analysis among various climatic and socio-economic data showed the best input structure in water consumption prediction via GPR. Accordingly, the results approved the substantial impression of WD with three day-lag, I, MWB and Tmax as the input dataset.</jats:p>",

Two levels of nutrient solution (high and low loading: HL/LL) were prepared to simulate the typical characteristics of the greenhouse effluent. The wood-chip bioreactor with Typha angustifolia exhibited the highest consistent nutrient treatment with an average nitrate reduction in the LL phase of 88.4% (28.2 g N m−3 media day−1) and phosphate reduction of 34.4%. The nitrate reduction in this bioreactor was the highest among the values reported in the literature. The near-complete denitrification developed provided a nitrate-limiting environment as evidenced by an average 21.5% sulfate reduction. The distinct increase in the outflow organic carbon (as BOD5) from the wood chips in the bioreactor planted with T. angustifolia appeared to be the key explanation for the efficient denitrification, while the other vegetated bioreactors resulted in 19.0%–36.5% nitrate reduction and low outflow BOD5 near the end of the experiment, indicating carbon limitation in these bioreactors.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the natural occurrence of such events (particularly colour) can be difficult to predict and commercial humic materials generally fail to closely match the indigenous natural organic matter (NOM) present in the raw water. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to simulate NOM event conditions. This paper describes a simple brewing method that we developed and used in our recent pilot plant evaluation of a proposed DAF/Ozone/BAC process for drinking water treatment. Using this method we successfully prepared, by using fallen leaves etc. collected from the local catchment area, large quantities of a concentrated NOM stock solution with its specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), when diluted, very close to the median SUVA of historical NOM events. The brewed solution showed broadly similar NOM characteristics to those of the raw water encountered during the pilot investigation period in terms of molecular weight distribution and fractionation. The coagulation behaviour was also examined for the spiked and non-spiked raw water.</jats:p>",

The traditional way of fulfilling the growing demand–supply gap by seeking new water supply options such as exploiting new fresh water resources and investing in the expansion of infrastructure is no longer considered environmentally or economically sustainable. A diverse portfolio of water efficiency measures is now a requirement for the majority of water companies in the UK. This paper presents results from a statistical analysis of a unique water efficiency program case study. The study evaluates the effectiveness of installing water-saving devices in single-family households in areas where a major UK water supply company operates. Using multilevel models, the study accurately measures the water savings achieved through the efficiency program and defines the factors that affect a household's potential to save water. Analysis illustrated a mean 7% decrease in consumption, explicitly attributable to the efficiency program. Research findings provide strong evidence that single resident and financially stretched households have a bigger potential to conserve water than larger and more affluent ones and also highlight the robustness of multilevel analysis, even in cases of data limitations.</jats:p>",

Over the last decade or so, Jinzhong has successfully developed the cooperative to stabilize and improve the quality of pig supply, by building relationships with pig producers (farmers) and achieving an exceptional financial performance in the process. The company-led cooperative represents an innovative supply chain governance mechanism in a Chinese context. However, the pork industry has evolved significantly and the time has come for the senior management team at Jinzhong to decide whether or not to keep the cooperative. This case study is aimed at senior undergraduate students and postgraduate students specializing in agricultural economics/agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of food companies.</jats:p>",

Disinfection of microorganisms by solar photocatalysis is emerging as a promising technique for drinking water treatment. The present study deals with the preparation of Ag-doped TiO2 by the sol gel method, and its immobilization over the inner surface of the Pyrex glass pipes used in fabrication of pilot-scale reactors. The solar photocatalytic efficiency of the reactors was tested for the disinfection of microorganisms in tap water and roof harvested rainwater. The photocatalytic experiments under solar irradiation illustrate that doping with silver ions significantly increases the inactivation rate of all microorganisms compared with pure TiO2 and direct photolysis. The inactivation efficiency against various microorganisms was found in the following decreasing order: E. coli&amp;gt;MS-2 phage&amp;gt;Aspergillus spores. The roof harvested rainwater was completely disinfected in addition to chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, within 120 minutes of solar irradiation. The experimental cycle was repeated several times to study the stability of the reactor. The pilot-scale solar photocatalytic fixed bed tubular reactors were found to be very effective for the disinfection of rainwater for potable use.</jats:p>",

We find that OSD hampers a reshoring manufacturer’s responsiveness to demand information updates and may significantly affect offshoring–reshoring comparisons, such that reshoring may yield lower profits than offshoring in many cases, including when offshoring has no baseline-cost advantage. We then show that OSD also affects how salient costs such as customs duties and shipping costs influence offshoring–reshoring profit comparisons. We further identify common-component designs as a mitigating measure to make reshoring more appealing under OSD, and numerically confirm the robustness of our results. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2016.0604 . </jats:p>",

In a recent modification of OCOP, coexisting ferrous iron of water was utilized in order to lower the dose of FeCl3 and hence to lower the cost of the treatment of water containing both arsenic and iron. Here we present how the OCOP method can be effectively and economically used for simultaneous removal of arsenic, iron and manganese ions from water containing all three contaminants. For this we have optimized the required doses of NaHCO3, KMnO4 and FeCl3 by response surface methodology and used the optimized doses in a field trial with 11 domestic units of 20 L capacity in batch mode. Arsenic, iron and manganese were removed simultaneously by the present modification of the OCOP method to below 1 μg/L, 0.03 mg/L and 0.009 mg/L from initial concentrations of 100 μg/L, 1–8 mg/L and 0.5–5.0 mg/L, respectively, with a reduced cost.</jats:p>",

The approach presented can be replicated using LiDAR data, and the infrared spectrum of National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery. GIS surface maps are analyzed in combination with local utility consumption data to determine potential reductions in potable water consumption for households. The results indicate an extensive urban catchment of rooftop surfaces, and commensurate potential for rainwater harvesting and stormwater attenuation. Sixty two percent of the households analyzed consumed less water than could be potentially harvested. The remaining 38% consumed more water than could be potentially harvested. There are noted and significant differences between the two sample populations, including differences in water consumed and roof size. A comparison of lot size between the two sample populations did not yield any significant difference. The conclusions indicate that the widespread implementation of rainwater harvesting could substantially reduce potable water use in urban areas, and are of use to policy makers, planners, engineers and property owners everywhere.</jats:p>",

This model investigates the standard policy of fixed order quantity by considering the three major types of return-recovery pair such as commercial returns, end- of- use returns, end –of- life returns and their inventory positioning at multiple periods.  The model is configured as mixed integer linear programming and solved by IBM ILOG CPLEX OPL studio.Findings: To find the performance of the model a numerical example is considered for a product with three Parts (A which of 2nos, B and C) for 12 multiple periods. The results of the analysis show that the manufacturer can know how much should to be manufacture in multiple periods based on Variations of the demand by adopting the FOQ inventory policy at different sites considering its capacity constraints. In addition, it is important how much of parts should be purchased from the supplier at the given 12 periods.Originality/value: A sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the proposed model two parts. First part of the analysis will focus on the inventory of product and parts and second part of analysis focus on profit of the company.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last decade, global competition has forced manufacturers to optimize logistics. The implementation of collapsible containers provides a new perspective for logistics cost savings, since using collapsible containers reduces the frequency of shipping freight. However, optimization of logistic cost is complicated due to the interactions in a system, such as market demand, inventory, production throughput, and uncertainty. Therefore, a systematic model and accurate estimation of the total cost and system performance are of great importance for decision making. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to describe deterministic and stochastic scenarios for a closed-loop container dynamic flow system. The uncertainties in a factory and a supplier are considered in the model. The performance evaluation of the collapsible container system and total cost estimation are provided through model analysis. Furthermore, fuzzy control method is proposed to monitor the processing rate of the supplier and the factory and to adjust the rate of the supplier operation then further reduce the logistic cost. A case study with a matlab simulation is presented to illustrate the accuracy of the mathematical model and the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We consider the problem of sharing demand information in two competing supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. Information sharing allows a manufacturer’s wholesale price to respond to demand signal, which benefits the supply chain if the manufacturer is efficient in cost reduction and hurts it otherwise. It also allows a manufacturer’s cost reduction level to respond to demand signal, which always benefits the supply chain. A supply chain that engages in information sharing triggers a reaction from the rival chain. Such a reaction may benefit or hurt the first supply chain, depending on whether the retailers compete on quantity or price, and whether or not the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. With quantity competition, information sharing occurs when the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when either information is less accurate or competition is less intense. With price competition, information sharing occurs when either competition is intense or the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when information is more accurate. When information sharing is beneficial to a supply chain, a manufacturer can buy information from a retailer with a side payment, which is zero if the manufacturer is sufficiently efficient in cost reduction.</jats:p><jats:p>The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2016.0607 .</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the Taguchi experimental design with orthogonal array L27 (313) was applied to analyze the effects of selected parameters, namely initial nitrate concentration, inlet flow rate, current density and initial pH. According to the analysis of variance results, the inlet flow rate and the current density were recognized to be the most effective factors playing a pivotal role in nitrate removal efficiency by using an EC process. The optimum conditions of initial nitrate concentration, inlet flow rate, current density and initial pH were found to be 100 mg/L, 50 mL/min, 80 A/m2 and 8, respectively. As a result, the observed nitrate removal efficiency under these conditions was 61.70%. In addition, operating costs were evaluated as 1.278 US$/g NO3-removed. Finally, a high correlation was observed between the experimental and predicted results indicating an appropriate accuracy of the Taguchi model for nitrate removal efficiency and its operating costs in an EC system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rural community water supplies often require the construction of a village water tower. Safe tower design requires careful planning and properly selected materials. In remote villages, transport of concrete or steel materials is cost prohibitive, and locally sourced construction materials are required. This paper presents a case study of a remote Ecuadorian village in the Amazon which used locally available hardwood (referred to locally as “Ecuadorian ironwood”) for water tower construction in conjunction with a local aid-organization. Typical samples of the wood were obtained and important structural properties measured. Wood identification was attempted, but matching mechanical properties and optical microscopy imaging to known woods was inconclusive. Using international building codes, an existing tower design was evaluated for principal failure modes. Because the tower was originally designed without verifying the material’s mechanical properties, the tower was found to be far overdesigned. By considering water flow requirements for various village sizes, this paper shows how the overall tower height, material thickness, and overall material quantity can be reduced while still maintaining adequate factors of safety. By reducing the amount of required material, villager effort and time are significantly reduced in harvesting the required wood from the forest. The measurement and design process in this paper could be replicated for other rural development projects which rely on locally available, but possibly imperfectly characterized, materials for engineering projects.</jats:p>"

This integrated 3D spillway model allows for complicated topographic and geomorphic conditions and describes the spatial distribution of the spillway dam (upstream reservoir, downstream river channel and the spillway dam itself) precisely, thus making it a real alternative to the physical model. Furthermore, this model provides the premise and possibility of a full-scale simulation of the spillway flow, that is, it can not only be used to study the hydraulics on the spillway face, but also can be used to study the hydraulics along the downstream river channel and estimate the scour problem associated with both the spillway flow and downstream river channel. In this model, turbulence was simulated using RNG k−ɛ equations. The flow velocity and surface pressure from the numerical model were verified by the data from experiments. Moreover, the river flow was studied and flow velocities downstream were obtained. The scour formed downstream of a ski-jump was also studied in this study on the location and shape of a scour hole. In all, this study provides new approaches for solving relevant hydraulic engineering problems.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to provide an understanding of how nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) could be improved by strategic N application. Experiments with seven N application timings and two N rates were conducted at two sites over two seasons to evaluate the effects of strategic N supply on N uptake, canopy development, and yield components. Delaying the application of N fertilizer initially produced a thinner, more open crop canopy, compared with application of N at sowing, as indicated by significantly lower light interception (LI) (68 vs. 80%), which was associated with reduced shoot mortality (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = –0.71) and increased harvest index (HI) (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.71–0.96). Nitrogen applied only at sowing had higher preanthesis N uptake (96.6 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> vs. 78.1 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), but did not result in more grain N at harvest. A smaller canopy, resulting from lower initial N supply, was able to respond to late N application, potentially through retaining more soil water at anthesis (80 mm vs. 69 mm at 0–60‐cm depth). The results provide evidence that in rainfed wheat production systems, early season N application is an inefficient strategy to convert biomass and N into grain. Manipulating canopy development through N management can alter canopy size and water use patterns, to improve NUE and reduce risk in dry seasons.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Uncertainty in estimating product demand in the premarkets and spare parts demands in the after-sales markets and qualified outputs of production facilities throughout these two chains are considered in this problem. Stochastic qualified outputs of these facilities are due to their imperfect productions systems. We show that uncertainties propagate and qualified flow depreciates by moving material, components, and products from upstream to the downstream of these supply chains, and these phenomena should be quantified to determine the service levels of this company in the pre- and after-sales markets. At the end, we propose a mathematical model determining the best marketing strategies for this company (i.e., price, warranty length, and service levels) in the markets and their preserving reliable flow dynamics throughout the chains’ networks. Finally, the model is tested on a test problem defined in engine industry and some managerial insights are provided by analyzing the results.</jats:p>",

A case study on the UK automotive industry is used and the data do perform this study is collected from the sustainability reports of the UK’ automotive companies.Findings and Originality/value: The proposed framework represents an important benchmarking tool, offering managers the possibility for assessing the sustainability behaviour of its supply chain and compare it with other supply chains. Once identified the dimension of sustainability where the company or the supply chain is worst performer managers can work closer to their supply chain’ partners in order to improve the performance of those dimension of sustainability.Research limitations/implications: One limitation of the suggested approach is related to the ambiguity of the sustainability’ indicators selection and the definition of weights for each sustainability dimension.Practical implications: The assessment of the SC sustainability by using the suggested framework to compute a SC sustainability index offers managers an opportunity for assessing the level of sustainability of each individual company and the corresponding SC in a very easy way. It also represents an opportunity for improving company performance. In this way managers can use the information on the sustainability index to help adjust their company's behaviour and improve their economic, social and environmental performance.Originality/value: The proposed framework represents a contribution in the area of index construction and a valuable component of organizational management systems and monitoring programs.</jats:p>"

Today as one of the fastest growing cities in the world, Bengaluru is unusual in the fact that it is an old city, located at a distance from perennial sources of fresh water. While in the precolonial past, it depended upon an interconnected system of rainwater harvesting via lakes and wells, today it relies on water that is pumped from a river at a distance of over a hundred kilometres.This paper traces the evolution of Bengaluru’s water supply infrastructure from the precolonial past into the present day. We posit that the shift of the city’s dependence on water from local to distant sources, with the advent of technology and the introduction of centralized piped water, has weakened local residents’ and policy makers’ awareness of the importance of conservation of local ecosystems. The resulting degradation and conversion of the city’s water bodies has reduced the resilience of Bengaluru to flooding and drought, especially affecting the poorest and most vulnerable of its residents. The disruption of the links between water and other forms of commons, including grazing lands, fishing areas and wooded groves, has further fragmented the once-organic connection between the city and its ecosystems, with widespread construction on wetlands leading to flooding and water scarcity in different seasons.  In an era of increasing climate change, cities in semi-arid environments such as Bengaluru will be hit by problems of water scarcity. We stress the need to develop an integrated perspective that considers the importance of local ecosystems as commons for increased urban resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Metagenomics has revealed hundreds of species in almost all microbiota. In a few well-studied cases, microbial communities have been observed to coordinate their metabolic fluxes. In principle, microbes can divide tasks to reap the benefits of specialization, as in human economies. However, the benefits and stability of an economy of microbial specialists are far from obvious. Here, we physically model the population dynamics of microbes that compete for steadily supplied resources. Importantly, we explicitly model the metabolic fluxes yielding cellular biomass production under the constraint of a limited enzyme budget. We find that population dynamics generally leads to the coexistence of different metabolic types. We establish that these microbial consortia act as cartels, whereby population dynamics pins down resource concentrations at values for which no other strategy can invade. Finally, we propose that at steady supply, cartels of competing strategies automatically yield maximum biomass, thereby achieving a collective optimum.</jats:p>"

A series of laboratory-scale chamber tests was conducted for artificial urban runoff synthesized with non-point source pollutants collected from a real road in Seoul, Korea. In addition, an analytical filtration model for estimating removal of non-point source pollutants was adopted considering the clogging characteristics. To evaluate the performance of three types of sand filter layers with different grain size characteristics, the pollutant concentration was measured in terms of total suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand. The lumped parameter (θ) related to the clogging property was estimated by comparing the accumulated weight of pollutant particles obtained from the laboratory chamber experiments and the theoretical estimation from the analytical filtration model. Based on the experimental study and theoretical consideration, a double-sand-filter layer consisting of two separate layers is proposed as the optimum system for removing non-point source pollutants in the pilot-scale rainwater reservoir.</jats:p>",

Their role in maintaining the hydrological regime of watersheds is still a controversial issue. Consequently, we use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate scenarios of land use in a watershed. In one of these scenarios we identified, through GIS techniques, Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) which have been undergoing watershed degradation and we considered these areas as protected by forest cover. This scenario was then compared to the current usage scenario regarding watershed sediment yield and hydrological regime. The results showed a reduction in sediment yield of 54 % among different scenarios, whereas watershed water yield was reduced by 19.3 %.\n                        </jats:p>"

In this study, evaluation of performance of a recently installed PAT system in Antalya City, Turkey, is presented for the first operational period of approximately 5 months. This full-scale PAT system was implemented in a parallel pipeline with a pressure reducing valve. The operation of the installed PAT system was continuously monitored online for flow rate, power and pressure. The installed PAT system, being in operation since 26 January 2016, works efficiently in a wide range of inflows (130–300 m3/h) and the produced energy varies between 0.7 and 8.4 kWh for a reduction of approximately one bar pressure head with an average efficiency of 60%. Based on the initial 5 months of operational data, environmental benefits of green energy production, reduction in physical water losses and carbon dioxide emissions were evaluated. Based on the implementation cost of the PAT system and the revenues from the environmental benefits, payback period of this specific full-scale PAT application was computed as 53 days or 1.8 months.</jats:p>",

This taxonomy aims to predict firms’ performance with regard to the frequency of supply chain disruption.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A cluster analysis of survey data from 908 firms representing 69 countries together with an analysis of variance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The authors’ analysis demonstrates a clear structure of four different patterns of how companies manage supply chain risks: passive, internal, collaborative, and integral. The authors found that firms pursuing an inter-organizational orientation (collaborative and integral) face the lowest levels of supply chain disruption. On the contrary, strategies which simply concentrate on having greater control of internal operations are not vigorous enough to stop the cascade effect of a disruption at the supply chain level. Furthermore, the excellent performance of integral SCRM strategies also suggests that collaboration between buyers and suppliers ensures the efficacy of internal business continuity plans and security procedures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Managers should play an active role in making sure that supply chain management and risk management disciplines evolve together. Obviously, when an exogenous event results in a supply chain disruption, a firm will try to put its operations under control through internal capabilities. But SCRM strategies designed proactively in advance with relevant partners are even more beneficial.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>First, previous studies have limited the analysis of SCRM mainly to its reactive internal initiatives within a firm. This paper takes the SCRM literature beyond the internal focus by considering both internal and inter-organizational efforts and, more importantly, developing a single configurational model to analyze modes of interaction. Second, there is little empirical evidence showing the current situation of SCRM. Research in SCRM has been more qualitative than empirical, especially in global coverage. The research tackles this gap and, based on a broader scope of the samples the empirical findings show a higher level of generalizability.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In total 309 valid replies were obtained on a five point Likert scale ranging from unimportant to most vital. Statistical analysis was used to create the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Factor analysis identified five factors of SCM practices in context of FS Practices. Further, descriptive statistics was used to find their importance in Indian gas context. Present work would help practitioners and Indian gas managers for understanding the importance of these variables and their role in SCM practices in relations of FS practices.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the oxidation kinetics of Fe2+ and Mn2+ in the presence of FA and ferric hydroxide are discussed and then the contribution of the oxidation step in membrane experiments is determined. All experiments are conducted with synthetic drinking water and the concentration of contaminants is determined by characterization of two different drinking water sources in the city of Istanbul: Ömerli Dam Lake and Danamandıra Village groundwater. The addition of ferric hydroxide helps to mitigate fouling and enhances the rejection of Mn2+ by up to 90% by developing a secondary filtration layer on the membrane surface which has been considered a challenge in drinking water treatment plants.</jats:p>",

In this direction, this paper applies a simulation model derived from a real world scenario to analyze the performance of the collaboration between condition-based maintenance – also known as intelligent maintenance systems – and spare parts supply chains, in comparison with existing maintenance approaches.

Data were collected through an electronic mail survey from buyer firms in the manufacturing industry in Korea. With 241 complete and usable responses, we used structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Our findings revealed that the majority of our hypotheses were supported, which is in line with the existing literature. However, the impact of coercive pressure on top management support and the impact of structural social capital on performance were found to be insignificant. The major contribution of our study is that it broadens the framework of green supply chain management (GSCM) by integrating major and recent constructs in the GSCM theory, while also providing instructive managerial implications through empirical evidence.</jats:p>"

This paper performs a literature review on an academic basis in order to identify the main subjects and sustainable dimensions of research studies involving the performance measurement of GSCM and the gaps for further research. Sixty three percent of the analyzed papers are associated with framework, mathematical modelling, empirical research and application, and the principal gaps to be explored are the metrics, measures and integration of the GSCM with existing quality methods. Almost all of these subjects are discussed in an economic and environmental dimension, remaining the social dimension a relevant gap to be explored. Based on this scenario, this paper intends to make a contribution to the academia and professionals of the area. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are still residents without access to electricity in some remote and less developed areas of China, which lead to low living standards and hinder sustainable development for these residents. In order to achieve the strategic targets of solving China’s energy poverty, realizing basic energy service equalization, and comprehensively building up a moderately prosperous society, several policies have been successively promulgated in recent years, which aim to solve the electricity access issue for residents living in remote and less developed areas. It is of great importance to determine the most economical mode of power supply in remote and less developed areas, which directly affects the economic efficiency of public investment projects. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to select the most economical power supply mode for rural electrification in China. Firstly, the primary modes to supply electricity for residents living in the remote and less developed areas are discussed, which include power grid extension mode and micro-grid mode. Secondly, based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) technique, the life cycle economic cost accounting model for different power supply modes are built. Finally, taking a minority nationality village in Yunnan province as an example, the empirical analysis is performed, and the LCOEs of various possible modes for rural electrification are accounted. The results show that the photovoltaic (PV)-based independent micro-grid system is the most economical due to the minimum LCOE, namely 0.658 RMB/kWh. However, other power supply modes have much higher LCOEs. The LCOEs of power grid extension model, wind-based independent micro-grid system and biomass-based independent micro-grid system are 1.078 RMB/kWh, 0.704 RMB/kWh and 0.885 RMB/kWh, respectively. The proposed approach is effective and practical, which can provide reference for rural electrification in China.</jats:p>"

To solve random and incomplete problems using a traditional evaluation index system, a novel model for evaluating regional agricultural water resources using a resilience index system was proposed. In addition, a new method for an evaluation index system and the filtering of key indicators were investigated. Based on the structural characteristics of a regional agricultural water resource system (AWRS), the model for an evaluation index system was built by constructing a hierarchical indicator architecture using a hierarchical framework model. The index weight was calculated using criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC). Then, index completeness was ensured using principal component analysis, and the reliability of the results was tested using the analytic hierarchy process. The model was applied to the Jiansanjiang Administration of Agricultural Reclamation in Heilongjiang, China. The main results included the following: (1) the index was optimized from 46 to 32, which identified the key indicators that affect the resilience of the Jiansanjiang Administration AWRS, and (2) an evaluation index system was constructed with a completeness of 85.6%. The results of this study provide an important and practical model for studying the resilience of related resources and environmental fields.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to develop a longitudinal study on how a water resources development megaproject was reported by the world newspapers during its whole life cycle. The development of the Three Gorges Dam project in China (1982–2015) was taken as an example. Newspaper perspectives on eight evaluation themes: time, cost, quality, risk, benefit, social impact, environmental impact, and organization management were extracted from eight newspapers in the UK, the USA, Australia, and Singapore using a content analysis approach. The results show that the media coverage mainly appeared in the construction phase, with peak reporting times occurring in transition periods. Social and environmental aspects were the main concerns of the eight selected newspapers. The tone of the news coverage on the Three Gorges Dam was generally negative. These findings implied that media communications provide valuable insights into the social and environmental complexities of megaprojects in river basin development.</jats:p>",

The system utilised in-line electrochlorination to oxidise water constituents without the need for external chemical supply. The oxidised arsenic and iron co-precipitated and were filtered via Greensand Plus™. The filter was catalytically active and provided an emergency oxidant. The system had only a few maintenance requirements due to online water quality monitoring. The contaminant removal during the field test in Costa Rica was impaired by strong fluctuations in water quality including low iron concentrations. However, the system removed on average 68% of the arsenic. Mean values of arsenic were 40 ± 23 μg/L in groundwater and 13 ± 6 μg/L in treated water. Iron was removed from an average of 2.8 ± 2.4 mg/L to 0.2 ± 0.2 mg/L (93% removal). Free chlorine produced and available in the treated water tank had a mean concentration of 1.25 mg/L and 0.64 mg/L, respectively.</jats:p>",

By measuring leaflet area (LA), MVD, SD, and SV, we demonstrated the significance of this functional trait in <jats:italic>Arachis hypogaea</jats:italic> (peanut) grown under different light regimes and in sun leaves of <jats:italic>Dalbergia odorifera</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Desmodium renifolium</jats:italic>.

Sun leaves of <jats:italic>D. odorifera</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>D. renifolium</jats:italic> also had stable SV along the leaflet node, with a positive correlation between MVD and SD. We conclude that under a certain light regime, a stable SV similar to the positive correlation between MVD and SD can also indicate the coordination between leaf water supply and demand.

The decisions to be simultaneously optimized include DC locations and inventory levels, which set of DCs serves each retailer, and the amount of shipments from DCs to retailers. We propose a nonlinear mixed integer programming model with a joint chance constraint describing a certain service level. Two approaches—set-wise approximation and linear decision rule-based approximation—are constructed to robustly approximate the service level chance constraint with incomplete demand information. Both approaches yield sparse multisourcing distribution networks that effectively match uncertain demand using on-hand inventory, and hence successfully reach a high service level. We show through extensive numerical experiments that our approaches outperform other commonly adopted approximations of the chance constraint. </jats:p>",

The determination of whether and how much compensation to provide to the participants is challenging. Institutional review boards typically allow researchers to provide a compensation that reimburses participants for their time and effort but is not so large as to be coercive. Using a randomized controlled trial, we estimate parents’ responsiveness to financial compensation in terms of their willingness to provide their child’s blood sample. We find that an additional dollar of compensation raises the willingness to provide a child’s blood sample by about 0.5 percentage point at a base of 65%. This corresponds to an elasticity of .33. Using the findings, we provide general guidance on how compensation can be structured to strike a balance between appropriate compensation for participation and coercion. </jats:p>",

In this study, a new integrated approach is proposed to address designing a multi-product, multi-period supply chain network with reverse logistics. The framework of the proposed approach includes green supplier evaluation and a mathematical model in an uncertain environment. To the best of our knowledge, integration of green supplier evaluation into the designing supply chain network with reverse logistics has not been considered in the literature. This integration can help to incorporate experts’ opinions about environmental impact of suppliers in the network design. Minimization of total cost and maximization of total greenness score of purchased raw materials/components are two objectives of the model. The fuzzy EDAS method is used to determine the greenness scores of suppliers. Also, demand of customers and capacity of suppliers are defined using fuzzy numbers and a fuzzy method is used to obtain trade-off solutions. The proposed approach is applied to designing the supply chain network of a home appliance company. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient to obtain solutions to design the supply chain network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys on glaciers are generally restricted to a single pair of bistatic dipole antennas orientated either parallel or perpendicular to the surveying direction. Extensive helicopter-borne and ground-based GPR investigations on the Glacier d’Otemma, Switzerland, demonstrated that the detectability of the ice-bedrock interface varies substantially with dipole orientation. We recorded several across and along profiles using two different commercial GPR systems operated with 15, 25, 50, and 70 MHz antennas. Dipole alignments parallel to the glacier flow generated considerably stronger and more coherent bedrock reflections compared with a perpendicular dipole setup. We observed the behavior for all the systems and antenna frequencies that we used. To help explain these findings, we performed 3D numerical modeling using the open source software gprMax. Simulations with 20 MHz transmitting and receiving dipoles indicated that the changes of the bedrock reflection amplitude are primarily governed by the bedrock topography. Scattering and intrinsic attenuation may also influence the amplitudes of the bedrock reflections, but these effects seem to be much less pronounced. Evidently, to increase the GPR bedrock reflection quality, dipole antennas should be orientated parallel to the glacier flow direction on a glacier confined to a valley. Because the directional dependence is a first-order effect, it is advisable to perform multicomponent surveys when the general shape of the bedrock topography is unknown. The multicomponent setup preferably consists of two sets of dipole antennas, each in broadside configuration and the sets being orthogonal to each other. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a stochastic multi-objective chance-constrained programming model (SMOCCP) was developed for tackling the water supply management problem. Two objectives were included in this model, which are the minimization of leakage loss amounts and total system cost, respectively. The traditional SCCP model required the random variables to be expressed in the normal distributions, although their statistical characteristics were suitably reflected by other forms. The SMOCCP model allows the random variables to be expressed in log-normal distributions, rather than general normal form. Possible solution deviation caused by irrational parameter assumption was avoided and the feasibility and accuracy of generated solutions were ensured. The water supply system in the Xiaoqing River watershed was used as a study case for demonstration. Under the context of various weight combinations and probabilistic levels, many types of solutions are obtained, which are expressed as a series of transferred amounts from water sources to treated plants, from treated plants to reservoirs, as well as from reservoirs to tributaries. It is concluded that the SMOCCP model could reflect the sketch of the studied region and generate desired water supply schemes under complex uncertainties. The successful application of the proposed model is expected to be a good example for water resource management in other watersheds.</jats:p>"

We propose that different delivery performance dimensions (on‐time delivery rate, early delivery inaccuracy, late delivery inaccuracy, and delivery speed) have varying impacts on future customer transaction quantities and unit prices. We further explore the effect of customer types on the proposed relationships. Trade customers (resellers) and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers generally have different operational needs for deliveries and therefore may value these metrics differently. Using instrumental variable regression, we analyze a proprietary transaction‐level dataset. The information was compiled by a Fortune 500 manufacturer from its Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control product supply chain, consisting of the manufacturer and its customers. The results indicate that measures of delivery performance affect customer transaction quantity and unit price differently. Furthermore, these impacts can differ significantly between trade customers and OEM customers. These findings provide fine‐grained insights about tuning delivery capabilities to increase sales volume or boost price. </jats:p>",

Because air pollution diffuses freely, it is necessary to distribute the responsibility for pollution with a common and differentiated rule. Based on a multiregional input-output model, this article calculated the PM2.5 emissions embodied in provincial trade (EEPT) of China’s 30 provinces in 2007 and 2010. The results show that the PM2.5 EEPT accounts for almost one-third of the production-based PM2.5 emissions of China. The economic crisis lowered the EEPT, while the ratio between the EEPT and production-based PM2.5 emissions has increased. The EEPT values of the eastern provinces are mainly due to the EEPT embodied in final consumption, while the EEPT values of the central, northeastern, and the western provinces are due to the EEPT embodied in the intermediate input. We also analyzed different compositions of EEPT, such as fixed capital formation and consumption. The emissions embodied in provincial imports are mainly due to fixed capital formation. Due to the policies of the West Development, the Rising of Central China, and Promoting the Old Industrial Base in the Northeast, the central government increased the investment to these areas. The ratios of the EEPT embodied in the fixed capital formation to the total EEPT of the central (0.64), northeastern (0.69), and the western provinces (0.65) are higher than that of the eastern provinces (0.62). This indicates that the government need to establish different policies to control the effects of EEPT. In addition to the challenges of regional collaboration, environmental damage and the EEPT should be taken into account. The importers in the collaboration should consider providing compensation to the exporters in the collaboration.</jats:p>"

A study was conducted in the Toba Tek Singh district, Punjab, Pakistan, to investigate aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology to recharge groundwater. The facility was developed by drilling a pumping/injection well and constructing the water storage tank along with developing the recharge mechanism. Three treatments of 51, 71, and 99 m3 of treated canal water were injected into the aquifer under gravity and were retained for 7 days. Another three treatments of 100 m3 each were injected for retention times of 14, 28, and 56 days. The recovery efficiency (RE) was found to be 83, 91, and 98% for injected volumes of 51, 71, and 99 m3, respectively, for retention time of 7 days. Similarly, the RE for an injected volume of 100 m3 was found to be 73, 62, and 52% for retention times of 14, 28, and 56 days, respectively. These results indicated that RE improved with increase in injected volume and decreased with increase in retention time; however, the technology was found to have potential for storing and recovering of water injected into the aquifer.</jats:p>",

In recent years, many areas have become vulnerable to the impact of extreme climate events. The impact of these events on water supplies has become more pronounced. This study states that there is a tangible impact of extreme climate events upon both water resources quality and water supplies. The Nile river water turbidity was investigated as an operational indicator for the water treatment plants (WTPs). The results illustrated that an unprecedented increase in average turbidity of raw water in Upper Egypt (from 4 up to 110 NTU) led to a cut in water supplies for up to 100 hours in some areas. While in Alexandria the turbidity did affect WTP operation efficiency, safe water could still be produced. Cuts in water supply would have an impact on hygiene and make people prone to use unsafe water sources. These consequences stimulate water supply bodies to develop action plans to mitigate and/or avoid such potential impacts on public health. This study suggests proposed steps to develop an appropriate plan to face such extreme events.</jats:p>",

PICS bags are hermetic grain storage bags that are leading a revolution in the post-harvest handling of grain on smallholder farmers in Africa. The bags have been very popular with farmers, but the major challenge has been developing supply chains to make those bags available for purchase at the village level. This article: (1) describes the PICS supply chain in West and Central Africa; (2) identifies constraints (i.e. financial, structural, social) that impede the development of the PICS supply chain; and (3) analyzes strategies used by businesses to expand distribution channels and increase bag sales.</jats:p>",

Focusing on a case study of the 2015 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> Modern Slavery Act and 2010 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> Bribery Act, we analyse two distinct legislative approaches that policy makers have used to promote corporate accountability within global supply chains and explore the varied impacts that these approaches have on corporate behaviour. Empirically, we analyse codes of conduct, annual <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CSR</jats:styled-content> reports, and supplier terms and conditions for 25 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FTSE</jats:styled-content> 100 companies to shed light into the impact of the legislation on corporate behaviour. We find that legislation that creates criminal corporate liability appears to spur deeper changes to corporate strategy, and argue that in the case of the Modern Slavery Act, the triumph of voluntary reporting over more stringent public labour standards seems to have undermined the effectiveness of recent governance initiatives to address forced labour in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Among the range of determinants of post‐fledging survival in altricial birds, the energy supply to the growing juveniles is likely to play a central role. However, the exact mechanisms shaping post‐fledging survival are poorly understood. Using a food supplementation experiment, we determined the effect of variation in food supply on the survival of juvenile Little Owls <jats:italic>Athene noctua</jats:italic> from hatching to 2 months post‐fledging. Experimental broods were food‐supplemented for 36 days during the nestling and the early post‐fledging period. The fate of 307 juveniles (95 of them provided with extra food) was determined by nest monitoring and radiotelemetry. In unsupplemented birds, the rates of survival measured at 5‐day intervals were lowest during the nestling stage, remained low during the early post‐fledging stage and steadily increased after about 2 weeks post‐fledging. Food supplementation substantially increased nestling survival, but we detected no direct treatment effect on post‐fledging survival. Instead, we found a strong indirect effect of food supplementation, in that fledglings of good physical condition had markedly higher chances of surviving the post‐fledging period compared with those in poor condition. Experimental food supplementation increased survival over the first 3 months from 45% to 64.6%. This suggests that energy reserves built up during the nestling stage influence post‐fledging survival and ultimately parental reproductive output. The low nestling and post‐fledging survival shows that the early life‐history stages constitute a crucial bottleneck of reproductive ecology in Little Owls. The strong treatment effects on the number of independent offspring indicate that natural variation in food supply is an important determinant of spatio‐temporal patterns in Little Owl demography.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: From the public health point of view, the microbiological properties of domestic water supply are the most important parameters of domestic water supply because of the propensity for microbial water-related diseases. In Enugu State, statistics have shown that reported cases of waterborne diseases (including typhoid fever) have been on the increase since 2003. The aim of the study was to determine the bacteriological qualities of domestic water supply and prevalence of typhoid fever in five communities of Enugu State in connection with the rising incidence of typhoid fever in the state.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of sources of domestic water supply and prevalence of typhoid fever in five rural communities of Ezeagu Local Government Area. 297 copies of structured questionnaire, 10 grab water samples analysed using the membrane filtration method and 227 blood samples collected for Widal test were used to generate the data for the study, analysed as frequency distributions, t-test of means difference and Pearson product moment correlations using MaxStat (version 3.60) statistical software.Results: 2 (40%) of the 5 communities complied with the WHO standard for faecal coliform counts. Prevalence of typhoid fever was high in all the communities (71.4%-100%). Only faecal coliform counts correlated positively and strongly (r=0.69) with prevalence of typhoid fever.Conclusions: Since faecal coliform counts correlated positively and strongly (r=0.69) with prevalence of typhoid fever, improving the bacteriological qualities of domestic water supply may help to reduce the prevalence of typhoid fever. </jats:p>"

We classify the data into five periods: 2000-2001 as the pre-Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) period, 2002-2003 as the SOX period, 2004-2006 as the Auditing Standard 2 (AS2) period, 2007 as the AS5 period, and 2008-2010 as the Great Recession period. The shocks to the audit market associated with these changes in auditing regulations and the economic environment have differential impacts on large clients and small clients. The percentage of small clients using Big 4 auditors dropped significantly over these shocks, whereas the percentage of large clients using Big 4 auditors experienced a large drop only from the SOX period to the AS2 period. We find that Big 4 pricing increased significantly from the pre-SOX period to the SOX period and continued to increase significantly in the AS2 period. Big 4 pricing experienced a significant decline in the AS5 period and declined insignificantly in the Great Recession period. Big 4 small firm pricing decreased significantly in the AS2 period compared with the SOX period and in the Great Recession period compared with the AS5 period. We find that the Big 4 pricing for small clients is contingent on the nature of competition. The Big 4 charged small firms higher prices in the SOX period, AS5 period, and Great Recession period when competition was lower. Our paper provides a unique contribution as a comprehensive analysis of Big 4 pricing and Big 4 small firm pricing. </jats:p>",

A supply-side disruption in the United States cocaine market was associated with reduced hospital stays for 2 vulnerable populations: pregnant women and newborns.

We, therefore, designed a novel bioreactor enabling high‐level oxygen supply, and its relevant process parameters and fermentation‐stage characteristics were investigated. The real‐time changes of pH and nonoil biomass were monitored as proxies for the consumption of nitrogen and lipid accumulation status, which was first applied to divided fermentation process with three stages. The experimental results showed that the biomass in this porous‐membrane‐impeller bioreactor was higher than in conventional bioreactor, while docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) percentage in total lipids was lower than in conventional bioreactor. A multistage control strategy is subsequently implemented for the porous‐membrane‐impeller bioreactor, and the maximum biomass, DHA concentration, DHA percentage in biomass and DHA productivity reached 151.0 g/L, 44.3 g/L, 29.33%, 369.08 mg/(L·h), respectively. This study thus provides a highly efficient and economic bioreactor for the production of DHA by Schizochytrium sp. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 63: 4278–4286, 2017</jats:p>",

The energy provider with the renewable energy (RE) generation (wind power) determines the energy purchase from the electricity markets and the pricing strategy for consumers to maximize its profit, and then the consumers determine their energy demands to maximize their payoffs. The hierarchical game is established between the energy provider and the consumers. The energy provider is the leader and the consumers are the followers in the hierarchical game. We consider two types of consumers according to their response to the price, i.e., the price-taking consumers and the price-anticipating consumers. We derive the equilibrium point of the hierarchical game through the backward induction method. Comparing the two types of consumers, we study the influence of the types of consumers on the equilibrium point. In particular, the uncertainty of the energy supply from the energy provider is considered. Simulation results show that the energy provider can obtain more profit using the proposed decision-making scheme.</jats:p>"

A total of 97 liver metastasis patients treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization were enrolled in this study. The <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography images of liver metastasis patients were collected before and after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment. The efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the treatment of liver metastasis was evaluated according to the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine cut-off values of <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters (Tsuvmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmean) for predicting the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Progression-free survival and the incidence of postoperative complications were compared. Correlation of Tsuvmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmean with blood supply and lipiodol deposition in the lesion was analyzed. Among three <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters, the receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax with a cut-off value of 3.56 was the best predictor of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization efficacy. According to the cut-off value of Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, liver metastasis patients were divided into the Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax ≤ 3.56 and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax &gt; 3.56 groups. Compared with the Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax &gt; 3.56 group, the Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax ≤ 3.56 group showed a longer progression-free survival and a lower incidence of postoperative complications. The Tsuvmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmean in the lesion with abundant blood supply were significantly lower than those in peripheral liver parenchyma, while the Tsuvmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmean in the lesion with lack of blood supply were significantly higher than those in peripheral liver parenchyma. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that lipiodol deposition in the lesion was positively correlated with the Tsuvmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, and Tsuvmax/Lsuvmean. The Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax of <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography may be a good tool for predicting the blood supply and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for patients with liver metastasis. </jats:p>",
