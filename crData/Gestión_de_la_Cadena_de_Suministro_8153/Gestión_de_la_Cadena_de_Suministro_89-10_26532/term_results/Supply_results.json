The 1988-89 academic year survey was sent to educators from the 30 U.S. schools listed in the Petroleum Engineering and Technology Schools book published by SPE. Twenty-five of these schools offer degree programs in petroleum engineering and five offer options in petroleum engineering within another engineering degree program. Nineteen of the 30 schools, which accounts for about 86% of the U.S. enrollment responded to the survey.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The survey asks each school to report the number of graduates during the 1988-89 academic year at the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels. The number of non-citizens included in these graduates and the number seeking employment in the U.S. job market are also reported. For those graduates who have reported to their school that they have found employment, the type of employer is requested. The following six employer categories are used:</jats:p>",

Not all economists are supply‐siders in this sense, but many more are now than were during the 1970s. The reason for the switch is the evidence that has accumulated on the incentive effects of taxes. Many studies have shown that cuts in tax rates for the highest‐income taxpayers actually have increased the government's revenue. A key reason for this effect is not a large elasticity of labor supply but rather a large elasticity of tax avoidance with respect to tax rates. The most important policy implication of this evidence is that the government cannot increase its revenue substantially without taxing the non‐rich.</jats:p>",

Electricorp, a state‐owned enterprise whose actions will be subject to a standard of commercial efficiency, has been formed to take over these functions and to sell bulk power at wholesale to localized distribution entities–who then will resell it at retail. Electricorp will be unregulated but subject to antitrust jurisdiction, as will be the distribution entities. Neither Electricorp nor the distributors will have any protected monopoly status. Substantial possibilities exist for competition in both bulk power and retail power markets over the long run, and one has reason to be optimistic that antitrust can deal with the remaining monopoly issues. New Zealand's radical deregulation yields favorable inferences about the outcome of the somewhat slower deregulation of electricity in the United States.</jats:p>",

The subjects were investigated at rest in supine or lateral posture, in quadrupedal and then in bipedal posture, and during locomotion. Quadrupedalism in humans was with subjects on their hands and knees. Bipedalism in dogs was on hindlimbs with the forelimbs held by a technician. Blood flow in the main arteries of the body (aorta, external and internal carotid, subclavian, and femoral) was measured by sonography. Positional variations between the main bones of the body were determined from X‐rays. This study investigated the reallocation of blood supply to different regions of the body when it switches from quadrupedal to bipedal posture and locomotion. Compared with resting posture, the principal findings are 1) cardiac output shows a minimal increase for humans in bipedal stance and a noticeable increase for dogs as well as humans in quadrupedal stance; 2) quadrupedal stance in humans and dogs and bipedal stance in dogs require increased blood supply to the muscles of the neck, back, and limbs, while human bipedal stance requires none of these; 3) cerebral blood flow (internal carotid) in humans did not change as a result of bipedal posture or locomotion, but showed a noticeable drop in quadrupedal posture and an even further drop in quadrupedal locomotion. The conclusion is that erect posture and encephalization produced a noticeable readjustment and reallocation of blood flow among the different regions of the body: This consisted in shifting a large volume of blood supply from the musculature to the human brain.</jats:p>",

The application to Pennsylvania dairy operators indicates that output price risk measured by the second and third moments of individual operators’ historical output price series is not an important factor in production decision making. In addition to not maximizing expected utility, these operators are not expected profit maximizers.</jats:p>",

A peaking storage tank is used for storing water that is pumped from wells or other sources of supply during off‐peak periods when energy costs are less for use during periods of on‐peak water demand. The optimal size of a peaking storage tank is that which results in the minimum total cost, which includes both the storage construction cost and the cost of operation of the pumps. The operational cost for a given time‐of‐use rate is determined by help of a pipe network simulation model solved by the Newton‐Raphson technique and a dynamic programming optimization model. A more simplified method is also introduced. Analyses show that low off‐peak energy costs make the construction of peaking storage tanks economically attractive and reduce on‐peak energy use, which results in electrical load leveling.</jats:p>",
