The power plant consists of two gas turbines site rated at 15,500 hp, with 1900-hp helper steam turbines driving 3600-rpm generators. The waste-heat boilers used to recover heat from the gas turbine exhaust are equipped with duct burners for steam temperature control and feature two stages of economizer coils. This paper includes a description of the cycle and aspects relating to the initial operation of the equipment.</jats:p>",
