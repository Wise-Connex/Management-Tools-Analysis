Shows how supply chain management (SCM) moves on from neoclassical theories of the firm to a new paradigm for business where competition pits channel against channel, and where supply chain partners combine skills and resources which none of the participants would be able to achieve independently. Argues that a growing recognition of the competitive advantage that can be gained through improving co‐ordination in the supply chain is the starting point for SCM initiatives that are evolving in the fresh produce sector. Observes that the fruit and vegetable supply chain has traditionally been fragmented but the last decade has seen rapid structural change. Briefly analyses the results of a qualitative survey of several northern European markets, in context, to highlight the differing degrees of pipeline integration within each system.</jats:p>",

Focusing the activities on consumer, by constant monitoring and measuring the extent of satisfaction of each component of supply and by implementing the concept of total quality management (TQM) it is possible to achieve not only a good marketing position, but also the improvement of loyalty and satisfaction of all employed.</jats:p>",

In 1990, after 65 years of pumping at increasing rates from the crater, the gradient between the Laguna and the highly contaminated Lake Managua had potentially reversed, leading to a scenario where the Laguna was possibly drawing in contaminated ground water from Lake Managua and/or a highly contaminated aquifer below an industrial area located between the Laguna and Lake Managua. A drilling and sampling program undertaken between 1990 and 1992 found: (1) four synthetic organic chemicals in the Laguna (methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,3‐dichlorobenzene and 1,4‐dichlorobenzene), (2) numerous other synthetic organic chemicals near Laguna Asososca in the ground water below the industrial area, and (3) no evidence of Laguna Asososca drawing water from Lake Managua. It appears that the Laguna Asososca capture zone extended into the industrial area but not as far as Lake Managua. Ground‐water flow modeling of the regional ground‐water flow system was consistent with the field interpretation. Estimates of the relative mobilities of the synthetic organic chemicals indicated that the chemicals found in the water of Laguna Asososca likely represented the mobile leading edge of a contaminant plume emanating from the industrial area. The simplest and most effective solution to mitigate contamination of Laguna Asososca is to maintain its water level above that of Lake Managua by reducing its pumpage to about 50% of the 1990 rate.</jats:p>",

This flap was composed of a cranially based rectus abdominus muscle pedicle flap that was attached to the caudal superficial epigastric island skin flap (including mammary glands 2 to 5) via the pudendoepigastric trunk. Selective angiography of the cranial epigastric artery in eight cadaver dogs proved that the arterial vasculature in the cranial rectus abdominus was contiguous with that in the caudal superficial epigastric skin flap. In the live dog study, three of six of the flaps failed because of venous insufficiency. Necrosis of mammary gland 2 occurred in two of six flaps. One of six flaps survived with the exception of the cranial most aspect of mammary gland 2. Angiography of the cranial epigastric artery proved that arterial blood supply to these flaps was intact. Histological evaluation of the failed flaps showed full‐thickness necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the presence of severe congestion, and venous thrombosis. Retrograde venous blood flow through the flap was inconsistent, and hence resulted in failure of this myocutaneous flap. Use of this flap for clinical wound reconstruction cannot be recommended.</jats:p>",
