      "abstract": "<jats:p>The production of export crops or cash crops as they are called in developing countries is subject to various characteristics which affect supply and producer response relationships. For perennials such as cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and coffee which are produced in Nigeria, cultivation involves planting, gestation, removal, yield, replacement, rehabilitation, etc. For annuals such as cotton, groundnuts and soya beans exported from Nigeria, similar situations, excluding gestation and replacement problems, are involved. Models for estimating supply schedules and response must be complex and highly demanding in data in order to encompass these dimensions. The models developed in this study rest on the classical assumption of rational producers who respond positively to producer prices. Because of data limitations ordinary least squares (O.L.S.) regression is employed to develop three types of price elasticities of supply for six commodities ‐ cocoa, palm oil kernel, groundnut, rubber and cotton. The results confirm the response to depressing pricing policies of the Marketing Boards in Nigeria and suggest policy implications of price and production incentives as positive means of enhancing improved production response designed to rejuvenate Nigeria's export crop industry under economic development.</jats:p>",
