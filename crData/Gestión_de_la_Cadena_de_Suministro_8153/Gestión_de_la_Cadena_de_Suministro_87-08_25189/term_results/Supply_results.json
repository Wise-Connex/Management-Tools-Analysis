The implications for water supply management and responsibility are discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>Legionella organisms are present naturally in the environment in water and soil and, as opportunist respiratory pathogens which could occur indirectly in potable supplies, albeit in small numbers, they are of concern to water undertakings. They are a relatively uncommon cause of pneumonia, affecting mainly but not exclusively middle aged and elderly men, especially those with a history of recent travel. The organisms do not spread from one person to another but are acquired by inhalation of infected aerosols from environmental or man‐made water reservoirs. There is no evidence for transmission by ingestion. I n potable water Legionella organisms are therefore highly unlikely to constitute a direct hazard to health, and their presence does not mean that the supply is non‐potable or indeed unsatisfactory in bacteriological quality.</jats:p><jats:p>Warm temperatures, stagnation and the use of unsuitable fixtures and fittings can provide conditions suitable for growth and subsequent incorporation of the organisms in aerosols from taps, showers, and other outlets. Significant hazards, however, are more likely to occur from hot‐water services and from recirculating cooling towers and humidifiers associated with air conditioning installations in large and often recently constructed buildings.</jats:p><jats:p>Legionella organisms presumably must occur in sewage, but it is unlikely that subsequent environmental conditions would favour significant growth though little is known about this or their possible role in animal diseases or in agricultural practice. Their occurrence in water and sewage treatment works is highly unlikely to present any real hazard to workers. The main impact of these organisms for the future is likely to be in the design and engineering aspects of large buildings and their water‐related services.</jats:p>",

The cranial mesenteric artery and vein supplied the jejunum and ileum, and their major branches were present in all specimens and supplied similar regions of the intestinal tract. Proximal branches of the cranial mesenteric artery were pancreatic arteries, caudal pancreaticoduodenal artery, middle colic artery, and ileocolic artery. A large collateral branch arose from the proximal segment of the cranial mesenteric artery, anastomosing with the continuation of the cranial mesenteric artery distally along the jejunum. Jejunal arteries arose from the continuation of the cranial mesenteric artery, forming a series of anastomosing arches. Straight vessels arising from these arches did not branch or anastomose before entering the serosal layer of the intestine. The proximal part of the ileum was supplied by branches from the continuation of the cranial mesenteric artery; these branches anastomosed with the mesenteric ileal (ilei mesenterialis) artery, a branch of the ileocolic artery. The venous supply paralleled the arterial supply in all specimens.</jats:p>",

After hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 25°C, the patients were rewarmed to a nasopharyngeal temperature of at least 38°C, resulting in a rectal temperature of about 34°C before termination of CPB. Twelve patients, forming the control group, were given no other external heat supply. In another group (n = 12), the “radiant heat supply group”, additional external heat was provided postoperatively, the main source of which was a thermal ceiling supplemented with heated, humidified respiratory gases. In this latter group the postoperative rewarming was accomplished earlier and was converted into a mainly passive process. Shivering, oxygen uptake, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> production and ventilation volumes were significantly reduced compared with the control group. Cardiac index and stroke index were higher and systemic oxygen extraction was lower in the radiant heat supply group.

The behavior of the system is analyzed under alternative assumptions about the time frame of analysis and the extent of the flexibility of interest rates. It is argued that links may exist between regional real and financial sectors even in the short run and that such links must, through the regional balance of payments, exist in the long run, even where there is perfect financial spatial integration. It is observed that these relationships have generally been ignored by regional economic model builders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study compared oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic and contralateral cortex of middle cerebral artery (MCA)-occluded feline brain using a microspectrophotometric technique. This technique was further validated in several experiments. A transorbital approach exposed the right MCA. After preocclusion blood pressure, heart rate, and blood gas values were determined, radioactively labeled microspheres (15 +/- 3 microns diam) were injected intra-atrially. The right MCA was then occluded. These same measurements were taken 1 h later. Arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined in the center and surrounding area of the occluded ischemic cortex and other brain regions. Regional cerebral oxygen consumption was determined as the product of CBF and oxygen extraction. CBF decreased significantly from 54.0 +/- 5.0 to 26.6 +/- 4.8 (mean +/- SE) ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 in the center of the ischemic cortex and from 49.6 +/- 7.0 to 30.6 +/- 5.0 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 in the surrounding ischemic cortex. Oxygen extraction was significantly increased from 3.7 +/- 0.4 ml O2/100 ml blood to 4.6 +/- 0.6 ml O2/100 ml blood in the center of the occluded cortex but was not significantly altered in the surrounding moderately ischemic cortex. Oxygen consumption was not significantly altered in either ischemic cortical region when compared with the contralateral cortices. Unilateral MCA occlusion caused a decreased regional CBF associated with increased brain oxygen extraction in the cortical region directly supplied by the MCA. The feline brain appears to maintain oxygen consumption in the occluded cortex by increasing oxygen extraction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Twenty‐four patients with stable angina pectoris were studied after aortocoronary bypass surgery with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Twelve patients (radiant heat supply group) were rewarmed during CPB to a nasopharyngeal temperature of at least 38°C and a mean rectal temperature of 34.4°C. Postoperatively they received radiant heat supply from a thermal ceiling. In addition, a heating water mattress was used during the end of the operation and heated, humidified inspired gases were administered intra‐ and postoperatively. The other 12 patients (combination heat supply group) had the rewarming during CPB extended until the rectal temperature exceeded 36°C, but otherwise received the same treatment as the radiant heat supply group. The combination of extended rewarming during CPB and postoperative radiant heat supply significantly reduced oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production and the required ventilation volumes during early recovery as compared with the values in the radiant heat supply group. The reduced metabolic demands were accompanied by lower cardiac index and oxygen delivery, which, however, were sufficient for adequate tissue perfusion as judged by the similarity in oxygen extraction and arterial base excess values in the two groups. The metabolic demands and ventilatory requirements were reduced to a level at which safe early extubation is possible.</jats:p>",
