      "abstract": "<jats:p>A major assumption in the supply chain management literature is that there is an economic rationale to the integration of processes across firm boundaries. In essence, it is assumed that there is a benefit in adapting and coordinating the activities carried out in sequence by the actors in the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to further develop and evaluate this fundamental assumption. Based on a theoretical framework regarding interdependencies and the analysis of five different supply chains, it is proposed that there are theoretical as well as empirical reasons for enhancing the underlying logic of process integration in supply chain management to capture pooled and reciprocal interdependencies. It is argued, that by enhancing the logic, one might better understand how managers prioritize their firms' strategic actions and therefore also actual organizational behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the commencement of the major developments on the North West Shelf, the offshore resource industry, during both its construction and operational phases, has faced considerable logistical impediments to cost-effective solutions for the offshore supply chain. These impediments have included distance, scant resources, lack of infrastructure both on and offshore and lack of critical mass.Throughout the world, offshore projects have greatly benefitted from the availability of integrated services to cater for the transport of equipment from the point of manufacture or distribution to the offshore location.Within the Australian context the privately controlled Esso Barry Beach and Dampier Woodside facilities are examples of integrated services, but both differ considerably from a public multi-user facility. The model used in the Timor Sea of one vessel or vessels for the use of several operators is another example.The NorthWest Shelf has now reached the critical mass and it became apparent several years ago that the area needed an integrated supply base available to multiple operators. It would need to include a heavy loadout wharf, laydown areas, slipway and engineering facilities and office space to service forthcoming projects, as well as planning and cooperation amongst all players to maximise efficiency and use of scant resources as drivers for economic benefits to offshore operators in the region.Furthermore the fallout from the events of 11 September 2001 and continuing threats of terrorism has meant the security of marine assets has become an important part of each operator’s everyday life. The introduction of new legislation relating to this security issue is planned for mid 2004.In 2000 and 2001 Mermaid Marine Australia Limited undertook a major expansion of its Dampier supply base, and established a world-class facility to meet the growing demands of the region.This complex has for the first time provided the northwest of Australia, particularly the North West Shelf, Carnarvon Basin and the onshore developments on the Burrup Peninsula, with a facility for offloading and loadout of heavy shipments and fabrication and slipway facilities, coupled with the advantages of a large supply base. This facility can also be expanded to meet growth and the emerging requirements related to security.This paper describes the drivers for change commencing with the earliest supply chains and following through to the integrated service now availabe. These drivers meet the requirements of the offshore operators in the region as well as showing the benefits anticipated from this integrated service. The paper also outlines in detail the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation for worldwide changes to port and offshore security.</jats:p>"

This report provides the best snapshot on the growth of e‐procurement in the United States. However, the sponsors do not publicly provide any analysis on the trends the data show from quarter‐to‐quarter. Now, with three years of available data from the twelve quarterly surveys conducted to date, there is an opportunity to analyze the adoption rates of e‐procurement tools, techniques and protocols in the American marketplace. The author of this study has conducted just such a longitudinal analysis of the ISM/Forrester data, examining the trends for organizations across the U.S. marketplace. What is demonstrated is that overall, both in manufacturing and service‐oriented firms and in large and small purchasing organizations, e‐procurement methods are rising and reaching “critical mass” in most areas with the “e‐way” fast becoming “the way”. However, important differences due exist between the groups and their specific needs, motivations, and results in their shift to an electronic acquisition environment. These are highlighted and discussed in this article.</jats:p>",

Managing the supply chain effectively enables businesses to serve their customers better and increase their own profitability. Supply chain management abounds with opportunities for information technology to be used for competitive advantage. By using tools such as the Internet, advanced planning software, and optimization techniques, companies can reduce costs and cycle times, improve customer satisfaction, and produce higher profits.</jats:p>",

Many of these technologies are relevant for both domestic and international supply chains, and many of these are discussed in other chapters of this book. Our focus is on international supply chain management. Information technologies that are unique to international trade draw on a complex and extensive array of regulations. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introductory primer for understanding what underlies these technologies and, more important, for a firm considering a shift from supply chains that are largely domestic in scope to a broader international orientation. Although we briefly discuss software specific to international supply chains, most of our discussion pertains to laws, service providers, and ways of doing business that any firm must understand to take advantage of opportunities for international buying and selling. We also provide references and links to more detailed information.</jats:p>",

The ability to create supply chain visibility, that is, to “see across the supply chain,” extends the scope of management options across all firms in the supply chain, and contributes to reductions in costs and improvements in service. Firms are now able to integrate this information to mitigate the bullwhip effect, increase the speed of operations, and improve service. Firms must adopt new collaborative business models—based on creating an extended, real‐time enterprise—to achieve these efficiency gains. This requires that managers learn how to operate in a collaborative environment with an abundance of shared information, and this means resolving problems among supply chain partners that impede successful collaboration. Detailed case studies of Nortel, Cisco, Dell, and NMS illustrate these ideas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Supply chain management (SCM) facilitates delivery of the right products or services to the right place in the right quantity for the right price. It also uncovers dormant synergies or enhances existing synergies among trading partners. This chapter outlines the fundamental strategies, members, and activities of a supply chain, and how information technologies enable better management of the supply chain. Currently, basic challenges in improving supply chain performance are embedded in the adversarial tension of competitive markets. Overcoming inherent distrust and fostering collaboration among decentralized supply chain members is a major challenge faced by today's supply chain managers. The capability to provide visibility of the entire supply chain's status to each supply chain member through SCM software fosters cooperation, and thus information technology can be viewed as a critical enabler of supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

We do so against a backdrop of increasing demand complexity and dynamism. However, we posit that these relationships cannot be understood in isolation; they form an integral part of a broader network operations strategy. The work examines the character of changing demand and offers an evolution model of supply systems as well as a future response scenario. The nature of supply network relationships is then described as a precursor to an examination of their role as part of a supply network operations strategy. The paper concludes with a description of the generic “building blocks” of such a strategy and the novel ways in which they might be customized to different types of demand behavior, as part of an endeavor to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The progressive commercialization of the water industry is the subject of this chapter. Recall the definition of commercialization stated in Chapter 1: the introduction of markets and market-simulating techniques as allocation and decision-making mechanisms, and the application of commercial practices (for example, cost-benefit analysis) and commercial goals (for example, profit maximization). In general, the successful commercialization of a service has four key prerequisites: the creation of an effective demand (not applicable in the case of water supply, given that it is partially non-substitutable resource essential for life); the conversion of a good or a service into a saleable commodity; the conversion of the workforce into one oriented towards profits; and the underwriting of risk by the state (Leys 2001). Full commercialization requires the correct valuation of water and all of the externalities associated with its production, consumption, and disposal, in order to enable the correct pricing of water and communication of that price to consumers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">An analysis of world and North American energy production and consumption over the past several decades indicates strong growth. Even with the growth of \"zero emission\" nuclear and large hydro, hydrocarbons (oil, gas and coal) made up more than 85% of world\nprimary energy consumption in 2002, and are forecast to make up more than 85% of a greatly expanded energy demand by 2025. Energy demand in the developing world is forecast by the Energy Information Administration to grow by 94% through 2025, when this region will account for nearly half of\nthe world's energy consumption. The question is, are these forecast growth rates sustainable, given the magnitude and distribution of the world's remaining energy reserves, and what are some of the political and social ramifications of maintaining this rate of consumption? Natural gas in North\nAmerica is of particular concern, as it is largely a Continental market (with the exception of about 1 % LNG at present) and demand, particularly for electricity generation, is forecast to grow dramatically over the next two decades. This presentation focuses on the \"Big Picture\" and how Canada\nfits into it, as well as what must be considered going\nforward to assure a sustainable energy future.</jats:p>"

For any supply chain to be effective, these flows cannot be interrupted or distorted without incurring waste and consuming management time in correcting problems. In addition, the procurement of materials, manufacturing, and distribution of products accounts for the majority of the overall cost and is key to customer service and overall competitiveness. Therefore, the development of a supply chain management capability for modern businesses is a means of contributing to business efficiency, effectiveness, and competitive advantage over rival producers. With the Internet enabling rapid information flow, much of the recent attention has focused on the information flow only, yet even in Internet‐enabled supply chains, the overall success still depends on an uninterrupted and efficient physical order fulfilment process. This chapter discuss the basics of both material and information flows and their interactions and concludes with an overview of current challenges and future trends on how to manage efficiently the material flow in the supply chain in the Internet age.</jats:p>",

The model was originally developed  from a strategic perspective in which a company desires to evaluate the  expansion or closure of its facilities. Nevertheless, the model is also  used for solving operational and tactical level problems by applying  applicable constraints. The data were collected from the company  studied. The results proved that economies of scale could be exploited  in seedling production more than the company does today; Compared to the  companyâs current supply chain strategy with 5 nursery units producing  seedlings, when other supply chain strategies were applied the number of  nursery units decreased by 2â4 units, and cost savings in the supply  chain varied from 11.3% to 21.3%.</ja:p>"

The time lost between changes in customer preferences and product mix disappears and customer demand can both be anticipated and shaped by the sales system. An automotive build to order supply chain must be able to meet seasonality within markets, and understand the detailed demand volatility for certain elements of the complex product mix, from which much of the profitability is derived. Market responsive manufacturing entails adaptive and flexible production and supply capability in conjunction with real‐time market interaction through revenue management. The combination of late capacity setting and revenue management can enable the whole extended enterprise to operate as a single entity.

It explains overall supply chain issues, strategic importance of SCM, supply chain strategies and an example of mathematical formulation. A supply chain is a global network of organizations that cooperate to improve the flows of material and information between suppliers and customers at the lowest cost and the highest speed. The objective of a supply chain is customer satisfaction. At the strategic level, a supply chain can be considered as being composed of five activities: buy, make, move, store and sell. Each activity is a module. The set of modules, along with its links, constitutes a model of the supply chain. Our paper presents some insights into the supply chain strategies of companies in Croatia. The major goal of this paper is to show a model for supply chain management in mathematical terms, with an example of mathematical formulation.</jats:p>"

Based on these principles, the EU adopted VAT rules on electronic supplies. Australia has been reluctant thus far.This article examines whether the amended EU-VAT Directive might serve as a model for Australia’s GST regime. The VAT and GST legislation of both the European Union and Australia is analysed and compared, with particular focus on cross-border e-commerce supplies and enforcement issues. The political and administrative aspects of EU-VAT Directives are also considered. The article concludes that the provisions of the EU-Directive concerning e-commerce are transferable to the Australian GST regime.</jats:p>"

To a greater degree than any of the industries privatized before it, water lay at the frontier of the market—so much so that new regulatory institutions had to be designed and regulatory bodies created in order to enable the market to function.</jats:p>",

In the numerical studies, paraffin wax FNP-0090 (product of Nippon Seiro Co. Ltd.) was used as the PCM and was encapsulated in four different capsules (sphere, cylinder, plate and tube) for investigating the effects of geometrical configurations. The capsules filled with PCM were placed in a rectangular tank. Water was used as the working fluid in a rectangular tank. Water was used as the working fluid in the circulation system to discharge the storage tank. A one-dimensional model was used for solving the water temperature distribution along the flow direction in the tank and a conductive one-dimensional phase change model was used for simulating the solidification process of the PCM inside the capsules. The effects of the capsule diameter and shell thickness and the void fraction on the performance of the heat storage system were also investigated. Results shown include the variation of the outlet water temperature of the storage tank with time, the temperature and heat release distributions of the PCM along the flow direction in the tank at different times, etc. A plate heat exchanger was used as a heat storage tank for experimental study. FNP-0090 was filled into the channels (the space between two plates) of one side of the heat exchanger and water flowed in the channels of the other side of the heat exchanger. The effect of flow rate and initial temperature on the outlet fluid temperature and heat release was investigated. The numerical results and the experimental data agreed within 10%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>In green parts of the plant, during illumination ATP and NAD(P)H act as energy sources that are generated mainly in photosynthesis and respiration, whereas in darkness, glycolysis, respiration and the oxidative pentose‐phosphate pathway (OPP) generate the required energy forms. In non‐green parts, sugar oxidation in glycolysis, respiration and OPP are the only means of producing energy. For energy‐consuming reactions, the delivery of NADPH, NADH, reduced ferredoxin and ATP has to take place at the required rates and in the specific compartments, since the pool sizes of these energy carriers are rather limited and, in general, they are not directly transported across biomembranes. Indirect transport of reducing equivalents can be achieved by malateoxaloacetate shuttles, involving malate dehydrogenase (MDH) for the interconversion. Isoenzymes of MDH are present in each cellular compartment. Chloroplasts contain the redox‐controlled NADP‐MDH that is only active in the light. In addition, a plastid NAD‐MDH that is permanently active and is present in all plastid types has been found. Export of excess NAD(P)H through the malate valves will allow for the continued production of ATP (1) in photosynthesis, and (2) in oxidative phosphorylation. In the latter case, the coupled production of NADH is catalysed by the bispecific NAD(P)‐GAPDH (GapAB) in chloroplasts that is active with NAD even in darkness, or by the specific plastid NAD‐GAPDH (GapCp) in non‐green tissues. When plants are subjected to conditions such as high light, high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> nutrition, cold stress, which require changed activities of the enzymes of the malate valves, changed expression levels of the MDH isoforms can be observed. In nodules, the induction of a nodule‐specific plastid NAD‐MDH indicates the changed requirements for energy supply during N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation. Furthermore, the induction of glucose 6‐phosphate dehydrogenase isoforms by ammonium and of ferredoxin and ferredoxin‐NADP reductase by nitrate has been described. All these findings are in line with the assumption that a changed redox state caused by metabolic variability leads to the induction of enzymes involved in redox poise.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A common theme in the studies of flexible supply contracts has been the producer's profit-maximization problem without regard to the suppliers' reactions. However, suppliers do react and protect their downside against producer's operating policies by revising their strategies in a manner consistent with their profitmaximization objectives. This fact motivates our work. Using a real-options (contingent claims) approach, we analyze and value supply contracts in a setting characterized by exchange rate uncertainty, supplier-switching options, order-quantity flexibility, profit sharing, and supplier reaction options. We also use basic diversification concepts, from portfolio theory, to analyze risk reduction in a unique framework. Given this setup, we explicitly model how flexibility can be mutually beneficial to both the producer and the suppliers. Using this model, we concurrently solve and examine the dual optimization problem for the suppliers and the producer. Our approach also endogenizes the extent and degree of profit sharing through the resulting optimal policies. We also analyze what induces the producer and the suppliers to accept flexibility in their contracts. </jats:p>",

However, the uses of the same technological advancements in business‐to‐business supply chain management are changing the marketplace itself. Successful supply chain management requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into the key supply chain process. The advantages are far more than the efforts involved in accessing the final product, a seamless chain that operates fluidly and benefits the entire value chain by speeding up communication between customers and their suppliers, improving service quality, and reducing costs. In this article, the author discusses how the Internet is being used in the management of various areas of supply chain by Indian companies.</jats:p>",

Data analysis used in the researh are tendentious analysis and geographical information system. The result shows that groundwater quality at the research place decreases. It can be proved by tendentious analysis that most of the groundwater quality conentration parameter – after being examined – the lower plae, the higher conentration. There are 21 quality parameters used for that research, 15 out of those have an inclining tendency, while the others are flat and decline. The result of 2 overlapping maps, atual zoning and potential zoning, shows that there is mismatching of risky polluted area. It is caused by human fators, some of them are population density, well construction, bad sanitation, individual septi tank, and industrial disposal from irrigation. Based on the result of the research, clean water district corporation is expected to be able to determine priority scale of clean water supply to Surakarta and its surrounding.</jats:p>"

Gias Cymru was formed for the sole purpose of purchasing the assets of Welsh Water from its American-owned parent company, Western Power. Owned by its members (mostly prominent Welsh citizens), prohibited from diversifying outside of its core water business, and wholly financed by debt, Gias Cymru promised an immediate and sustained reduction in water prices for its customers. Control of Welsh water, it proudly announced, had returned home to the Welsh people.</jats:p>",

This study uses observation and secondary data analysis. The collected data are meteorology data, the water production of Municipal waterworks, the quality and the quantity of springs, the number of population and the customers. The result of the study shows that there are eight springs with the total debit 157 liter/ second or 6739 m3/ day. The Municipal Waterworks uses 65 liter/ second or 5616 m3/ day with the leaking rate 7% or 5222,88 m3/ day and the rest is used for irrigation. The quality of spring is qualified for drinking water requirement. The need of drinking water for per capita of the population is 136.7 liter/ capita/ day. In 2003 the prediction of the number of consumers is about 20.745 persons, so the total need of drinking water is predicted about 2835.8 m3/ day. The total need of drinking water added with the leak water is 3032.36 m3/ day. The Municipal Waterworks fulfils the need of drinking water for the population especially for the consumers of Municipal Waterworks. However, if the number of customers is accounted based on the number of the population in the pipe sope (­+ 48246 persons), the Municipal Waterworks will not fulfil the need of drinking water for population, therefore it needs to add volume production of drinking water.</jats:p>"

Individuals with demonstrated anti-IgA are thereafter committed to receiving IgA-depleted cellular products or IgA-deficient plasma and derivatives to prevent recurrent severe reactions. Unfortunately, in populations of IgA-deficient individuals screened for anti-IgA, the predictive value of the test in the absence of a prior reaction is quite low. Anti-IgA testing is complex and limited to a few reference laboratories, many of which still employ a labor-intensive hemagglutination assay developed in the late 1960s. Timely decisions regarding further transfusion management of patients experiencing anaphylaxis often rely upon more rapidly obtained assays of the IgA concentration as an indicator of the likelihood of subsequent demonstration of anti-IgA. The scarcity of IgA-deficient banked plasma products and dedicated platelet-pheresis donors has led to the development of American Rare Donor Program policies designed to appropriately allocate these precious resources. The test methods used to establish the diagnosis of IgA deficiency and identify the approximately one-third of these individuals with anti-IgA are discussed, along with the incidence of abnormal tests in various populations. Also presented are testing recommendations for the identification of an IgA-mediated mechanism for transfusion-associated anaphylaxis and qualification of patients to receive rare IgA-deficient plasmacontaining products. <jats:bold>\n                     <jats:italic>Immunohematology</jats:italic> 2005;21 :226–233.</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>",

The temporal and spatial variations of the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, obtained with an inversion technique based on a cloud model, provide strong indications that the mechanism responsible for the driving of the observed flows is magnetic reconnection. Apart from the LOS velocity, application of the cloud model enables the derivation of several other physical parameters, like pressure, temperature, density etc. Mean values of these parameters permit the estimation of the role of these structures in the mass balance of the solar atmosphere. They, furthermore, permit a reasonable estimate of the energy provided by magnetic reconnection which is available for the heating of the solar corona.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most manufacturing takes place in the context of a supply chain. Each station in the supply chain must not only manufacture a product but also decide how much to produce. This decision is influenced by the supply of materials/components from the next station down in the supply chain and the demand from the next station up. With the advent of increased customization, inventory management is increasingly becoming a critical issue in the manufacturing process. In this paper we model the decision logic at each stage of a supply chain system through the use of system identification and PID controllers. The goal is to investigate and manage the costs of manufacturing a product in the context of a supply chain. It is assumed that the supply chain has well-understood interactions between individual positions, allowing for a focus on the ordering decision logic. A review of ordering strategies is presented, and a discussion of the difficulties in determining PID gains for human decision makers is included. The results show a range of correlation between the PID simulation and measured supply chain inventories. This stems from a number of factors, which are discussed. Additionally, ordering strategies to optimize the supply chain are investigated.</jats:p>",

Using a survey where workers declare their true employment experience, this paper argues that these supply trends imply more inexperienced workers. It then investigates the consequences of this fact on the skill composition of the labor force, between-groups wage inequality and the level of unemployment. The main result is that a labor market with wage rigidities may not recover from such a temporary labor supply shock: with a younger and less experienced labor force, there is higher unemployment among low-experience workers, they do not accumulate enough on-the-job human capital, this reduces in the long-run the supply of skilled (experienced) workers and the demand for unskilled workers. This intertemporal multiplication of supply shocks generates multiple equilibria, and the rigid economy is stuck to the bad equilibrium even after the shock. In a competitive labor market, in contrast, wage inequality and notably, the wage return to experience becomes higher but there is no persistence of the supply shock.</jats:p>"

CGR of production increased in all zones except in hilly zone and north eastern zone. Highest increase in rate of growth in productivity was observed in western zone with 15.95 per cent per annum. State as whole, there was positive compound growth rate in area, production and productivity with 2.47, 3.68 and 1.19 per cent respectively. Lagged area and lagged price had significant positive influnce on cassava area while the influence of rainfall and lagged yield was not significant. The supply response model for cassava shown that for every increase of 0.18 rupees per quintal in tuber price in the previous year, the current arac increased by one hectare.

Drawing on emerging perspectives on interfirm governance and networks, the authors propose that the ability to show flexibility toward a (downstream) customer under uncertain market conditions depends on the governance mechanisms that have been deployed in an (upstream) supplier relationship. The governance mechanisms take the form of (1) supplier qualification programs and (2) incentive structures based on hostages. The authors develop a set of contingency predictions and test them empirically in the context of vertical supply chain networks in the apparel industry. The tests show good support for the hypotheses. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for marketing theory and practice. </jats:p>",

The literature indicates that multiple renal arteries are found in 9– 76% of cadavers. The purpose of this study is to establish the incidence and characteristics of variations of renal arteries in Thais. A total of 267 Thai cadavers were dissected in the anatomy laboratory. The anatomical findings included: a single hilar artery in 82% of cases; double renal arteries in 17% of cases (one hilar artery with an upper polar artery occurred in 7%; two hilar arteries in 7%, and one hilar artery combined with one lower polar artery in 3%); and triple renal arteries occurred in 1% (two hilar arteries with one upper polar artery in 0.4% and two hilar arteries with one lower polar artery in 0.6%). In preparation for interventions, such as living renal donation, vascular reconstruction, renovascular hypertension, or radical nephrectomy, the results indicate that preoperative renal imaging is necessary and that operative techniques with attention to multiple renal arteries should be considered.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Respecting the principles of analytics, systematization and comprehensiveness, the paper deals with the frames of disparity between supply and demand in services market. The basic reasons for disparity are systematically divided into five groups: (1) reasons for problems in the area of information on supply and demand, (2) reasons for problems in the area of parallel functioning of the gray market, (3) reasons for problems in the area of psychological conditions and perceptions of consumers, (4) reasons for problems in the area of social and economic situation, (5) reasons in the area of institutional functioning. These groups contain reasons of the general character and reasons in individual areas and flows. The analysis of disparity has been conducted via relevant relations of demand and supply that exist in services market, as follows: (1) the relation of supply of services provided by companies towards adequate forms of demand (other companies, institutions, population), (2) the relation of institutions' supply of services toward adequate forms of demand (all companies, population) and (3) the relation of unofficial supply of services toward adequate demand (population). Within basic prerequisites for the solution to disparity of demand and supply in the service sector, we have especially emphasized and analyzed personnel potential. We have analyzed elements and problems of the labor market, available personnel potential (personnel potential of the employed and the unemployed), as well as latent personnel potential.</jats:p>"

The primary justification for the discharge policy is to preserve human capital by maintaining incentives for work. In this paper, we test this fresh start argument by providing the first estimate of the effect of personal bankruptcy filing on the labor supply using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Our econometric approach controls for the endogenous self-selection of bankruptcy filing and allows for dependence over time for the same household. We find that filing for bankruptcy does not have a positive impact on annual hours worked by bankrupt households, a result mainly due to the wealth effects of debt discharge. The finding is robust to a number of alternative model specifications and sample selections. Therefore, our analysis does not find supporting evidence for the human capital argument for bankruptcy discharge.</jats:p>"

This paper presents formulas for the fill rate of periodic review supply systems that use base-stock-level policies. The first part of the paper contains fill-rate formulas for a single-stage system and general distributions of demand. When demand is normally distributed, an exact expression uses only the standard normal distribution and density functions, and a good approximation uses only the standard normal distribution function. The second part of the paper derives the probability distribution of the finished goods inventory level for serial systems with buffer inventories between stages. This distribution leads to fill-rate formulas and the conclusion that shorter supply chains have higher fill rates. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the work of simulating and analysing TPSS. It is based on dependent train movement in conjunction with TPSS simulation to establish a panorama view of the features. The free time scheduled strategy for train movement is applied which is more flexible and effective to reflect operation strategies. To set up the dynamic TPSS structure with respect to the moving train status for the system solution, the schematic arrangement is split into four parts: establishment of the elementary electric network framework; establishment of the dynamic electrical network structure which includes both the elementary power network and the moving trains statuses; dynamic electric network simulation; and system analyses based on the panoramic features drawn from the simulation. The simulation results are based on the Shanghai Metro Line One (excluding the extension section). Simulation and analysis on more lines including Shanghai Line Two and Guangzhou Line One MTRS have also been implemented using similar approaches. The complete profiles of the TPSS provide a practical means in analysing the system configuration as well as organizing the system operation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, a risk-neutral manufacturer sells a single product to a risk-neutral retailer. The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product. Other model extensions are also discussed. </jats:p>",

As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9 min for the LifeSite and 16.9 min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access‐related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access‐related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87 min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access‐related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.</jats:p>",

The findings revealed how technical issues impact two groups of adopters, namely leaders and followers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter is focused on discovering important trading partner selection criteria that are relevant in electronic data interchange (EDI)-enabled relationships. Increasing implementation of integrated supply chain management (SCM) and collaborative commerce initiatives call for the cultivation and maintenance of long-term strategic partnerships such as those engendered by EDI. A body of evidence shows that hub firms (i.e., firms that initiate technology-enabled partnership networks) are getting choosier about their trading partners. However, there is a need to understand specific trading partner attributes that are more likely to ensure successful long-term relationships. Using the survey technique, this study brought forth respondents from customer and supplier firms engaged in EDI applications; the final respondent sample ended up with a pool of firms primarily in the manufacturing sector. Factor analysis uncovered six trading partner selection factors which both customer and supplier firms thought were critical in selecting partners: strategic commitment of top management, readiness for high-level EDI, joint partnering, trading partner flexibility, communications, and EDI infrastructure. Overall, customer firms regarded a number of trading partner selection factors with a higher level of criticality than did the supplier firms. Customer firms have historically been ahead in initiating EDI networks that may partly explain their higher level of awareness of the implementation requirements involved. This is reflected, for instance, in one other finding that shows customer firms highly valuing the trading partner flexibility and joint partnering factors, which is indicative of their understanding of the collaboration process. Specific items of the trading partner selection factors that correlate highly with many EDI network system success measures are also articulated in the study. The effect of the network initiator status was also taken into consideration after looking at the firms’ perceptions of the success of the EDI network. Customer firms perceived their EDI systems to be successful whether they had a customer firm initiator in their network. Network initiator status appears to have a marginal effect on customer firms in this way. On the other hand, a supplier firms with a supplier initiator in the network perceived the system as more successful than supplier firms with a customer initiator. It behooves managers of systems using EDI, particularly of supplier firms, to understand the findings of this study in order to enhance their position as a desirable potential trading partner for customer firms that they value. Unless the supplier is in the rare position of having high bargaining power in the marketplace, for instance, having a near monopoly over certain goods or services, it behooves the supplier to enhance its position in the eyes of the customers. This is especially necessary in marketplace segments where suppliers fiercely compete for targeted customer accounts. This study’s findings have important implications for strong partnerships involved in integrated supply chain management initiatives and collaborative commerce.</jats:p>"

A simulated cooperative game was created to estimate a university fee and predict the behavior of nursery growers and nursery product retailers. The simulation suggests a university fee of $3.51, leading to an average retail price premium for the resistant tree of $10.41. At this price level the simulation predicts that 62 percent of all retail dogwood trees sold would be powdery mildew resistant. Based on 1998 sales of 1.475 million dogwood trees nationwide, 914,500 were predicted to be the powdery mildew resistant varieties, resulting in $3.2 million in revenue for the university. Given this level of sales and markup pricing, the cost of the trees will rise in subsequent stages of the distribution channel, and revenues will increase as well. The simulation suggests nursery revenue will increase by nearly $4 million and costs by $3.2 million, resulting in a net nursery gain of $0.8 million. Similar computations for the retail level are $9.5 million in revenue and a net increase of $5.5 million.</jats:p>",

This was driven by a strong increase in denitrification in groundwater under native riparian vegetation. Nitrate concentrations were significantly lower during high flow compared with base flow. Riparian patches had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations that were more aromatic compared with the gravel bar patch closest to the river.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Multiple linear regression showed that the rate of denitrification was best predicted by the concentration of low molecular weight organic acids. These molecules are probably derived from decomposition of soil organic matter and are an important energy source for anaerobic respiratory processes like denitrification. The second best predictor was per cent surface water, reflecting higher denitrification rates during spring when hydrological connection between surface water and ground water was greatest.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Our results indicate that, while denitrification rates in Garonne River alluvium were spatially and temporally variable, denitrification was a significant NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> sink during transport from the NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐contaminated floodplain to the river.

Gambrill’s (1999, 2001) important essays calling for a social work practice built upon a bedrock of empirical research are among the spate of recent publications that feature “evidence-based” or “empirical-based practice” (Corcoran, 2000; Cournoyer, Powers, 2002; Lloyd, 1998; Thyer, Wodarski, 1998; Vandiver, 2002). This is not to say that empirical research has become the sole or even main source that guides client intervention; the broad consensus in social work would appear to indicate otherwise. Evidence-based practice, defined as practice based on empirical studies preappraised for scientific validity and prescreened for clinical relevance (Gambrill, 2001), remains far less common than practice that sterns from authority, face validity, practice wisdom, common practice, and the principle of the respectable minority (Beutler, 2000; Gambrill, 1999; Reid, 1997; Rosen, Proctor, Morrow-Howell,, Staudt, 1995).</jats:p>",

Barley and A. thaliana plants were grown at five N concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1, 10 and 20 mM) for 27 and 26 d, respectively, and the isoenzymic profile of the three enzymes were analysed in their roots. The number of GR isoforms in the three plant species was increased at high N supply compared with low N. In addition, the CAT and GR activities detected in the roots were increased in plants grown at higher N. The increase in activity and number of bands of GR at high N in the roots of all three plants studied was not accompanied by a change in activity or the number of SOD isoforms. The possibility that the application of high N promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species by stimulating an increased rate of growth is discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One partial solution to the problem of ever‐increasing demands on our water resources is optimal allocation of available water. A non‐linear programming (NLP) optimization model with an integrated soil water balance was developed. This model is the advanced form of a previously developed one in which soil water balance was not included. The model also has the advantage of low computer run‐time, as compared to commonly used dynamic programming (DP) models that suffer from dimensionality. The model can perform over different crop growth stages while taking into account an irrigation time interval in each stage. Therefore, the results are directly applicable to real‐world conditions. However, the time trend of actual evapotranspiration (AET) for individual time intervals fluctuates more than that for growth‐stage AETs. The proposed model was run for the Ardak area (45 km NW of the city of Mashhad, Iran) under a single cropping cultivation (corn) as well as a multiple cropping pattern (wheat, barley, corn, and sugar beet). The water balance equation was manipulated with net applied irrigation water to overcome the difficulty encountered with incorrect deep percolation. The outputs of the model, under the imposed seasonal irrigation water shortages, were compared with the results obtained from a simple NLP model. The differences between these two models (simple and integrated) became more significant as irrigation water shortage increased. Oversimplified assumptions in the previous simple model were the main causes of these differences. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this model, no player has complete knowledge about all the costs and constraints of the other players. The decision‐making framework employs an iterative procedure, based on the Integer L‐shaped method, in which a master problem is solved to propose global solutions, and each player uses his local problems to construct feasibility and optimality cuts on the master problem. The master problem is modeled as a mixed‐integer program, and the players' local problems are formulated as linear programs. Collaborative planning scenarios in private e‐marketplaces and in supply chains were formulated and solved for test data. The results show that this distributed model is able to achieve near‐optimal solutions considerably faster than the traditional centralized approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research in Supply Chain Management and Electronic Commerce has grown dramatically in the past decade as firms have intensified efforts to streamline operations and improve service to a diverse and demanding customer base. Central to this theme is the need for firms to look outside of their organizations for opportunities to collaborate and coordinate with partners to ensure that the supply chain is both efficient and responsive to dynamic market needs. Such collaboration and coordination opportunities introduce new challenges and complexities as a result of increased problem scale and scope, and potentially conflicting incentives among different supply chain players. Motivated by these new challenges, this special issue explores a range of coordination and collaboration problems, stressing the role of information and associated technologies in facilitating and enabling supply chain integration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a market with two competing supply chains, each consisting of one wholesaler and one retailer. We assume that the business environment forces supply chains to charge similar prices and to compete strictly on the basis of customer service. We model customer service competition using game‐theoretical concepts. We consider three competition scenarios between the supply chains. In the uncoordinated scenario, individual members of both supply chains maximize their own profits by individually selecting their service and inventory policies. In the coordinated scenario, wholesalers and retailers of each supply chain coordinate their service and inventory policy decisions to maximize supply chain profits. In the hybrid scenario, competition is between one coordinated and one uncoordinated supply chain. We discuss the derivation of the equilibrium service strategies, resulting inventory policies, and profits for each scenario, and compare the equilibria in a numerical study. We find that coordination is a dominant strategy for both supply chains, but as in the prisoner's dilemma, both supply chains are often worse off under the coordinated scenario relative to the uncoordinated scenario. The consumers are the only guaranteed beneficiaries of coordination. </jats:p>",

Provision of an adequate water supply for its town and garrison has been a continuing problem, particularly as the population has grown from about 3000 in the 18th century to over 30 000 by the end of the 20th. The narrow peninsula is dominated by the Rock, a mass of Lower Jurassic dolomite and limestone whose main ridge has peaks over 400 m high. Early supplies of potable water were from roof and slope rainwater runoff, and from shallow wells in the Quaternary sands that cover ‘shales’ flanking the Rock at low levels. Intermittent hydrogeological studies through the 19th and 20th centuries, notably in association with the British Geological Survey in 1876, 1943–1952, and 1974–1985 attempted to develop inferred groundwater resources within the sandy isthmus which links the Rock to southern Spain and in the Rock itself. Problems resulted from inadequate understanding of the geology, of recharge, of the behaviour of aquifers containing saline water at depth and of the need to protect aquifers from pollution. Failure to extract adequate groundwater led to development of a separate supply of saline sanitary water to reduce demand for potable water and innovative attempts to improve slope catchment of rainwater, before near-total commitment to desalination for potable supplies in 1993.\n          </jats:p>",

It first gives an overview of the various planning and scheduling models that have been studied in the literature, including lot sizing models and machine scheduling models. It subsequently categorizes the various industrial sectors in which planning and scheduling in the supply chains are important; these industries include continuous manufacturing as well as discrete manufacturing. We then describe how planning and scheduling models can be used in the design and the development of decision support systems for planning and scheduling in supply chains and discuss in detail the implementation of such a system at the Carlsberg A/S beerbrewer in Denmark. We conclude with a discussion on the current trends in the design and the implementation of planning and scheduling systems in practice. </jats:p>",

Consistent with this explanation, we find such asymmetry in the interwar period following the abandonment of the gold standard and before it, when agents arguably anticipated this development. We find no monetary asymmetry before World War I, which is consistent with Ball and Mankiw (1994), because under a credible gold standard, agents do not expect persistent inflation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As widely accepted performance measures in supply chain management practice, frequency-based service levels such as fill rate and stockout rate are often considered in supply contracts under vendor-managed-inventory (VMI) programs. Using a decentralized two-party capacitated supply chain model consisting of one manufacturer and one supplier in a VMI environment, we demonstrate that supplier's service level is in general insufficient for the manufacturer to warrant the desired service level at the customer end. The method by which the supplier achieves her service level to the manufacturer also affects customer service level. </jats:p><jats:p> By developing bounds on the customer service level, we show that the expected backorders at the supplier should also be taken into account. We suggest a supply contract that offers a menu of different combinations of supplier's service level and expected backorders according to a linear function. Under this contract, the manufacturer can control the end customer service regardless of how the supplier manages her inventory. The supplier has complete flexibility on which combination of the two quantities on the menu to choose according to her own cost functions. Because it does not require any detailed information on supplier's operational characteristics nor her costs, this kind of contract is expected to be easily implementable. In addition, we derive an estimate of the customer service level in terms of the new measures. </jats:p><jats:p> Our findings have direct implications to supply chain metrics in general: The local service levels are insufficient measures to guarantee the system wide performance. Alternative local measures and/or coordination mechanisms should be employed to achieve desired system performance. Our analysis illustrates a possible way to explore such alternative measures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Retailers often stock competing products from multiple manufacturers. When the retailer stocks out of a particular item, customers who prefer the item are likely, with some probability, to switch to a substitute product from another manufacturer at the same store. In such an event, a “lost sale” for the manufacturer is not a “lost sale” for the retailer. This exacerbates differences in manufacturer's and retailer's stockout costs for the item. Such differences in stockout cost influence the optimal contract between the manufacturer and the retailer and also impose agency costs on the channel. Such contracts, in turn, determine equilibrium inventory levels and fill rates. We study these issues in a single‐period supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, under three different scenarios (when the two firms are integrated into a single entity, when the retailer makes stocking decisions, and when the manufacturer makes stocking decisions). We compare, and present a methodology for comparing, stocking quantities, manufacturer efforts, and supply chain profits across different scenarios. We find that VMI performs better when manufacturer effort is a substantial driver of consumer demand and when consumers are unlikely to substitute to another brand in case of a stockout. On the other hand, if non‐contractible manufacturer effort is unimportant, or when substitution is significant, VMI can exacerbate, rather than mitigate, channel inefficiencies, and can perform worse than traditional Retailer Managed Inventory. </jats:p>",

To analyze this process and its outcomes, the following research questions were examined in this study: How do CMC and FTF contribute to a win-win strategy in negotiation? How do CMC and FTF affect the participants' ability to empathize with each other? Are the negotiation strategies of Anglo, Nordic, and Latin negotiators affected differently depending on the medium? Is the ability of Anglo, Nordic, and Latin negotiators to empathize with each other affected differently depending on the medium? On the basis of our results, we surmise that CMC does not allow negotiators to employ a cooperative win-win strategy (as recommended by negotiation-strategy training). We see significant differences when we examine the use of personal pronouns and speech acts by the Anglo, Nordic, and Latin culture clusters. When we look at the use of cooperative speech acts, a similar situation occurs: in contrast to Anglos, who behave in a cooperative way, Latins are significantly less cooperative and Nordics use many more general speech acts in the CMC setting.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The unique characteristics of the model are that it: (1) defines larvae in terms of their protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, and ash content; (2) tracks weight separately from length to follow larval condition; and (3) includes genetic variation in growth efficiency and egg quality to better simulate cohort population dynamics. The model includes parameterizations for filtration, ingestion, and respiration, which determine larval growth rate, and processes controlling larval mortality and metamorphosis. Changes in larval tissue composition occur as the larva grows and in response to the biochemical composition of the food.</jats:p><jats:p>Simulations of larval growth indicate that departures of temperature, salinity, or food content from optimum levels reduce larval cohort survival, either because of metabolic constraints that result in death, unsuccessful metamorphosis, or increased predation resulting from increased larval lifespan. Temperatures and salinities near optimal values improve larval survival at low food concentration by increasing ingestion rate or growth efficiency. Also, survival at a given food concentration can vary widely depending on food composition, which determines food quality. The simulations suggest that the ratio of carbohydrate + lipid-to-protein may best describe the overall food quality, with optimal food compositions being characterized by ratios near 1.2 to 1.4 over a range of food concentrations. In contrast, food compositions containing too much or too little protein reduce larval survival, even at saturating food concentrations.</jats:p><jats:p>In simulations emphasizing genetic variability within the cohort, larvae with high growth efficiency originating from large eggs out-perform other egg quality–growth efficiency combinations over a wide range of temperature, salinity, and food contents. As a consequence, suboptimal temperature, salinity, or food content compresses genetic variation by uniformly favouring larvae from large eggs with a high growth efficiency. However, the larval survival obtained from simulations that use a range of food qualities is representative of a much broader range of genetic types. Thus, the simulations support the supposition that food quality is an important variable controlling the survival and genetic variability of C. gigas larval cohorts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effects of nutritional status on the responses to high temperature of 2 wheat cultivars that differed in their sensitivity to high temperature were investigated in plants grown in pots in environmentally controlled growth rooms. The availability of nitrogen to the grains was altered by changing the amount and timing of the nitrogen supplied to the plants, and also by trimming the ears. Single grain weight was significantly decreased in the plants grown at 30/25°C compared with those grown at 20/15°C. The effects of nitrogen level or trimming on the response of grain filling to temperature did not seem to be mediated through alterations in the availability of carbohydrates within the grains. Neither N level nor trimming had substantial effects on the deposition of starch, but both treatments altered the accumulation of protein, and the responses of protein accumulation to the effects of temperature. At the lower temperature, increasing the nitrogen supply resulted in greater single grain weight, more protein per grain, and higher grain protein percentage. At the higher temperature, raising the supply of N increased none of these attributes; the rate of protein accumulation was not accelerated by raising the temperature as much at high as at low N, and high N reduced the duration of protein deposition. There was a linear and positive relationship between the amounts of amino acids in the grain and the rate of accumulation of protein in the endosperm, and the effects of N level and trimming were associated with changes in the concentration of amino acids in the grains. High temperature conditions appear to lower the supply of amino acids to the grain in plants well supplied with nitrogen. There was a positive relationship between the rate of protein deposition and the amount of amino acids in the grain. Although raising the level of nitrogen resulted in an increase in amino acid levels in the grain at low temperature, there was no such increase at high temperature. Trimming, however, did increase grain protein and the rate of protein deposition at high temperature as well as the amino acid levels in the grain. One possible interpretation of this paradox arises from other work showing that under high temperature and/or water deficit there is an inadequate supply of soluble carbohydrates in the shoot to metabolise high levels of nitrogen. Differences in the responses of starch deposition and protein accumulation to N level, trimming, and temperature confirm that these two components accumulate in the grain independently of each other. Consequences of the interactions between nitrogen supply, temperature, and cultivar are discussed in relation to yield and quality.</jats:p>"

The study yielded regional maps through time of palaeotemperature, overburden, denudation rate and palaeotopography, with increasing assumptions and hence uncertainty.Regionally the &gt;60,000 km3 of Strzelecki Group comprises ~90% volcanoclastic detritus and coal with only ~10% basement-derived sediment, but the northern margin of the basin, near Lakes Entrance, is likely to have a higher basement-derived portion resulting in better reservoirs. The basement-derived sediments are probably largely granitic as the Devonian granites were exposed during the Permo-Triassic Hunter-Bowen Orogeny. Regional mid-Cretaceous uplift resulted in increased denudation of basement, but inversion of the basin margins resulted in denudation of the onshore Strzelecki Group sediments. Emperor and Golden Beach Subgroup sediments deposited in the subsiding Central Graben were at least 50% basement-derived, again with higher quality reservoirs predicted near the Lakes Entrance area and poorer reservoirs near to Wilson’s Promontory.

Depth profiling and surface analysis have been carried out on pipe samples obtained from the water distribution system in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. X-ray diffraction spectrometry identified basic lead carbonate, lead oxide and lead phosphate as the principal components. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry revealed the crystalline structure within the corrosion product and also showed spatial correlations existed between calcium, iron, lead, oxygen and phosphorus. Elemental profiling, conducted by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and secondary neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS) indicated that the corrosion product was not uniform with depth. However, no clear stratification was apparent. Indeed, counts obtained for carbonate, phosphate and oxide were well correlated within the depth range probed by SIMS. SNMS showed relationships existed between carbon, calcium, iron, and phosphorus within the bulk of the scale, as well as at the surface. SIMS imaging confirmed the relationship between calcium and lead and suggested there might also be an association between chloride and phosphorus.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the supplier of a key component to a global manufacturer offers a one‐time price discount; we study the firm's optimal response to the discount under two different strategies. In the first strategy, the firm does not pass along the discount to its customers (sales subsidiaries); the firm simply coordinates purchasing and production among the different factories to take advantage of this one‐time price discount. In the second strategy, the firm offers price discounts for its most profitable products in different sales subsidiaries to increase their demand. We carried out experiments for the two strategies based on a mathematical programming model, built around Toshiba's global notebook supply chain. Model constraints include, among others, material constraints, bill‐of‐materials, capacity and transportation constraints, minimum lot size constraints, and a constraint on minimum fill rate (service level constraint). Unlike most models of this type in the literature, which define variables in terms of single arc flows, we employ path variables, which allow for direct identification and manipulation of profitable and non‐profitable products. </jats:p>",

This concept uses spontaneous fuel distribution achieved by an interaction between the gaseous fuel jet and the airflow. Previously, we proved that fuel distribution based on the innovative fuel supply concept actually occurred according to the load by means of pressurized combustion tests using a prototype combustor. However, NOx was not low enough at high loads, and combustion efficiency was not high at medium and low loads. Further, the pressure loss of the combustor was high. Therefore, the prototype combustor was improved from the viewpoint of NOx, combustion efficiency and combustor pressure loss. This paper describes the detailed structure of the improved combustors and the results of the pressurized combustion experiments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nThe rms2 and rms4 pea (Pisum sativum L.) branching mutants have higher and lower xylem-cytokinin concentration, respectively, relative to wild type (WT) plants. These genotypes were grown at two levels of nitrogen (N) supply for 18–20 d to determine whether or not xylem-cytokinin concentration (X-CK) or delivery altered the transpiration and leaf growth responses to N deprivation. Xylem sap was collected by pressurising de-topped root systems. As sap-flow rate increased, X-CK declined in WT and rms2, but did not change in rms4. When grown at 5.0 mm N, X-CKs of rms2 and rms4 were 36% higher and 6-fold lower, respectively, than WT at sap-flow rates equivalent to whole-plant transpiration. Photoperiod cytokinin (CK) delivery rates (the product of transpiration and X-CK) decreased more than 6-fold in rms4. Growth of plants at 0.5 mm N had negligible (&lt; 10%) effects on transpiration rates expressed on a leaf area basis in WT and rms4, but decreased transpiration rates of rms2. The low-N treatment decreased leaf expansion by 20–25% and expanding leaflet N concentration by 15%. These changes were similar in all genotypes. At sap-flow rates equivalent to whole-plant transpiration, the low N treatment decreased X-CK in rms2 but had no discernible effect in WT and rms4. Since the low N treatment decreased transpiration of all genotypes, photoperiod CK delivery rates also decreased in all genotypes. The similar leaf growth response of all genotypes to N deprivation despite differences in both absolute and relative X-CKs and deliveries suggests that shoot N status is more important in regulating leaf expansion than xylem-supplied cytokinins. The decreased X-CK and transpiration rate of rms2 following N deprivation suggests that changes in xylem-supplied CKs may modify water use.\n</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to assess the acute and midterm outcome after stent implantation in the PDA. Between 1996 and 2002, ductal stenting was performed in 21 neonates and infants (14 females/7 males) to maintain pulmonary blood supply in cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). Balloon‐expandable stents were implanted in the PDA with a final diameter of 4–5 mm without procedural deaths. Stent patency was achieved for 8–1,130 days (median, 142). Reintervention was necessary in nine patients. Overall survival rate after 6 years was 86%. Two neonates died a few days after the procedure due to right heart failure not related to PDA stenting. Corrective surgery was possible in six patients. An additional aortopulmonary shunt was needed in three patients; Fontan type operations were performed in six. One patient died after bidirectional Glenn shunt, another five reached palliation by additional perforation of the atretic valve/balloon valvuloplasty, and two are awaiting surgery. We conclude that in many patients with cyanotic CHD, especially in those with ductal pulmonary perfusion and additional forward flow from the right ventricle, ductal stenting is an effective transcatheter approach. Morphology of the PDA predicts the risk of restenosis and necessity of reintervention. Growth of the pulmonary vascular bed allows corrective or palliative surgery, and some patients can be cured by the intervention alone.

However, initiatives for the regulation of the hard drug trade cannot be pursued at the international governmental level because the sale of hard drugs is forbidden by law. Therefore, what remains are initiatives at the local level. In a case study of the City of Rotterdam, an inventory is made of interventions on the supply side. It describes interventions initiated by both governmental and private organizations, including the closure of certain dealing addresses, public transport and other general regulations, reporting centers for drug-related nuisance (i.e., local government), and “self-regulation” of dealing addresses and drug consumption/selling rooms (i.e., private interventions). The argument here is for a different approach of (dosed) suppression and regulation (by public and private interventions). In this approach, the use of “quality criteria” for dealing addresses and the spread of dealing addresses are important instruments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Positive Channel Two Input Two Output (PCTITO) converter is a third Order MIMO DC-to-DC unidirectional and non-isolated switching converter that is derived from the non-inverting buck-boost converter. Negative and Dual Channel TITO converters are also presented. In steady state one of the PCTITO outputs is positive while the other is negative. Although the outputs could be regulated to provide different absolute values, an interesting application of the new converters is to provide symmetrical outputs (i.e. 15 V) to supply balanced loads. Since the absolute value of the outputs could be greater or smaller than the input voltage, the PCTITO converter will be suitable for present 14 V (from 9 to 16 V) or for future 42 V (from 30 to 50 V) automotive voltage distribution buses. To regulate the outputs two in phase equal-switching frequency PWM-based multivariable control loops have been designed. The closed-loop system must provide low audio susceptibility and good line and load regulation at both outputs. In addition, the common mode voltage between the two outputs that could appear in unbalanced load operation has to be minimized. With these general guidelines, several control parameter adjustments have been considered validated using an averaged model of the system, and tested by simulation.</jats:p>"

Milk and blood plasma, taken after 3 weeks of lactation, was examined on the concentration of amino acids (total amino acids in milk, free amino acids in plasma) and urea by ion exchange chromatography or autoanalyzer, respectively. The contents of almost all amino acids in milk were significantly higher compared with the native diet, when Val was supplemented, reflecting increasing milk protein concentrations. Highest amino acid concentrations were observed with 0.85% dietary Val. Amino acid pattern in milk was not affected by the Val supply. In blood plasma the concentration of free Val rose with the dietary Val from 9 mg/l (0.45% dietary Val) to 132 mg/l (1.45% dietary Val). Several other amino acid contents were also higher when Val was added to the native diet, but there was no dose–response. Urea concentrations in milk and blood plasma were lowest with 0.65% and 0.85% dietary Val, respectively. Conclusively, for sows nursing litters with 10–12 piglets a dietary valine supply of 0.85% (0.75% apparent ileal digestible Val) can be recommended with a minimum requirement of 0.65% (0.55% apparent ileal digestible Val).</jats:p>",

The electric power system of a vehicle consists of two major components: an alternator and a battery. A detailed understanding of the characteristics of the electric power system, electrical load demands and the operating environment, such as road conditions and vehicle laden weight, is required when the capacities of the generator and the battery are to be determined for a vehicle. In this study, a battery-alternator system has been developed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and data obtained from vehicle tests have been used as a basis for validating the models.

        "signified by a rapid increase in aggregate demand and shortages … The budget deficit reached … 19 per cent of GDP in 1991. The decision to liberalize 90 per cent of prices in January 1992 led to a price jump of 245 per cent and by the summer the monetary overhang had been eliminated. Efforts to tighten monetary policy in 1992–4 failed mainly due to attempts to preserve the rouble zone which after the break-up consisted of fifteen independent countries, each with their own central bank. And although the CBR [Central Bank of Russia], under the leadership of Viktor Gerashchenko, was the only one allowed to print roubles the central banks of other CIS countries (and initially also the Baltic States) could issue credits. This meant that monetary policy spun out of control … More countries started to introduce their own currency or issue monetary surro-gates. Furthermore, much of the credits issued by CIS central banks were used to finance imports of Russian commodities, mainly oil and gas, which meant that pressure was also put on the CBR and the Russian government by Russian exporters to continue looser monetary policy. As a result by mid-1992 the granting of concessional credits to agriculture and industry intensified. At the same time Russia was unable to increase tax revenues or reduce expenditures and as a result continued to run a large budget deficit. And without access to domestic capital markets and a lack of willingness by the West to lend money to Russia, the only source of finance was the printing presses. This policy resulted in a rapid growth of the money supply."
