      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of increased uncertainty on the agent's allocation decision is an intriguing general question and has recently received some systematic attention in the literature. Sandmo has analyzed the effect of savings rate uncertainty on the savings decision and both he and Leland have explored the effect of “income uncertainty” on the same decision. In addition, Leland has investigated the effects of uncertainty on optimal foreign exchange positions and both authors, Leland and Sandmo have begun an exploration of the effects of uncertain demand on the firm's output decision. Finally, Block and Heineke have analyzed the effect of income, savings rate, and wage uncertainty on the agent's labour allocation. However, in all of this work there has not been a geometric treatment of even a restricted case. The purpose of this note is to develop such an analysis for a special, but interesting labour allocation problem, and thereby derive the results of income uncertainty in a transparent fashion.</jats:p>",

There was a net retranslocation of 37.5% of the plant potassium in the 15 days following potassium cutoff. Blades and fibrous roots exported potassium readily, but petioles and beet tissue accumulated potassium even as the degree of deficiency increased. The eight oldest leaves (blade plus petiole) exported potassium throughout while the potassium in leaf 9 was relatively unchanged. Younger leaves were net importers of potassium.

However, this effect depends on the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ in the medium. ATP is shown to release a Ca2+ or Mg2+ inhibition of K+ uptake. If the Ca2+ or Mg2+ content of the medium is varied and EDTA used to mimic the effect of ATP, it can be demonstrated that the observed effect of ATP is entirely explicable by its chelation of divalent cations. Externally applied ATP has similar relative effects on K+ uptake under control conditions and under conditions where metabolism is inhibited, and although it apparently fully releases metabolic inhibition, these experiments reveal ambiguities which are discussed. It is con- cluded that apparent effects of externally applied ATP may often be indirect. The possibility of specific, i.e. energy-providing, effects can nevertheless not be ruled out in principle, but more sophisti- cated experimentation than found hitherto in the literature is required to demonstrate such effects.</jats:p>"

We tabulated the level and side of origin of the great anterior medullary artery. Previous authors have shown that in man the peak incidence of the great anterior medullary artery is at T‐10. The peak incidence in the monkey is at L‐1. There are other features of the arterial supply to the lumbo‐sacral cord of the monkey that are different from man.</jats:p>",

Air temperatures were not controlled. Dry matter, and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, were measured separately for tops and roots after harvest at 7 weeks. In a second experiment, the rate of early radicle elongation was measured for the two species in complete nutrient solutions at 10 and 20°.Water-bath temperature markedly influenced the growth of both roots and tops, growth with 20° being approximately double that with 10° in both species. At both bath temperatures, responses to superphosphate closely paralleled those observed previously on the same soil in the field. There was a slight positive interaction between bath temperature and superphosphate rate, but in the main the effects of the two factors were independent and additive. The results did not support the suggestion that reduced growth with low root temperature may be due primarily to reduced phosphorus uptake. Nor did they indicate reductions in nodulation, nitrogen fixation, or translocation of either nitrogen or phosphorus from roots to tops as likely causes. It is suggested that temperature may have directly affected the growth and/or metabolism of the roots, influencing their production of growth substances, which in turn influenced processes controlling top growth.</jats:p>"
