A somewhat unusual graphical method of making the trial and error computation discussed as Method I of the paper was devised and found to reduce considerably the amount of labor required for the computation. The graphical method is the subject of this letter. </jats:p>",

First, the research program has corrected a number of misconceptions about the possible effects of the normal use of household detergents by the American public on water supplies and sewage treatement misconceptions which otherwise might have been accepted by default; and second, it seems reasonable to assume from the findings so far that it will be possible, if necessary, to develop technological processes capable of handling any problems which may arise.</jats:p>",
