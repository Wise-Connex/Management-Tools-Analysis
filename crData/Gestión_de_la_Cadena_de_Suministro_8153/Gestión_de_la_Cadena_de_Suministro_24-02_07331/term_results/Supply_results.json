      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research aims to explore the complex interplay between supply chain resilience (SCR), digital supply chain (DSC), and sustainability, focusing on the moderating influence of supply chain dynamism. The goal is to understand how these elements interact within the framework of contemporary supply chain management and how they collectively contribute to enhancing sustainability outcomes. The sample size is 300 CEOs and managers. The study approach integrates quantitative research methods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is utilized to quantitatively analyze the direct and indirect effects of SCR and DSC on sustainability. The numerous surveys we conduct among supply chain ecosystem stakeholders provide a rich picture of practical implications and contextual nuances. In sum, our early findings generally support a positive relationship between SCR and sustainability in and of itself decrying the need for more resilient supply networks for sustainability. We further find the beneficial impact of digital technologies in promoting sustainability via enhancing environmental control and controlling for efficiency in supply chains. We also offer evidence to show that supply chain dynamism compounds the positive logic between SCR and DSC and sustainability. As a final word, it must be noted that our work speaks to the burgeoning Supply Chain Dynamism as moderator literature by examining the direct and contingent effects of SCR and DSC on not only performance but sustainability. By shedding light on the moderating role of dynamism, the study provides fresh insights into the multifaceted nature of supply chain management and sustainability practices. The study&amp;#039;s findings enhance theoretical understanding by elucidating the synergistic effects of SCR, DSC, and sustainability in dynamic supply chain settings. It augments existing theoretical frameworks by integrating concepts of resilience, digitalization, and sustainability into a comprehensive model. Practical and economical, the research offers actionable guidance for organizations aiming to improve sustainability performance through resilient and digitally advanced supply chains. By acknowledging the role of supply chain dynamism, managers can tailor strategies to manage disruptions effectively and leverage digital innovations. Economically, adopting sustainable practices can result in cost savings and competitive advantages. The research emphasizes the importance of aligning supply chain strategies with sustainability goals to drive long-term value and societal impact.</jats:p>"

Employing a rigorous data-driven approach, the research endeavors to address inventory allocation challenges inherent in the complex dynamics of a “cloud supply chain” through the implementation of a two-stage model. Initially, machine learning is harnessed for demand forecasting, subsequently refined through the empirical distribution of forecast errors, culminating in the optimization of inventory allocation across various service levels.The empirical evaluation draws upon data derived from a reputable home appliance logistics company in China, revealing that, under conditions of ample data, the application of data-driven methods for inventory allocation surpasses the performance of traditional methods across diverse supply chain structures. Specifically, there is an improvement in accuracy by approximately 13% in an independent structure and about 16% in a dependent structure. This study transcends the constraints associated with examining a singular node, adopting an innovative research perspective that intricately explores the interplay among multiple nodes while elucidating the nuanced considerations germane to supply chain structure. Furthermore, it underscores the methodological significance of relying on extensive, large-scale data. The investigation brings to light the substantial impact of supply chain structure on safety stock allocation. In the context of a market characterized by highly uncertain demand, the strategic adaptation of the supply chain structure emerges as a proactive measure to avert potential disruptions in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of sustainable practices within hospital supply chains has never been more pronounced than in the contemporary healthcare landscape, particularly in the wake of global health challenges. This research paper extends the discourse on sustainable hospital supply chain management (SHSCM) by examining the role of Technology Supply Chain Applications (TSCAs) as a catalyst for Sustainable Societal Advancement (SSA). Drawing from a substantial sample size of 401 respondents and employing factor analysis via structural equation modeling (SEM), the study upholds methodological integrity and rigor. The paper unveils a novel perspective on how TSCAs can revolutionize SHSCM by promoting efficiency, transparency, and collaboration, which are crucial for societal progression in the post-pandemic era. The findings affirm both hypotheses, with the data revealing a significant positive relationship between TSCAs and SHSCM, and between CIF-infused SHSCM and SSA. The implications of these relationships are manifold, indicating that the integration of technology within hospital supply chains is not merely a facilitator of internal process improvements but also a strategic contributor to societal well-being. The paper also navigates through the complexities of implementing TSCAs in SHSCM, presenting a balanced viewpoint by considering the limitations, such as the study's geographical and demographic specificity, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Beyond confirming the positive impact of TSCAs on SHSCM and SSA, the research offers actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers. It emphasizes the need for strategic investments in technology to enhance the resilience and sustainability of hospital supply chains. The study concludes by advocating for a concerted effort towards embedding technology at the core of hospital supply chains. This strategic pivot is crucial not only for the recovery of healthcare systems but also for laying the foundation for a more sustainable and socially responsible future. It highlights the need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach that leverages technology to overcome current challenges and drive forward the agenda of sustainable development within healthcare and beyond. Through this research, a compelling case is made for the strategic enhancement of technology within hospital supply chains as a means to foster societal advancement, providing a blueprint for future research endeavors aimed at bolstering the global healthcare landscape.</jats:p>"

All 270 food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya registered by Kenya Association of Manufacturers (2022) were considered using the census approach. Target population for the research was one participant from logistics, supply chain or operations department at each of the registered food and beverage manufacturing firms. Primary and secondary data was used, the primary data was collected using semi structured questionnaire that was administered by the researcher and research assistants. Samples of the questionnaire were pilot tested to test the reliability and validity before full scale data collection. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics while the inferential analysis was further carried out using structural equation modelling, ANOVA and regression coefficients to give effect of the explanatory variable.&#x0D;\nFindings: The study found out that supply chain visibility significantly influenced the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya at both when there was a moderator and without a moderating variable, supply chain technology. In the first model without moderator, it recorded a standardized estimate of 0.538 (p&lt;0.000), indicating that as supply chain visibility increases, performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms also increases. Fit indices on structural equation modelling revealed a marginal fit with a chi-square test of 211.322 with 86 degrees of freedom  (P-value =0.0492). The structural path for structural equation modelling from supply chain visibility to supply chain performance remains positive and significant. Standardized estimate of 1.347 and p-value was 0.001&lt;0.05. Which indicates that the variability of supply chain visibility on the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms could be explained by 53.8% when no moderator is included and increased to 134.7% when ,moderator, supply chain technology is incorporated thereby indicating a stronger relationship. The other fit indices that gave a satisfactory model fit when the moderator supply chain technology was used are RMR=.9196, GFI=.9263, NFI= .9473, RMSEA=.0184 and CFI=.9369 which implies that the model was fit to determine the relationship between supply chain visibility and performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya and therein make conclusions and recommendations. ANOVA, regression coefficient and model summary (R2) were also used and indicated significance for there use with all recording p-value of 0.000&lt;0.05.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: System theory of management was adopted and validated. By incorporating supply chain enabling technologies in the management and planning of production in a manufacturing firm, it has the potential of revolutionizing the business environment hence increasing flow of raw materials and other items into the company’s production plant, warehouses or retail locations in an effort to create visibility and enhanced performance. The theory can assist Kenya and the manufacturing firms in developing policies and strategies to assist manufacturing sector while creating competitive advantages through supply chain visibility. The study found out that some of the important supply chain mapping strategies to enhance performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms is supply chain visibility and supply chain technology.    </jats:p>"

Aspects of the raw material potential of critical or strategic mineral resources in Europe, its further exploration, and the concept of modifying factors are considered, and reporting systems of resources and reserves are described, underpinned by examples of mineral potentials in different regions of the EU. Thus, targeted exploration of raw materials, especially within the framework of national geological research, serves to support a sustainable and resilience supply chain. EU projects, such as GeoERA and Geological Service for EU, assist in shaping the tailor-made exploration programs fit for providing mineral data publicly available through EuroGeoSurveys’ European Geological Data Infrastructure.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. PT IMP is a company engaged in the production of metal frames located in Cikarang and is committed to producing the best quality products with national standards, in the right amount and time. In fact, there are still some obstacles in the material procurement process such as difficulties in selecting suppliers that match the criteria, delays in the arrival of raw materials which result in obstruction of the production process and product distribution until the ToP cannot be met. An evaluation of the company's ongoing material procurement performance is needed. This research measures the company's performance using the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) Model, which divides supply chain activities into five core processes, namely plan, source, make, deliver and return. Each process consists of 3 levels. The mapped SCOR model consists of 5 core processes at level 1, 17 performance matrices at level 2, and 25 KPIs at level 3. SCOR model performance weighting is carried out using supporting methods, namely the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and normalization. The overall SCOR performance value measurement result is 61.51. Based on the company's performance indicator monitoring system, the performance value currently achieved is in the average category, because it is in the value range of 50-70. Therefore, improvements need to be made to improve the current material procurement performance value. Proposed improvements are made in the form of proposed strategies based on 25 KPIs that affect the achievement of material procurement performance values. The proposed improvement strategy is designed based on Lean Supply Chain principles, through the application of Gemba Kaizen which consists of 14 proposed strategies.\r\nAbstrak. PT. IMP merupakan perusahaan yang bergerak di bidang produksi rangka metal yang berada di Cikarang dan berkomitmen untuk menghasilkan produk dengan kualitas terbaik berstandar nasional, dalam jumlah dan waktu yang tepat. Kenyataannya masih terjadi beberapa kendala pada proses pengadaan materialnya seperti kesulitan dalam memilih supplier yang sesuai dengan kriteria, keterlambatan datangnya bahan baku yang berakibat terhambatnya proses produksi dan distribusi produk sampai dengan ToP yang tidak dapat terpenuhi. Diperlukan evaluasi kinerja pengadaan material perusahaan yang sedang berjalan. Penelitian ini mengukur kinerja perusahaan dengan menggunakan Model Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR), yang membagi aktivitas rantai pasok kedalam lima proses inti, yaitu plan, source, make, delivery dan return. Masing-masing proses terdiri atas 3 level. Model SCOR yang dipetakan terdiri dari 5 proses inti pada level 1, 17 matriks kinerja pada level 2, dan 25 KPI pada level 3. Pembobotan kinerja model SCOR dilakukan menggunkan metode pendukung, yaitu metode Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) dan normalisasi. Hasil pengukuran nilai kinerja SCOR secara keseluruhan adalah 61,51. Berdasarkan sistem monitoring indikator kinerja perusahaan, nilai kinerja yang dicapai saat ini berada pada kategori rata-rata, karena berada pada rentang nilai 50-70. Oleh karena itu, perlu dilakukan perbaikan untuk meningkatkan nilai kinerja pengadaan material saat ini. Usulan perbaikan dibuat dalam bentuk usulan strategi berdasarkan 25 KPI yang berpengaruh terhadap pencapaian nilai kinerja pengadaan material. Usulan strategi perbaikan dirancang berdasarkan prinsip Lean Supply Chain, melalui penerapan Gemba Kaizen yang terdiri dari 14 usulan strategi.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Climate change, water scarcity and pollution, and growing water demand across all sectors are stressing existing water supply systems, highlighting the need for alternative water supply (AWS) systems. AWS systems are those that have not typically existed in the traditional supply portfolio of a given service area but may be used to reduce the pressure on traditional water resources and potentially improve the system’s resilience. AWS systems have been used for decades, often where traditional systems are unable to maintain sufficient quantity and quality of water supply. Simpler forms of AWS systems, like rainwater harvesting, have been used for centuries. As human population and water demand have increased, AWS systems now play a larger role in the broader supply portfolio, but these systems alone are not able to fully resolve the increasingly complex mix of problems contributing to water stress. Entrenched challenges that go beyond technical issues include low institutional capacity for developing, operating, and maintaining AWS systems; monitoring water quality; more efficiently using available resources; and establishing clear responsibilities among governments, service providers, and property owners. Like traditional water supply systems, AWS systems should be developed within a sustainability-focused framework that incorporates scenario planning to account for evolving natural and institutional conditions. In ASEAN, the adoption of AWS systems varies among countries and provides context-specific lessons for water management around the world. This article provides an overview of AWS systems in the region, including rainwater harvesting, graywater recycling, wastewater reclamation, desalination, and stormwater harvesting.</p>"

Various supply contract forms have been studied in the existing literature to facilitate supply chain coordination. However, most existing literature has established coordination models assuming constant production costs. In reality, per-unit production costs often decrease as production quantity increases, which is called the learning effect. This paper underscores the significance of considering this learning effect in decision-making processes for coordinated supply contracts. We propose a supply contract scheme for channel coordination that incorporates the learning effect within a supply chain comprising a single manufacturer and a single retailer. In this framework, the manufacturer acts as a Stackelberg leader, initiating the process by designing and presenting the contract. The supply contract scheme is designed to ensure that the retailer’s order quantity aligns with the global solution. We also demonstrate how the contract parameters are determined when the relative bargaining powers of the supply chain members are given exogenously in the market. Our findings reveal that contracts with a learning curve can generate additional profits for both the manufacturer and the retailer compared to the existing coordinated contracts with static production costs. This study provides valuable insights into the impact of the learning effect on supply chain efficiency and offers practical implications for supply chain practitioners.</jats:p>"

Our findings reveal an 8% relative decrease in imports for French firms sourcing inputs from Japan, with more substantial declines for those highly reliant on Japanese suppliers. This is coupled with a 12.8% relative increase in imports from China for these exposed firms. Additionally, we discover that this transition is primarily driven by the top 5% of large firms and is prominently observed within the automotive sector. Regarding the transmission of input shortages through the global supply chain, we find that this shock only affects the exports of firms with the lowest levels of inventory, exhibiting variations across sectors and a time-dependent pattern.

Renewable energy‐oriented LESCM practices are effective tools for proactive and leading manufacturing organizations, making them socially and environmentally responsible enterprises. In this context, our research focuses on understanding how LESCM implementation by companies may indirectly impact firms' financial success, through facilitating the adoption of blockchain technology (BT). Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the adoption of BT on reducing business operating costs and improving the business's environmental performance. To answer these research questions, we have used survey data from 189 Bangladeshi manufacturing firms, a developing country facing unique challenges and opportunities in the realm of sustainable business practices. Through rigorous analysis and robust statistical methods, we substantiate our hypotheses, shedding light on the positive associations between LESCM practices, BT adoption, financial performance, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature network analysis and identify trends in I4.0 and HSCs. We posit the need to instill into current HSC efforts the quadruple bottom-line (cultural, economic, environmental, and social) pillars of sustainability and define a Sustainable Humanitarian Supply Chain (SHSC). Based on the extant literature and ongoing practice, we highlight how I4.0 technologies can aid SHSC stages from disaster risk assessment to preparedness to response to relief. The complex nature of SHSCs requires a holistic and multidisciplinary approach and collaboration by scholars, policymakers, and industry practitioners to pool solution resources. We offer future research venues in this fledgling but life-saving scientific discipline. SHSCs can be empowered with I4.0 technologies, a much needed direction in our climate-changed world.</jats:p>"

Against this background, this study assumed that the relationships of supply chain participants were a key element of supply chain performance and explored paths for relationship optimization. For the empirical analysis, a survey was conducted with employees working in supply chain-related jobs in South Korea. A total of 350 questionnaires were included in the analysis, and a structural equation model was used for hypothesis testing. The two dimensions of interactional justice, namely interpersonal justice and informational justice, were found to have a significant positive impact on the factors of the triangular theory of love. Hence, perceiving justice when transacting with counterparts within the supply chain is vital for enhancing levels of intimacy, passion, and commitment. While passion and commitment showed a significant positive influence on relationship performance, intimacy did not. These results reflect the current supply chain environment, indicating that an appropriate level of passion and commitment is necessary for members constructing a supply chain. This study demonstrates that behavioral science factors commonly observed in interpersonal relationships can also be explored in business relationships, thus highlighting its interdisciplinary relevance. The results have practical implications for companies considering supply chain relational dynamics.</jats:p>",

This trend is particularly prevalent among online customer bases. The root cause of this issue lies in the absence of an effective tool for measuring online customer satisfaction that surpasses the capabilities of existing methods. To address this concern, a quantitative study explored the dimensions of online customer satisfaction measurement and established a model applicable across industries for gauging and predicting online customer satisfaction. This was accomplished by conducting an online survey via SurveyMonkey with 384 respondents, employing supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in conjunction with the topic modeling algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The findings of this study revealed a significant relationship between predictor variables such as navigation, playfulness, information quality, trust, personalization, and responsiveness and the target variable, online customer satisfaction, employing multiple linear modeling (LSM). Furthermore, it was observed that this phenomenon transcends age groups, impacting both younger and older customers alike. However, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations, including the risk of overfitting, challenges in establishing external validity, a narrow focus on the retail sector (B2C), and a restricted scope limited to the United States market.</jats:p>"

However, the liquid temperature in the double-suction pump remains almost constant, using the entropy production or dissipation method to evaluate energy loss is difficult. The traditional analysis method based on pressure drop cannot quantify the internal energy changes in each component. To solve this problem, a pressure energy loss evaluation approach is developed on the basis of the pressure drop theoretical analysis and numerical prediction, and the effects of cavitation on the energy loss are investigated. The structure of the volute casing is improved to enhance the performance based on energy loss analysis and cavitation behaviour prediction. The results show that the energy loss efficiencies for the suction casing, impeller, and volute casing are 0.55, 4.6, and 5%, respectively, at the design flow rate. The proportion of energy loss in the impeller and volute casing increased with a decrease in NPSHa. The RNG k–ε and k–ω turbulence models are chosen for the numerical simulation, and the numerically predicted results are verified experimentally.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the M1B-induced momentum manifests only over economic expansion, rather than economic recession. Both the reversal and the momentum can be partly explained by unrealized capital gains, implying the disposition effect to some extent driving both phenomena since Grinblatt and Han (2005) used unrealized capital gains as a proxy for the disposition effect. We further find the reversal primarily occurring in January, implying reverse disposition trading occurring before the beginning of a year. As there are no capital gain taxes levied in Taiwan, the reverse disposition trading cannot be related to tax-loss selling as in U.S. Furthermore, time-varying market risk exposure cannot explain the reversal in most cases. For the March-December momentum, apart from unrealized capital gains, the CAPM and the Fama-French 3-factor models can each to some extent explain the momentum.\n\nJEL classification numbers: G10, G11, G19.\nKeywords: Price momentum; Reversal; Disposition effect; Emerging stock market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Prefabricated construction has less environmental pollution, less resource consumption, and high productivity. This new construction model is an important tool for the construction industry to achieve sustainable development. However, disruptions in the prefabricated construction supply chain (PCSC) frequently occur in practice, which seriously reduces the performance of prefabricated building projects. Improving the resilience of the prefabricated construction supply chain (RPCSC) is an urgent problem to be solved. This study first identified the factors influencing the RPCSC through a comprehensive literature review. Next, 13 experts were invited to summarize and integrate these factors, and 11 concepts were obtained. Finally, the fuzzy cognitive maps method is applied to evaluate the impact of these concepts on the RPCSC and the interaction between them. The results show that the main factors are relationship quality of members, laws and regulations, information exchange/analysis, Professional management personnel/Labor quality, and R&amp;D. Moreover, this study reveals the effect of these factors individually or synergistically influencing the RPCSC. This study provides valuable insights for governments and members of the prefabricated construction supply chain. The related findings can help reduce the risk of disruption in the prefabricated supply chain, improving the productivity and low-carbon performance of prefabricated construction.</p>"

However, supply chains have always been hit rock bottom by scandals and controversies. In this review paper, we have explored the advancement and research gaps, of blockchain technology (BT) in supply chain management (SCM). We have used the Prisma framework for systematic literature review (SLR) and included a minuscule amount of grey literature to reduce publication bias. We found that supply chain traceability and transparency is the most researched objective in SCM. There was hardly any research in supply chain resilience. Further, we found that 40 % of the papers were application based. Most articles have focused on the advantages of BT, rather than analyzing it critically. This study will help identify gaps and, suitable actions to be followed for an efficient implementation of BT in SCM.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Purpose- Central banks serve as institutions responsible for executing monetary policy in countries, with the primary objective of managing the money supply and ensuring price stability in the economy. These institutions formulate and implement monetary policies, controlling interest rates, maintaining price stability, managing exchange rates, and overseeing the banking sector. Through the use of both traditional and modern tools, such as policy interest rates, reserve requirements, rediscount policies, and open market operations, central banks aim to uphold stability in the economy and financial system. The economic literature extensively explores the theoretical and empirical effects of central banks' expansive and contractionary policies on inflation. This study specifically investigates the practices of selected country central banks regarding monetary policy, with a focus on understanding the relationship between money supply and inflation. The objective is to unveil the impacts of these policies on countries' macroeconomic variables and identify determinants influencing the selection of effective policies and tools in central banks' pursuit of price stability-oriented monetary policy practices.\nMethodology- One of the tools central banks employ to intervene in the market is the manipulation of the money supply, influencing macroeconomic variables through expansive and contractionary policies. This study analyzes the impact of central banks' monetary policies using PanelVAR analysis for the period 2005–2022. The initial model features inflation as the dependent variable, while independent variables include money supply, policy interest rates, growth, current account deficit, budget deficit, and unemployment. These variables are modeled as annual percentage changes, with the money supply variable included as a level value after logarithmic transformation. Subsequent models are constructed with each independent variable as the dependent variable, adhering to the assumptions of VAR models. To address the stationarity condition of unit roots, cross-sectional dependencies in panel data series are tested. Following the identification of cross-sectional dependency issues, second-generation unit root tests are applied. After stationary analyses, VAR analysis is conducted, cointegration vectors are identified, and error correction models are established for further analysis. Finally, impact response analysis determines the size of the effects of the macroeconomic variables used in the analysis, and Granger causality analysis is applied to ascertain the direction of causality.\nFindings- In the model for controlling the money supply, the alternative hypothesis is accepted, supporting a statistically significant relationship or a cause-and-effect relationship among policy interest rate, growth, inflation, unemployment rate, current account deficit, and budget deficit variables. In the analysis where inflation is the dependent variable, long-term cointegration between money supply, inflation, and policy interest rate is identified. There is a bidirectional causal relationship between the money supply variable and inflation and policy interest rate. A causality relationship from the current account deficit variable to the money supply is determined, but causality from the money supply to the current account deficit variable cannot be established. Causality relationships are identified between policy interest rate and inflation, money supply, growth, and current account deficit variables, with the direction of the relationship being from inflation to policy interest rate, from growth variable to policy interest rate, and from the current account deficit variable to policy interest rate. A bidirectional causality relationship is found between unemployment and growth variables, and a unidirectional causality relationship from inflation. Additionally, a bidirectional causality relationship is identified between growth and inflation variables. From the growth variable to the budget deficit variable, a unidirectional causality relationship is found. When examining impact-response graphs, a unit change in the money supply variable results in a sudden increase in the inflation variable, and this response does not dampen for 12 periods. When examining the inflation variable, a unit change in itself requires 10 periods from the perspective of money supply and 7 periods from the perspective of policy interest rate to dampen the effect.\nConclusion-The formulation of monetary policy within the framework of country dynamics, specifically through policy interest rates and inflation, ensures measured responses from other macroeconomic variables. Conscious management of the long-term cointegration between money supply, inflation, and policy interest rate plays a crucial role in effectively managing the economy. A unit shock applied to the money supply variable has a prolonged impact on inflation, lasting for 12 periods without damping. An uncontrolled inflation problem in the long term could lead to chronic issues. Balancing the impact of money supply through policy interest rates is thus crucial. In line with economic theories, policymakers and economists are advised to implement monetary policies under the assumption of the Post-Keynesian view, which asserts that money supply is intrinsic for maintaining economic stability and controlling inflation. Considering the bidirectional causality relationship between inflation and money supply, it is emphasized that structural factors are essential in controlling price changes, and solely relying on money supply may not be an effective tool. Therefore, within this framework, a structural approach is recommended.\n\nKeywords: Money supply, inflation, monetary policy, central banks, PanelVAR.\nJEL Codes: E51, E52, E31, C32\n</jats:p>"

Products that are decaying, or those that change over time, have a high sensitivity to the environment in terms of temperature, carbon emission, humidity, waste disposal, etc. This study develops a profit maximization model in the presence of deterioration, preservation, imperfect production, inspection error, rework, stock and price-dependent demand. The three carbon emission strategies are proposed to reduce the expenses in different carbon emissions scenarios. The suggested approach may be used to determine the optimal production period, preservation investment, and level of green investment. The solution of the non-linear constraint optimization is provided by using a penalty method in metaheuristic approaches.  In order to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the essential model parameters, a numerical example is presented. The soft computing results produced by DE and PSO are compared with the results obtained by Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) technique.</p>"

The concerned model’s objective function is minimizing the total supply chain costs in addition to maximizing greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In a bid to identify the most suitable dams for establishing the floating photovoltaic system, the hybrid approach by applying the fuzzy best-worst method and the TOPSIS technique is first exploited.

The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the performance and optimize the existing Sekota water supply distribution system using Bentley Water GEMS.The system's hydraulic modeling is carried out by considering as a continuous supply system, and the evaluation procedure used the extended period simulation approach after calibration was done. Calibration is used to ensure the performance of the model using the observed pressure values. The output of the existing system shows pressure is very high means above the maximum pressure and velocity is very low at peak hour demand. The results of velocity and pressure before optimization have negative effect on the performance of the system. The number of pipes and junctions their velocities and pressures which were in admissible ranges are 15 and 42 pipes for velocities and zero and 59 junctions for pressure before and after optimization were evaluated respectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The practice of sourcing from the point of global in an inclined market for goods, materials, also the services, required across geographical boundaries have become an important futuristic aspect in concurrence with supply chain. Global sourcing often aims to be very explicit, on the global efficiencies on the delivery of the product, also on the requirement of the services in supply chain. The efficiencies in particular include low skilled labor, low cost raw materials, and minimum wastage. In the large number of information technology projects, also in service application, mobile apps, also in data base service are outsourced globally for more economic pricing. Global sourcing include hidden cost, in pricing, associated with different culture, with exposure to financial, also political risk, being for manufactured goods, which has the disadvantage of longer lead time, risk at ports, interrupting supply chain, also of difficulty in monitoring quality of product in supply chain.  Global sourcing is the practice of sourcing materials, components, products, from the global market. Goods and services across geographical boundary in supply chain, in which is sourcing often aims to exploit global efficiency in delivery of product and service. In a global sourcing in futuristic management is that manufacturing cost, are generally lower, while business organization can often buy goods at a lower price. Global sourcing from international market aims to exploit global efficiency, such as lower price, cost of skilled labor, cheaper raw materials, and economy facing lower trade tariff. Global sourcing in futuristic management is the process that the organization buys the product it needs or requires from the any organization globally. The high tech products that are selected in the market are to be global sourcing and supply chain management. Supply chain global sourcing does simplifies the communication, optimizing the procedures between vendors, customers, thus making it easier for the development markets, to stay connected in any part of the global economy in supply chain</jats:p>",

This study uses the environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIOA) and structural path analysis (SPA) methods to investigate the dynamic variation of China’s embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions in 20 economic sectors from 2000 to 2020, aiming to determine the key supply chain and key sectors. The results reveal that from the final demand perspective, the sector with the highest embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions has changed from “Agriculture” in 2000 to “Construction” in 2010 to “Other service and activities’ in 2020. The top listed supply chain path of embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions has also evolved (starting from production to consumption) from “Agriculture→Rural consumption” in 2000 to “Agriculture→Food and tobacco→Urban consumption” in 2010 to “Agriculture→ Urban consumption” in 2020. Notably, the high ranked path, “Agriculture→Food and tobacco→Rural consumption”, shows that the embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission flowing between agriculture and the food industry cannot be ignored. The supply chain path “Coal Mining→Nonmetal Mineral Products→Construction→Capital Formation” has risen from the 17th position in 2000 to the 3rd position in 2020. Thus, it is necessary to control CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from sectors upstream, which are predominantly influenced by the construction industry, and a coordinated effort between sectors is also required to effectively reduce emissions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of China's supply chain over the past two decades. In particular, it suggests policy interventions by controlling critical supply chain paths and key sectors associated with embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission, thereby facilitating the coordinated reduction of anthropogenic CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions.</jats:p>"

Inventori harus ada karena akan menetukan tingkat pelayanan yang mampu diberikan perusahaan kepada konsumennya, namun tidak boleh berlebihan karena akan berkaitan dengan biaya simpan inventori dan kemungkinan inventori tersebut akan rusak, hilang atau kadaluwarsa. Berdasarkan bentuknya, inventori dapat diklasifikasikan menjadi bahan baku, barang setengah jadi dan produk jadi. Berdasarkan fungsinya, inventori bisa dibedakan menjadi Pipeline/transit inventory,cycle stock, persediaan pengaman (safety stock), dan anticipation stock. Menurut (Waters, 2003), total biaya menyimpan inventori biasanya mencapai sekitar 25% dari nilai inventori tersebut dalam setahun. Jumlah ini merupakan sebuah angka yang sangat besar sehingga sangat diupayakan untuk diturunkan, namun bukan berarti harus meniadakan jumlah inventori. Inventori tetap harus ada karena ini berkaitan dengan service level perusahaan, yang harus dilakukan adalah bagaimana mengelola biaya-biaya yang digunakan untuk inventori tersebut. Biaya dalam mengelola inventori ini dapat diklasifikasikan sebagai biaya unit (unit cost), biaya pemesanan (ordering cost), biaya penyimpanan, dan biaya kekurangan (shortage cost). Biaya penyimpanan itu sendiri terdiri dari biaya modal, biaya layanan persediaan, biaya ruang penyimpanan, dan biaya resiko persediaan. Salah satu keputusan penting dalam manajemen inventori adalah ukuran pemesanan karena kan memberikan pengaruh pada frekuensi pemesanan dan rata-rata inventori yang akan disimpan oleh perusahaan. Salah satu model sederhana yang biasa digunakan dalam pemesanan inventori adalah metode Economic Order Quantity.

The result of the research validated the benefits that the gradual implementation of the technology presented to the company in terms of utility, time, and quantity of production, which were related in degrees of uncertainty with variables that were labeled as “high,” “medium,” and “low.” The established membership was validated through fuzzy graphs, showing the company’s status, and adjusted with the appropriateness of the technology until profits were placed within the “high” range. Thus, fuzzy logic is a tool that helps measure variables in degrees of belonging, with words used by business people to make it more understandable.

The August 2023 wildfires on the island of Maui, Hawaii, USA, have highlighted weaknesses at this intersection. While attention has focused on the wildfire causes or water quality impacts afterward, few studies have analyzed the response. We review this extreme case to support disaster-response lessons for water utilities and to guide further research and policy. First, emergency water releases were not available in a timely manner. Second, fire and wind toppled power lines, causing power outages that inhibited pumping water. Third, many structures were a total loss despite water doused on them, consuming valuable water. Finally, water was lost through damaged premise plumbing in burned structures, further reducing system pressure. These conditions emphasize that water utilities need to access emergency water supplies quickly, establish reliable backup electricity, coordinate with firefighters on priority water uses, and shut valves in burned areas to preserve water. While further research will certainly follow, we present these early lessons as starting points.</jats:p>"

The goal of this study was to conduct a literature review on data flow implementations in management systems of wood supply chains and to evaluate their applicability in supply chains to analyze the opportunities for improving them in practice. Recent findings We utilized the ScienceDirect database, Scopus and Web of Science in order to document data flows in systems and actual applications. Due to ongoing outsourcing, the wood procurement chains, and the wood supply chains were identified in the forest industry. Several different technologies can be implemented also in wood supply chains to digitalize the data flow depending on the specific needs of organizations. In this regard, digitalization of Big Data causes significant changes in elements of supply models that should be integrated and standardized in the optimization and simulation systems. Summary A modelling guide is suggested for accurate dynamic solution of problems of forest logistics. Then, the opportunities in digitalization for connecting different data flows, technologies, and stakeholders are discussed thoroughly. We conclude that data-driven dynamic optimization, and locally implemented digitalization contributes to wood supply modeling in the establishment of standards for cloud-based platforms at time-related and sequential measures which will ensure successful forest logistics through the planning and the monitoring of wood supply chains.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the implications of various standards being proposed to certify that the grid electricity used is renewable. The standards vary in how strictly they match the renewable generation to the electrolyser demand in time and space. Using an energy system model, we compare electricity procurement strategies to meet a constant hydrogen demand for selected European countries in 2025 and 2030. We compare cases where no additional renewable generators are procured with cases where the electrolyser demand is matched to additional supply from local renewable generators on an annual, monthly or hourly basis. We show that local additionality is required to guarantee low emissions. For the annually and monthly matched case, we demonstrate that baseload operation of the electrolysis leads to using fossil-fuelled generation from the grid for some hours, resulting in higher emissions than the case without hydrogen demand. In the hourly matched case, hydrogen production does not increase system-level emissions, but baseload operation results in high costs for providing constant supply if only wind, solar and short-term battery storage are available. Flexible operation or buffering hydrogen with storage, either in steel tanks or underground caverns, reduces the cost penalty of hourly versus annual matching to 7%–8%. Hydrogen production with monthly matching can reduce system emissions if the electrolysers operate flexibly or the renewable generation share is large. The largest emission reduction is achieved with hourly matching when surplus electricity generation can be sold to the grid. We conclude that flexible operation of the electrolysis should be supported to guarantee low emissions and low hydrogen production costs.</jats:p>",

The decision to make supply chain operations sustainable is no longer an option for many organisations. The question is not “should we do it? but how can we implement sustainable supply chain management practices?” &lt;strong&gt;Study level/applicability:&lt;/strong&gt; This case has been developed for management institutes and schools that teach undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Sustainability has become an essential module in management curriculums; thus, this case is relevant for management programmes (operations, logistics, supply chain management, business studies, and management). &lt;strong&gt;Case overview:&lt;/strong&gt; This case highlights the achievements of Rameshwaram (plant head at the Nirlep factory of Bajaj Electrical Ltd.) and his team for successfully completing a sustainability initiative—Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL)—in a short span of six months. This case is divided into two parts: the first part presents their initiatives in making all echelons of their supply chain sustainable; the second part specifically outlines how they achieved Zero Waste to Landfill in one of the manufacturing operations in a short span of six months. A cross-functional team was put together to plan and implement the ZWTL project. Initially, the team encountered many challenges, such as poor quantification of waste at the factory site, inadequate infrastructure for waste segregation, a lack of vendor participation, and extensive training of vendors and employees as needed to ensure project compliance. However, with sustained efforts, the goal was achieved. As a result, BEL became the first Indian company in the sector to achieve 99% diversion from landfills for the waste generated at the Nirlep factory in 2021. It translated into a dramatic reduction of adverse environmental impacts. Monetary benefits were also realized by utilizing the waste for commercial use. As customers across the globe appreciated their efforts, their brand equity increased severalfold. &lt;strong&gt;Expected learning outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The case establishes that supply chain sustainability initiatives can never be completely successful without the unanimous engagement of internal and external stakeholders. In present times, the foundation of business performance has moved away from financial profitability only to the “triple bottom line,” which incorporates environment and social responsibility. The choice between commercial viability and sustainability is no longer available to the companies, as they need to integrate environmental and social goals within their businesses and provide transparency on sustainable performance and value to not only all stakeholders but also policymakers and consumers.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

One such device is the Vents TwinFresh regenerative installation. Twin Fresh install in the structure of the outer wall. The task of follow-up is to increase the efficiency of its work. Studies of heat exchange processes in the thin channels of the heat regenerator carried out. Channels with different thermophysical properties are studied. Experimental uncertainty decreases with better thermal insulation of the investigational stand. It is confirmed by the decrease in overheating and the heat transfer coefficient of the external surface thermal insulation when its thickness increases. Overcoming the critical diameter of the insulation of the experimental installation allows to minimize the measurement error, which takes into account the influence of heat exchange processes of the outer surface of the insulation with the environment. It is necessary to determine not the critical but the expedient diameter of the insulation. When using the appropriate thickness of thermal insulation, the temperatures on the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe have practically the same value. Thus, it is possible to take temperature readings of thin tubes from the outside, not from the inside, with the same accuracy. Accordingly, the design of the test stands for experimental research is simplified. The scope of application of the appropriate diameter of thermal insulation is not limited only to studies of heat transfer. This concept can used in any systems, equipment, and techniques that require insulating materials.</jats:p>"

The proposed architecture uses an eco-friendly federated learning AI-driven paradigm with cutting-edge Quondam Signature Algorithm technology and efficient encryption. The research also uses Modified Lean Six Sigma for sustainable supply chain management. The framework combines these aspects to synergistically increase IIIoT systems cyber resilience and environmental sustainability. The proposed work explores advanced encryption and process optimization methods to develop robust security architecture and advance safe and environmentally friendly IIIoT applications in supply chain management. We analyze cost-in-communication systems, focusing on federated learning and encryption. The suggested method uses an online/offline system, an elliptic curve digital signature technique, and online phase signature generation to combine offline phase calculations and optimize temporal complexity. Since it uses federated learning and encryption, the proposed method looks to improve efficiency and lower communication costs. This proposed work also shows that the recommended technique reduces communication costs, improves analytical capabilities, and protects IIoT systems from various attacks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance. The original studies of water supply network and network exploitation data, as well as international experience, applied in similar conditions, and the data of existing literature, data of works on water supply zoning, which were carried out in the networks of various settlements in the Republic of Armenia, have been improved and are now being implemented effectively through the clear procedure developed by us. In our case, zoning is carried out under the conditions of the existing system, therefore the methods developed during design and reconstruction work consider the features of the existing system.Aim. To develop a technique to enhance the efficiency of water supply systems by implementing network zoning. It involves transforming the network into hydraulically separated zones isolated from each other. Within each zone, water supply can be regulated based on consumption requirements. Objects. The article discusses issues related to design and reconstruction procedures of existing water supply network zones. It defines the priority of zoning implementation for the current stage and proposes a method for assessing the permissible level of losses, taking into account the technical condition of the water supply network. Methods. The calculations for this study were performed using well-known hydraulic principles and laws. Experimental studies were conducted directly on the water supply network under production conditions. Results. The actual implementation of these measures in various urban locations revealed that reduction in water usage in a service zone was only 8–10%. However, analysis of the functioning of the reconstructed zones led to the conclusion that the already constructed zones now offer suitable conditions for productive work on leak detection and elimination. In the given example, during the operation of the study zone, 4300 m (about 25%) of the existing 17400 m pipelines in the reconstruction zone were decommissioned, along with 13 of 22 pumping stations. Over two years of work, the cost of electricity at the existing yard pumping stations was reduced by more than six times, the total cost of electricity in the zone was reduced by more than twelve times, and the amount of water entering the zone was reduced by 44% as a result of the water supply system reconstruction presented in the example.  </jats:p>"

Public ownership of water infrastructure is prevalent in most European countries. In the Czech Republic, however, water infrastructure is highly fragmented, which entails multiple risks. The fragmentation of the sector leads to a low economic efficiency of operations, the unstable quality of service provision, and significant price differences. The aim of the paper is to use the IFE matrix to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different ways of operating water supply systems in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, through the FMEA method (failure mode and effects analysis), this paper tries to identify the risks and threats to drinking water supplies for selected operators (representing the most frequently used operating models) and, subsequently, it proposes measures to mitigate the identified risks. The topic was addressed in the form of a case study of selected water system operators in the Czech Republic, and the findings indicate the compartmentalized model to be the most appropriate operating model.</jats:p>"

During the manufacturing processes of a product, a variety of meta data can be derived from each working step and considered during subsequent stages of its liefycle like shipment, utilization or recycling. With upcoming regulations decided by the European Union, manufacturers must begin to react to the demand of a comprehensive circular economies by introducing technical solutions like Digital Product Passports (DPP). By associating the specific conditions of all stages in the life of a product within a digital identity, e.g., the DPP, transparency and efficiency can be increased. The Gaia-X service landscape aims at realizing federated data infrastructures, enabling robust and transparent services while considering data sovereignty. In this work, a modular and generic multi-tenant framework for utilizing DPPs within cross-company ecosystems is presented with respect to the manufacturing sector. In applying the Secret Network-blockchain for implementing the automation of DPP management processes, premises for Gaia-X compliance and therefore strengthened trust-anchors are realized. By considering details of ecosystems, as well as most interesting security threats to the proposed architecture, a holistic view of applying DPPs in the context of smart production supply chains is shown.

However, when reporting their sustainability-related practices and initiatives, O&amp;G companies seldomly mention the term green supply chain management (GSCM). The study aims to investigate the development of GSCM practices in the O&amp;G sector and to categorize how they are integrated with the sustainability practices reported by the industry. A multi-phase research approach was adopted consisting of a comprehensive literature review, followed by a single case study employed in an international oil and gas company. Primary data were collected by conducting 12 semi-structured interviews with senior members of an O&amp;G company. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the primary data from the interviews and to synthesize this work with the secondary data in order to answer the research question. The research identifies that the adoption of green purchasing practices is still in its infancy, whereas green production practices are more advanced compared to the current academic literature on the O&amp;G industry. Additionally, new insights are obtained on how O&amp;G companies are diversifying their business models and investing in the renewable energy business. The results of this work will enable O&amp;G businesses to understand the latest developments in GSCM practices and how they are impacting the O&amp;G sector. Practitioners will also be able to benchmark their current GSCM practices with the research findings and develop and formulate strategies to maximize the implementation of GSCM practices.</jats:p>"

The study utilized groundwater level data spanning 48 years (1973 -2020), using GIS to map groundwater levels and visualize fluctuations throughout the study area. The findings revealed significant variations in groundwater levels within the southwestern district of Punjab during different seasons. The maximum waterlogged areas were found to be 97,350 ha (1973, Faridkot), 56,080 ha (1981, Ferozepur), 21,730 ha (1991, Sri Muktsar Sahib), 52,790 ha (2000, Sri Muktsar Sahib), 6,760 ha (2010, Sri Muktsar Sahib), and 2,910 ha (2020, Fazilka). However, the waterlogged and potential waterlogging area observed in Fazilka district covered about one-third (32.52%) of the district during 2020. The study identified that 45% of the study area faced the risk of overexploitation, 46% was considered safe, and 9% was either waterlogged or at risk of waterlogging. Over the 48 years, the study demonstrated the dynamic nature of waterlogged areas in the southwestern districts of Punjab, including Ferozepur to Fazilka via Faridkot and Sri Muktsar Sahib districts.</jats:p>",

The National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), the Immediate Payment System (IMPS), the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and Mobile Banking (MB) are all used in the study as proxies for digital payment systems. In contrast, M1, or narrow money, is used as a proxy for the money supply in India from July 2016 to August 2022. Every month, the Reserve Bank of India database has served as the source of the statistics. The effect of digital transactions on M1 has been studied using the sophisticated econometric approach known as the ARDL (autoregressive distributed lag model). The presence of cointegration between the variables is further demonstrated by the long-run cointegration bound test. The findings of the diagnostic tests show that serial correlation and heteroskedasticity are absent. According to the results of the CUSUMSQ (CUSUM-square) and Jarque–Bera tests, the model is stable and normally distributed. Digital payments are statistically significant and positively correlated with the money supply, according to the error correction model test. The long-run equation results also demonstrate that the digital payments system might have a long-term positive or negative correlation with M1. Since every other independent variable, excluding IMPS, is positively connected to the money supply and IMPS is negatively related, the two are inversely related. The money supply will shrink as IMPS transaction volume rises, but this will have minimal substitution impact on the M1 monetary aggregate. Thus, the study’s findings imply that there might be several changes to the money supply or monetary aggregates, which are crucial tools of monetary policy, due to the impudent rise of financial innovations or additional fintech opportunities. Because of this, the demand for money function may become unstable, making it difficult for policymakers to put their plans into action.</jats:p>"

В процессах оперативного и производственного планирования необходимы решения, которые приносят больше прибыли при одновременном снижении затрат на деятельность предприятия. В исследовании использовался метод теоретического анализа публикаций по теме оптимального использования запасов на производстве. Результаты показали, что большинство предприятий в процессе управления материальными ресурсами сталкиваются со следующими проблемами: отсутствие надлежащей координации планирования потребностей в материальных ресурсах в натуральном и стоимостном выражении, недостаточная обоснованность ассортимента поставок ресурсов, сбои в сроках и объемах поставок, несвоевременная оплата и низкий уровень исполнения финансовых обязательств. По этой причине требуется система принятия решений с эффективной производительностью и синхронизацией. Управление материальными ресурсами должно обрабатывать потоки сырья, денежных средств и информации с учетом профиля производства. Затем производство преобразует сырье в конечную продукцию. Однако производственная система управления запасами сталкивается с проблемами, такими как неточное планирование. Управление запасами играет решающую роль в эффективности цепочки поставок. Управление запасами – это непрерывный процесс планирования, организации и контроля запасов при одновременном балансировании спроса и предложения. Разработка системы управления запасами напрямую связана с продажами, финансами, производством и закупками. Проведенное исследование позволило сделать вывод о том, что целью управления запасами является минимизация средних затрат на единицу времени, затрачиваемых на систему инвентаризации в долгосрочной перспективе. Использование современных коммуникационных технологий в сочетании с искусственным интеллектом позволит своевременно получать и передавать информацию, легко отслеживать запасы и контролировать их. Использование программного обеспечения для управления запасами предоставляет ряд преимуществ, таких как адаптивность, гибкий подход, прозрачность, и в конечном счете позволяет сократить затраты на доставку и обслуживание запасов.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>the effectiveness of inventory management is a vital part of a manufacturing organization to increase competitiveness. In the processes of operational and production planning, solutions are needed that bring more profit while reducing the costs of the company's activities. Most enterprises in the process of managing material resources face the following problems: lack of proper coordination of planning of material resource needs in physical and monetary terms, insufficient validity of the range of supply of resources, failures in the timing and volume of deliveries, late payment and low level of fulfillment of financial obligations. For this reason, a decision-making system with efficient performance and synchronization is required. The management of material resources should process the flows of raw materials, cash and information, taking into account the production profile. The production then converts the raw materials into final products. However, the production inventory management system faces problems such as inaccurate planning. Inventory management plays a crucial role in the efficiency of the supply chain. Inventory management is a continuous process of planning, organizing and controlling inventory while balancing supply and demand. The development of an inventory management system is directly related to sales, finance, production and procurement. The purpose of inventory management is to minimize the average cost per unit of time spent on an inventory system in the long term. The use of modern communication technologies in combination with artificial intelligence will allow you to receive and transmit information in a timely manner, easily track stocks and control them. Using inventory management software provides a number of advantages such as adaptability, flexibility, transparency, and ultimately reduces the cost of shipping and maintaining inventory.</jats:p>"

The study was executed by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and sought to enhance supply chain systems by deploying advanced traceability mechanisms, underscoring product monitoring, and ensuring real-time stock visibility. The inquest discusses the accomplishments, challenges, and regulatory framework of NAFDAC, emphasizing GS1 Technology-driven Traceability, and presents the outcome of the field scanning activities conducted in July 2023. The study utilized GS1 standards to uniquely identify products, locations, and personnel in the supply chain. The approach involved a phased public sector pilot, showcasing the feasibility and challenges of tracking vaccine movement through the supply chain. The result shows the detection of 43 unique products across 1022 facilities from a total of 110,113 scans, offering valuable insights into vaccine distributions. The strategic goals of the project aligned with developing safety surveillance systems in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to facilitate patient access to global health products. The safety surveillance initiative complemented ongoing global efforts among WHO-HQ, PAHO, ASEAN, and MHRA, underlining safety systems across regions. Similarly, a significant improvement in traceability through automated data capture (barcode scanning) and expanded coverage for COVID-19 and selected RI vaccines in Nigeria was recorded. Summarily, information derived from this report will build confidence in patients regarding vaccine authenticity, establish a transparent and robust supply chain, and foster pharmacovigilance capability through integration with the track-and-trace systems. Thus, the study provides invaluable insights and opportunities for global health practitioners, policymakers, and researchers. Convincingly, this script will also serve as a reliable blueprint and innovative model for incorporating track-and-trace into regulatory oversight by other National regulatory authorities, most especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.</jats:p>"

This research draws on institutional and stakeholder theories to identify the adopted social sustainability practices in Egypt and to determine the factors affecting their implementation. A mixed‐method research approach is followed involving interviews of hotel managers and a literature‐based questionnaire answered by a total of 187 practitioners from hospitality and tourism supply chains in Egypt. The interviews revealed that social sustainability practices in the two hotels' supply chains are adopted but limited to legal requirements and brand policies. Statistical analysis indicated that local suppliers boost the adoption of social practices. All the studied barriers show very weak correlation with the adoption of social sustainability practices; according to the interviews, this does not imply barriers inexistence, but rather reflects lack of awareness regarding social rights in a culture that tend to preserve social conservatism. The enablers explained significant variations in many social sustainability practices (53 out of 62). This study is unique since it offers a novel approach by linking institutional and stakeholder theories to recognize weaknesses in tourism supply chain social sustainability, thereby providing directions for the future design of sustainable tourism policies.</jats:p>"

The gating angles required for thirty power switches in MLI are optimized by both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Gray Wolf Op-timization (GWO). In the optimization technique, the optimal angles are determined by solving the trigonometric equations from the Fourier analysis for targeting minimum total harmonic distortion (THD) at the MLI output. Simulation model and experimental prototype are developed for performance analysis and validation. The results obtained demonstrate that the MLI is effec-tively able to produce 31-levels of three-phase ac output voltages with THD not exceeding 5% when loaded with a resistive load and a three-phase induction motor. The voltages and currents are measured and recorded for different loads and operating conditions, including the amount of energy consumed by the loads, as well as frequency analysis, which shows the absence of most of the triple harmonics that have a negative impact on the efficiency of the inverter.</jats:p>"

Sediment transport in streams is an important issue in the assessment of sediment deposition in dam reservoirs and its impact on operational activities. Evaluation of sediment yield contributes to decision-makers for effective water management and protection of the dam body and its elements. In this study, land use cover changes, in particular in forest areas, agricultural areas, arable lands, permanent crops, heterogeneous agricultural areas, and pastures in the Çakıt and Körkün sub-basins of the Seyhan River basin were examined between 1990 and 2018 using CORINE land use cover (CLC) data. The effect of land use/land cover (LULC) modifications on sediment yield was studied using suspended sediment observation data and CLC data. It was determined that the forest area in the Çakıt sub-basin drainage area increased between 1990 and 2018, and decreased in the Körkün sub-basin. It was determined that the increase in forest area in the Çakıt sub-basin drainage region until 2018 helped to reduce sediment movement. The regression values between forest area and suspended sediment concentration in Çakıt and Körkün sub-basins were found to be 0.9521 and 0.4431, respectively.</jats:p>",

It also provides analysis of how COVID-19 policy and population responses temporarily altered the long-run structural trajectory of the private rental sector (PRS) in Australia.In 2021, the Australian PRS housed more than 2.363 million households, a 17 per cent increase of nearly 340,000 households since the 2016 Census. This growth has been greater than total household growth in each intercensal period since 1996.Between 2016 and 2021 PRS growth was concentrated at mid-market levels; in dwellings renting from around $300–$530 per week ($2021). This continues a major change trend first established in 2011, reinforcing the structural shift to a market concentration of dwellings renting at mid-to-higher levels.The long-term shift in the national distribution of PRS household incomes reveals the growth of households with incomes at mid to high levels ($1,246 a week and above). In 1996, these ‘wealthier’ households comprised 40 per cent of all PRS households (or 489,000 households); in 2021, they comprised 64 per cent (or 1,519,000 households), a 211 per cent increase. In comparison, the total number of PRS households increased by 91 per cent between 1996 and 2021 (from 1,234,000 households to 2,362,000).Over the same time frame, there has been a relatively constant total number of lower income renters in the PRS; 508,000 households in1996 and 488,000 in 2024. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of 348,000 affordable and available private rental homes for very-low income (Q1) households in 2021 and that, as a result, 82 per cent of Q1 PRS households paid unaffordable rents.</p>"

This underscores the critical need to embrace digital solutions. This study seeks to aid Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers, in improving supply chain efficiency, optimizing inventory management, and enhancing the overall customer experience by creating a comprehensive supply chain database. Specifically, we employ the core entity method to identify Walmart's key entity, which is the \"product,\" and ascertain its associated entities. Subsequently, we establish relational models based on the attributes and relationships of each table, considering real-world scenarios, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. We employ normalization techniques to ensure the proper utilization of functional dependencies and candidate keys for each entity. This guarantees that the designed tables adhere to the principles of the First, Second, and Third Normal Forms, preserving data integrity while minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we create a set of logical database commands, illustrated through flowcharts, and rigorously test their functionality and efficiency. Lastly, we explore potential directions for future research. The successful implementation of this design relies on robust data management practices and a reliable database system tailored to meet Walmart's specific needs. This results in a logically structured and standardized supply chain database. The research findings underscore the vital importance of a well-conceived supply chain database in addressing the challenges faced by large-scale retail operations like Walmart supermarkets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: In the urban and rural areas, the water supply to the residents and commercial establishments is provided with a fixed water flow rate. Now a day’s most people’s utilize the excess water by connecting the motor pump or suction pump to suck the water directly from the area street pipeline which is considered as water theft. It causes enormous complications during summertime and also reduces their environmental resources. In this project, the proposed system is used to develop an IoT-based water supply monitoring and theft identification system by recording the flow rates at the consumer or user end. To implement the proposed water supply system, each consumer can be provided with a PIC-based microcontroller kit to record the flow rate using a flow sensor. The electrically operated solenoid valve is provided to the consumers to monitor water usage. If any excess water deduction occurs in the water supply pipeline the excess flow rate and corresponding charges will sent to the consumer ID. The valve is turned off using IoT to stop the water supply when the consumer fails to pay or uses excessive water LCD is connected with a Node MCU to display data nearby. The proposed framework is completely automated; there is no need for manpower. The domestic water supply monitoring and theft identification system offers several benefits, including improved water resource management, reduction in water wastage, and financial savings. Identifying and addressing instances of theft, it promotes fair usage and conservation of water resources, ultimately contributing to sustainability.</jats:p>"

Methods: A hybrid approach combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis was adopted. The research was divided into two phases: (i) identification of critical factors based on the literature, and (ii) analysis of eight experts’ insights on those factors by employing the grey DEMATEL approach. Results: Fourteen factors that affect trust in the wine supply chain were identified based on the academic literature. From the analysis of the experts’ views, with the use of the grey DEMATEL approach, the factors were classified into two groups. The first group (nine factors) concerns the factors that affect the rest and the second group (five factors) concerns those which are affected by the former factors. Conclusions: The study of trust in the supply chain can be further improved by monitoring the trends in the sector and by engaging a wider audience of stakeholders. This approach can be applied to various regions in order to examine whether the situation is different from country to country. Stakeholders will have the necessary information to support their decisions and prioritize their objectives, aiming at improving the whole supply chain.</jats:p>"

This empirical study analyzes business data from 1140 automotive companies operating in Europe, utilizing various business intelligence platforms and employing decision tree analytics to establish connections between enablers, drivers, company size, and financial resources. The goal is to identify persistent barriers hindering the rational transition to Industry 4.0. The findings reveal an uneven transformation within the industry nexus. While larger companies possess the financial means to allocate collective intelligence, technical resources, and drive necessary for fulfilling I4.0 requirements, smaller members of the nexus lag behind despite their enthusiasm and intent. This imbalanced evolution poses a threat to the comprehensive transformation required for realizing all the benefits of Industry 4.0 within the sector. The primary discovery indicates that small to medium-sized enterprises do not exhibit the same rates of Industry 4.0 adoption, a lag highly correlated with their available financial and human resources for digital transition. The decision tree proposed in this study offers guidelines for achieving an Industry 4.0-compliant nexus.

Another purpose is to develop recommendations for implementing best practices of biomass logistics in Ukraine. Effective logistics of biomass fuel supply is one of the important prerequisites for a successful implementation of bioenergy projects. The share of logistics cost in the whole supply chain is 30...50% for biomass delivered to the consumer. In case of long-distance international transportation this share may reach more than 75%. The composition and complexity of harvesting and logistics operations, which affects the final product cost, depends on biomass source, type and commercial form (pellets, briquettes, chips, bales). The more compressed biomass is, the more efficient its transportation is from an economic and energy point of view in terms of ton-kilometer. Effective biomass supply logistics minimizes its cost as a fuel for an energy facility. This is important because fuel cost is the largest component (up to 70% and more) and often plays the crucial role in forming the price of energy produced. It is important for Ukraine to study and implement the best European experience in harvesting and logistics operations for biomass supply for energy conversion. In particular, this includes the creation of a system for biomass electronic trading as well as practical implementation of the concept for wood chips production from felling residues on a forest roadside. Drafts of required basic documents, including legislative ones, have already been developed for these areas. Other priority tasks for the domestic bioenergy sector are the mastering of technologies for corn and sunflower stalks harvesting, development of energy crops growing, creation of trade and logistics centers for wood/agrarian biomass or the implementation of other similar concepts, introduction of long-term contracts for biomass supply and payment for biomass delivered per its energy unit (not per ton), development of companies that specialize in biomass and biofuel logistics.</jats:p>"

High-income countries (&gt;$13,845) are seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of domestic consumption by imposing new sustainability regulations on global supply chains. Recent evidence suggests that these regulations are broadly supported across high-income countries. However, it remains unclear whether citizens of middle-income countries support aligning domestic sustainability regulations with the measures developed by high-income countries. Concerns about economic competitiveness and foreign imposition could increase public resistance toward such alignment. Alternatively, desires for continued market access in high-income countries and aspirations for strengthening local environmental and labour regulations could foster support for alignment. Based on survey-embedded experiments in the three largest democratic non-OECD economies (Brazil, India, Indonesia), we find surprisingly strong support for domestic-based measures that are aligned with emerging global supply chain sustainability regulations. Our findings suggest that support is largely driven by positive impact expectations, where the future benefits of alignment are perceived as outweighing concerns about increased costs. These results bode well for initiatives to install stricter sustainability regulations for global supply chains that are acceptable not only in high-income economies but also in non-OECD countries.</jats:p>"

The microbial communities in the water body and sediments in the reservoir center and before the dam were com- posed of 380 genera. The microbial diversity in sediment was higher than that in water. The influence order of water quality factors on microbial community was DO &gt; CODcr &gt; TN &gt; Mn2 + &gt; Fe2+. Potential pathogenic microorganisms were detected in water and sediment samples. Although no coliform bacteria were detected, disinfection as a water supply source was still necessary. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the main water quality factors affecting microbial community structure were DO and TP in the dry season, but the pattern was not obvious in the wet season. Sodium hypochlorite has a good disinfection effect on tap water and can fully ensure water quality safety.</p>"

Different systems were formed to maintain a balance between the demand and supply of blood bags. UTD-PMI Kota Kupang serves blood requests in 12 hospitals and 1 clinic located in the city and Kupang district. The demand for more blood than the supply of blood in the UTD-PMI is a personal problem. The prediction of demand and the blood supply becomes important so that there is no difference in demand and supply of blood in the very large UTD-PMI office. The study used the Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) method to predict blood supply and demand. Data from the last four years is used to predict the amount of blood demand and supply. Predictions with the DES method are divided into two categories. The first category uses the data of the last 3 years to predict data in the fourth year for the next 6 months. The training data used is divided into two types: the last 3 years and the last 2 years. Forecast results compared to real data in 2023. Category 2 uses data from the last four years to predict data for 2023. The training data used is divided into 4 types, each starting from the last 4, 3, 2, and 1 year. To determine the accuracy of the calculation using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results of determining training data with different ranges result in predictions of blood demand and blood supply, whose results are also different but still in the “good forecast” category.</jats:p>"

The efficiency of cooling fuel elements using the free convection method without additional inclusion of active cooling is considered due to design limitations of the overall dimensions of the source. Calculation estimates were made using numerical modeling of the temperature regime of the source. The object of the study is an intrinsically safe power supply with size restrictions of 200×160×65 mm with an aluminum housing. The main heat-generating elements are power transistors with a power of 1 to 6 W, mounted on the heat-dissipating parts of the housing through an insulating gasket. For stable operation of semiconductors, a temperature regime is required without exceeding the transistor temperature of 85 ° C under standard environmental conditions at an air temperature of 20 ° C and a relative humidity of 20%. The authors analyzed the heat exchange between the model of the designed power supply housing and the air environment according to the parameter of the limiting temperature of heat-generating semiconductors in a steady state. Conclusions about whether the thermal operating conditions are adequately ensured for this case are made.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p id=\"p1\">The survival of salt marshes, especially facing future sea-level rise,\nrequires the supply of sediment. Sediment can be supplied to salt\nmarshes via two routes: through marsh creeks and over marsh edges.\nHowever, the conditions of tides and waves that facilitate sediment\nimport through these two routes remain unclear. To better understand\nwhen and how sediment import towards salt marshes occurs, measurements\nspanning two months were conducted in Paulina Saltmarsh. The results\nshow that the marsh creek and the marsh edge do not import sediment\nsimultaneously. The marsh creek tends to import sediment during neap\ntides with waves. A small tidal range results in weaker flow during ebb\ntides, reducing the export of sediment. Strong waves, particularly\nduring this period, enhance the sediment supply from mudflats to the\nmarsh creek. Additionally, waves can directly affect sediment\nre-suspension in the marsh creek during spring tides when the water\nlevel is above the marsh canopy. The marsh edge benefits from\ncontrasting tidal and wave conditions, with sediment imported during\nspring tides with weak waves. Waves during spring tides re-suspend\nsediment, impeding the sediment deposition, and thus leading to sediment\nexport over the marsh edge. These results highlight the potential\nsediment transport routes to marshes under varying conditions, shedding\nlight on their implications for the long-term survival of salt marshes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The phenomena of backdraft in chimneys due to meteorological conditions and geometrical parameters of the chimney head in the area of adjacent buildings are fundamentally considered. For the purpose of in-depth analysis of the backdraft phenomena, the meteorological parameters of atmospheric pressure and turbulence were calculated, and the wind speed was determined under operational and extreme conditions of chimney systems. Wind has a role to impact, and its consequences must be assessed to provide the required safety level of chimney systems. The technical conflict between National Norms and European Standards regarding the interpretation and definition of the \"wind resistance zone\" is considered separately, where the European approach has more mathematical approach. It is proposed to consider and analyse this issue according to more modern approach, using CFD computational fluid dynamic modelling and specialised software for thermal and aerodynamic calculations of chimneys, which makes it possible to assess the functional ability of a chimney, both in terms of design features and wind exposure. This approach has the advantage that the analysis is carried out locally, specifically for an individual chimney, which avoids random or template results. In other words, the interaction of the \"atmosphere-chimney-room\" system is considered. The ANSYS CFX-Post module analyses the formation of backdrafts for different wind speeds with the same geometric parameters of the chimney head, characterised by the speed changes of flue gas movement, static pressure, temperature field, and the formation of a flue gas plume in the atmosphere. The following factors have been identified in the modelling of the chimney functioning: the use of secondary air through the bypass hole, the temperature of the outside air is taken to calculate the minimum draft 288.15 K, the temperature of flue gases is 345.95 K. The obtained results of CFD computational modelling studies provide the motivation for the development of innovative and effective approaches to eliminate dangerous backdraft phenomena in chimneys.</jats:p>"

At such enterprises a large amount of dusty air is generated, which comes from various technological processes. Dust and gas collecting devices are used to purify dusty air. Depending on the state of dust and air flow, its fraction, dust dispersion and the method of collection, different aspiration devices are used. Aspiration devices are divided by the method of dust collection into wet or dry. Each of these types of aspiration devices has its own advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed in this article, such as increased aerodynamic or hydraulic resistance, regeneration of the device, the size of the trapped fraction, the need to use flushing fluid, etc. The classification of plant types for selection to a specific process or needs depends on the most efficient method of collection, particle dispersion and energy efficiency of the dust collector. Wet dust collectors have more diverse forms, designs and applications than dry dust collectors.  Wet dust collectors are divided into groups depending on the state of the liquid phase (devices in which dust deposition occurs on a film of liquid, foam devices, turbulent dust collectors or condensation devices) and on the method of dispersion of the liquid (nozzle scrubbers, devices in which crushing is carried out due to the energy of the gas-air flow or dynamic gas washers). In this article, the designs and operating features of various wet dust collectors of each of these groups are considered in accordance with their characteristics of dust collection, liquid flow rate and design shortcomings. On the basis of the works of a number of researchers, the characteristics of the fractional degree of air purification from dust are graphically presented to determine the most effective apparatus for capturing fine fractions.

In every period, retailers privately observe the demand and manufacturers pay retailers ‘information rents’. I study collusive equilibria between the supply chains that may or may not involve the retailers. I find that including forward‐looking retailers in the collusive scheme may facilitate or hinder collusion, depending on the likelihood of a high demand and the gap between a high and a low demand. Moreover, collusion on monopoly profits can be easier or more difficult to implement than collusion on upstream profits.</jats:p>",

The applicability of the proposed model is evaluated through a real-life case study of a multinational sporting goods retailer with sensitivity analysis. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulation is used to capture the demand uncertainty and test the robustness of the model.\nResults: The minimized cost is achieved with optimal facility locations and product flows. The optimal result shows a 3% reduction in the total cost, making it the most robust solution under demand uncertainty.\nLimitations of the investigation: The proposed model is only applicable to a single-commodity supply chain network. In addition, the cost components of the network are limited to facility costs and transportation costs, disregarding the other cost components.\nPractical implications: This research demonstrates a methodology that can be used as a decision support system by managers to make strategic and tactical decisions in a supply chain network when demand is uncertain.\nOriginality / Value: The MILP and simulation techniques used together to construct a three-tiered supply chain under uncertainty receive little attention in the literature. In addition to developing a novel three-echelon MILP model, this research makes use of a real-world case study to illustrate the methodology's performance in the context of demand uncertainty through simulation.</jats:p>"

The objective of the study is to analyze the supply responsiveness of potatoes under risk. Firstly, a production function in lag is estimated from empirically expected variables. Evaluating parameters found that risky variables explained the crucial role of farmers' strategies in decision-making. The findings explain that potato farmers appear to be risk-averse. Hence, the point of government policies has to take a look at risk management, and also the dynamic point of view. In the end, to test the effectual or not of government policy such as the potato farming program, risky variables are going to explain the effect and also impact the latter result. For example, minimizing the effect of the risk variable will increase the acreage, which implies a shift in the supply curve.</jats:p>"

In this respect, the key management function ‘controlling’ cannot be overlooked or sidelined. In addition, when it comes to the maritime management and supply chain management, the controlling function is extremely relevant. As a result, the conventional notion of controlling undergoes changes not drastically in the whole process of management whether it is budgets, Critical Path Method (CPM), Programme Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), Gantt Chart and the Management by Objectives (MBO), Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM)-to name a few. The analysis of global trends, the marketing management, the last mile connectivity, supply chains resilience, adaptability impinges on the controlling function. Basically, the controlling is a performance appraisal or a corrective mechanism from the deviation of standards. Most of the areas of maritime management including cargo handling, port efficiency and cargo evacuation are of paramount importance in modern times. Identifying the existing gaps and finding solutions are mattered. In this process, there is an attempt being made to understand the entire supply chain process pertaining to the controlling process cannot be ignored. Since the maritime transportation in terms of 90 percent by volume and 70 percent in terms of value carried by the seaborne, the controlling aspects from the managerial point of view has its own relevance in future.</jats:p>",

As demand currently exceeds supply for many of these minerals, governments worldwide are devising strategies to secure stable procurements of the minerals they lack as well as to ensure that they reap the benefits of their own natural wealth. The European Union (EU) is in a difficult position in this regard due to limited domestic reserves and, thus, serves as an ideal case study to explore developments in international economic law on this issue. Internally, the EU has been reforming its financing mechanisms, developing risk management tools, and enhancing recycling. Externally, the EU has been using international trade tools to focus on access to supply rather than traditional market access issues while also developing new investment rules to open doors and protect its foreign investors in extractive industries. Both internal and external actions are being coordinated with allies through new cooperative mechanisms. However, challenges abound. These strategies will face resistance from resource-abundant economies in view of their growing demand for policy space to protect their own mineral sector. Such strategies are also inherently competitive and, hence, might lead to growing tensions among resource-seeking economies themselves.</jats:p>",

Increasing competitive pressures are forcing companies to increase their rates of innovation to shorten each product’s duration in the market, thereby compressing each product’s life cycle. This study employed a descriptive survey research design to accomplish its goals since it has enough provision for the protection of bias and maximized reliability. The target population comprised of managers in manufacturing firms that are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). KAM therefore provided the sampling frame for this study. As at 2017, KAM had a membership of 903 manufacturing firms. A sample of 90 respondents was drawn from this population. Primary data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire which was self-administered. Data obtained was processed and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results of the data analysis were presented in charts and tables. The findings revealed that lead time system accounted for 7.6% of change in performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The results showed that organisational policy had no intervening effect on performance and lead time system. Lead time system significantly influences performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. This study recommends that manufacturing firms should ensure that they are proactive in activities that reduce lead time. Keywords: Lead time system, Manufacturing firm, Performance, Kenya.</jats:p>"

The Law of Ukraine \"On Milk and Dairy Products\" is basic in the field of regulation of the dairy industry. The legislator fixed the interpretation of the main terms of the dairy industry in the relevant legal act - the Law of Ukraine \"On Milk and Dairy Products\". This act defines what \"raw milk\", \"dairy raw materials\", \"dairy products\", \"traditional dairy products\" are. Also, the legislator fixed the main institutions of the state policy of ensuring the safety and quality of milk and dairy products. In addition, the act discloses the issue of state support for producers of milk, dairy raw materials and dairy products and the mechanism for its implementation. It should be noted that the Law of Ukraine \"On Milk and Dairy Products\" regulates the legal and organizational foundations for ensuring the safety and quality of milk and dairy products for life and the health of the population and the environment during their production, transportation, processing, storage and sale, import into the customs territory and export from the customs territory of Ukraine. The study identified the main, in our opinion, regulatory legal acts that regulate the supply of milk, dairy raw materials and dairy products to the state, and also characterized their purpose, main provisions and meaning. It was found that milk and dairy products occupy a significant place in the market of food resources. It is noted that the production of dairy products is an important component of food security. It was found that providing the state with milk is a complex process that includes the following stages: milk production, milk processing, sale of dairy products, state regulation.</jats:p>",

Moreover, little is known about adopting digital technologies in manufacturing firms at a supply chain level. This paper aims to understand why and how manufacturing firms adopt digital technologies and the impact of the adoption on supply chains. This research includes the design of a Web-based Supply Chain Management application to facilitate inventory management, starting from the process of ordering goods from suppliers and procurement of goods to managing goods to customers. Digital technology in the supply chain in the manufacturing area helps companies to store goods management data, raw materials, inventories, deliveries, and daily deposits, and others that are still using manual systems or not yet computerized to maximize performance and also profits for the company, suppliers, including end customers. The study identifies that technological intelligence and supply chain cooperation are critical factors and proposes two-dimensional levels of adopting digital technologies according to their low-to-high degrees.</jats:p>"

The study therefore analyzed teachers’ availability, supply, and distribution in public primary schools in Bayelsa State. The study was descriptive adopting ex- post facto research design. The population of the study comprised all 3,571 teachers distributed across the 547 public primary schools in Bayelsa State as of the 2022/2023 academic session. It was a census study; therefore, a sample was not made. A checklist titled: Teachers Availability Distribution and Supply Checklist (TADSC) was used to collect data for the study. The data collected were analyzed using percentages and histogram charts. Findings from the study revealed that the enrolment of pupils in public primary schools was generally low and varied by local government area. It was also found that teachers were not adequately supplied while the available ones were not equitably distributed across the eight local government areas. Lastly, the results of the findings showed that the existing public primary schools in the State require adequately qualified classroom teachers for effective pedagogical-related assignments. Arising from the findings, it was recommended that the State government should provide existing public primary schools with basic teaching and learning facilities including qualified and adequate teaching manpower; rural communities should be provided with basic amenities while rural allowance/incentives for teachers should be increased to promote high teacher retention in local and rural areas; teachers should be redistributed across schools and local government areas for equity, fairness, and effective utilization by relevant authorities like the State Universal Education Board {SUBEB} and the State Ministry of Education.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/-counters-/edu/0798/a.php\" alt=\"Hit counter\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Therefore, today a power supply system is used on board a spacecraft that provides onboard electrical energy for the operation of all on-board equipment (engine, control, communications, and heating systems) by generating direct electric current using a generator, converting chemical energy into electrical energy, using fuel cells, powered by supercritical liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, delivered from Earth. The life support system, used today on the spacecraft, includes: system for regenerating water from atmospheric humidity condensate in a spacecraft cabin, a water regeneration system from urine, system of generating oxygen and hydrogen during the electrolysis of water in microgravity conditions, a system for utilizing carbon dioxide, removing harmful micro impurities, operating at the expense of internal resources spacecraft during space flight. Thus, the task arises of developing new types of power supply and life support systems, including the development of new and improvement of existing technologies for continuous charging of spacecraft fuel cells with hydrogen and oxygen, generating onboard electricity without the use of “Earth tanks” with supercritical liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, improvement of existing oxygen and hydrogen generation systems, regeneration of water from condensate of atmospheric moisture and waste products of astronauts, removal of harmful micro impurities and cultivation of rapidly multiplying microalgae on the spacecraft during a long space flight. The article presents a new type of power supply and life support systems for spacecraft, powered by a solar panel, which includes the developed new technologies: an oxygen and hydrogen gas generator, which makes it possible to economically and easily separately produce oxygen, hydrogen and drinking water to enrich the atmosphere with oxygen and replenish the drinking supplies of the spacecraft cabin, continuously charge the fuel cells of the spacecraft with hydrogen and oxygen, produced for the uninterrupted generation of onboard electricity; a separator for purification of technical wastewaters from harmful solid inclusions and pathogenic microbes and obtaining drinking water from them, regeneration of drinking water from urine, excreted by astronauts, in quantities sufficient for consumption of this water by astronauts during a long space flight; a concentrator that receives a solution with microalgae cells from a space photo bioreactor, growing microalgae under weightless conditions, which utilizes carbon dioxide released during the breathing of astronauts, produces oxygen to enrich the atmosphere of the spacecraft cabin with oxygen through photosynthesis. A concentrator permits to obtain a high-quality concentrate of cells of rapidly multiplying microalgae and supplement the crew's diet by the biggest part of this concentrate, and to replenish the space photo bioreactor with the remainder of the concentrate and nutrient solution in order to obtain enough biomass for a long space flight.</jats:p>"

It is determined that corporate governance can be viewed as a set of legal, economic, organizational norms and rules within which a corporation (company) operates, and on the basis of which the relations between all its participants are built. Corporate governance unites various participants in corporate relations, each of which takes care of its own interests, establishes mechanisms and methods of interaction between them. It is highlighted that most studies related to corporate governance have a rather narrow focus and are conducted exclusively at one of these levels. The issue under study is multifaceted and also includes the definition of functions and components of corporate governance, which include: creating a strategy and setting goals, ensuring financial stability, ensuring transparency and compliance, and facilitating interaction with stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The model presents the role of knowledge management and Web 4.0 as having a key impact on the processes for business value creation for the industrial organisation. The paper is structured into three chapters. The introduction presents the methods used along with the research question. Chapter one starts with the theoretical bases and state of the art of the Industrial Sub-Supplier Process (ISSP). Chapter two makes a link between the ISSP, knowledge management and knowledge discovery process using data from Supply Chain Management Software for management decision-making. Chapter three of the research starts with web 4.0 tools and proposes a Sub-Suppliers Model 4.0, while trying to explain how the ISSP can be optimized based on the KPIs used. The main research contribution is the novelty integration of the knowledge discovery concept and the implementation of web 4.0 tools into the ISSP.</jats:p>"

This study identified two key issues: (1) the connection between supply chain capabilities and organizational responsiveness and (2) the impact of supply chain capabilities on organization responsiveness. In a taxonomy, various scenarios of the relationship between supply chain capabilities and organization responsiveness were developed, and different studies were used to demonstrate the experience of intra and inter-organizational activities in economic growth. The findings of numerous studies show in detail that an organization's supply chain capabilities are essential for improving organizational responsiveness and competitiveness.

The <jats:bold>subject </jats:bold>is causal connections between the budget deficit, money supply, and the depreciation of money. The <jats:bold>relevance </jats:bold>of the research for Russia is determined by concerns about macroeconomic stability and high inflation. In the case of the United States, an increase in the money supply and an inflation spike occurred because of the debt financing of the federal budget deficit. The <jats:bold>scientific novelty </jats:bold>of the paper lies in considering the two main options for monetary policy to support the liquidity of public debt: hard and soft, and the analytical methods and results of the research. One of the important scientific results is that the burden of public debt should be measured not as the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) but as the share of public debt in a bond market. The second scientific result is very important for the practice: during 2011–2022, in the eight biennial periods, the GDP deflator was approximately equal to the growth of the money supply M2 minus GDP growth. Thus, the depreciation of money was directly caused by monetary policy. In the other three biennial periods, a substantial difference was observed, probably because of external shocks. As the <jats:bold>method </jats:bold>of the study, the author estimated the effect of interest rates caused by crowding out corporate debt by public debt. It was substantiated that to obtain the effects of soft monetary policy and thus the increase of M2 to GDP deflator, it is essential to use biennial periods. Based on the <jats:bold>results </jats:bold>of the analysis, it was revealed that, particularly in 2021–2022, the growth of the GDP deflator amounted to 139.8% and was due to the growth of the money supply M2 by 140.5%. At the same time, the effect on GDP growth was insignificant, at 3.4%. <jats:bold>The key conclusion </jats:bold>is that for the implementation of macroeconomic stability policies, it is necessary to manage the expansion of the M2 money supply, the exchange rate, and to use the GDP deflator as an important indicator in addition to the inflation index — consumer price index. A good way to achieve this is to adopt a special law for controlling inflation, similar to the USA Inflation Reduction Act.</jats:p>"

This article describes the data and methods used to develop a workforce projection model that estimates the future supply of 14 pediatric subspecialities certified by the American Board of Pediatrics at the national and US census region and division levels from 2020 to 2040. The 14 subspecialties include adolescent medicine, pediatric cardiology, child abuse pediatrics, pediatric critical care medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric endocrinology, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric hematology-oncology, pediatric infectious diseases, neonatal-perinatal medicine, pediatric nephrology, pediatric pulmonology, and pediatric rheumatology. Hospital medicine was excluded because of the lack of historical data needed for the model. This study addresses the limitations of prior models that grouped adult and pediatric physician subspecialty workforces together and aggregated pediatric subspecialties. The model projects supply at national and subnational levels while accounting for geographic moves that pediatric subspecialists make after training and during their career. Ten “what if” scenarios included in the model simulate the effect of changes in the number of fellows entering training, the rate at which subspecialists leave the workforce, and changes in hours worked in direct and indirect clinical care. All model projections and scenarios are available on a public, interactive Web site. The model’s projections can also be examined with other data to provide insight into the possible future of the pediatric subspecialty workforce and offer data to inform decision-making.</jats:p>",

The account of harvest was conducted on Methodos of realizations of examination of sorts of plants of group of grain, leguminous, cereal on a fitness to distribution in Ukraine. Results. The duration of the maize growing season depended on the conditions during the years of research. In some years, due to lack of precipitation and high temperatures, the duration of the growing season was reduced to 87–107 days. The use of fertilizers reduced the negative impact of weather conditions, which was manifested in an increase in corn yield by 22-59% depending on the doses and fertilizer systems, and also contributed to a decrease in the coefficient of variation. It was found that in the phase of BBCH 79 between grain yield and reserves of productive moisture in the soil layer 0-100 cm there is a strong relationship (r=0.73); in the phase of BBCH 09 and BBCH 59 it was average (r=0.57-0.69); at the time of full grain ripeness BBCH 89 –weak (r=0.3). Between the yield and the amount of precipitation during the growing season, an average relationship was found – r=0.63. The influence of fertilizer on the water consumption coefficient was revealed, which is manifested in its decrease under the influence of fertilizer. It testifies to more productive use of water plants. Conclusions. In the conditions of the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe, the duration of the growing season of maize varied within 87-124 days and significantly depended on moisture supply. In addition, water consumption by crops was in the range of 1397–2742 m3/ha. Fertilizers contribute to the rational use of water and ensure the formation of more stable yields over the years of research. The revealed patterns of realization of the potential of maize productivity depending on water supply and fertilization are important factors in improving the technology of its cultivation.</jats:p>"

In this study, we perform a simulation-based analysis of pandemic-triggered impacts on pharmaceutical supply chains in Germany with the aim of examining supply chain response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this, we build a digital supply chain model using a hybrid approach that combines case study analysis and discrete-event simulation implemented in anyLogistix. Based on the results, we propose a specific response action plan for the pharmaceutical industry that can be deployed in response to severe disruptions and pandemic-like crises. We also offer a resilience framework for the post-pandemic environment as a guideline for strategic decision-making.</jats:p>"

The reliability of the traction power supply system (TPSS) for an electric road is a key consideration in ERS planning and maintenance, but since the development of ERS is still at its early stage, the reliability study of different ERS systems has not been fully researched. This paper fills this research gap. It first analyses the potential operation risks of three different ERS systems using the failure mode and effect analysis method. Then, a fault tree model is built to analyse the overall reliability of the traction power supply system of each of the three ERS types and to identify the weak links. Furthermore, the overall failure rate and reliability indicators are obtained by combining the possible failures of both the electric and non-electric components of the TPSS. Finally, based on the analysis of the potential risks and the corresponding reliability indicators, the advantages and disadvantages of different ERS solutions and the future development prospects are discussed.</jats:p>",

However, changes in climate, population, consumption patterns, land use and urbanization are affecting its quality and future availability. In Andorra, a country located in the middle of the Pyrenees, the confluence of climate change and a socioeconomic model with an important weight of the tourism industry based on an intensive use of water could threaten the future sustainability of water resources. This paper analyses the water resources of Andorra and its future sustainability using the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) modelling tool. The WEAP-Andorra model presents an initial estimate of the national water demand segregated into the main water consumers in the country (i.e. tourism, residential, primary sector, snowmaking, and hydro power production). It explores the future evolution of water resources combining climatic, including an extreme drought scenario, and socioeconomic variables (i.e. demography, tourism, irrigation, and snowmaking trends). The model includes an Adaptation scenario to assess the impact of some strategic adaptation measures. The results indicate a significant decrease in annual streamflow across all simulated scenarios by 2050. In the global change scenarios, yearly streamflow is projected to decrease between 5.3% and 8.5%, while in an extreme drought scenario, the loss reaches 65.4%. The impact of global change on future water demand at the country scale is not expected to be compromised. However, in an extreme drought scenario, it could be affected. The sectors most affected by the combination of global change and drought could be ski resorts, especially to ensure snowmaking and hydropower production. The future frequency and duration of droughts will determine the severity of the unmet demand.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective supply chain management is imperative for the seamless operation of manufacturing facilities, ensuring the timely delivery of goods and services to customers. However, the inherent complexity of supply chain systems introduces various risks and uncertainties that can significantly impact factory performance and the broader business sector. This research addresses the challenges faced by a brick manufacturing factory in Aceh Besar Regency, highlighting the absence of a well-structured risk management framework, inadequate mitigation planning, and suboptimal risk identification methods within the supply chain. To address these shortcomings, this study employs the House of Risk (HoR) methodology, utilizing it to identify risk events and agents within the supply chain. Mitigation strategies are designed based on the Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP). Data for the study were gathered through interviews and questionnaires completed by 12 respondents from three brick manufacturing factories and consumers. A combined quantitative and qualitative analysis approach, incorporating severity and occurrence risk levels assessed by each respondent, was used. The application of the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model revealed 21 risk events and 23 risk agents. Notably, risk agents such as adverse weather conditions, weak contractual agreements with suppliers, adverse weather during production and delivery processes, and damaged products displayed the highest ARP values (649, 826, 1521, 473, 276) across key business processes (plan, source, make, deliver, return). In response to these findings, proposed mitigation strategies include executing tasks during inclement weather, managing raw material inventory, establishing fair long-term contractual agreements with suppliers, selecting appropriate transportation during adverse weather, and choosing high-quality suppliers. This research contributes to the field of supply chain management by addressing gaps in risk mitigation within the brick manufacturing sector. The combination of the HoR methodology and ARP provides a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, thereby enhancing the resilience of the supply chain. The results are particularly relevant for practitioners seeking effective strategies to manage risks in brick manufacturing and other similar industries.\n</jats:p>"

This article involves four key chain partners viz. a single supplier of raw materials, single manufacturer, single retailer, and single collector of the used products from the end users. Depending on the returned goods quality, the collector procures used items from customers. Unlike the existing articles, the manufacturer has two different setups for the production of both items made from newly sourced components and returned goods. A specified portion of fresh and used items goes through the same reworking cycle because the production process for both is flawed. This model has been framed under the carbon tax and the strict carbon cap regulations in order to maintain better environmental stability. A newly developed metaheurestic method namely Atomic orbital search algorithm has been implemented to determine the optimal replenishment planning and acceptance quality level, along with the corresponding numbers of deliveries among the four different chain partners and to improve the supply chain net profit. To assess how carbon regulatory policies affect the best course of action, a numerical analysis of the mathematical models is conducted, followed by a sensitivity analysis of key parameters. This study proposes that the manufacturer should consider implementing a strategy wherein they provide collectors with better rates for used products. By doing so, this is anticipated that the demand rate for these items will increase, leading to improved profitability and raw materials sustainability for the suggested model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In line with the trend of population growth in the world, increasing food production becomes imperative for the agricultural sector, especially since even with the current population, one billion people were malnourished or hungry. The opportunity to increase food production is mainly reduced to increasing yields and is less based on increasing cultivated areas and the number of domestic animals. The productivity of agriculture increases through its intensification, that is, greater application of artificially produced inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, etc.), which threatens the health safety of the food produced in this way and leads to an increase in nature pollution. This closes a circle in which the survival of humanity is conditioned by the reduction of health food safety and the degradation of the environment. As a logical counterbalance, an ecological movement emerged that advocates food production based on sustainable principles, the use of natural inputs and processes, and the preservation of nature. That logic would be acceptable to everyone if it did not materialize in the contradiction of \"more ecology, less (more expensive) food\". In addition to environmental activists, the goal of producing food in an ecologically acceptable manner was also adopted by the EU as one of its longterm strategic goals (the so-called \"Green Plan\"). One of the possibilities of increased satisfaction of the food needs of the world population, instead of increasing its production, is the reduction of losses and waste of already produced food, which has become one of the world's development goals since 2015 (SDG 12.3. - halve global food waste per capita at the retail level and consumer level and reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030). Terminologically, food losses are related to the phases of its production, distribution and processing, and food waste to the phase of food trade and consumption. Practically, the effect of increasing food production can be substituted by the effect of reducing food losses and waste, which has become a new challenge for all participants in the food supply chain, from producers, through distributors and traders to consumers. The scientific community is also one of the participants in that process, which contributes with its research to identify causes and find solutions to reduce food losses and waste. The facts presented in this chapter aim to draw attention to the issue of food losses and waste with a focus on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The treatment of the selected topic begins with the argumentation of the growing need for food in the world, primarily due to the increase in the number of inhabitants and the goal of eradicating hunger and malnutrition. It continues with the projection of limited possibilities for the production of significantly larger quantities of food in the future. After that, the concepts of food loss and waste and ways of measuring them are introduced. The key chapter is the dedicated to assessing the scope and causes of food losses and waste in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An overview of food losses and waste along the supply chain is also given, based on selected literature sources. The chapter ends with a review of the hierarchy of food waste disposal with concrete proposals for reducing food losses and waste in the BiH environment.</jats:p>"

Digital twin allows the realization of a virtual model of a real system, enhancing the relevant performance (e.g., in terms of production rate, risk prevention, energy saving, and maintenance operation). Current literature presents many contributions pointing out the advantages that may be achieved by the definition of a digital twin of a water supply system. The Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 introduces the concept of the Asset Administration Shell for the digital representation of components within the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Several proposals are currently available in the literature considering the Asset Administration Shell for the realization of a digital twin of real systems. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, at the moment, the adoption of Asset Administration Shell for the digital representation of a water supply system is not present in the current literature. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to present a methodological approach for developing a digital twin of a water supply system using the Asset Administration Shell metamodel. The paper will describe the approach proposed by the author and the relevant model based on Asset Administration Shell, pointing out that its implementation is freely available on the GitHub platform.</jats:p>"

Based on a multidimensional analytical review of scientific sources, the classification of internal and external factors affecting supply chain management in China’s transportation and logistics systems is substantiated. The author’s configuration of these factors is proposed, taking into account regional differences, and the structure of the factor field is formed. The result of the research from a scientific point of view was an assessment of the functional effectiveness of supply chain management from the perspective of traditional factors such as natural resources, capital, labor and land, as well as transformational and transactional, including human (skills, qualifications, knowledge), scientific and technological (research, innovation, technology) and material (infrastructure, equipment, materials) factors. The theoretical significance of the study lies in the formation of a configuration of internal and external factors affecting supply chain management in China’s transport and logistics systems, taking into account regional differences.

Our study expands the current understanding of LW pay by shifting from the traditional labor-capital view to an operations and supply chain management perspective. We use a game theoretical approach to explore the different responses of two competing supply chains to LW accreditation. We find that a moderate LW standard allows for Pareto optimality where key stakeholders (i.e., manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and workers) have a collective interest in promoting the LW movement. From a multistakeholder lens, the LW movement is only sustainable if the LW standard is neither too aggressive nor too conservative. We further demonstrate the following points. (1) Not all types of uncertainties are harmful to supply chains with LW pay. Yield uncertainty slows down the progress of the LW movement, whereas demand uncertainty encourages the voluntary adoption of LW pay among all stakeholders. (2) Supply chain coordination may slow the adoption of voluntary LW pay, which implies that the classic coordination paradigm is not a panacea in alleviating the plight of underpaid workers. (3) From the perspective of competition intensity, greater monopsony power hinders the progress of the LW movement, and we provide evidence for the positive effects of a competitive environment on incentivizing voluntary LW pay. </jats:p>"

Simulation results show that risk spillovers spread among industries via the production network, leading to systemic risk in the real sector.

Agribusiness stands to become a key beneficiary of this technology as a platform to execute ‘smart contracts’ for transactions, particularly for high-value produce. First it is important to distinguish between private digital currencies and the distributed ledger and block chain technologies that underlie them. The distributed and cross- border nature of digital currencies like Bit coin means that regulation of the core protocols of these systems by central banks is unlikely to be effective. Monetary authorities are focused more on understanding ‘on-ramps’ and ‘off-ramps’ that constitute the links to the traditional payments system rather than being able to monitor and regulate the currency itself.

Considering the vertical differences in products, we build a live streaming sales model for an e‐commerce supply chain. We examined different live streaming channel strategies for the manufacturer, with the base strategy being no live streaming sales and the manufacturer only reselling a high‐quality product on the e‐commerce platform. The manufacturer's strategies for choosing live streaming include selling a high‐ or low‐quality product on independent and e‐commerce platform channels. We solve the solutions under different scenarios, comparing the equilibrium solutions and discussing the impact of live streaming under different channel models. We find that live streaming channel encroachment by the manufacturer can achieve a win–win situation for both the manufacturer and e‐commerce platform, and the encroachment of a low‐quality product can achieve a larger win–win situation. In the independent live streaming channel, the manufacturer chooses to sell a high‐quality product under the quality and cost advantages. In the e‐commerce platform's live streaming channel, the presence of commissions further influences the manufacturer's strategy. In the extended model, we analyze the spillover effect of live streaming sales. A multi‐agent‐based simulation model is developed to validate the conclusions of the main model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Robotics and automation have developed as key technologies for supply chain management as a result of the increased demand for quicker and more effective supply chains. Robotics and automation improve supply chain management by lowering long-haul expenses, boosting work and usage strength, reducing errors, declining repetitive stock checks, updating orchestrating, taking care of times, and assembling induction to the problematic and hazardous places. Robotics aids in design, creation, etc. Automation helps to do tasks that are often done by people through the use of self-operating physical machines, computer software, and other technology. Despite being widely accepted as a tool to aid in decision-making, supply chain management (SCM) has very seldom used AI and ML. This article investigates several AI and ML sub-fields that are best suited for resolving real-world SCM-related issues in order to fully realize the potential benefits of AI and Ml for SCM. In doing so, this article examines the track record of successful AI and ML applications to supply chain management and highlights the most fruitful SCM domains to apply AI and ML. And also find out the how robotics and automations helps in warehouse management. The most recent developments in robotics and automation for supply chain management are thoroughly reviewed in this paper. We first give a general overview of the difficulties that supply chain management faces before going over the many ways that robotics and automation are used at various points along the supply chain. Additionally, we go over the advantages of robots and automation in supply chain management, including higher efficiency, accuracy, lower costs, and improved safety. Lastly, we discuss some of the present drawbacks and difficulties associated with robots and automation in supply chain management and suggest some possible directions for further investigation.</jats:p>",

This study adopted a census survey sampling which was conducted on 270 food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya registered by Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM, 2022). The target population for the research was all 270 respondents each from the food and beverage manufacturing firms. Both primary and secondary data was used, the primary data was collected using semi structured questionnaire that was administered by the researcher and research assistants. Samples of the questionnaire were pilot tested to test the reliability and validity before full scale data collection. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented in tables and figures. The inferential analysis was further carried out using structural equation modelling, ANOVA and regression coefficients. The results were then presented using tables, figures, graphs and charts.&#x0D;\nFindings: Supplier collaboration significantly influenced performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya at both without a moderator and also using the moderating variable, supply chain technology. In the first model without moderator, it recorded a standardized estimate of 0.637 (p&lt;0.001), indicating that as supplier collaboration increases performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms also increases. Fit indices on structural equation modelling revealed a marginal fit with a chi-square test of 216.155 with 86 degrees (P-value 0.0561). The structural path for structural equation modelling from supplier collaboration to supply chain performance remains positive and significant standardized estimate of 0.855 and p-value was 0.001&lt;0.05. Which indicates that the variability of supplier collaboration on the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms could be explained by 63.7% when no moderator is included and increase to 85.5% when supply chain technology is incorporated thereby indicating a stronger relationship. The other fit indices that gave a satisfactory model fit are RMR=.9019, GFI= .9774, NFI= .9164, RMSEA=.0191 and CFI=.9176 this implies that the model was fit to determine the relationship between supplier collaboration and performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya and therein make conclusions and recommendations. ANOVA, regression coefficient ant model summary (R2) were also used and indicated significance of there use all recording p-value of 0.000&lt;0.05. &#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: While transaction cost theory used in this study was validated by offering cost reduction strategies like outsourcing, accurate order forecasting as increasing the organization bottom line. The study recommends that when creating a supplier collaboration portfolio, companies should pool suppliers with the same activities in one pool but to use technology to mop up suppliers with high asset specificity for components delivering competitive advantage. Meanwhile, suppliers with low asset specificity for suppliers with components which result to less competitive advantage needs to be managed as a separate line of engagement.</jats:p>"

The prediction of water discharge over weirs should be as precise and straightforward measured as feasible. The experimental investigation of flow prediction over varied heights of a conventional rectangular sharp-crested weir was conducted in the present work. The investigation evaluated five ratios of weir height to length, P/b, of 0.33, 0.4, 0.47, 0.53, and 0.6, different water discharges, Q, of up to 17.25 L/s, and different bed slopes, S, between 0.001 and 0.01. The experiment's findings reveal that a change in the bed slope has no significant effect on the brink depth, hb, for a constant water discharge. However, it influences the head over the weir, h, which is usually measured upstream of the weir location and used to predict water discharge. A simple, accurate formula was developed for predicting water discharge over rectangular sharp-crested weirs depending on the brink depth with mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.714% and 0.229, respectively. In addition to having a simple form, the developed formula performs well, is unaffected by the bed slope, and applies to a wide range of h/P values, from 0.158 to 0.945.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the role of nitrogen in alleviating drought stress in barley. Parameters such as relative water content, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, mesophyll concentration of CO2, total leaf nitrogen, grain yield, total organic nitrogen content, starch content, and macronutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were examined. The optimal grain yield (3.73 t·ha−1) was achieved with 1 g of nitrogen per container (near 200 kg N hectare−1) under ideal moisture conditions. However, under drought stress, nitrogen supply variants (1 g and 2 g per container) exhibited a significant decrease in photosynthetic rate (Pn), NRA activities, and a notable increase in Ci values. Stomatal conductance exhibited a substantial decrease by 84% in the early growth phase, especially with a 2 g dose of nitrogen supply. Nitrogen enhanced crude protein levels, yet both drought stress and nitrogen application reduced grain weight and starch content. Nitrogen effectively improved metabolic processes under drought, particularly in earlier growth stages (e.g., tillering). This research highlights the importance of sustainable agricultural practices related to the growth stage of barley, emphasizing nitrogen optimization to enhance crop resilience in water-scarce environments. The results underscore the intricate interplay between nitrogen fertilization, drought stress, and crop yield, indicating benefits during initial stress exposure but detrimental effects in subsequent growth stages.</jats:p>"

The investigated aspects were: population supplied by water; raw water sources; responsible body; water fluoridation and data availability. Only 38% of the population in the macro-region have access to piped water, of which only 44% is treated, the service performed by the state company and those managed by the municipal body were equivalent (48%). 484 sources of collection were identified, 99% underground supplying 92% of the population, this dependence on groundwater reaches 63% throughout the state, surface collection occurs only in the main municipality (5%). Despite the index that 91% of indicator 6.1.1 of the SDGs, the high rural population and the low demographic density constitute a challenge for the expansion of access. No municipality performs artificial fluoridation and there are no records of fluoride levels or previous analyses. There is a direct relationship between a lower HDI and access to potable water. Conclusion: a small part of the population has access to treated water, therefore fluoridation is not guaranteed and the surveillance system needs to be improved.</jats:p>"

While scandals like the Rana Plaza incident have focused the world's attention on Asia, in Brazil, over 35,000 people have been rescued from conditions analogous to slavery in the past 15 years. Outsourcing and the underlying social structures that blur the implementation of outsourcing are central to this problem. Fashion supply chains are highly fragmented and labour intensive, exhibiting power asymmetry and informality. Although supply chain research has focused on how focal firms can control or improve supplier practices, this study examines focal firm misconduct and decoupling. Our research presents an intervention aimed at developing a blockchain solution to create a census of fashion working conditions in Brazil. The project included two non-governmental organisations, two fashion brands and their suppliers, the fashion retail association, a blockchain start-up and the research team (18 organisations). We contribute to both theory and practice, revealing that the blockchain's potential to ease transaction costs is outweighed by governance costs related to third-party supervision. We show that focal firms justify unfair purchasing practices via victimisation and diverting attention from themselves to consumers (‘unwilling to pay’) and suppliers (‘not behaving as expected’), unveiling how these drivers of organisational misconduct lead to supplier decoupling (means–end) and focal firm decoupling (policy–practice). Such underlying social structures sustain inaction or, at best, advance focal firms’ visibility of their supply chains while offering no true transparency to the broader society. </jats:p>"

This paper aims to explore the new perspective of the determination of component version numbers based on various methods and to propose an effective method. First, by analyzing the source code of the component, you can try to determine the version number of the component by a specific mode, function, or variable in the code. This approach requires in-depth study and analysis of the source code to extract key code snippets that may contain version information. Second, the submission history of the component can be used to track the change of the version number. The modification content and update information for each version is obtained by viewing the submission records of the components in the version control system. Such an approach is relatively feasible for those components with a canonical versioning history. In addition, the metadata or metadata information of the component can be used to determine the version number. Some open-source components may contain version-related information in their code or documentation, such as release date, release instructions, version labels, etc. By parsing and extraction of these metadata, the version number of the components is obtained. In addition, the version number of the component can be obtained through communication with the community or the developer. Participate in the relevant open source community or contact component developers to consult them for information about the component version. This approach may require more time and resources, but is a viable option for those components that are difficult to determine the version number through other means. To sum up, the determination of the version number of open source components without package management files is an important link in supply chain security detection.</jats:p>"

ULP Weda's electricity supply, with an installed power of 5.2 MW and a peak load of 5.6 MW, faces challenges due to high fuel prices, leading to a Cost of Supply (BPP) value of IDR 4,193, significantly higher than the average selling price of IDR 1,365 in the Veda system. To address these issues, a research methodology, incorporating SWOT and TOWS analyses, was employed. Three potential scenarios emerged: relocating Diesel Generating System (SPD) engines, adding rental generator engines, and purchasing excess power. Financial Feasibility Study (KKF) calculations, considering Nett's Present Value (NPV), Nett's Present Cost (NPC), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR), determined the excess power purchase scenario as the most viable, with an NPV of IDR 29.8 billion, NPC of IDR 623 billion, IRR of 33.49%, and the lowest BPP value at IDR 1,244. The Homer application provided insights into optimizing generating machine units for optimal BPP values. Sensitivity analysis showed that higher interest rates and lower fuel prices contribute to lower BPP values. This comprehensive research offers a strategic framework for addressing electricity supply challenges in the ULP Weda area, ensuring financial viability and optimal operation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Ant tending aphid colonies reduce the effectiveness of biological control on aphids which is detrimental to the crop plants. However, their mutualistic interaction is complex and, depending on the quantity and quality of the sugar that aphids produce, it may change to a predator-prey interaction. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by providing ants with a high-quality sugar supply with the predictions that ants with an extra-sugar source should more often predate on aphids and, therefore, the abundance of aphids on the experimental plants should be reduced. We carried out an experiment on pepper plants, inoculated with the aphid <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> in greenhouses with naturally occurring <italic>Tapinoma ibericum</italic> colonies in three different periods. Our results showed a significant reduction in aphid colonies abundance and greater aphid predation by the ants in plants with an artificial sugar supply. However, the expected effects greatly varied among greenhouses and seasons. A negative effect on aphid abundance was mainly detected in autumn, while a positive effect on ants predating aphids were mainly detected in summer, when a lower ant activity on the plants occurred. Although our experimental results show that the artificial sugar supply changes ant behavior from tending aphids to preying on them, the large variation in the expected effects suggests that some other unconsidered factors influence their strength. Consequently, future advances should focus on detecting factors driving observed variations among study areas and year seasons, to continue research on using biological control for aphids in horticultural protected crops.</p>"

However, there is a research gap regarding the policy tools and the role of local governments in implementing blockchain technology to achieve carbon emissions traceability. Additionally, the strategic relationships and policy implications resulting from the implementation of blockchain technology are not examined systematically. An effective method for examining the strategies used in interactions between supply chain stakeholders and governments is evolutionary game theory, or EGT. This paper employs mathematical modelling and MATLAB 2016 software simulation to examine the decision-making process of manufacturing companies when considering implementing blockchain technology traceability. Specifically, the subjects in the model include product manufacturers (PM), product suppliers (PS), and local governments (LGs). The aim is to examine the decision-making behavior of carbon traceability participants in blockchain technology. This paper analyses the most effective blockchain-based traceability strategies for low-carbon supply chain members under a variety of scenarios by modifying the parameters. The findings suggest the following: (1) Manufacturers and suppliers need to manage the cost of blockchain traceability, collaborate to create an environmentally friendly product certification system, and improve brand image. (2) Local governments should set up efficient reward and punishment systems to incentivize supply chain stakeholders to engage in the blockchain traceability system. The aforementioned discoveries furnish policymakers with guidance to encourage the implementation of blockchain-based carbon footprint traceability technology, thereby establishing a transparent carbon footprint traceability framework across the entire supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, if a regulator caps the incumbent’s upstream and downstream prices, consumers and firms are better off after entry than under a price-cap monopoly.

This case study examines the prevention of supply chain issues by understanding the root of the issue. Although the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the issues at hand, it was not the root cause of the problem. The coronavirus pandemic helped show the holes in the organization's current supply chain strategy, which this research helps to resolve through a series of methodology adjustments and organizational changes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research study serves two purposes. First, it seeks to examine the dynamics of Malaysia's supply construction sector and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 2015 to 2023. Second, it aims to identify the key macroeconomic forces regulating this sector and their influence throughout the provided timeframe. In order to achieve these goals, the study applies a variety of research approaches, including correlation and regression analysis. The primary macroeconomic indicators examined are exchange rates, base lending rates, and inflation. The study's findings show that the Base Lending Rate (BLR) has a considerable effect on Malaysia's supply construction GDP. In contrast, exchange rates and inflation rates have modest or statistically negligible impacts. The study's regression model emphasizes the significant influence of BLR and demonstrates that it is the most powerful predictor among the investigated macroeconomic factors. The importance of this research rests in its capacity to clarify the complex link between macroeconomic data and Malaysia's supply construction sector. It emphasizes BLR's crucial role in influencing the performance of this sector and, as a result, its impact on the whole economy. Furthermore, the study provides useful insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and future research endeavours, enabling informed economic decision-making and strategic planning in the construction sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Export production, which is defined as the export of organic matter fixed by photosynthesis, is crucial for sustaining oceanic carbon uptake. The export route in the open ocean is the sinking of biogenic particles through the bottom of the euphotic layer. In contrast, the export routes in the shelf seas are the sinking of biogenic particles to the sediment and the horizontal transport of biogenic particles across the boundary of the shelf seas to the open ocean. The biogenic particles in the shelf seas are supported by multisource nutrients including riverine and oceanic ones. Their exports depend on the hydrodynamic conditions and biogeochemical processes responsible for different sources of nutrients. Here, a unique physical-biological coupled model with a tracking approach is applied to evaluate the export production supported by multisource dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) over the East China Sea. The total export production is 6.83 kmol N s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> (=17.16 Tg C yr<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), which is slightly lower than the reported atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> absorption. Approximately 80% of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) is exported via off-shelf transport, and the remaining 20% is buried in the sediment. The PON supported by DIN from rivers accounts for 8% of export production, with an e-ratio (export production/primary production) of 0.09. In comparison, that from the Kuroshio accounts for 64%, with an e-ratio of 0.22. This suggests that offshore areas here are more efficient in exporting local production than nearshore ones, largely supported by oceanic nutrients.</jats:p>"

One avenue that holds promise for achieving this objective is the application of digital technologies, which have the potential to decouple economic growth from its carbon footprint. However, it is crucial to ensure that these technologies are designed and governed in a prudent manner, with a strong alignment to environmental priorities. This study focuses on exploring the potential roles of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain coordination and impact mitigation. Furthermore, they have the capacity to incentivize recycling and circular business models, as well as facilitate carbon accounting and offsetting. To fully realize these benefits, it is essential to deploy these technologies within inclusive collaborative frameworks that take into consideration social and ecological considerations. The study also offers policy recommendations that highlight key leverage points for digital innovation, enabling countries to embark on smart and green industrial transformation pathways. By harnessing the potential of blockchain and AI in supply chains, governments can promote transparency, traceability, and accountability, thereby fostering sustainable practices and reducing environmental impacts. Incorporating blockchain and AI technologies into supply chain approaches leads to a substantial improvement in efficiency, as demonstrated by a numerical analysis. In conclusion, the integration of innovative digital technologies offers significant opportunities to optimize production systems and economic activity while prioritizing sustainability objectives for the betterment of society and the environment. These technologies have the potential to mitigate environmental externalities by addressing information imbalances within global supply chains.

In the models consisting of energy management systems (EMS) and generation sources, there will be power fluctuations between the source and the load under certain conditions due to the unpredictable behavior of RERs. Therefore, a reliable scheme has to be implemented between the source and the load to ensure optimal performance of direct current (DC)‐MGs. This article has presented a review of the EMS models introduced by various researchers to enable optimal power supply and efficient operation of the DC‐MGs. A thorough illustration of the schemes adopted to provide efficient operations under grid‐connected and islanded mode of operations are provided. The effects and advantages of centralized and decentralized EMSs are discussed. The role of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in microgrid scheduling is presented and compared with a few other energy storage systems. The scheduling strategies implemented for optimal EMS using different algorithms and techniques are elaborated. In addition, the effects of battery degradation and the formulated solutions to improve the degraded models with improved battery life are also provided with cycle life and calendar life. Then, the lithium ion and lead acid BESS effect on microgrid EMS is presented. Finally, the energy management methods for DC‐MGs end with challenges, research gaps, and future direction.</jats:p>",

A sample size of 140 respondents was selected. The study employed a simple random sampling technique to choose the sample. The collection of primary data was facilitated by the administration of a questionnaire. The data were subjected to regression analysis for the purpose of analysis. The findings of the study provide confirmation that there is a moderating effect of organizational culture (β1 = 0.224, P &lt; 0.05) on the relationship between supply chain integration and the performance of food manufacturing firms. The research findings indicate that the influence of supply chain integration on the performance of food manufacturing firms is contingent upon the organizational culture. Food and beverage manufacturing businesses should consider enhancing the comprehensiveness of their supply chain integration procedures. This may be achieved by granting suppliers access to their inventory management systems, enabling them to make timely choices on inventory replenishment. The integration of supply chains facilitates the exchange of management practices across enterprises, enhances the management of supplier expertise, and allows suppliers to communicate any difficulties that may impact order fulfillment to the organization.</jats:p>"

Although various factors that may influence supply chain carbon performance have been investigated, the impact of supply chain concentration remains unclear due to insufficient research and inconsistencies in conclusions from the existing research. It is essential for enterprises to understand whether and to what extent supply chain concentration is an effective measure for improving carbon performance. Equally important is understanding the situations in which supply chain concentration works more effectively. In this research, we will construct fixed effects models using data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2021 to investigate the effects and mechanisms of supply chain concentration on corporate carbon performance. Our results suggest that supply chain concentration has a significant positive effect on carbon performance, with financing constraints playing a partial mediating role in this relationship. In addition, we have found that managerial myopia has a negative moderating effect on the positive relationship between supply chain concentration and carbon performance, whereas unexpected public events positively moderate this relationship. Further research indicates that the effect of supply chain concentration on carbon performance is stronger for state-owned enterprises and low-growth enterprises in China.</jats:p>"

This research aimed to study the process by which farmers adopt water conservation behavior and explore the intervention of perceived risks and risk attitude. This survey was conducted among farmers in the Sistan region in the southeast of Iran (N = 6,000). A sample of 361 farmers was selected by multistage cluster randomization. The research instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire whose reliability was checked by Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability in a pilot study and whose content validity was confirmed by a panel of agricultural sociologists. The data were analyzed using mean, percentage, and structural equation modeling in the SPSSwin26 and AMOS24 software suites. The results reveal that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action influence farmers' water conservation behavior positively and significantly. Also, most components of the health belief model are influenced by farmers' perceived risks and risk attitude. It can be concluded that it is imperative to focus on socio-psychological components to promote water conservation behavior and use water scarcity-coping strategies in Iran.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to propose an optimal design for an intelligent supply chain of multiple perishable products under a vendor-managed inventory management policy aided by IoT-related technologies to address the challenges associated with traditional supply chains. Various levels of the intelligent supply chain employ technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Blockchain. In this paper, we develop a bi-objective nonlinear integer mathematical programming model for designing a four-level supply chain consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and customers. The model determines the optimal network nodes, production level, product distribution and sales, and optimal choice of technology for each level. The objective functions are total cost and delivery times. The GAMS 24.2.1 optimization software is employed to solve the mathematical model in small dimensions. Considering the NP-Hard nature of the problem, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is employed, and its performance is compared with the Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) and NSGA-III. The results indicate that the adoption of these technologies in the supply chain can reduce delivery times and total supply chain costs.</jats:p>"

However, since 1964, agricultural productivity particularly clove production has continually and significantly decreased due to many problems and challenges, especially financial ones. For example, financial intermediaries including banks, cooperatives and micro-enterprises provide micro-financing to the farmers but with high interest rates along with collateral requirements. The numerous programmes, measures and policies adopted by the relevant parties to find solutions to the dwindling clove production have failed. This study has therefore proposed a Waqf-Muzara’ah- Supply Chain model (WMSCM) to address the challenges. The study has used Theory of Reasoned Action adopt the model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measuring the efficiency of water supply services is very important, as the demands for water supply are increasing as the year goes by due to increasing population and development. Improving the efficiency of water supply services is also an economically viable way for water conservation. This paper examines the efficiency of water supply services using Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) output-oriented and Slack-Based Measure (SBM) models. SBM provides the input excesses and output shortfalls for the concerned decision-making units (DMUs). Meanwhile, the CCR output-oriented model interprets the efficiency by maximising the output produced by the DMUs whilst maintaining the input used. The results indicate that the optimal efficiency value for SBM model is lower than the optimal efficiency value of the CCR model. Furthermore, the SBM model provides the water supply providers with values for input excess and output shortfalls for future improvements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability is becoming increasingly important as a topic in general supply chains and cold chains. This study addresses the critical need for an integrated and comprehensive approach to supply chain design that simultaneously maximizes cost efficiency and incorporates environmental sustainability, focusing specifically on cold chains. Prior research has identified a gap in existing studies, highlighting the absence of an overarching framework from the logistics providers’ perspective. Our novel mathematical programming model introduces a unique strategy that carefully balances environmental concerns and cost optimization, addressing the shortcomings found in previous works. By integrating variables related to distribution, transportation, and inventory management, the model aims to minimize overall expenses and environmental impact, specifically regarding energy consumption and carbon emissions. We formulate and solve the optimization problem through rigorous mathematical programming, offering a flexible solution applicable to various logistics scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in overall expenses and environmental effects, providing logistics providers with a powerful tool for informed decision-making and sustainable supply chain management. This research contributes to the evolving field of supply chain sustainability by presenting a practical and effective model for maximizing cost savings while promoting environmental responsibility. The study concludes with compelling statistics, revealing a noteworthy decrease in overall expenses by €25 128 146.73 (100.25%) and environmental impact by 17 359.39 (100.04%). The outcomes show a notable decrease in general expenses and environmental effects, giving logistics providers a strong instrument for wise choices and sustainable supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The focus is on exploring variations in gross domestic production and efficiency related to waste gas and wastewater discharge across regions. The inputs include labor, capitalization, energy usage, and total water consumption, with domestic gross production as the output, and total wastewater and exhaust gas discharges as unintended outputs. The findings highlight Beijing, Tianjin, Hainan, Qinghai, Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Shandong as the most efficient regions, while Zhejiang, Ningxia, Hunan, and others exhibit lower performance. Notably, Guangxi ranks lowest (0.631). Unlike traditional direct distance function models, the SDDF model provides a more accurate estimation of the production efficiency of all 30 administrative regions, and addresses the limitation of generating the same efficiency values of 1 simultaneously for multiple regions. The study emphasizes the need for inefficient regions to reduce water consumption and emissions and enhance productivity, offering valuable insights for policymakers in formulating environmental and production policies.</jats:p>",

In addition, we developed a four-dimensional analysis framework of the issuing agency, issuing period, policy tools, and drug supply chain to analyze specific policy items, determine their basic characteristics, and quantitatively analyze them from a policy mix perspective.\nResults\n The analysis using policy tools showed that the national government tended to call on stakeholders in all aspects of drug supply to fulfil their responsibilities, and both national and provincial governments tended to use incentive tools, such as opening up urgent drug supply tracks and applying financial incentives to promote drug supply. However, managing stakeholders’ behaviors in drug supply and the capacity building to guarantee drug supply are still lacking and require improvement. From the perspective of the drug supply chain, the national government has paid much attention to the distribution of drugs, whereas attention to the supply of drug substances has been lacking. As various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of policies related to drug supply increased slowly after a surge at the beginning of the pandemic and then rapidly decreased. From the policy mix perspective, the analysis showed that incentives were lacking in drug research and development, and capacity building was not discussed much in the drug manufacturing process.\nConclusions\n We suggest enhancing the complementarity and cohesion of the policy content issued by national and provincial governments, strengthening the coordination and connection between policymaking bodies, optimizing the internal structure of policy tools, improving the performance of various policy strategies, and using appropriate policy tools to create policies suited to various stages of emergencies and drug supply chains.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Here, the authors focused on determining the increase in consumers’ preferences for sustainable products, including that of OEMs, who are responsible for the drop in new product sales. We also assessed the effects of remanufacturing by outsourcing to third-party remanufacturers. However, the outsourcing of remanufacturing not only enables the producer to offer a remanufactured product at the same time as manufacturing new units; it also provides OEMs with the flexibility required to peruse eco-design in manufacturing and/or remanufacturing. For instance, Gree and Midea have heavily invested in eco-design to reduce energy costs in manufacturing, while Xerox has adopted a modular design approach to divert materials away from landfills and towards remanufacturing. Following observations of real-world applications, the authors developed two theoretical models in which remanufacturing can be outsourced to an independent remanufacturer, endowing the OEM with the flexibility required to enact eco-design in manufacturing or remanufacturing. This analysis reveals that OEMs tend to put more effort into eco-design in manufacturing than in remanufacturing. Furthermore, such efforts in the name of eco-design may be beneficial for both the OEM and the third-party remanufacturer. As such, this paper encourages governments to provide more incentives that will encourage OEMs to invest in eco-design in manufacturing and establish a possible “win–win” scenario in terms of both environmental and economic performances.</jats:p>"

Based on Geographic Information System technology, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model suitable for watershed hydrological simulation was constructed to study the impact of climate and land-use change on runoff in the Second Songhua River (SSR) basin. Within the base period (1965–2010), the annual average temperature (AAT) of the SSR basin is 4.2 °C. Under the CC scenario representing concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5, the AAT of the watershed increased to 5.4 °C between 2020 and 2049. Under the CC scenarios of RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, the temperature in the watershed increased by 1.1 and 0.2 °C in June, respectively. The research results indicate that (1) there is a positive correlation between runoff and precipitation in the SSR watershed, and a negative correlation with temperature; (2) when the precipitation remains unchanged, the temperature increases by 1 °C and the runoff decreases by 7.2%; and (3) when the temperature remains constant, for every 10% increase in precipitation, the runoff increases by 30.5%. This study provides the scientific basis for water resource planning and sustainable development in the Northeast region and has important practical significance.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the paper summarizes the connotation of digital transformation and its application trend in modern enterprise operations, and expounds the importance of green supply chain synergies and the emission reduction needs of enterprises in pursuit of carbon neutrality.Through literature review and theoretical construction, this paper proposes a conceptual model that details how digital transformation can enhance the synergy of enterprises’ green supply chain by optimizing information transparency, improving decision-making efficiency, promoting resource conservation and technological innovation. Further, the model reveals how this synergistic effect can indirectly or directly lead to improved carbon performance by improving production processes, logistics management, and product lifecycle management.The empirical research part, based on rich sample data and advanced statistical methods, verifies the positive correlation between digital transformation and green supply chain synergies and the negative correlation between digital transformation and carbon emission performance. At the same time, structural equation model and case analysis are used to deeply analyze the concrete manifestation and implementation effect of these influencing mechanisms.Finally, based on the research findings, this paper puts forward specific suggestions for enterprises and policy makers, emphasizes the strategic significance of promoting digital transformation to enhance green supply chain synergies and optimize carbon emission performance, and also points out the issues that need to be paid attention to and the development direction of future research. This study provides important theoretical support and practical guidance for understanding and practicing how enterprises use digital means to promote green development.</jats:p>"

In particular, merit‐based selection rule and high wages attract more capable young elites to serve in public services. In contrast, campaign‐style corruption investigation may deter them from serving in government. Furthermore, the effects of civil service management are contingent upon individuals' attributes. Individuals with political connections are less likely to prefer merit‐based selection rules and more likely care about the economic return on government jobs, but intensive corruption investigation is more likely to crowd out those with weak public service motivation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Biomass energy plays an essential role in renewable energy for many reasons, such as reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, providing heat, electricity, and biofuels for various applications, and utilizing waste materials for helpful energy products. Besides, it can create employment opportunities and promote rural development, especially in developing countries where biomass resources are abundant and accessible. In the context of renewable energy research and application, this paper aims to develop a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming for designing multiple echelon biomass supply chain networks. The model is formulated to consider the economic costs and environmental impact of biomass distribution from the suppliers to the biomass plants. In this research, the Epsilon constraint method is adopted to generate Pareto fonts, which provides the trade-offs between two objectives. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is implemented to provide decision-makers with information about a network with changed parameters such as demand. Our model allows the decision maker to determine the capacity of warehouses and biomass power plants, inventory levels, type of trucks, etc. The proposed model is verified and evaluated using a practical dataset from Can Tho province, Central Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, generating several benefits for energy security and sustainability. Such a network includes 3 types of power plants, 3 scales of warehouses, 13 potential locations, and 41 suppliers. From the generated solutions, with the proportion of biomass electricity satisfaction varying from 5% to 30%, Hung Phu, O Mon, and Cai Rang industrial parks are the most suitable for power plants. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the health system to function well, the population must have equitable access to quality, affordable pharmaceutical supplies; however, pharmaceutical systems in Africa are challenged by inadequate funding, drug stock outs and irregular supplies, a shortage of trained pharmacy personnel, and a lack of systems for drug regulation and quality. Faith-based health providers, as private, not-for-profit actors, have long complemented public sector efforts in the supply of pharmaceuticals in Africa. However, the contribution of faith-based health providers in pharmaceutical systems has not been formally studied. This study examines the nature and function of faith-based healthcare providers in improving access to pharmaceutical supplies in Africa. To do so, we conducted an exploratory qualitative systematic review to identify documents that contain information on faith-based involvement in pharmaceutical supply in Africa. The review identified 20 articles for inclusion. These articles were analyzed using thematic, narrative analysis. The analysis revealed a significant evidence gap relating to the contribution of private-not-for-profit, faith-based providers to African pharmaceutical systems. The review suggests that while faith-based drug supply organizations have existed for a long time and contribute significantly to national pharmaceutical systems, there is very little known about the nature of faith-based pharmaceutical providers and how they complement public sector pharmaceutical systems. In many contexts, faith-based involvement in pharmaceutical systems improved access for the general population and increased the supply of pharmaceuticals in national systems. Faith-based drug supply organizations also often provide pharmaceutical supplies to both rural and urban areas, often targeting rural and remote areas particularly. The review also indicates that faith-based drug supply organizations improved access to medicines and related commodities and, despite a lack of regulation in many contexts, have the potential to make a positive contribution to quality assurance of pharmaceuticals. In summary, the analysis confirmed that faith-based involvement in pharmaceutical supply chains contributes to strengthening the national health system by complementing the public pharmaceutical system through improved access to medicines and related commodities in Africa. These conclusions corroborate the need to continually document and acknowledge faith-based healthcare providers’ efforts which could guide the formulation of stringent, evidence-based strategies.</jats:p>"

Materials supply and delivery are crucial especially in road construction projects as they are required for the daily construction process. Lack of materials is a major source of jobsite productivity loss. This is due to the lack of structured communication and clearly defined tasks in the current materials management methods. The divergence between design and construction, the failure to coordinate and integrate multiple functional specializations, and poor communication lead to excessive fragmentation. All of these contribute to performance issues like late material ordering and delivery, low productivity, and budget overruns. This research develops a material supply chain (MSC) framework for best practices in road construction projects at all phases. This ensures that contractors receive the supplies they need at the optimum time, with the required quantities, and at the lowest possible cost. Contractors can enhance output, save money, and stay competitive. A questionnaire was designed to investigate current practices in MSC, identify the most common obstacles that faced contractors throughout the project phases, and identify the most important contributors to the integration of supply chain in construction. The developed framework was then evaluated by road construction experts; 90% stated that the proposed framework promotes project participants to share information and data. 80% assured that the framework promotes completing the project with desired quality and encourages problem solving before it even occurs.</jats:p>"

For each cancer type, specific selection approaches were developed. Firstly, we predefined 817 features applicable across various cancers, along with a median of 61 histology-specific features and developed a customized Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) algorithm for each feature Standard criteria for data quality control (QC) were formulated, and a web-based computational QC platform enabling manual and automatic inspections was created. This framework has been applied to electronic health data since 2006.\n<jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> The data supply chain captured features from 171,128 individuals across 11 cancer types. It updates individual profiles daily and conducts QC checks, including 143 logical comparisons, processing an average of 81 cases daily. Continuous automatic and manual data QC within closed-human-in-loop systems ensured accuracy. Using the developed data warehouse, we were able to showcase survival graphs by tumor stages and demonstrate the framework's ability to expedite data collection for quick clinical hypothesis testing. A dashboard displaying patients’ cancer journeys, including landmark events, treatment progress, and longitudinal tumor tracking, was also developed.\n<jats:bold>Interpretation:</jats:bold> We have developed an automatically updated data supply chain that comprehensively synthesizes multimodal medical data and assesses data QC, aimed at directly assisting clinical decision-making for individual patients. Ongoing learning is essential, depending on the purpose of data use, and further research into its applicability in other environments is required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Many countries faced health workforce challenges even before the pandemic, such as impending retirements, negative population growth, or sub-optimal allocation of resources across health sectors. Current quantitative models are often of limited use, either because they require extensive individual-level data to be properly calibrated, or (in the absence of such data) because they are too simplistic to capture important demographic changes or disruptive epidemiological shocks such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Method: We propose a population-dynamic and stock-flow-consistent approach to physician supply forecasting that is complex enough to account for dynamically changing behaviour, while requiring only publicly available time-series data for full calibration. We demonstrate the utility of this model by applying it to 21 European countries to forecast the supply of generalist and specialist physicians to 2040, and the impact of increased health care utilisation due to Covid on this supply. Results: Compared with the workforce needed to maintain physician density at 2019 levels, we find that in many countries there is indeed a significant trend towards decreasing generalist density at the expense of increasing specialist density. The trends for specialists are exacerbated by expectations of negative population growth in many Southern and Eastern European countries. Compared to the expected demographic changes in the population and the health workforce, we expect a limited impact of Covid on these trends, even under conservative modelling assumptions. Finally, we generalise the approach to a multi-professional, multi-regional and multi-sectoral model for Austria, where we find an additional suboptimal distribution in the supply of contracted versus non-contracted (private) physicians. Conclusion: It is therefore vital to develop tools for decision-makers to influence the allocation and supply of doctors across specialties and sectors to address these imbalances.</jats:p>"

The constant deterioration of air quality caused by military operations and their consequences, as well as the need to reduce the consumption of available energy resources, requires studying the recommendations on the optimal air exchange rate of existing European and American air quality requirements in residential and office buildings to achieve the required air quality with minimal energy consumption. The objectives of the study were to obtain data on the efficiency of air purification in a given volume at different air exchange rates. A separate task was to check the data declared by the manufacturer on the pressure drop across the filter with an increase in the volume of air passing through it. CleanZone5300 filtration systems with F9 class filter and HEPA H12/13 class filter were considered, which can provide an air exchange rate of 2 to 10 times. In a room volume of 225.9 m3, at a temperature of 18 ˚C, a relative humidity of 57-59 % and an initial number of particles in the room air of 533,440 particles/ft3 (15105 particles/m3), the ability of filtration units to purify the air at different rates was studied. It was concluded that even with a factor of 2, the filtration system can provide air purification up to 40 % when using the F9 filter and up to 60 % when using the HEPA H12/13 filter in a short period of time. Recirculation filter units are considered as the easiest way to increase the air exchange rate in the room, in our climatic conditions. With the possibility of avoiding the processing of air for heating or cooling when using outside atmospheric air. In the installations used in the study, the electrical power consumption of the fans is 300 W per hour. The conclusions of the study need to be tested in office premises with an existing ventilation system to determine the optimal multiplicity of achieving a given air quality when using filters or portable filter units.</jats:p>"

The success of a livable city is achieved not only by physical advantage factors but also by social and economic factors. Livable cities must be investment-friendly to support economic functions. Investment-friendly cities will be the preferred locations for multinational corporations. Urban planners, designers, and managers need to devise urban development strategies that attract investors. This research aims to identify pivotal factors that drive investors' decision-making in selecting investment locations. This study focuses on the influence of global supply chain operations on investment location selection in the era of climate change, which is still relatively rare as it attempts to formulate regional development policies based on a demand-side approach. A demand-based approach requires identifying the investor's point of view in the investment location selection process. The Electronics and Automotive industry in the JABABEKA Industrial Area, Jakarta, Indonesia, is used as a case study. Primary data was collected from the respondents' perceptions and analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) method, applied in the software Smart PLS 3.2.8. The structural model used in this approach is formative. On a global scale, the choice of Indonesia as an investment location is influenced by (i) aspects of physical, social, and economic advantages related to cross-border trade and (ii) aspects of the supply chain related to the impact of climate change.</jats:p>",

The article proposes a methodology for replacing series reactive power compensation in high-voltage paths of the power supply system with parallel reactive power compensation in a low-voltage load node. Results. An algorithm for successive transformations of the power supply circuit has been developed, which makes it possible to estimate the values of the capacitances of compensating capacitors, at which full compensation of reactive power in the system is achieved. Originality. The proposed analytical method for calculating the parameters of the compensation unit makes it possible to dispense with complex optimization computer methods and makes it possible to estimate the compensation capacities that fall on the share of the load and the network. Practical value. The proposed technique allows, using a simple algorithm, to determine with high accuracy the necessary parameters of the compensating device, which provide the optimal mode in the power supply system. The proposed algorithm can easily be implemented in a microcontroller system for automatic control of the modes of the power supply system.</jats:p>"

Better accessibility of formal seeds of fodder and green manure can ensure twin effects- productivity and sustainability. The present study throws the light in respect of the supply-demand gap of formal seeds, causes and seed replacement rates of fodder and green manure crops. Methods: The study was based on a survey conducted on a well-structured schedule during 2022 and 2023. Three stages of random sampling were adopted to select the Blocks, Villages and farmers. One bock with 06 villages and 60 farmers (10 farmers from each village) was selected randomly from each district for the study. So that study was comprised of a total of 05 blocks, 30 Villages and 300 farmers. Result: The study found that there was a gap in the supply-demand of formal seeds of fodder and green manure crops. The study further reported an inverse relationship between farm size and use of the formal seeds for fodder and green manure crops. The seed replacement rate (SRR) was less for all categories of farms. Farm size is negatively associated with seed replacement rate. Low SRR signifying the need to strengthen the seed supply systems. It was further observed the seeds from the informal sector were given less preference by formers, in terms of quality, over to formal seeds provided by public and private sectors. Despite this, the reason for the gap was that the formal seeds belonging to the public sector were not available in proper time and quantity. The availability of seeds of desired varieties through the public sector was also an issue of concern. Whereas, access to formal seeds belonging to the private sector was limited due to higher prices in comparison to the farmers’ saved seeds and formal seeds of the public sector causing a supply-demand gap for the fodder and green manure crops. </jats:p>"

For each scenario, the paper discusses the responses of existing relay protection devices, which are crucial for detecting and mitigating open-phase faults. These responses vary depending on the impedance at the fault location and the load rate of the plant. This paper highlights that open-phase faults can lead to three-phase imbalances in the power system, but their impact on voltage levels is not always straightforward due to the transformer and motor compensation effects. Additionally, the paper identifies blind zones in open-phase fault detection, where existing relays may fail to respond effectively, leading the plant to enter a station blackout state. In conclusion, the research underscores the importance of open-phase fault detection and protection in nuclear power plants. It reveals potential vulnerabilities in existing relay configurations and emphasizes the need for enhanced monitoring and safety measures to prevent extended plant operation under open-phase fault conditions.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the years with higher instabilities of prices were 2020 for potatoes and carrots, 2019 for lettuce, and 2018 for onion. The price elasticity or inelasticity had independent behavior per supply center. However, there are some periods of inelasticity where the price does not influence the quantity demanded or supplied of the evaluated products. In conclusion, there is high variability of price and volume for tomato, potato, onion, lettuce, and carrot during the year. There was a negative in the price and volume of vegetables which indicates that the reduction of volume increases the price of vegetables.

The practical experience helps students identify the consequences of their decisions, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, coordination, and strategic decision-making. This study aimed to provide 38 students in Technology in Logistics and Bachelor of Administration courses with practical experience in managing a supply chain with variable demand through the Beer Game. The intervention combined theory and practice, using the Beer Game as a simulation tool. Results revealed imbalances in orders and difficulties in decision-making, especially concerning unfulfilled orders. Previously reviewed research has confirmed the effectiveness of the Beer Game as a teaching tool for supply chain management. The evaluation by participating students showed that the game had a significant impact on the development of logical reasoning and the assimilation of concepts, although 25-30% of students faced difficulties in understanding certain game concepts. It is suggested that future Beer Game sessions should include strategies to mitigate the \"Bullwhip Effect\" and deepen the analysis of decision-making behavior in the supply chain, preparing university students for future challenges in their careers.</jats:p>"

Tidak mengherankan jikaUMKM dibidang kuliner jumlah nya sangat banyak. Indonesia adalah salah satu negara yang memiliki Jumlah penduduk muslim terbesar di dunia, sehingga Pemerintah tidak ragu untuk menetapkan Visi Pusat Halal Dunia 2024 ini. Upaya akselerasi sertifikasi halal dilakukan dengan sertifikasi Halal Self Declare dimana pelaku UMKM menyatakan produknya halal dengan proses pendampingan dari BPJPH dan penetapan halal oleh Komisi fatwa MUI. Dalam salah satu syarat self declare ini, apabila dalam produknya menggunakan bahan daging maka disyaratkan pembelian di Rumah Potong Hewan (RPH) yang bersertifikat. Persyaratan ini menjadi kendala tersendiri bagi pelaku UMKM mengingat belum banyak tersedia Juru Sembelih Halal (Juleha) dan RPH bersertifikat halal. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui peluang bagi Muhammadiyah untuk ikut ambil bagian dalam memenuhi kebutuhan produk halal tersebut (supply chain). Metode penelitian ini adalah degan menggunakan model penelitian sosio legal dan pendekatan yuridis empiris. Responden dalam penelitian ini adalah pelaku UMKM kec, kartasura dan para Pimpinan Lembaga yaitu PDM Kota Surakarta, MUI Kota Surakarta dan Dinas Pertanian Kota Surakarta. Dalam upaya menakar peluang Muhammadiyah menyediakan Juleha dan mendirikan RPH bersertifikat Halal. Hasil yang diperolah adalah Muhammadiyah memiliki peluang dalam menyediakan juru sembelih hewan (juleha) di kecamatan kartasura. Dari data yang diperoleh bahwa UMKM merasakan kesulitaan memenuhi persyaratan tersebut, disatu sisi jika diminta mengganti bahan tanpa menggunakan daging maka akan merubah minat masyarakat akan produknya. Disamping itu diperoleh data bahwa 85% RPH belum memiliki sertifikat Halal. Oleh karena itu penelitian ini menjadi penting dalam mendukung upaya pemerintah menjadikan Indonesia sebagai Pusat Halal Dunia di tahun 2024 ini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" width=\"435\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keywords: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self Declare, Supply Chain, Muhammadiyah, Halal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</jats:p>"

Patient safety in healthcare supply chains is paramount, particularly in the face of inherent risks and vulnerabilities associated with disruptions and uncertainties. A hybrid selection model, integrating factor analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), and the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), is introduced to rank these attributes. Twenty-two SHSC attributes are categorized into four facets: social, environmental, economic, and technological. A survey conducted across five Cambodian provinces gathered 361 valid responses from healthcare professionals, forming the basis for a structural SHSC model. This model is subsequently implemented in a Phnom Penh tertiary hospital. The findings underscore the imperative of incorporating patient safety considerations into healthcare supply chains. The hybrid selection model helps healthcare leaders figure out what factors are most important for patient safety and rank them. This gives them information they need to come up with effective strategies and long-lasting projects. The study's outcomes provide actionable insights for healthcare stakeholders. The multi-analytical approach of the model offers a comprehensive perspective to address supply chain challenges, reduce extraneous costs, and minimize environmental footprints. In essence, the effective implementation of sustainable healthcare supply chain strategies not only enhances care quality and fortifies patient safety but also aligns with the broader objectives of healthcare entities.</jats:p>"

According to a research from the Health Research Funding organization, between 10–30% of pharmaceuticals in underdeveloped nations are counterfeit. The primary problem is not in counterfeiting per such, but rather in the fact that these pharmaceuticals have distinct adverse consequences on human health when compared to regular drugs. The WHO estimates that over 30% of all medications sold in Latin America, Asia, and Africa are fake. This is the main issue facing the entire world, and things become worse in underdeveloped nations where one in ten medications are either counterfeit or do not adhere to drug standards. It is becoming increasingly challenging to standardize drug safety due to the growth of online pharmacies. It is challenging to identify fakes. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain is becoming a serious public health concern, a process that affects all of us. In this work, we present a new approach to medication supply chain management that handles safe drug supply chain data using Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain-based platform. By implementing drug record transactions on a blockchain, a drug supply chain and smart healthcare ecosystem may be constructed. The suggested method addresses this issue. To allow for time-limited access to patient health information and electronic prescription records, a smart contract has been introduced.</jats:p>",

One key aspect involves strategically placing and sizing buffers to handle uncertainties (e.g., stochastic material lead-times and activity durations) within the prefabricated construction supply chain (PCSC). This study examines three buffering policies based on varying combinations of time and inventory buffers to mitigate stochastic material delays and activity prolongs in PSCS, namely, pure inventory buffering policy, pure time buffering policy, and mixed inventory-time buffering policy. To enable this analysis, we characterize how stochastic material delays originating from off-site supply chains impact project schedules, and then develop mathematical procedures for sizing inventory and/or time buffers under the three buffering policies. Case application and numerical analysis are conducted to investigate the performance of these buffering policies and the impact of the project characteristics on them (e.g., due date and arrival rate). Finally, insights are extracted to assist managers in choosing appropriate policies for projects with different characteristics. In general, combining inventory and time buffers results in better performance, particularly under tight project deadlines and high arrival rates. The pure time buffering policy can also be a viable option in specific situations, allowing managers to have more choices.</jats:p>",

This is due to various laws of time variation in thermal loads of residential, public and industrial buildings, and the high inertia of district heating systems. Currently, new technical capabilities have appeared that make it possible to implement methods of quantitative and qualitative regulation of heat load in heat supply systems, which have a number of advantages over qualitative regulation. Based on the equations of heat transfer, thermal and hydraulic balance, the article shows the interactions between the parameters of various types of heat supply systems, viz. valve opening degree, throughput capacity, flow rate, and coolant temperature. The type of flow characteristics of the control valve, temperature characteristics of heat supply systems, temperature control characteristics, thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the regulated area are determined. The purpose of the article was to consider the influence of the maximum throughput capacity of the control valve on the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of dependent and independent water heating systems. As a result of the analysis of the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of heating systems, recommendations have been developed for selecting valve parameters to ensure high-quality temperature control. For independent heat supply systems with a heat exchanger, it is recommended to install a control valve with a concave (logarithmic, parabolic or other) characteristic. In the case of installing a valve with a linear characteristic, the heat exchanger throughput capacity need to be greater than the maximum throughput capacity of valve (the pressure loss of the medium flow in open valve is higher than the pressure loss in the heat exchanger). For dependent heat supply systems, it is recommended to install a control valve with a linear characteristic and a maximum throughput capacity five times less than the throughput capacity of the jumper.</jats:p>"

The manual intermediary management of MSC and medicine data often leads to issues like unauthorized third parties participating in the process and illegally tempering medicine data. As a result of this medicine temperament, end users get counterfeit medicine that poses severe consequences for patients' health. Over time, manual data management and intermediaries transform into digital platforms that track, manage, and exchange data in real‐time. Real‐time data exchange opens attackers up to target MSCs, access medicine data illegally, and modify medicine conditions, locations, and specifications. With the objective of this, the proposed survey identifies security and privacy issues and discusses security solutions. This security solution involves various data security and privacy frameworks such as micro‐segmentation, zero trust model, and many other software‐based security solutions. Moreover, The proposed survey explores radio frequency identification for medicine tracking in which each intermediary transforms the medicine location over the internet. In contrast, the Internet of Things is used to exchange medicine temperature conditions in real‐time. Furthermore, cybersecurity‐based solutions help protect against malicious threats, and blockchain keeps data private and temper‐proof. Artificial intelligence provides machine learning and deep learning models for analyzing large amounts of data to generate insights from the MSC data. Therefore, this survey addresses the various security and privacy issues and provides solutions that help researchers carry out work in this domain.</jats:p>",

This research utilized the Fuzzy-AHP method to compose a risk index and assessed the key links within China’s natural gas supply chain from the import side to the domestic side. The results indicate that (a) for China’s gas import, the most influential risks are the correlated dependence risk, international relation risk, and supplier internal stability risk.

The most environmentally friendly hydrogen production method remains water electrolysis, where the electrolyzer constructs the physical interface between electrical energy and hydrogen energy. However, few articles have reviewed the electrolyzer from the perspective of power supply topology and control. This review is the first to discuss the positioning of the electrolyzer power supply in the future integrated energy system. The electrolyzer is reviewed from the perspective of the electrolysis method, the market, and the electrical interface modelling, reflecting the requirement of the electrolyzer for power supply. Various electrolyzer power supply topologies are studied and reviewed. Although the most widely used topology in the current hydrogen production industry is still single-stage AC/DC, the interleaved parallel LLC topology constructed by wideband gap power semiconductors and controlled by the zero-voltage switching algorithm has broad application prospects because of its advantages of high power density, high efficiency, fault tolerance, and low current ripple. Taking into account the development trend of the EL power supply, a hierarchical control framework is proposed as it can manage the operation performance of the power supply itself, the electrolyzer, the hydrogen energy domain, and the entire integrated energy system.</jats:p>"

This study maps the scope and structure of circularity in the manufacturing SC discipline and explores the evolution of the domain over time. We review 946 journal articles published between 2013 and September 2023. Our study identifies key drivers and barriers to circular economy (CE) deployment in manufacturing SC operations, bibliometric parameters, emerging research themes, decision support tools, theories and applications. Using the theory extension approach, we propose a strategic framework to fortify the deployment of circularity in SCs. This comprehensive study renders a methodological contribution through combined descriptive content analysis and bibliometric and network analyses to evaluate the circular manufacturing SC operations concepts, theories and applications. We posit that manufacturing firms require to deploy innovation‐led approaches to embed the CE strategies in their SC operations. We find that the studies investigating green skill development and circularity‐culture adoption can facilitate manufacturers to understand the efficacy of circularity in their SC operations. The findings of this study can facilitate the practitioners to identify the links between the CE approaches and their strategic implications and examine CE implementation at the strategic level.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it should be free of all kinds of microorganisms, and chemical substances that are dangerous to fauna and flora. Insufficient water supply is one of the issues confronting Middle Eastern countries, and Lebanon becomes a typical example. This study aims to evaluate the basic physical, chemical, and microbiological water properties for eight distinct sites, in southeastern Lebanon, identified during the coronavirus pandemic, as the worst economic situation to hit Lebanon began. These tests were carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO). The results were utilized to assess the level of environmental pollution. A comparison was made between the obtained results with other studies: Lebanon southwest and the northwest region of Jordan Valley. The novelty of this study stems from the fact that it is the first to shed light on the degree of pollution level and the lack of environmental education for water conservation and water pollution prevention in this unstudied area, and compares the results locally and regionally. In addition, the obtained results indicate the impact of the Coronavirus on the behavior of the habitants in this region.</jats:p>",

Under an input-process-output workflow, conventional risk prioritization uses a risk priority number (RPN) aligned to the risk analysis. Imprecise information coupled with a lack of dealing with hesitancy margins enlarges the scope, leading to improper assessment of risks. This significantly affects monitoring quality and performance. Against the backdrop, a methodology that identifies and prioritizes the operational supply chain risk factors signifies better risk assessment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p> The study proposes a multi-criteria model for risk prioritization involving multiple decision-makers (DMs). The methodology offers a robust, hybrid system based on the Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF) Set merged with the “Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution.” The nature of the model is robust. The same is shown by applying fuzzy concepts under multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to prioritize the identified business risks for better assessment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p> The proposed IF Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for risk prioritization model can improve the decisions within organizations that make up the chains, thus guaranteeing a “better quality in risk management.” Establishing an efficient representation of uncertain information related to traditional failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) treatment involving multiple DMs means identifying potential risks in advance and providing better supply chain control.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p> In a company’s supply chain, blockchain allows data storage and transparent transmission of flows with traceability, privacy, security and transparency (Roy <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2022). They asserted that blockchain technology has great potential for traceability. Since risk assessment in supply chain operations can be treated as a traceability problem, further research is needed to use blockchain technologies.

By this, the authors try to address the supply chain risk assessment and mitigation framework better than the conventional one. To the best of their knowledge, no study is found in existing literature attempting to explore the efficacy of the proposed hybrid approach over the traditional RPN system in prime sectors like steel (with production planning data). The validation experiment indicates the effectiveness of the results obtained from the proposed IF TOPSIS Approach to Risk Prioritization methodology is more practical and resembles the actual scenario compared to those obtained using the traditional RPN system (Kim <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2018; Kumar <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2018).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p> This study provides mathematical models to simulate the supply chain risk assessment, thus helping the manufacturer rank the risk level.

The model’s outcome substantially adds value to the current risk assessment and prioritization, significantly affecting better risk management quality.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Despite extensive research on nucleation, our understanding on supersaturation, nucleus seed formation and phase transition dynamics remains rudimentary. Here, we present exact statistical thermodynamic formula for the saturation degree, the most-probable size distribution of mesoscopic nuclei, and their phase transition, introducing the mesoscopic state defined by temperature, the total monomer concentration, and the largest cluster size (LCS). These results show that supersaturation emerges even at equilibrium for mesoscopic nuclei systems and decreases with the LCS. The size-distribution of nucleus seeds is either a unimodal or a monotonically decreasing function of size, depending on the system and temperature. There exists a critical supersaturation condition under which nucleus seeds undergo a phase transition, during which the most probable size exhibits an abrupt change. We also investigated nonequilibrium dynamics of supersaturation, nucleus seed formation, and phase transition, accounting for the monomer-supply-rate effects. Nucleus seeds attain either nonequilibrium-steady-state (NESS) or transient-oscillatory-state (TOS) depending on the monomer-supply-rate, before undergoing phase transition. In both NESS and TOS, nuclei assume a quasi-equilibrium size distribution; their population exhibits a universal power-law relaxation during the phase transition. This work can be extended to investigate diverse nucleation and phase transition phenomena prevalent across nature and industry.</jats:p>"

The closure of a valve can occur instantly, rapidly, or gradually, and the appropriate law can be convex, linear, or concave, depending on various factors. These factors include the pipe's characteristics (type, diameter, roughness, and length), the conveyed fluid (nature and temperature), and operating conditions (pressure and flow rate). Other factors that receive less attention, such as the duration of slow closure and the impact of soil load on the pipe, are also considered in this study. The main focus of this article is to investigate how the optimal law evolves based on the time it takes for a valve to gradually close, specifically in the case of a valve located at the end of an underground gravity supply pipe. The findings reveal that when the slow closure time (t) exceeds 0.50 times the return period (t4), the exponent of the optimal law becomes a damped periodic function. Each closure time corresponds to a unique optimal law, and as the valve closure time increases, the range of optimal laws becomes narrower.</jats:p>",

For these operators, we also discuss some basic properties, such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Additionally, we develop a MADM method based on the developed operators and apply it to solve the green supply chain management problems, which can implement environmentally friendly practices to minimize carbon emissions, resource consumption, and waste generation while promoting long-term sustainability. Finally, we verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method based on a comparative analysis between the proposed techniques and existing methods.</jats:p>",

This paper adopts a quantitative method that uses 21 criteria from the three sustainability dimensions to measure rice stakeholders’ decision-making activities against sustainable rice practices (SRPs) using a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process multi-criteria decision-making approach. The findings reveal that decisions with regard to water usage, supplier diversity, and a safe working environment were ranked high, while government intervention, quality assurance, transparency, and power usage ranked low. This implies that improved performance of other stakeholders across the rice value chain such as the government and extension officers would enhance productivity and drive food security in the region.</jats:p>"

Total Quality Management is a system that emphasises quality and focuses on ensuring customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a very important instrument for operational performance and business continuity. Therefore, this study aims to determine and analyse the effect of supply chain management (SCM) and total quality management (TQM) on operational performance (OP) mediated by competitive advantage (CA). Sample collection was carried out by distributing questionnaires, using purposive sampling technique, which is one of the non-probability sampling categories. The data analysis method uses structural equation model-partial least square (SEM-PLS). The results stated that the strategy of implementing supply chain management and total quality management together can increase competitive advantage. Increased competitive advantage can improve operational performance. The suggested policy implications are that the company can continue to maintain good relations with partners, produce products according to customer desires, competitive prices and timely products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Onion is one of India's most highly watched agricultural commodities. Onion prices have a direct impact on the average person's consumption basket. After China, India is second in terms of area and production, and third in terms of export. The market is critical to the success of any business, but it is especially vital for agricultural products like onions, which are more difficult to sell due to their seasonality, and bulkiness. The bulk of the state's onion growers are resource poor and lack storage facilities, forcing them to sell their crop to wholesalers shortly after harvest when the price is lowest. This study seeks to identify numerous challenges and restrictions involved in managing the onion supply chain, as well as identify and analyse alternative solutions that may be used to optimise onion supply chain management. It was discovered that the onion supply chain is constrained by a lack of grading facilities, a lack of grading storage facilities, and a lack of infrastructure. It must be determined that the public and commercial sectors must work together in a public-private partnership to develop physical infrastructure, information distribution, and the services necessary for quality and constant improvement of the supply chain. A sample of 120 farmers were randomly selected from Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. Descriptive statistics including frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, mean scale value were used to analyse the data.</jats:p>"

Considering a model community of forty houses with an average of six  occupants per home, the developed optimization algorithm using the simulated annealing heuristics approach minimizes the total  cost of continuous water distribution to the community through a system of pipe network in a way that satisfies the critical hydraulic rules and constraints for efficient water distribution. Thus, the controlled variables of the simulated system include volumetric flow,  velocity and head loss. To realize the desired goal, the prototyped communal water distribution system was first simulated by water free  fall i.e., only gravity feed under a peak demand flow condition. This facilitated the identification and localization of head-loss zones.  Subsequently, virtual pump stations of various capacities were optimally introduced as boosters at identified nodal points to overcome  critical head losses. The response of the system to varying capacities of the booster pumps was then used to analyse and determine the  optimum capacity of the pump. Simulation outcome showed that the optimum least cost design for a sixtyyear system’s life cycle is  achieved by using a combination of gravity and 5 hp (3.73 kW) pump with optimum pipe diameter ranging from 60 - 150mm.  </jats:p>"

BC functions to ensure supply chain performance, while the ML model ensures product quality.Design/methodology/approach: Smart Contracts will be built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine BC network based on Ethereum. The ML model to identify good and bad green coffee beans will be built using different YOLO algorithms, which will go through training and validation stages, namely using the k-fold cross validation method. The ML model algorithm is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using YOLOv5m, YOLOv6m and YOLOv7. The best model will be chosen based on the results of cross-validation with test data in the form of coffee image data that the model has never seen (unseen data). The whole process of building the ML model is done on the Google Collab Pro+ Virtual Machine.Findings: YOLOv5m outperformed the other models in both non-augmented and augmented training datasets, highlighting the proficiency of YOLOv5m in managing compact datasets and its resilience in the face of data augmentation, positioning it as a prime selection for quality discernment tasks within the realm of green coffee beans. The smart contracts offer an all-encompassing approach for user management, monitoring product status, and presenting traceability data within the framework of coffee plantation administration.Originality/value: This research contributes to the development of blockchain network as a solution to implement traceability systems along coffee supply chains in Indonesia. Moreover, it shows that while blockchain can ensure the process of production along the coffee supply to follow certain guidelines, machine learning can verify whether the product that was produced by utilizing BC is of high quality/acceptable.</jats:p>"

In particular, we illustrate a validated assessment and diagnostic tool, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI), adapted for supply chain managers with the intent of instilling corporate entrepreneurial activity among supply chain professionals. Granted, supply chain managers are typically tasked with meeting expectations toward customer service effectiveness, efficiency, asset utilization, and safety. Yet, we believe that forming an organizational environment conducive to entrepreneurial thinking could be extremely valuable in the supply chain realm, enhancing capabilities like agility, plasticity, and responsiveness such that innovation and business growth are achieved alongside traditional SCM expectations.

The closer the consumers are, the greater the market pricing power, so the pharmaceutical market power of manufacturers and retailers has also changed. This study considers the effect of service on the pricing strategy of the pharmaceutical platform supply chain. The study aimed to coordinate optimization, and the coordination strategy of the pharmaceutical platform supply chain of complementary products is discussed mainly by researching the price and service factors. Various situations are studied by hypothesis and model solving. This study uses Stackelberg game decision-making. Manufacturers are at the forefront of platform supply chain decisions. The research found that the price was lower under centralized decision-making than under decentralized decision-making. Coordination between price and service levels needs attention in the pharmaceutical platform supply chain of complementary products, and the service level should be controlled within a certain range. Only by improving the service level can enterprises maximize profits, providing a theoretical basis for pharmaceutical supply chain pricing strategy research. Supply chain members must strive to improve service levels to improve medical supply consumers’ (patients) psychological satisfaction level. Service levels do not fully mitigate channel conflict. Therefore, pharmaceutical complements have become a way to alleviate the conflicts in the pharmaceutical platform supply chain.</jats:p>"

We inventoried the desires for public goods across Dutch society, and projections of agricultural supply. A multi-method approach was used to find agreement levels between desired and expected change in good delivery. Most stakeholders expressed a desire for biodiversity and climate regulation from agriculture, whilst desire for natural heritage and recreation was less common. The utility of a public good to a stakeholder appears to influence its desire. Scenarios for agriculture focus on extensification, sustainable intensification, regionalization, or meadow bird conservation. Regionalized scenarios showed the highest agreement between public good supply and desire. Maximizing alignment between desire and supply thus requires a challenging transition towards region-specific agricultural sustainability strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High nitrogen (N) efficiency crop genotypes utilize resources rationally and reduce N losses. To evaluate the extent of genotypic variation in response to N supply, twenty-four maize genotypes were grown in Soilrite (peat mass, vermiculite and pearlite mix) supplied with low N level (2mM) or normal N level (25mM) in Hoagland solution.  At 21 DAS the average shoot height (SH), leaf area (LA), stem dry weight (SDW), leaf dry weight (LDW), above ground dry weight (ADW), root dry weight (RDW) and total plant dry weight (PDW) were 38.1, 257.5, 67.3, 121.5, 96.9, 49.4, 76.9 and 140.6% higher respectively in seedlings exposed to normal N treatment than those grown under low N level. The shoot N content (SNC), root N content (RNC), above ground N accumulation (ANA), root N (RNA) and total plant N accumulation (PNA) were found to be 1.79, 2.23, 3.51, 3.30 and 3.44-fold increased at normal N supply over low N. Coefficients of variation (CV) varied greatly and ranged from 10.9-37.8 and 9.4-36.7 under low-N and normal-N treatment, respectively. LA, SDW, LDW, ADW, TDW, SNC, RNC, ANA, RNA and TNA showed significant positive correlation both under low N and normal N regime (p&lt; 0.05). SDW, LDW, ADW, PDW, SNC, RNC, ANA, RNA and PNA were significantly correlated and had high CVs reflecting the difference of N in different maize genotypes and these parameters were selected for calculation of N efficiency comprehensive index.  According to the N efficiency comprehensive index scatter map under low and normal N conditions, genotypes HKI-164-D4, HKI-325-17 AN, HKI-1332, DTL-3, DTL-2, DHM-117 and DTL-1 were efficient under both low and normal-N conditions and genotypes DTL-10, SNJ-2011-96, PSRJ-13099, NSJ-211 and Z59-17were inefficient under both low and normal-N conditions</jats:p>",

From national level bans and phase out policies to divestment campaigns and the creation of ‘climate clubs’ such as the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, an increasing number of such policies are being adopted by governments, cities and financial actors around the world. But why would states voluntarily relinquish potentially profitable reserves of fossil fuels? How can we account for the rise of supply-side policies, the form they take and the sites in which they are being adopted? What conditions and contexts are most conducive to the adoption and sustainability of ‘first mover’ bans and phase out policies? This paper seeks to build an interdisciplinary account fusing insights from diverse theoretical traditions from international political economy, political science, sociology and the literature on socio-technical transitions in order to capture the interaction of political, economic and socio-cultural drivers in national and international settings which can provide the basis of a more integrated and multi-dimensional understanding of supply-side policies. Such an account, we suggest, helps to understand the origins and evolution of supply-side policies and, more critically, the conditions which might enable the expansion of supply-side climate policies to new sites.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Thedistribution of products stands out as one of the pivotal activities for logistics companies in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical events. Intense competition compels companies to efficiently execute their logistical processes, with cross-docking emerging as a frequently applied solution. However, the location of cross-dock terminals in urban areas remains a problem insufficiently addressed in the literature, with a dearth of studies and models tackling this issue. This paper introduces a novel and innovative model for locating cross-dock terminals based on the CI-DEA–IDOCRIW–MABAC (Composite Indicators–Data Envelopment Analysis-Integrated Determination of Objective Criteria Weights–Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison) methods. In the process of defining input indicators, the following three sources were utilized: relevant literature, practical insights from logistics experts, and the knowledge and experience of the authors. Eight inputs and three outputs were considered (the number of users in the observed channel; the area served by the channel; the average distance a vehicle travels in one delivery; the required number of vehicles; labor availability; competition; construction, and expansion possibilities; proximity to the main infrastructure and traffic facilities; the average number of deliveries; average delivered quantity; and service level). The model underwent testing in a case study analyzing nine distribution channels (areas within the observed urban zone). The results indicated that alternative A4 (in the southwest area) ranked the highest since it was the best-ranked in accordance with the most important criteria, suggesting that the terminal is best located in the southwest zone. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by company management. By developing a completely new model and addressing the identified gap in the literature, this paper provides unequivocal scientific contributions.</jats:p>"

Therefore, a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system is a very important aspect of business operations that involves coordinating the activities involved in the production and delivery of goods and services to customers. SCM can be applied to small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the Minahasa Cooperatives and UMKM Department to improve their performance and competitiveness. SCM aims to efficiently manage the flow of goods, information and capital from suppliers to end consumers. This research aims to design and develop a web-based Supply Chain Management system for the Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs by applying the k-means algorithm for customer segmentation. In this research, the K-Means algorithm is used to group similar data points. This algorithm works by defining clusters so that the total intra-cluster variation (known as total within-cluster variation) is minimized. The results of this research can help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain management. In developing this system, customer, supplier and product data were successfully grouped into several groups based on similar characteristics using the k-means algorithm. Apart from that, the system that has been developed can also help facilitate the SCM process by utilizing information technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

Methods: This study’s population comprised all companies in the manufacturing sector in Jordan. A simple random method was applied to gather data from 278 companies. The research model was evaluated in terms of validity and reliability, which were found to be satisfactory. Hayes’s PROCESS macro in IBM SPSS was applied for hypothesis testing. Results: The findings showed that GSCM directly and positively affected CE performance. Moreover, GSCM showed positive impacts on the three types of green innovation. In addition, the three innovation types demonstrated positive impacts on CE performance and proved to positively mediate the GSCM–CE performance relationship. Conclusions: The present study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to examine the mediating effect of green innovations on the GSCM–CE performance relationship. It is also among the first to examine the impact of GSCM on three different types of green innovation that represent technological and non-technological innovations.</jats:p>"

The product fails if any of its components (or elements of work) fails, but finding the faulty component can be prohibitively difficult. We study group warranty contracts for the manufacturer to induce suppliers to improve their quality levels. When information is symmetric and the manufacturer can contract on his own quality level, we show that a group warranty contract can achieve the first-best outcome. When the manufacturer’s quality level is not contractible, we show that the manufacturer and all the suppliers under-invest in qualities. We then extend our model to the asymmetric information case where suppliers have private quality cost information. Further, we consider whether the manufacturer benefits from sourcing multiple components from a single supplier, that is, supply consolidation. We find that supply consolidation benefits the manufacturer when his quality level is not contractible, but hurts him in the presence of asymmetric quality cost information of the suppliers. </jats:p>",

Public procurement price variance is deemed a key inefficiency in public expenditure contributing to the loss of colossal amounts of Money. Mechanisms to achieve realistic public procurement prices are stipulated in the existing public procurement regulatory regime; However, Price variances, manifesting in inflated tenders, are abound. The extent and drivers are yet to be empirically examined. This study adopted an exploratory approach to examine the extent of public procurement price variance; by conducting variance analysis of market prices and prices of goods contained in procurement contracts of 336 public procuring entities (Ministries, Departments, and Agencies) in Kenya in the 2022/2023 Financial Year. Analysis of data drawn from a random sample of 40 MDAs, indicates that all items acquired by MDAs were overpriced: at between 20% and 220% of the market price. Analysis of drivers of overpricing ranked: “budgeted kickbacks/bribes”; “Response to Late Payments by MDAs”; “Collusive Bidding”; and “Over-use of non-competitive methods”; as key drivers. The study reviewed the price oversight mechanism of the public procurement system in Kenya and recommends the adoption of a live internal public procurement audit model to monitor and oversight pricing. This will require a review of the regulatory regime to entrench the internal procurement audit model into the public procurement process. The study also recommends a public procurement study to examine the extent and magnitude of procurement price variance across Kenya and its fiscal effect on the Economy.</jats:p>",

The developed conceptual model of logistics company adaptation defines the tasks, principles, components, and stages of adaptive management, allowing the logistics company to obtain a synergistic effect from the implementation of the model as a complete system, provides an opportunity to improve the quality of management, forming a proactive adaptation management mechanism. Taking into account modern trends, in the conceptual model adaptation and sustainable development are highlighted as its main components, since sustainable development is based on compliance with the principles of environmental sustainability and social responsibility, adaptation is defined as a tool for the effective implementation of these principles in a logistics company in a changing environment. It was determined that to make corrective changes to the existing business model, it is necessary to assess the existing level of adaptability of the logistics company. To implement this approach, a system for evaluating the effectiveness of adaptive management of business processes of a logistics company has been developed, which consists of 7 subsystems, having a variable character, oriented to any stage of the company's digitalization. Applying a comprehensive approach to the system of evaluating the effectiveness of adaptive management based on the calculation of integral criteria for each subsystem is justified, which are summarized in a total integral indicator that summarizes the influence of all factors and determines the degree of adaptability of the logistics company's business model.</jats:p>"

The removal of ammonium is based on the nitrification process. Nitrification depends on many factors, such as water quality and filtration process parameters. To investigate the influence of filtration rate on the nitrification efficiency, nitrifying biofilters were formed at the pilot plant in the industry for drinking water production from surface water. The new biological filters were started under optimal conditions for biofilm formation. After the biofilm formation, the influence of the filtration rate on nitrification was examined over 3 months (from November to January). The time required for the spontaneous growth of nitrifying bacteria on the new filters was around 70 days. The operating conditions at the start-up period were the continuous flow of water containing γ(NH4+) ≈ 1mg/L, dissolved oxygen in a concentration &amp;gt;9 mg/L, filtration rate &amp;lt;1 m/h, inlet water temperature &amp;gt;12 °C and pH from 7.8 to 8. After the complete formation of the nitrifying biofilm, the percentage of NH4+ removal was greater than 95% for all tested filtration rates, from 0.5 to 8.4 m/h, at γ(NH4+) from 1 to 2.5 mg/L and raw water temperature from 13 to 7°C.</jats:p>",

Here we present a stylized stochastic food production model to show how optimal crop allocations change depending on food security risk targets. To guarantee stable livelihoods for farmers, we examine the viability of a contingency fund that supports farmers in the event of low crop yields. Applied to the West African context, accounting for weather variability can substantially improve the reliability of the food supply and boost the fiscal sustainability of a contingency fund. Yet, setting reliability targets for food security is costly and leaves high residual risk in certain regions. Spatial risk-sharing through regional cooperation at the West African scale can eliminate the risk of insufficient food supply and further enhance the fund solvency.</jats:p>"

Time-averaged velocity was measured over a sand-filled gravel-bed stream with four cases of sediment depositions and compared with those over a gravel-bed stream without sediment depositions. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure the instantaneous velocity of flows. The progressive infilling of void spaces in the gravel-bed stream forms distinct bimodal depositions that alter the mean flows characterised by increasing zero-velocity levels and massive damping in the bed shear stresses. The data plots of turbulent intensity depict enhancement of streamwise turbulent intensity in the near-bed flow region with increasing sand depositions. Moreover, the opposite nature of streamwise and vertical turbulent kinetic energy fluxes in the interfacial sublayer leads to slowing down the time-average Reynolds shear stresses at the vicinity of the gravel-bed surface. At the vicinity of the crest, the ejection and sweep events contributed approximately 86 and 56%, respectively, to the total Reynolds shear stress production in the case of gravel bed under clear-water flow conditions. By contrast, the contributions of turbulent sweep events increased over the sand-filled gravel bed at the same location.</jats:p>",

Furthermore. The KS coefficient was used to analyze the producers' risk-taking behavior after estimating the production function and determining the area variable that has the most influence on the production process. If it increased by 1%, production would increase by 0.802%. The farmer's decision to adopt the technology was based on economic, social, and institutional factors. It turns out that 40% of farmers make their decision based on financing. When analyzing the decisions of farmers under risk, it was found that 35% of them make the decision in relation to the price, which is the main incentive for production. In order to understand the relationship between the risk, the return, and the size of the farm, it was found that when the area is increased, the return increases, and the revenue of a dunum at the tenure size of 10 dunams amounted to 481,600 dinars and at a higher KS level, what is known as risk-haters, the revenue was the highest possible and the risk also increased with it, and the farmers became among the large holdings they prefer. In any case, some farmers believe that when you want to get a higher return, it is important to keep in mind that there is a greater risk. Risk is affected by a number of factors, including economic, divided into price and productivity, social ones, and others related to the farmer himself in terms of efficiency, management, skill, and experience. .

To achieve its aim, the study explores how the NGP might influence future economic growth, natural gas reserves and electricity supply. Econometric techniques are employed for analysis, where real GDP is dependent variable, and the NGP is the dummy explanatory variable alongside other explanatory variables. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillip Perron Methods were used for unit root tests. The ARDL bounds tests indicated evidence of co-integration and long-run relationships among the variables. From the results, electricity supply and the NGP have a positive and significant relationship with real GDP. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a control variable, had a negative and significant relationship with real GDP in the short run. Also, the Error Correction Term is -0.2228. Consequently, the speed of adjustment for the model to return to long-run equilibrium after a shock is 22.28%. The study also found that the current two (2) percent annual growth rate of proven NG reserves is inadequate to cater for the rapid growth in the NG sector considering the positive effect of the NGP. The study, therefore, recommends that policymakers should continue to promote the NGP programme because it contributes positively to real GDP. In addition, consideration should be given to a diverse energy mix policy to reduce the over-reliance of electricity generation on NG-fired power plants, consequently, policymakers should promote policies that will lead to the diversification of the energy source for power generation.</jats:p>"

Employing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for nonlinear processing, Savitzky–Golay (S–G) filtering to reduce high-frequency noise, gate recurrent unit (GRU) neural network for linear feature signal processing, and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) for nonlinear signal handling, we established a comprehensive model combining EWT-S–G-GRU and LSSVM. The results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits superior accuracy in groundwater depth prediction, with an average relative error of only 2.14% and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.93. This outperforms the other four models, with average relative errors of 12.88%, 11.90%, 7.07%, and 11.10%, and NSE values of 0.58, 0.56, 0.71, and 0.73, respectively. The superiority of the model established in this study is attributed to its effective handling of both nonlinear and linear features of groundwater, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. The EWT-S–G-GRU and LSSVM model proves to be more reliable in revealing the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of future groundwater, providing a robust reference for the rational development and utilization of groundwater in the urban area of Xinxiang City.</jats:p>",

To shed light on this issue and facilitate more informed policy discussions, this article delves into six decades of research, encompassing negative income tax and BI experiments, lottery studies and unconditional cash transfers (UCTs). In an effort to advance existing knowledge, we not only review the labour supply outcomes of existing studies but also systematically examine their design features, implementation characteristics and analyses. Our examination reveals the presence of significant methodological shortcomings in much of the empirical research. Great caution is thus advised when making broader inferences about the impacts of a BI.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to reduce the costs of the entire chain, risk, emission of pollutants, and time to deliver the product to the customer in uncertain demand condition. In this paper, the NSGAII algorithm is used to solve the model. In this algorithm, among the answers of each generation, a number of them are selected using the two-run tournament selection method. In the binary selection method, the answers are randomly selected from the population, and then a comparison is made between these two answers, and whichever is better is finally selected. The selection criteria in NSGA-II are, firstly, the rank, and secondly, the crowding distance related to the answer. Also, the performance of the NSGA-II algorithm on the same model and data has been compared with the MOPSO algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, if it encounters an impossible solution, it exits the local mode and solves the problem in global conditions. The results show that the proposed method strikes a better balance between discovery and efficiency criteria and avoids falling into local optima. Therefore, in addition to its effectiveness in discovering optimal answers, the genetic-based method has high speed and subsequently, high convergence and diversity rates compared to the particle swarm method. Also, compared to previous methods in the green closed-loop supply chain, the proposed method is better than the modified genetic algorithm, reducing the costs of the chain by about 2.38%.</jats:p>"

The contributions to the SI focus on the reconfiguration of the means and methods of the exploitation of migrant labour during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related reorganisation of contemporary border and migration regimes. They all focus, more or less explicitly, on the adaptation and reorganisation of migrant labour supply chains which were disrupted through the ‘double crisis’ of public health and existing border and mobility regimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this way, the SI seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of COVID-capitalism, understood as a form of disaster capitalism, in which fractions of capital try to turn the multiple crises implicated by the pandemic into a source of profit. If and how they succeed with these endeavours is, however, not guaranteed from the outset but an empirical question. The study of migrant labour supply chains does thus not only help to develop a more nuanced understanding of disaster capitalism but also contributes to debates on the logistification of migration management. </jats:p>",

Machine learning models, which are gaining popularity due to their accessibility and ability to reveal complex relationships, play a significant role in tackling these challenges. The efficacy of gene expression programming (GEP) models, support vector machines (SVMs), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) has been assessed through measured data of number 540 obtained from six rivers, namely Oak Creek, Nahal Yatir, Sagehen Creek, Elbow River, Jacoby River, and Goodwin Creek from 1954 to 1992. The assessment of model performance has been conducted utilizing root mean square error (RMSE), R2, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and developed discrepancy ratio (DDR) as indices. Following data normalization within the range of 0–1, the data models underwent training and testing processes with a partition ratio of 80% for training and 20% for testing. Four dimensionless parameters, denoted as Fr = U/√gy, U/U*, Se, and ω = τU/γs√gyDs3, were employed as inputs in the models. The outcomes indicate that they exhibit superior performance compared to other methods, as evidenced by the following metrics in predicting BSL during the test stage: RMSE = 1.4088, NSE = 0.73054, R2 = 0.8729, and maximum QDDR(max) = 1.9564.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the current SCR-related academic literature related to SCR to develop a new holistic definition. A total amount of 214 scientific contributions the last 5 years (i.e., between 2018 and 2022) have been analyzed. Findings revealed four important issues to achieve SCR, i.e., <jats:italic>Key resilience attributes</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Technology-aided visible</jats:italic> <jats:italic>SC</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Sustainable and measurable SCR practices</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Relationship between SC partners</jats:italic>. Leveraging insights gleaned from these critical issues, we have meticulously crafted an updated and comprehensive definition of SCR, by considering the multi-faceted facets that contribute to its holistic understanding. In light of our emerging insights, we suggest a novel approach to fortify organizational supply chain resilience, emphasizing a more holistic perspective. Our recommendations for future research include (1) exploring the integration of emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring to enhance adaptive decision-making in post-COVID-19 supply chains, (2) investigating the strategic role of collaborative networks and information sharing among supply chain partners to enhance agility and responsiveness amidst post-pandemic uncertainties, and (3) analyzing the impact of sustainable and circular supply chain practices on resilience. Findings of the paper and the new holistic definition of SCR have several implications for both academics and managers that are listed at the end of the paper along with limitations of the study and future research avenues.</jats:p>"

In 2023, there were 1.0 DBP subspecialists per 100 000 US children aged 0 to 17 years (range 0.0–3.8), with wide variability in DBP subspecialist distribution. Given the prevalence of DB conditions, the current workforce is markedly inadequate to meet the needs of patients and families. The American Board of Pediatrics Foundation led a modeling project to forecast the US pediatric subspecialty workforce from 2020 to 2040 using current trends in each subspecialty. The model predicts workforce supply at baseline and across alternative scenarios and reports results in headcount (HC) and HC adjusted for percent time spent in clinical care, termed “clinical workforce equivalent.” For DBP, the baseline model predicts HC growth nationally (+45%, from 669 to 958), but these extremely low numbers translate to minimal patient care impact. Adjusting for population growth over time, projected HC increases from 0.8 to 1.0 and clinical workforce equivalent from 0.5 to 0.6 DBP subspecialists per 100 000 children aged 0 to 18 years by 2040. Even in the best-case scenario (+12.5% in fellows by 2030 and +7% in time in clinical care), the overall numbers would be minimally affected.

The authors analyzed the measures to increase the energy efficiency of the educational buildings of the NUWEE, namely, the installation of thermal insulation of facades, roofs, floors on the ground and first surfaces, replacement of windows and doors, installation of thermal insulation of pipelines, modernization of automated thermal energy regulation units (ATERU), heating system and lighting, implementation of the energy monitoring and dispatching system, installation of the ventilation system with exhaust air heat recovery. Implementation of the proposed measures will reduce energy consumption and related costs by 60 %, namely by 6,232 MWh/year (compared to the baseline level of energy consumption of 10,286 MWh/year). It will result increasing of the buildings’ comfort and functionality. After the implementation of the described measures, the increase of the energy efficiency class of educational buildings is predicted. The implementation of energy-efficient measures will also lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 50 %, namely by 1,648 t/year. Measures that can pay off as soon as possible are the implementation of thermal insulation of pipelines, modernization of ATERU and lighting, implementation of energy monitoring and dispatching systems. The longest payback period will require the installation of ventilation air heat recovery, but this measure is necessary in view of the current reduction in heat energy costs for heating the external supply air in the cold period of the year.</jats:p>"

Several international and European policies such as Agenda 2030 and the European Green Deal have been defined with the aim of making agri-food systems more sustainable at all stages of the supply chain, from production to consumption. Particularly, the European Union concentrates several policies on it. Therefore, the assessment of the level of sustainability among the states of the European Union is a key aspect to properly address and evaluate the implementation of these policies. The objective of this paper is to measure the sustainability of the global agri-food supply chain (AFSC) of the European Union countries through the application of a multi-criteria analysis. In particular, the method used is the Multiple Reference Point Partially Compensatory Indicator, which allows the creation of composite indicators using different levels of compensation across them. A set of 50 indicators, referred to 2011 and 2019, were built and then divided into the three basic dimensions of sustainability (economic, social and environmental), aggregated into the four main AFSC sectors (agriculture, food industry, distribution, and consumption) in order to obtain an overall sustainability index. Through such an index we provided a sustainability ranking for the EU countries, while the analysis of dimensions of each sector contributed to increase the knowledge about the supply chain that can be used by decision-makers. According to the results, Italy achieved the best level of sustainability of the AFSC with a value of 48.53, followed by Sweden, Austria, Spain, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal and Slovakia. In relation to the different sectors, the biggest problems were observed in the consumption sector, where most countries did not perform well, especially for the social dimension (e.g. excess of overweight and obese persons). In contrast, the performance of the agricultural sector was good, with few exceptions, showing a fair state of sustainability.</jats:p>"

The reduction of food waste and biodiversity loss are also specified in the Sustainable Development Goals 12.3 and 15 of the United Nations. However, which supply chain stages and food products to target with policy measures is hardly known. Especially, a differentiation of the impact after sub‐stages and taxa is still missing and is therefore quantified in the present study. The food waste mass at five supply chain stages and seven sub‐stages in Germany was calculated and differentiated after 204 food products. All products were traced back to their countries of origin, in which their land use impact on mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants was quantified. A new approach was developed to calculate the detailed feed demand for animal products. Germany's avoidable food waste (food that was edible before its disposal) leads to 0.3 vertebrate and 1.5 plant species being potentially lost globally. Household‐level waste is responsible for 47% of this species loss, while food services show the largest impact per mass, with individual catering being as influential as one‐person households. The most influential products are obtained from pigs and cattle. Among vertebrate taxa, mainly amphibians are affected, occurring in the mainly affected country Brazil. The results can be used to formulate policies that target, for example, individual catering or display the impact of animal products and their feed demand.</jats:p>",

It has been identified that the spectrum of existing research on scientific approaches to competitiveness management requires some structuring and refinement, taking into account the latest trends and the specifics of the activities of aviation enterprises in modern conditions. A unique perspective on structuring scientific approaches to managing the competitiveness of aviation enterprises has been proposed, according to which the discussed approaches are categorized depending on the object, target parameters, scientific directions, innovative technologies, and combined objects. The advantage of such structuring lies in a better understanding of the specifics of existing approaches and the identification of innovative scientific approaches to enterprise competitiveness management that require further research. Special attention has been paid to the study of key aspects and specifics of the logistic approach, which involves finding a compromise and balance of interests and responsibilities, consistency and coordination of actions, subordination of partial to general, and measuring the results of activities not only from the perspective of resource savings but also the magnitude of losses caused by irrational actions of chain participants. The logistic approach to managing the competitiveness of aviation enterprises lies in the implementation of the supply chain management concept, aimed at effectively servicing demand and creating additional value for consumers, and realizes a customer-oriented approach to competitiveness management. Direct tools of the logistic approach that can be effective in managing aviation logistic processes have been identified in the article, such as ESG technologies, CALS technologies, Agile approach, IoT, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, robotic systems. The advantages of these tools and their application areas are indicated. Thus, the use of various approaches and technologies will enable aviation enterprises to find optimal solutions to enhance their competitiveness in modern conditions.</jats:p>"

However, challenges like scalability, privacy, and interoperability persist. This study explores the scarcity of real-world blockchain implementations in supply chain and logistics since we have not witnessed many real-world deployments of blockchain-based solutions in the field. Puzzled by this, we integrate technology, user experience, and operational efficiency to illuminate the complex landscape of blockchain integration. We present blockchain-based solutions in three use cases, comparing them with alternative designs and analyzing them in terms of technical, economic, and operational aspects. Insights from a tailored questionnaire of 50 questions addressed to practitioners and experts offer crucial perspectives on blockchain adoption. One of the key findings from our work shows that half of the companies interviewed agree that they will miss the potential for competitive advantage if they do not invest in blockchain technology, and 61% of the companies surveyed claimed that their customers ask for more transparency in supply chain-related transactions. However, only one-third of the companies were aware of the main features of blockchain technology, which shows a lack of knowledge among the companies that may lead to a weaker blockchain adaption in supply chain use cases. Our readers should note that our study is specifically contextualized in a Netherlands-funded national project. We hope that researchers as well as stakeholders in supply chain and logistics can benefit from the insights of our work.</jats:p>"

In the VUCA era, many studies have identified three dimensions (sensing capability, seizing capability and reconfiguring capability) as organizational antecedents that contribute to supply chain resilience from the perspective of dynamic capability. However, the current literature on the antecedents of supply chain resilience largely lacks a managerial perspective. Research has shown that firms rely on supply chain managers when developing supply chain resilience. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms at play in supply chain resilience and its organizational antecedents. Based on existing research, this study explores the paths and effects of managerial antecedents (dynamic management capability) and organizational antecedents (dynamic capability) on supply chain resilience by integrating dynamic and management capabilities. Through a questionnaire survey of supply chain managers in Chinese manufacturing companies, 223 valid sample data points were collected and tested empirically. The results show that the three dimensions of dynamic management capability (managers’ social capital, human capital and cognition) are positively related to supply chain resilience and that supply chain resilience is influenced by the mediating effect of the three dimensions of dynamic capability (sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities). We argue that managers should focus on developing their social capital, human capital and cognition to improve supply chain resilience. This study explains dynamic management capability's role and logical path in supply chain resilience. Furthermore, it examines the mediating effects and internal logic of the three dimensions of dynamic capabilities, providing a new perspective for supply chain resilience research and bringing some management insights for managers to effectively improve firm supply chain resilience in terms of social relationship management and related learning skills.</jats:p>",

Climate change is dramatically altering global precipitation patterns across terrestrial ecosystems, making it critically important that we understand both how and why plant species vary in their drought sensitivities. Andropogon gerardii and Schizachyrium scoparium, both C4 grasses, provide a model system for understanding the physiological mechanisms that determine how species of a single functional type can differ in drought responses, an issue remains a critical gap in our ability to model and predict the impacts of drought on grassland ecosystems. Despite its greater lability of foliar water content, previous experiments have demonstrated that S. scoparium maintains higher photosynthetic capacity during droughts. It is therefore likely that the ability of S. scoparium to withstand drought instead derives from a greater metabolic resistance to drought. Here, we tested the following hypotheses: (H1) A. gerardii is more vulnerable to drought than S. scoparium at both the population and organismal levels, (H2) A. gerardii is less stomatally flexible than S. scoparium, and (H3) A. gerardii is more metabolically limited than S. scoparium. Our results indicate that it is actually stomatal limitations of CO2 supply that limit A. gerardii photosynthesis during drought. Schizachyrium scoparium was more drought-resistant than A. gerardii based on long-term field data, organismal biomass production and physiological gas exchange measurements. While both S. scoparium and A. gerardii avoided metabolic limitation of photosynthesis, CO2 supply of A. gerardii was greatly reduced during late-stage drought stress. That two common, co-occurring C4 species possess such different responses to drought highlights the physiological variability inherent within plant functional groups and underscores the need for more studies of C4 drought tolerance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Effectively managing drug demand and supply through pharmaceutical quantification is critical as it ensures that medications are readily available when needed while reducing costs, optimizing inventory management, and ultimately improving patient care. This research aimed to examine the existing literature on the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) on predicting pharmaceutical demand in public systems. This review focused specifically on the accuracy of these methods, their limitations, and the ethical concerns associated with their use. Methods: The research used PubMed and Google Scholar databases, following PRISMA principles, and yielded 13 peer-reviewed articles. The quality of the included studies was assessed for potential bias using established standard criteria, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Checklist Tool for systematic reviews of intervention. Results: The results show that linear regression and random forest are the predominant models for predicting medication quantities in hospital pharmacies. However, the precision of these models can be affected by data entry inaccuracies and fluctuations. The study identified technical, human, and organizational obstacles as barriers to adoption, as well as problems related to privacy and confidentiality. Conclusion: The use of AI and ML can estimate the demand and supply of medicine in public pharmaceutical delivery systems. The results highlight the importance of further study to improve forecasting algorithm simulation accuracy, broaden single time-series projections to incorporate additional patient-associated factors and investigate various efficiency measures.</jats:p>"

It has been established that the main part of their product supply is formed by households and at the expense of imports. Based on the determination of indicators of the sufficiency of food consumption in Ukraine, it was established that the most critical is the provision of domestic demand for fruit. Elasticity indicators for prices, incomes and substitute products were determined. The coefficients of price elasticity of demand and supply show that consumers and producers respond to price changes – when they increase, demand decreases, and as a result, supply volumes. It was determined that the demand for stone fruits and nuts changes most noticeably when the income of the population varies. The coefficients of the cross-elasticity of the demand for fruits have a positive value. Therefore, there is a direct dependence on the price change for substitute products.</jats:p>"

To tackle inefficiencies and cost-saving opportunities, different technologies are being explored. One promising contender in this regard is blockchain, which offers innovative solutions to transform the landscape. This study proposes an inventive supply-chain system leveraging blockchain technology to address the limitations of conventional approaches. By employing a distributed, immutable, and highly reliable ledger concept, the suggested Blockchain system facilitates transparent record-keeping and provenance tracking at a reduced cost, all without the need for a third-party intermediary. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using Hyperledger Fabric in the presented paper.</jats:p>",

Based on the theory and evidence that backlog orders’ predictive power is diminished further in a supply chain due to the bullwhip effect, we hypothesize and find that the overpricing of order backlog is mainly driven by upstream rather than downstream firms. More importantly, we use both hedge portfolio methods and Fama-MacBeth regressions to show that common institutional investors in a supply chain can utilize their knowledge to better incorporate the bullwhip effect and mitigate the magnitude of order backlog mispricing. Further, we find that the overpricing of second-tier suppliers’ backlog orders and thus, the role of supply chain common institutional investors is more pronounced during expansion periods than during recession periods. Overall, we highlight the role of institutional supply chain knowledge in improving pricing efficiencies of complex supply chain dynamics. </jats:p>"

The exponentiation conversion circuit multiplies the logarithmically converted input signal by a power exponent value to perform exponential conversion. As a result, we can obtain the power function characteristic of a power exponent value. This circuit is a small-scale circuit that utilizes the exponential characteristics of the MOSFET subthreshold region. In a conventional circuit, expansion of the signal dynamic range and reduction of the power supply voltage have been an issue. In this paper, it was confirmed by simulation that the signal dynamic range has expanded by optimizing the current density of MOSFETs. In addition, the linearity of the multiplying circuit was improved by feedback produced by the operational amplifier circuits. We proposed reducing its power supply voltage from 6.0 to 3.3 V by a new multiplying circuit that can eliminate the restriction of maximum voltage gain. Our circuit expands its signal dynamic range from 17.5 to 42.7 dB in condition of the power exponent value from 0.50 to 2.0.</jats:p>",

We apply the proposed approach to a case study considering deploying in-state renewable ammonia manufacturing in Minnesota’s supply chain network. We find that accounting for price uncertainty leads to supply chains with more ammonia demand met via renewable production and thus lower costs from importing ammonia from existing producers. These results show that the in-state renewable production of ammonia can act as a hedge against the volatility of the conventional ammonia market.</jats:p>"

The aim of this analysis is to reduce damage to the Nippon Oil Pump (NOP) Type Slocoid Top 208 HBM and increase the production of higher quality cat food. From the results of the analysis carried out, there were several findings that caused wear on the gear pump, including the viscosity of the material being channeled which was very thick, reaching 1.37 cp.

More specifically, we provide an operating policy for Depository Institutions (DIs) to improve their efficiency in packaging, distributing, coordinating, and managing the inventory of coins. We further propose a new policy (via a Rewards Program) to increase coin circulation in the economy and optimally determine a reward price, which, if implemented by the Federal Reserve System (FRS), can incentivize DIs to process the coins themselves and/or frequently deposit excess coins at the FRS. We identify the structures of DIs’ best response to the reward price and FRS’s optimal pricing policy. The results and insights developed in this study can be beneficial to both the FRS and DIs in increasing the efficiency of the nation’s coin circulation and thereby reducing their operating costs. Additionally, to estimate the societal benefit from the Rewards Program, we formulate the coin flow for an entire FRS region as an optimization problem from the supply side perspective and quantify the societal costs (and benefits) with and without the reward. We show via numerical experiments that both the FRS and Dis reduce their operating costs as a result of the program and produce a surplus benefit for the society. The reward price that maximizes this surplus is determined optimally. We also propose a robust optimization framework to help DIs and the FRS to manage their inventory under uncertain demand while attaining their cost reduction goals. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate some of the critical inhibitors associated with SCR during COVID-19. The study employs multi-criteria decision-making utilising the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process. This research was conducted in the context of the Indian pharmaceutical supply chains. The research showed that there are seven major inhibitors to SCR. The findings of the current study are expected to aid the pharmaceutical supply chain managers in identifying and evaluating the critical inhibitors to achieving SCR and designing strategies to mitigate any future catastrophe like a global pandemic. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water are used for several important purposes but the most essential use considered on the basis of social and economic significance as it relates to the health of the population is human consumption and sanitation. Man needs constant and accessible supply of water to provide necessary prerequisite for important physiological and biochemical processes. On account of the general contention that water is more basic than all other critical stuff to life and in its pure state is commended key to health. This study aimed at to examine the physical characteristics of the water supply sources in Choba as a crucial factor for development and upon which the quality of life depends. Thus, water samples were collected from borehole and well water sources being the only available major sources of water supply in Rumuokocha, Rumuchakara, Igbogo, Owhipa, Ndudor and Rumualoghu communities that make Choba and the parameters investigated include pH, Temperature, Dissolved oxygen (DO), Conductivity, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) and Salinity. The results of the analyses for temperature was t= 0.751 and t= 0.547 both at p&lt;0.05 for borehole and well water sources implying no significant difference from the allowable limit by WHO whereas for DO, pH, salinity, TDS and conductivity, t= -51.966; -24.027; -24.796, -19.546 ;2.321and t= -51.966; -24.027; -16.966, -20.024; 2.272 for borehole and well water sources respectively indicating a statistically significant difference between the parameters investigated and the allowable limits. Similarly, the ANOVA result shows F= 400.384; 23.262; 19.997; 8502.215at p&lt;0.05 for parameters like temperature, salinity, TDS and conductivity of the available water sources do not vary significantly in the area. Therefore, constant monitoring and assessment of physical water quality parameters, water treatment and assessment of bacteriological content and other relevant water parameters to holistically ascertain it suitability for adequate human use were recommended.</jats:p>"

Achieving the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement requires leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU), which presents challenges for LMICs due to their significant fossil fuel reserves. This dilemma raises equity concerns as these countries must balance climate action with their Right to Development (RtD). Against this background, through a content analysis of documents submitted to the UNFCCC and triangulation with ownership structures of extraction projects, this paper explores how ten LMICs define their roles in addressing climate change and LFFU, with a focus on mitigation policies and the energy sector. Drawing on Gramscian concepts such as hegemony, common sense, historical bloc, war of position, passive revolution, and<jats:italic>trasformismo</jats:italic>, this paper presents a non-exhaustive neo-Gramscian perspective for the analysis of supply-side climate policy in developing countries. The analysis reveals that LMICs’ development paths have been characterized by fossil fuel expansion, energy addition, and carbon lock-in, grounded on energy security reasons, export dependencies, or equity and responsibility. From these findings, the paper argues that the global energy transition can be interpreted as a passive revolution: the fossil historical bloc, through the interdependencies between states, national oil companies, and fossil capital, maintains its hegemonic position by aligning material, organizational, and discursive resources around fossil fuels, with the RtD serving as a discursive tool to perpetuate fossil dominance in energy systems, agreeing to the legitimate demands for development. One of the<jats:italic>trasformist</jats:italic>tactics deployed is the bridge narrative of gas, which accommodates and neutralizes the challenge posed by renewables. Nonetheless, there are opportunities for Southern leadership to contest the bloc with potential counter-hegemony. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on supply-side mitigation policies and distributive justice issues in the North–South context, focusing on the need and potential for an inclusive and just energy transformation. There are avenues of research to analyse how the challengers’ war of position will bear fruit in coalition building and the establishment of a new, just, and inclusive common sense.</jats:p>",

As water demand has increased due to population growth and urban development, a situation of water scarcity has emerged, posing a threat to water security and the well-being of the region. The implementation of effective public policies on water is crucial to confront this crisis. Through rigorous evaluation of water availability and quality, it becomes possible to identify problem areas and sources of contamination, enabling concrete measures to be taken for mitigation and control. Additionally, appropriate design of public policies promotes water conservation, encourages sustainable water management practices, and establishes governance mechanisms to ensure their implementation. The successful implementation of these public policies entails a range of benefits and utilities. Firstly, it ensures the provision of potable water to the population, meeting their basic needs and improving their quality of life. Moreover, it promotes the conservation of water resources, preventing their overexploitation and ensuring long-term availability. Furthermore, it prevents water pollution, preserving its quality and safeguarding the health of the inhabitants. Encouraging results have been observed as a result of the implementation of effective public policies. There has been a decrease in water scarcity and an improvement in the quality of water available for human consumption and industrial use. Additionally, citizen participation and community engagement in water management have been promoted, strengthening the region's resilience to future water challenges.</jats:p>"

This research takes the smart elderly care service supply chain as the object, combines the social emotional choice theory for the first time, and uses the time perception to refine the elderly care demand into future-orientation demand and present-orientation demand. This paper analyzes the coordination effect of suppliers’ efforts to meet the needs of the elderly under the two conditions of no contract and benefit-sharing contract on the dual-channel supply chain of smart elderly care services. The results show that the benefit-sharing contract is more conducive to maximizing the profit of the supply chain, and the segmentation of elderly demand is conducive to giving full play to the advantages of dual-channel differentiated services, which is conducive to forming a win-win situation of improving the service efficiency of the smart elderly service supply chain and increasing the happiness index of elderly users. The main contributions of this paper are: Using geriatric behavioral psychology to analyze the motivation of the elderly and designing the service effort level index considering the needs of the elderly. Match online and offline channels with personalized services to give full play to the “smart” effect. Based on the game method of Hotelling and Stackelberg, the coordination and optimization of the smart elderly care services dual-channel supply chain, considering the needs of the elderly are realized.

A total of 12 sampling sites were selected to represent different land-use patterns of the Kirala Kele Wetland using purposive sampling technique, and sampling was conducted from March 2021 to May 2021, on a monthly basis. Triplicated samples (n = 3) were obtained for each sampling event at each sampling site. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected from each site to determine the biological water quality using the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score. Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) was calculated to understand the physicochemical parameters of water, and the mean values of physicochemical water quality parameters were compared with the Sri Lankan water quality standards. According to the WAWQI for the different sampling sites, water is not suitable for drinking without treatment. The resulted BMWP score (BMWP = 61) shows that the water quality is acceptable (clean but slightly impacted) for biotic components of the wetland in accordance with the aquatic macroinvertebrates present. Spatial variation in water quality parameters and the aquatic macroinvertebrates were taken into account, and the temporal variation in water quality parameters within the 3 months from March to May was considered.</jats:p>",

The present study examines the crop water requirement (CWR) and irrigation water requirement (IWR) of the Bhadra and Tungabhadra (TB) command areas, with a focus on forecasting future irrigation water needs. Using the CROPWAT 8.0 software, CWR and IWR were estimated for the base period (1975–2010) and three future periods: near future (2023–2048), middle future (2049–2074), and far future (2075–2099). Five best-performing Global Climate Models (GCMs) were utilized under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (i.e., SSP-245 and SSP-585). The results indicate that in the Bhadra command area, CWR increases during the kharif season under both SSPs. However, monthly IWR for the kharif season experiences a significant decrease, except for June. In the TB command area, CWR shows a decreasing trend, while monthly IWR increases for both seasons in future periods. The SSP-585 scenario exhibits a more pronounced increment in CWR and IWR for both command areas. The results enhance comprehension of water demand dynamics in agricultural areas, assisting policymakers and stakeholders in devising effective strategies to address climate change impacts on agriculture and encourage sustainable practices.</jats:p>",

However, solitary efforts and the spillover of environmental protection effects still hamper enterprises’ enthusiasm for carbon emission reduction. To tackle this challenge, two vertical cooperation mechanisms, cost cooperation and alliance cooperation, are proposed. The mathematical models and solutions are developed for both of the two mechanisms, and their values and applicability are explored, respectively. In addition, the impact of fluctuations in consumer markets, financial markets, and carbon markets on cooperation is examined. The results show that both cooperation models effectively motivate enterprises to enhance carbon reduction and boost market demand. However, cost cooperation may result in inflated product prices and even weaken the profitability of the supply chain. In contrast, alliance cooperation can enhance product price performance and effectively increase supply chain profits. Concerning environmental performance, the initial market is better suited for alliance cooperation, whereas cost cooperation fits the mid-to-late market. The higher financing costs of the financial market and the trading price of the carbon market will strengthen the applicability of cost cooperation. This study offers managerial insights for collaborative decision-making in the context of a multi-market cross-section.</jats:p>"

Modelling mixed traffic has proved to be a challenging task due to variations in vehicle dimensions and composition along with non-lane-based driving. Most of the simulation software is based on the car following models and lane change models which were originally developed for lane-based traffic. Several attempts have been made to adapt these models for mixed traffic by extending them to include new parameters. This study summarizes lane change models used along with car following for mixed traffic. It can be concluded from past studies that lateral manoeuvre varies with the longitudinal speed in a non-linear manner. Sub-models or specific parameters are needed to model the lateral behaviour of each class of vehicle. Trajectory data analysis and subsequent models have also pointed towards the need for vehicle pair-dependent parameters.</jats:p>",

The manufacturers decide whether to adopt the green supplier integration (GSI) strategy and the green supplier development (GSD) investment level to improve the product greenness degree. The interaction between the GSD decisions and the GSI strategies are analyzed with different manufacturer GSD capacities and market greenness sensitivity. The results indicate that the manufacturer with a higher GSD capacity will always adopt the GSI strategy to maximize GSD investment level or profit, and the manufacturer with a lower GSD capacity decides whether to adopt the GSI strategy by comparing the GSD capacities of the two manufacturers. The game model is extended from dedicated sourcing to diversified sourcing and hybrid sourcing to obtain optimal sourcing options jointly reached by the two manufacturers. Under these extensions, the GSI strategy always leads to higher GSD investment levels, and adopting the GSI strategies by both manufacturers becomes the only Nash equilibrium strategy combination. Manufacturers choose different sourcing options by judging the difference in their GSD capacities under different criteria, and choose hybrid sourcing when their GSD capacity gap is sufficiently large in a weakly competitive market.</jats:p>",

We propose an ecological resilience perspective to illuminate the complex, dynamic nature of supply chain systems. Our research pivots around two questions: (1) Can the resilience of endotherms (warm-blooded animals) serve as a conceptually robust source phenomenon for metaphorical transfer to the study of supply chain resilience? (2) What theory-based principles can be derived from this metaphor to enhance our understanding of supply chain resilience? After rigorously establishing the conceptual equivalence between endotherm resilience and supply chain resilience, we identify a set of theory-based principles that provide insights into the evolving field of supply chain resilience. These principles help illuminate the adaptive and predictive dimensions of supply chain resilience. This paper contributes to theory building in operations management and supply chain management while suggesting new avenues for future research. </jats:p>",

This comparative review delves into the practices of the United States and African countries, examining the implementation, challenges, and potential benefits of blockchain in enhancing supply chain efficiency. The United States, as a global economic powerhouse, has been at the forefront of integrating blockchain into its supply chain processes. The American approach emphasizes transparency, traceability, and accountability. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable ledger, enabling seamless tracking of goods from their origin to the end consumer. The use of smart contracts automates and streamlines contractual agreements, reducing paperwork and minimizing delays. While the adoption in the USA is relatively widespread, challenges include the need for standardized protocols, regulatory frameworks, and overcoming resistance to change within established systems. In contrast, the African continent presents a diverse and evolving landscape in the adoption of blockchain within supply chains. Several African nations have recognized the potential of blockchain to address longstanding issues such as counterfeit goods, fraud, and inefficiencies in logistics. Blockchain offers a decentralized solution that can empower local producers and facilitate international trade. However, challenges in Africa include limited technological infrastructure, varying levels of regulatory frameworks, and the need for capacity building. Collaborative efforts between governments, private sectors, and international organizations are essential to overcoming these obstacles. Both the USA and African countries stand to benefit from blockchain adoption in global supply chains. Increased transparency reduces the risk of fraud and enhances trust between stakeholders. The immutable nature of blockchain records ensures data integrity, contributing to the overall resilience of the supply chain. However, successful implementation requires a nuanced understanding of local contexts, regulatory frameworks, and technological capacities. This comparative review serves as a foundation for future research and policy development, shedding light on the dynamic landscape of blockchain adoption in global supply chains across diverse socio-economic environments.</jats:p>"

In this research, mitigation strategies for a tier one multinational company operating in the automotive industry and providing an assembly operation to final customer Renault Tanger and Renault SOMACA were prioritized according to their effectiveness, as well as their implementation costs. Based on research in the literature and the opinions of experts in the field. 44 risks and 55 mitigation strategies were identified. FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) method was used based on the latest AIAG 2019 edition to filter and identify the risks to be prioritized, we used then a multi-objective optimization approach to identify the mitigation strategies that constitute the Pareto front for each of the risks and finally used the EDAS method for the final ranking of the strategies. Our case revealed that strategies like ensuring elaborating a contingency planning and defining the responsibilities, imposing contractual obligations on subcontractors, applying a flexible supply contract were found to be relevant risk mitigation strategies for the company. Managers interested in mitigating risk can deploy this model to prioritize risk mitigation strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability has become a key issue in the forest industry; this research aims to analyze the quantitative techniques and metrics applied to the forest-to-lumber supply chain to achieve sustainable decision-making during the last six years. The methodology used was the PRISMA systematic literature review guide, which provides a complete and updated view of the situation. A total of 724 publications were collected from the Web of Science database. Consequently, 85 papers were selected for analysis and synthesis after applying inclusion criteria. The results show a growing interest in sustainability in the forest-to-lumber supply chain, with a peak of publications in 2019. Mathematical Programming and Simulation models are on top of the quantitative techniques applied. These techniques are applied to the supply chain components, classified according to the raw material’s degree of processing or transformation level in forest entities, sawmills, transportation, and other entities. The concluding remarks highlighted that 19 published works research the social dimension, 43 explore the environmental dimension, and 55 examine the economic dimension. Moreover, in the environmental dimension, there is a concentration on the use of metrics associated with greenhouse gases, and to a lesser extent, they have been concerned with soil and water. Additionally, in the social dimension, they have concentrated mainly on the workers, leaving the local communities around the supply chain in the second place. Our systematic review reports the techniques or quantitative methodologies applied in the forest-to-lumber supply chain and the metrics used to handle the dimensions of sustainability.</jats:p>"

Given insufficient numbers of AM subspecialists to care for all AYAs, the workforce supports AYAs health care capacity through education, research, advocacy, and the development of policies and programs sensitive to their unique needs. A modeling project funded by the American Board of Pediatrics Foundation was developed to forecast the pediatric subspecialty workforce in the United States from 2020 to 2040 on the basis of current trends in each subspecialty. The model predicts workforce supply at baseline and across alternative scenarios, and reports results in headcount and headcount adjusted for percentage of time spent in clinical care, termed “clinical workforce equivalent.” For the AM subspecialty, several scenarios were considered that modified the number of fellows and/or clinical time. The baseline model predicted low growth nationally (27% and 13% increase in total AM subspecialists and AM subspecialists per 100 000 children, respectively) and declines in AM workforce relative to population growth in census divisions with existing geographic workforce disparities. In the alternative scenarios, fellow number and clinical time changes did not significantly change predictions relative to the baseline model, but a 12.5% decrease in fellows predicted a 40% reduction in the workforce from baseline with a widening of geographic workforce disparities. On the basis of the expansive clinical and nonclinical roles of AM subspecialists and these forecasted workforce challenges, significant educational, practice, and policy changes will be necessary to bolster the supply of well-trained clinicians addressing the dynamic health care needs of AYAs.</jats:p>",

This paper considers a supply chain system composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PL provider, in which both the manufacturer and the 3PL make the low-carbon investment. 3PL is a leader in the low-carbon supply chain. To promote emission reduction in logistics, the manufacturer and the retailer separately share the logistics emission reduction costs of the 3PL. Through comparing the no-sharing, manufacturer-sharing and retailer-sharing models, we discuss the cost-sharing strategy preference of each participant and analyze the impact on environmental benefit and social welfare. The results show that cost-sharing can effectively improve product demand, which also supports society in obtaining higher benefits. Moreover, the 3PL tends to be shared by the retailer when the low-carbon investment cost of logistics is high and the investment cost of production is low. Both the manufacturer and the retailer prefer the other party to share the cost, but sharing it together can effectively alleviate free-rider behaviour.</jats:p>",

Electronic procurement (e-procurement) aims to convert traditional procurement approaches into web-based/online platforms. Even though e-procurement is an effective tool that may improve supply chain management, the extent of e-procurement implementation has been slow to date. This study investigates the barriers that hinder e-procurement implementation in construction supply chains with the aim of prioritizing solutions to the identified barriers relative to time, cost, quality, and construction owner satisfaction. A comprehensive literature survey was performed, and a focus group discussion was organized for the purpose of the study, which resulted in the identification of 28 barriers. Then, a total of 131 construction practitioners were contacted to evaluate the barriers through a questionnaire survey. The responses were analyzed using the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarities to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) for prioritization. Finally, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain a deeper insight into the transformation process from the conventional procurement route to the e-procurement solution. Findings highlight that issues related to unexpected order cancellations, large variations in material costs, and the uncertain nature of the industry that requires a large number of changes are ranked as the most significant barriers. Given the highly competitive environment and the high demand for advanced technologies in the construction industry, a new paradigm can enhance the efficiency of supply chain operations. Exploring and eliminating the potential difficulties of adopting e-procurement in the procurement process may be a good start. Overall, this research is expected to facilitate the transformation of the procurement process by addressing the critical barriers identified by practitioners.</jats:p>"

We introduce a stochastic sales effort, which affects two types of products. The numerical results show that sales effort and the order quantity of new and remanufactured products exhibit concave and convex functions, respectively. The upper limit of sales effort has a greater impact on supply chain decisions. High sales efforts can serve as a means of coordinating dispersed supply chains. Moreover, in different cases, the decisions of an integrated channel are better than those of a decentralized channel. Finally, whether the supply chain adopts an emergency order strategy depends on the relative cost of emergency orders and out-of-stock costs.

Using logistics service quality as a foundation, our study explores the meaning of logistics service performance from the perspective of FIOs. Applying the hermeneutic method, we conducted interviews with 23 informants across 14 organizations to understand the meaning of logistics performance for FIOs. We leverage these interviews to offer a contextualized understanding of logistics service quality based on the four pillars of food insecurity and the shared meaning of logistics service performance within FIOs. By subjecting an important “traditional” performance metric to the consumer‐centric realities of the food insecurity supply chain, we extend logistics theory by offering transformative logistics service outcomes based on well‐being perspectives. We also offer timely guidance to help facilitate the vital work of FIOs.</jats:p>",

We test the performance of several sourcing strategies and their combinations. A special focus is directed toward shared reverse flows. The results show that disruption impact and recovery processes in the Circular ISN do not always follow conventional patterns known from the resilience of individual supply chains due to intertwining and circularity effects. We offer some managerial recommendations for the design of resilient sourcing strategies in the ISN context that are triangulated around collaborative sourcing practices, coordinated production planning, shared reverse flows, and visibility in inventory management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies involved in a supply chain must coordinate their operations through adoption of inbound logistics strategies so as to enhance business performance. KTDA factories have adopted inbound logistics strategies with the aim of turning around their performance as well as reduce operational costs leading to sustainable procurement performance. However, despite this KTDA tea factories still experience wide variations in earnings. The drop in earnings and high variation in tea bonuses among factories has been blamed on operational cost at the factory. This points out that although inbound logistics have been adopted, they have not resulted in sustainable procurement performance. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between suppliers sourcing strategy and sustainable procurement performance. The study adopted correlation research design. The target population of the study was 188 staff drawn from the 16 KTDA managed Region 5 factories. A census method was used to collect data from the production managers, ICT managers, procurement Managers, leaf base managers, factory unit managers and directors using a structured questionnaire. The findings revealed that suppliers sourcing strategies had a positive significant correlation with sustainable procurement performance (r = 0.545, p &lt; 0.05). The study recommends that KTDA sourcing strategies need to aligned to organizational sustainability goal, develop procedures and policies on material handling with sustainability goal. The results of this study may advice on policy formulation in relation to sourcing strategies and sustainable procurement performance. Other researchers may benefit from the literature on inbound logistics and sustainable procurement performance since the current study provided a basis for further studies</jats:p>",

The study adopted quantitative research design using a correlational method of investigation. The population consists of 16 shipping firms in Port Harcourt. The study adopted census sampling and studied the entire 16 firms with focus on managers. The reliability of the instrument was determined using Cronbach's alpha test with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 and it stood at 0.88 higher than the benchmark of 0.7. The data collected for this study were analyzed through inferential statistics. The Spearman Rank Correlation Technique was employed to test the various hypotheses formulated through the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results revealed that supply chain management is significantly and positively related with business performance of shipping firms in Port Harcourt. Based on the findings, it was concluded that supply chain management with its dimension of supply chain integration and reverse logistics will improve business performance of shipping firms in Port Harcourt on the basis of the results obtained from the analysis. The study recommends that shipping firms should adopt reverse logistics as this would ensure customer after-sale satisfaction which in turn results in improvement in business performance, and also, shipping firms should integrate their supplies as this would enable them to improve business performance.</jats:p>"

However, CES’s supply-demand methodology remains scarcely explored on the coastal beach, and the demand relating to public preferences has not been sufficiently unveiled in spatial assessment. Here, we selected recreation services as a lens of CES and applied the knowledge of multi-source big data to better reflect public preferences. Point of Interests (POIs) refer to particularly valuable or interesting places. We proposed to integrate POIs and social media data (Weibo check-in) to quantify the demand for beach recreation services (BRS). We also used socio-ecological indicators to quantify the BRS’s supply. The supply-demand balance of BRS was further identified by quadrant analysis and coupling coordination degree. Our methodology was applied to a typical coastal zone, Shenzhen Dapeng New District, in the Greater Bay Area of China. Over 80% of the beaches in the study area exhibited an imbalanced or barely balanced supply-demand of recreation services. We found that POIs density had a significant influence on a balanced supply-demand of BRS. Multi-source big data (POIs and Weibo check-in) provided an efficient, low-cost, and across-scale approach for public preference mapping than traditional questionnaire surveys. The proposed CES’s supply-demand framework can identify coastal beaches with imbalanced recreation and support sustainable coastal management. Coastal beach management prioritizes not only waste prevention and sufficient safety signs but also proper infrastructure development that contribute sustainably to the human well-being of nature experiences.</jats:p>"

Quick development and improvement of HPSSs may be achieved using specialized methodologies and programs. In the paper a schematic diagram is proposed and operation principles of a 400 V / 50 Hz HPSS were developed. The system’s main component is the master generating unit of the hydropower plant using a 250 kW induction generator (IG). The voltage of the system is controlled by the controller of the AC/DC power converter. The electrical frequency of the system is controlled by the speed controller of the hydropower turbine. A wind turbine, an energy storage system and a regulated dump load are connected to the IG through the AC/DC converter. Goal. The paper aims to develop a methodology for steady state performance analysis of the hydraulic turbine driven isolated IG operating in parallel through an AC/DC power converter with additional sources and consumers of active power. Methodology. The methodology for evaluation of performance characteristics of the IG operating in the proposed system has been developed. The methodology is based on the equivalent circuit of the system, equations of active and reactive power balance in the system and the superposition method. Results. The equations of frequency, voltage and power regulators of the system are given. The performance characteristics of the IG operating in the system supplying resistive and RL load in «constant voltage – constant frequency» mode are obtained. Novelty. The developed methodology is innovative in taking into account the control algorithms of the system. The comparative analysis of the IG’s performance operating in the stand-alone generating unit and in the generating unit connected to the proposed system is performed. Practical value. The developed methodology can be used for development and performance improvement of hybrid AC power systems. </jats:p>"

There are two main research purposes of this paper: First, it aims to study the relationship between the digital economy and the supply of basic public services. The second purpose is to clarify the transmission mechanism through which the digital economy affects the supply of basic public services. This paper gives an examination of the association of digital economy with the supply of basic public services based on the panel data collected from 287 prefecture-level cities across China from 2011 to 2021 and by utilizing bidirectional fixed effect model. The study delivers findings as follows: There is an inverted “U”-shaped relationship between digital economy and the supply of basic public services and most of the cities situate at the left-hand side of the inflection point. Market enabling and financial enabling serve as the transmission channel through which digital economy affects the supply of basic public services. In non-central cities and areas where energy consumption is high, development of digital economy and the supply of basic public services remain effective in promotion in the first place and inhibition afterwards. A further study shows that there is a non-linear relationship, namely, digital economy plays a role in promoting in the first place and inhibiting afterwards in basic public services such as employment services, social security, and health care.

The latter often represents an uncompensated social burden, which should be properly accounted for in investment planning. Here we present a new framework for quantifying direct financial risks burdened by utilities and alternative water purchase losses incurred by domestic customers, including those in low-income groups, during flood- and drought-induced utility water supply disruptions. This framework enables the comparison of benefit-cost ratios of a portfolio of flood protection and leakage reduction for water supply systems across the island of Jamaica. A system-level optioneering analysis allows the identification of the optimal adaptation option per system. We estimate that 34% of systems would benefit from flood defences and 53% would benefit from leakage reduction to adaptation to droughts. The benefit that could be achieved by implementing all system optimised adaptation options is estimated to be 720 million Jamaican dollars per year on average, representing a substantial saving for the utility and its customers, including low-income customers. We identify options that offer strong synergies between economic and equity objectives for both types of adaptation option. The proposed framework is established to support the business case for climate adaptation in the water supply sector and to prioritise across flood and drought mitigation options. We take a first step towards mainstreaming equity considerations in water supply sector optioneering frameworks by estimating the contribution of adaptation options towards reducing household costs for low-income customers.</jats:p>",

This hybrid model offers opportunities for organized labor to gain a foothold within some of Amazon’s vertically integrated nodes as the firm lengthens its corporate commodity chain to grow increasingly close to consumers. Building on earlier work on opportunities for, and constraints on, labor in a variety of global commodity chains, our empirical cases examine how Amazon’s corporate strategies may open opportunities for labor in three illustrative cases ensconced in fulfillment centers—the Fordist vertical integration side of the model—in the Inland Empire and Otay Mesa (both in southern California) and Northern Kentucky. </jats:p>",

Safety reports are constantly being printed, all cases of disasters and incidents are thoroughly investigated, and the results of the investigation are published in the open press. This gives people the opportunity to decide which airline they will use.  Along with safety, users are also interested in the issues of self-replacement achievement of the scheduled item, comfort and quality of service during the flight, convenience of the schedule and the possibility of easily purchasing a ticket for the flight of interest. As ties between countries expanded, tourism developed and more and more people wanted to get acquainted with the culture and history of other peoples. The number of trips has increased many times and there is a need to reduce travel time.  It is clear that one, even a large airline, if chosen by a passenger, cannot cover all continents and countries of the world, not to mention cities. Hence the need for airline interaction in order to jointly provide passengers with the opportunity to catch up with the intended goal with the least cost and time. If at the beginning of the airline achieved these goals by concluding bilateral agreements such as interline or code-sharing, then further tightening of competition led them to the idea of creating associations of airlines – alliances. As you know, today there are three global alliances in the world, under the control of which there are more than 60% of air transportation in the world. This is Star Alliance, One world and Sky Team. Currently, many airlines are seeking to join one of these alliances, but for this they must meet certain requirements and one of them is – high level of security.</jats:p>"

This investigation employs the WetSpass-M model to estimate water balance and the Mann-Kendall test alongside Sen's slope estimator to evaluate trend. The study also assesses mean annual water balance components, considering diverse combinations of land-use and soil. The findings offer a hydrological insight, revealing that 14% of precipitation results in runoff, 29% of that recharging the aquifer; the remaining portion is lost through evapotranspiration. The trends in precipitation and simulated water components are not significant but a significant downward trend in groundwater is observed beyond a specific point in time. Based on this outcome, as well as the analysis of land-use changes, it was speculated that human activities in this fast-developing region might be implicated in the decline in groundwater levels. Analysis of water balance components in various soil and land-use combinations indicates that evapotranspiration exhibits greater variability within the land-cover class, while recharge is more influenced by soil texture. These findings enhance our understanding for identifying potential sites for artificial recharge and determining sustainable groundwater withdrawals based on spatiotemporal recharge patterns.</jats:p>",

A lack of clarity in the fundamental differences between SSCM and green supply chain management (GSCM) is being observed in this field of research. However, it is regrettable to note that there is a huge deficit of research in the oil and gas (OG) industry, mainly in developing countries (DCs), where this sector of activity is the most lucrative and polluting. The purpose of this research is to present the practices of SSCM in the framework of the quadruple helix approach in the oil and gas industry in specific geographical areas of developing countries by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) of papers published from 2012 to 2024 focused on both the OG industry and DCs. As part of this study’s findings, the authors highlight the distinction between SSCM and GSCM by building a conceptual framework that applies the triple bottom line of SSCM to the OG industry and demonstrates that GSCM, which is more related to environmental issues, is a part of SSCM. Therefore, in order to be more efficient and to have a great impact on their performances, OG companies in DCs should apply SSCM practices, which are close to circular business rather than GSCM practices, especially because their implementation can be influenced by certain barriers and pressures that involve the use of the QHC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered unprecedented disruptions across global supply chains, challenging businesses to reassess and optimize their supply chain analytics strategies. This paper delves into the far-reaching impact of the pandemic on supply chain analytics, providing a comprehensive global review of the challenges, innovations, and transformations that have emerged. The pandemic-induced disruptions have exposed vulnerabilities in traditional supply chain models, prompting organizations to reevaluate their analytics frameworks. The sudden fluctuations in demand, supply chain interruptions, and logistics bottlenecks necessitated a rapid response, pushing companies to leverage advanced analytics to enhance visibility and agility in their supply chain operations. This global review reveals that organizations have increasingly turned to predictive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to navigate the uncertainties introduced by the pandemic. These technologies have enabled real-time data analysis, forecasting, and scenario planning, empowering businesses to make informed decisions amidst the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the crisis. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of data-driven insights in risk management within the supply chain. Organizations have recognized the need for robust analytics tools to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with suppliers, transportation, and geopolitical factors. The integration of analytics into risk management strategies has become imperative for building resilient and adaptable supply chains. The study further explores the emergence of digital twins and blockchain technologies as transformative elements in supply chain analytics. Digital twins provide a virtual representation of the entire supply chain, facilitating simulation and optimization, while blockchain enhances transparency and traceability, crucial for ensuring the integrity of the supply chain. This global review underscores the profound impact of COVID-19 on supply chain analytics, emphasizing the paradigm shift towards data-driven decision-making, advanced technologies, and resilience-building strategies. As businesses continue to navigate the ongoing challenges, the integration of innovative analytics solutions remains pivotal in not only mitigating current disruptions but also in building agile and future-proof supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analytically explores the value of blockchain technology in building consumer trust in recyclers. We focus on an e-commerce closed-loop supply chain composed of an online platform and a manufacturer. In the forward chain, the platform selects a reselling or marketplace model to sell products. In the reverse chain, the platform collects used products, and the unknown whereabouts of the used products will cause consumer mistrust and be detrimental to the corporate image. Blockchain technology can address these challenges by improving the visibility of the recycling chain. By constructing differential game models, we specify the conditions for blockchain implementation and explore its impact on the online sales model choice and the E-CLSC performance. The findings show that the manufacturer consistently benefits from blockchain technology, while the platform decides to adopt it when the long-term profits outweigh the initial investment costs. Interestingly, the sales model selection will not change with the advent of blockchain technology. We further show the benefits of blockchain-enabled recycling and provide tangible insights for related practitioners.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the impact of clean energy integration on power supply and demand is analyzed, taking into account factors such as the volatility and seasonality of renewable energy sources. A case study is conducted in Region A, which comprises four areas in China, to forecast the power supply and demand in the electric power system. In terms of power demand, we employ two commonly used methods in time series analysis, namely SARIMAX and factor decomposition, to establish a comprehensive forecasting model. These methods are applied from both short-term and long-term perspectives to analyze the monthly maximum electricity demand of users, aiming to accurately predict power demand under a high proportion of clean energy integration. As for power supply, we utilize the least squares method to regressively fit the installed capacity of energy sources and analyze future trends. Through the predictions of both demand and supply, the stable operation of the power system is ensured.</jats:p>",

This study represents groundwater potential zones in the Amravati district, Maharashtra, India, using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-influencing factor (MIF) techniques. These techniques are employed for a detailed spatial analysis, which is essential for sustainable groundwater management. The study integrates data layers including lithology, geomorphology, land use/land cover, drainage density, lineament density, rainfall, soil, elevation, and slope to evaluate the groundwater potential. The resulting groundwater potential map classifies the area into five categories: poor, fair, moderate, good, and excellent based on groundwater availability. The study reveals that 9% of the area has poor groundwater potential, 37% fair, 28% moderate, 13% good, and 13% excellent. This map is instrumental for stakeholders and policymakers, as it aids in resource allocation and the formulation of sustainable groundwater management strategies. Through the application of AHP and MIF techniques, this study effectively maps the groundwater potential, providing an essential tool for evidence-based decision-making for water resource management in the Amravati district.</jats:p>",

However, integrated supply chain optimization especially distribution partnerships has not been extensively studied for its effect on the performance of distribution companies as opposed to manufacturing companies. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the influence of distribution partnerships on supply chain performance of agrochemical production firms in Kenya. The theory of partnerships guided the study which was also grounded on a positivist philosophy. This study employed the descriptive survey design targeting 32 agrochemical production firms with the unit of observation consisting of 96 persons being one management, one procurement and one supply chain staff per firm. The study adopted the census method and used primary data collected using researcher designed questionnaire and interview schedule that were both pretested using the test-retest method for reliability and content and construct validity. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with descriptive statistics comprising frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviations while inferential statistics comprised Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple regressions. However, distribution partnerships did not have any significant impact on Supply Chain Performance of Agrochemicals production firms in Kenya.The study also recommended that there is need for the firms in the agrochemical supply chain in Kenya to strengthen their distribution partnerships.</jats:p>"

Utilising principal component analysis (PCA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), and tobit regression, we present a pioneering method to unravel the complex relationship between economic policies and urban supply chains. PCA simplifies data complexity and reveals complex policy-resilience relationships, while DEA facilitates a comparative efficiency analysis. Our findings underscore the critical importance of supply chain resilience in fostering early economic recovery, indicating that cities implementing diverse, sector-specific policies achieved more notable improvements in gross domestic product (GDP).

This optimization program aims at reducing emissions and supply chain costs in an unregulated scenario w.r.t. the cap definition, i.e., trading CO2 is allowed but no formal limit on the CO2 emissions is imposed. Also, we considered an initial budget for technological investments by the facilities in the considered supply chain, allowing plants to reduce their unit production emissions at a different unit production cost. For this model, differently from what exists in the literature, we derive some theoretical conditions guaranteeing that, if obeyed, the emissions over time have a non-increasing trend meaning that decreasing caps over time can be attained with a self-regulated scenario.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We consider a hybrid supply chain with a manufacturer and an online retailer with rich demand information. The manufacturer invests in green products and sells them not only through retailers that then sell to customers (reselling) but also directly to consumers via retailers by paying a proportional fee (agency selling). The retailer first decides whether to share demand information with the manufacturer, who then decides whether to encroach. We show that a manufacturer is willing to encroach when the entry cost is small if the retailer chooses not to share information. However, with the increase in the entry cost, the manufacturer could still encroach if the retailer shares information. We also find that a manufacturer that is more efficient at producing green products is more likely to encroach. Moreover, when the entry cost is sufficiently small or large, the retailer prefers to share information with the manufacturer when the greening investment efficiency is high or the efficiency is low but the proportional fee is large. Nevertheless, when the entry cost is moderate and the competition intensity is small, sharing information is better for the retailer even if the efficiency is low and the proportional fee is small. Finally, we observe that consumer sensitivity to the direct channel, differences in agency selling price and direct selling price, and imperfect retailer information do not influence decisions in specific circumstances. Furthermore, adjusting the encroachment order or ex post sharing impacts the decision‐making, with the magnitude of impact depending on certain supply chain parameters.</jats:p>"

Initial design of a classic supply vessel (with anchor handling tug functions) with ice class Arc6, a deadweight of 2700 tons and a power of ~14 MW powered by diesel fuel is developed for uses as a basis for analyzing the possibility of using alternative energy sources. It shows that usage of liquefied natural gas as the main fuel decreases vessel’s cargo capacity and deteriorates general arrangement due to necessary to accommodate large storage tanks. The development of fully electric ice-class supply vessel is impossible due to the large required mass of Li-ion batteries. The usage of hydrogen fuel cells leads to serious changes in the vessel’s architecture, especially due to large liquid hydrogen storage tanks.

This systematic review aimed to point out the contribution of on-farm trees to global wood supply and tropical forest conservation. The study adopted the Sample-Phenomenon of Interest-Design-Evaluation-Research type framework to identify relevant literature. Both grey and peer-reviewed publications were considered. Of the 3800 publications identified, 42 substantially met the inclusion criteria and were selected for data extraction. A huge imbalance was evident in the wood supply and demand that forest production could not satisfy alone. On-farm trees were observed to be a significant alternative source of wood supply in South Africa, India, and Kenya, supplying 27, 36, and 70 per cent of total apparent consumption, respectively. Where importation reliance was low and a low forest production rate, on-farm trees contributed more than 50% of the total apparent consumption. China had a high reliance on importation. On-farm trees contributed at least a supply of 8% of total apparent consumption. On-farm trees were the chief source of wood fuel. On-farm trees contribute substantially to the supply chain of industrial roundwood, woodfuel, and sawn wood, reducing the need to infiltrate the forests.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to investigate the research and development (R&amp;D) competition within the supply chain, focusing on two aspects: R&amp;D competition at the manufacturing level and competition in pricing strategies. This paper establishes a dynamic game model of R&amp;D competition, comprising two manufacturers and two retailers, with both manufacturers exhibiting bounded rationality. The key findings are as follows: (1) an increase in the adjustment speed positively affects the chaotic nature of the R&amp;D competition system, leading to a state of disorder. This chaotic state has adverse implications for manufacturing profitability. (2) The spillover effect exhibits a positive relationship with the level of chaos in the R&amp;D competition system. A greater spillover effect contributes to a more turbulent environment, which subsequently impacts the profitability of manufacturers. (3) R&amp;D cost parameters exert a positive influence on the stability of the R&amp;D competition system. When the system reaches a state of equilibrium, an escalation in the R&amp;D cost parameters poses a threat to manufacturer profitability. (4) Retailer costs play a detrimental role in the stability of the R&amp;D competition system. As retailer costs increase, there is a decline in R&amp;D levels, thereby diminishing manufacturer profitability. (5) To mitigate the chaotic state, we propose the implementation of the time-delayed feedback control (TDFC) method, which reflects a more stable state in the R&amp;D competition system.</jats:p>",

Yet, inclusion of this <jats:italic>political‐economic feedback</jats:italic> in dynamic models of infrastructure systems and socio‐hydrology has lagged behind <jats:italic>operational</jats:italic> feedback concerns. We address this gap through a dynamical systems application of the Coupled Infrastructure Systems (CIS) Framework, which provides the conceptual building blocks for analyzing social‐ecological systems through various classes of infrastructure and the flows of material and information among them. In the model, political‐economic feedback involves three decisions—infrastructure investment, rate‐setting, and short‐term demand curtailment—and each decision is constrained by institutional friction, the aggregation of decision and transaction costs associated with taking action. We apply the model to three cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area to compare how institutional friction interacts with a city's water resource portfolio and financial position to determine its sensitivity, or the degree to which its performance (e.g., providing sufficient supply to meet demand) changes given reductions in Colorado River water availability. We find that the slowing effect of institutional friction on investment and rate‐setting decisions can increase the sensitivity of a city's supply, but it can also promote objectives that compete with over‐response (e.g., rate burden). The effect is dependent on the initial operating capacity of the CIS and flexibility within the institutions, highlighting the need to consider political‐economic and operational feedback together when evaluating infrastructure systems.</jats:p>",

The proposed hybrid system consists of a micro-hydro power plant (MHPP), a photovoltaic (PV) generator, a combined heat and power (CHP) unit with one diesel generator, batteries, a converter, a thermal load controller (TLC), and a boiler. A comprehensive techno-economic analysis is performed in the HOMER Pro software, which evaluated and compared 12 possible configurations with different combinations of system components. The results show that the optimal system has the lowest total net present cost (NPC) and the lowest levelized cost of energy (COE) amounting to 284421.0 $ and 0.178 $/kWh, respectively. Compared to a diesel/batteries/converter/boiler hybrid system, the proposed system produces 65.4 % less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the shares of electricity, heat, and renewable energy generation are increased by 31.1 %, 5.0 %, and 51.2 %, respectively. It is shown that covering the demand for heat by regenerating the waste heat from the diesel generator and excess electricity from renewables contributes to reducing the total cost of the system and the GHG emissions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship between product variety and sales has been extensively researched, but almost exclusively from the perspective of a new goods retail firm. Closed-loop supply chains for used goods, such as automobiles, offer unique challenges in terms of using reverse flows to create product variety at the retail location. Firms in used goods industries are unable to define their product mix a priori and may not even know which goods will be available to add to their sellable inventory. In this article, we use data from a used automobile retailer to explore these issues. A better understanding of the relationship between variety and sales can help used automobile retailers improve how they define and structure product variety at retail locations. Improved management of used automobile sales has obvious financial implications, but it also has important environmental implications, given the large contribution of passenger vehicles to overall emissions. This study implements a cluster analysis using consumer-facing variables to understand how customers view product variety for used automobiles. Our results show that three distinct classes of inventory exist, primarily driven by a key characteristic—body type—which differs from the traditional definition of product variety for new vehicles in the existing literature. A two-way fixed effects regression is then used to understand the relationship between product variety at the firm's retail locations and sales. The results demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between product variety and sales and, intriguingly, suggest that increasing product variety in some classes can be used to drive sales in others. Our findings yield important contributions for managers in used automobile firms and extend the broader literature on closed-loop supply chains. Specifically, our research demonstrates important differences in how product variety should be managed with used goods relative to new goods by a firm seeking to maximize sales. </jats:p>",

To ensure business continuity, companies should assess the risk associated with their suppliers and develop a business continuity plan that includes multisourcing their strategic materials. Digital transformation will revolutionize the supply chain industry, allowing for end-to-end visibility, real time insights and seamless integration of business and processes. Companies should also focus on creating a collaborative workforce ecosystem that prioritizes worker health and well-being. Maintaining trust with stakeholders is crucial, and firms must revisit their relationship management strategies. Finally, to maintain business leadership and competitiveness during volatile periods, the product portfolio needs to be diversified and marketing and sales teams must work in tandem with product teams to position new products accordingly.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This work contributes substantially to the literature on supply chain agility (SCA) by adding several new factors. The findings result in a more efficient and cost-effective supply chain during a stable situation and high service levels in a volatile situation. A less complex methodology for understanding SCA provides factors with a more straightforward method for identifying well-springs of related drivers. First, the study contributes to reestablish the factors such as quickness, responsiveness, competency, flexibility, proactiveness, collaboration and partnership, customer focus, velocity and speed, visibility, robustness, cost-effectiveness, alertness accessibility to information and decisiveness as applicable factors for SCA. Second, the study suggests a few more factors, such as liquidity management, Vendors’ economic assessment and economic diversity, that are the study’s unique contributions in extending the enablers of SCA. Finally, public policy influencing skills, local administration connects and maintaining capable vendors are the areas that were never considered essential for SCA.

Frameworks that model and optimize the production, storage, and dispatch of generated energy are important for data-driven decision making in the energy systems space. The proposed multiperiod framework considers the evolution of technology costs under different levels of promotion through research and targeted policies, using the year 2021 as a baseline. Furthermore, carbon credits are included as proposed by the 45Q tax amendment for the capture, sequestration, and utilization of carbon. The implementation of the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework is illustrated through computational case studies to meet set hydrogen demands. The trade-offs between different technology pathways and contributions to system expenditure are elucidated, and promising configurations and technology niches are identified. It is found that while carbon credits can subsidize carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) pathways, substantial reductions in the cost of novel processes are needed to compete with extant technology pathways. Further, research and policy push can reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by upwards of 2 USD/kg.</jats:p>"

There is a lack of systematic research in the literature on the identification of consumer goods demand attributes and the formation of influencing factors in consumer goods supply chains. In this paper, we use the literature on demand functions and product pricing functions to establish three mathematical models to study the factors that influence retailers in designing and planning product supply strategies for different customers under nonessential demand patterns and to solve the profit maximization problem. The results of numerical examples validate the validity of the model. The research results can help retailers develop different supply strategies according to different types of customers and different demand patterns, thereby improving business performance. The theoretical contribution of this study is the construction of value ranges and a demand function diagram for identifying consumer product demand attributes.</jats:p>"

Consistent with the reputational cost hypothesis, we find that heightened public attention to CMDs increases responsible sourcing. After Section 1502 takes effect, we find higher demand for 3TG products processed in certified smelters, decreased conflicts in covered countries’ mining regions relative to other regions, and reduced sensitivity of conflict risk to conflict minerals’ price spikes. Finally, we find that conflicts decrease in Eastern DRC territories with prevalent 3T (tantalum, tin, and tungsten) mines but increase in territories with prevalent gold mines. Overall, our findings highlight the real effects of enhanced supply chain transparency regulation.</jats:p>",

Traceability is a powerful tool to ensure them, but implementing a transparent and effective system is a complex operation. As a result, innovative systems, like blockchain, could be introduced. Although research on its impacts in the agri-food is recent, the literature appears fragmented. The objective is to investigate the studied aspects of the blockchain adoption in agri-food, with the purpose of retrieving meaningful considerations about the current state of the art about strategic high-value supply chains, such as wine and olive oil, particularly subjected to fraudulent behaviors. A productivity measurement was applied to retrieve the evolution of the number of documents through the years, the most productive countries, the sources, the research areas, and the most significant papers in terms of number of citations received. To understand the research trends, a co-occurrence analysis was employed. Results show that most of the existing studies focus on the role of blockchain in the resolution of some critical issues as food safety and frauds. While wine is currently an emerging sector in which this approach can be implemented, olive oil still needs more attention. In both cases, blockchain could potentially help to support the profitability and sustainability of the production. The research underlines the importance of focusing on the environmental and social dimension of the blockchain phenomenon and the use of technology to improve the efficiency of agri-food chains and reduce waste and resource use.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>В данной статье рассматривается использование блокчейн-технологий в управлении цепочками поставок и оценивается их воздействие на прозрачность и эффективность бизнес-операций. В последние годы блокчейн стал одним из наиболее обсуждаемых инновационных решений в области цифровых технологий. Его способность обеспечивать прозрачность и надежность данных открывает новые перспективы для улучшения управления цепочками поставок. Основной целью данного исследования является анализ того, как внедрение блокчейн-технологий может оптимизировать процессы и повысить доверие между участниками цепочки поставок. Для достижения поставленных целей использовались как качественные, так и количественные методы исследования. На первом этапе была проведена детализация понятия блокчейн и его ключевых характеристик, важных для цепочек поставок. Затем посредством опросов и интервью с представителями компаний, использующими блокчейн, собраны эмпирические данные. На заключительном этапе выполнена статистическая обработка информации и построение моделей для оценки влияния блокчейн-технологий на эффективность цепочек поставок. Результаты исследования показали, что применение блокчейн-технологий в управлении цепочками поставок приводит к значительному повышению прозрачности процессов. Среди положительных аспектов отмечены улучшение отслеживаемости товаров, сокращение времени на проверку достоверности данных и снижение риска мошенничества. Кроме того, блокчейн обеспечивает более эффективное управление контрактами и соглашениями, что способствует уменьшению количества конфликтных ситуаций между партнерами. Количественный анализ продемонстрировал, что компании, внедрившие блокчейн, показывают увеличение производительности и снижение операционных затрат. Полученные данные подтверждают гипотезу о том, что блокчейн-технологии могут значительно повысить эффективность и прозрачность управления цепочками поставок. Однако исследование также выявило ряд проблем и ограничений, связанных с внедрением этой технологии, таких как высокая стоимость начальных инвестиций и необходимость обновления инфраструктуры. Важным фактором успеха является также готовность партнерских компаний к сотрудничеству и адаптации под новые условия. Внедрение блокчейн-технологий в управление цепочками поставок имеет потенциал существенно улучшить прозрачность и эффективность бизнес-операций. Исследование показывает, что блокчейн-системы способны обеспечить высокий уровень доверия и оптимизацию процессов, что, в свою очередь, может привести к конкурентным преимуществам для компаний. Однако для достижения этих результатов необходимо учитывать различные вызовы и тщательно планировать процесс интеграции.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>This article examines the use of blockchain technologies in supply chain management and evaluates their impact on the transparency and efficiency of business operations. In recent years, blockchain has become one of the most discussed innovative solutions in the field of digital technologies. Its ability to ensure data transparency and reliability opens up new perspectives for improving supply chain management. The main goal of this study is to analyze how the implementation of blockchain technologies can optimize processes and increase trust among supply chain participants. To achieve these goals, both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. In the first stage, the concept of blockchain and its key characteristics important for supply chains were detailed. Then, empirical data were collected through surveys and interviews with representatives of companies using blockchain. In the final stage, statistical processing of the information and the construction of models to assess the impact of blockchain technologies on the efficiency of supply chains were carried out. The results of the study showed that the application of blockchain technologies in supply chain management leads to a significant increase in process transparency. Positive aspects include improved traceability of goods, reduced time for data verification, and reduced risk of fraud. Additionally, blockchain ensures more efficient management of contracts and agreements, which helps reduce the number of conflict situations between partners. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that companies that have implemented blockchain show increased productivity and reduced operating costs. The obtained data confirm the hypothesis that blockchain technologies can significantly increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management. However, the study also revealed a number of problems and limitations associated with the implementation of this technology, such as the high cost of initial investments and the need to update infrastructure. An important success factor is also the readiness of partner companies to cooperate and adapt to new conditions. The implementation of blockchain technologies in supply chain management has the potential to significantly improve the transparency and efficiency of business operations. The study shows that blockchain systems can provide a high level of trust and process optimization, which, in turn, can lead to competitive advantages for companies. However, to achieve these results, it is necessary to consider various challenges and carefully plan the integration process.</jats:p>"

Risk factors for Cryptosporidium occurrence in drinking water supply wells, beyond surface water influence, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, physical and chemical factors were assessed as potential predictors of Cryptosporidium occurrence in 135 public supply wells in Minnesota. Univariable analysis, regression techniques, and classification trees were used to analyze the data. Many variables were identified as significant risk factors in univariable analysis and several remained significant throughout the succeeding analysis techniques. These factors fell into general categories of well use and construction, aquifer characteristics, and connectedness to the land surface, well capture zones, and land use therein, existence of potential contaminant sources within 200-feet of the well, and variability in the chemical and isotopic parameters measured during the study. These risk categories, and the specific variables and threshold values we have identified, can help guide future research on factors influencing Cryptosporidium contamination of wells and can be used by environmental health programs to develop risk-based sampling plans and design interventions that reduce associated health risks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Reservoirs are key components of many water supply systems, providing functional capability to manage, and often mitigate, hydrological variability across space and time. The presence and operation of a reservoir controls the downstream flow regime, such that in many locations understanding reservoir operations is crucial to understanding the hydrological functioning of a catchment. Although substantial progress has been made in modelling reservoir operations, several key challenges remain, particularly for large-scale applications including hundreds of reservoirs. In these cases, generic and uncalibrated reservoir operating rules are often applied. However, these rules were developed from global reservoir databases that consist mostly of large irrigation reservoirs and thus are not transferable to smaller reservoirs or those fulfilling other purposes, such as water supply. An alternative option is to use a calibrated, data-driven approach but such techniques require reservoir inflows, outflows and storage data which are rarely available across hundreds of reservoirs. To overcome these problems, here we design a set of simple reservoir operating rules (with only two calibrated parameters) focused on simulating small water supply reservoirs across large scales with various types of open access data (general catchment attributes such as surface area or reservoir capacity, and flows at downstream gauges). Using Great Britain as a case study, we integrate our rules into a national-scale hydrological model and compare hydrological simulations from two modelling scenarios, with and without the new reservoir component. Our simple reservoir operating rules significantly increase model performance in reservoir-impacted catchments, particularly when the rules are calibrated individually at each downstream gauge. We also test the feasibility of using transfer functions (which transform reservoir and catchment attributes into operating rule parameters) to identify a nationally-consistent parameterisation. This works well in ~50 % of the catchments, while nuances in individual reservoir operations limit performance in others. We suggest that our approach should provide a lower benchmark for simulations in catchments containing water supply reservoirs, and that more complex methods should only be considered where they outperform our simple approach.\n                        </jats:p>"

The emergence of financial innovation has prompted the adoption of alternative financing modes by 3PLs, including e‐commerce platform financing (EPF) and fourth‐party logistics financing (4PF). To clarify the differences among the three financing modes at the operational management level, we develop a Stackelberg game model to capture the strategic interactions between the 3PL and creditors. We examine a platform‐based supply chain where a manufacturer sells products through an e‐commerce platform to consumers, with the logistics services for the supply chain provided by the 3PL and fourth‐party logistics (4PL) firms. The analysis results reveal that the equilibrium interest rates under EPF and 4PF share a similar pattern regarding the logistics service cost coefficient, the commission rate, and the 4PL service fee. The difference is that under EPF (4PF), the logistics service level increases in the commission rate (4PL service fee) but decreases under the other financing strategy. Furthermore, the 3PL is inclined to invest in logistics technology only when the fixed investment cost is low, and these financing modes are complementary rather than alternative. The 3PL and manufacturer can benefit from 4PF (BF) when the logistics service cost coefficient is large and the market size is small (large); otherwise, EPF can enhance their profits. We also find that when the opportunity costs of capital are homogeneous, both the 4PL and the platform are consistently willing to act as financiers themselves. However, when considering heterogeneity in the opportunity costs of capital, they may be reluctant to provide financing. Each financing mode may achieve Pareto improvements under specific conditions. Finally, we also analyze the impact of technology R&amp;D risks and endogenous 4PL service fee, yielding some valuable insights.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, most existing studies on cocoa supply chains overlook the management of cocoa waste through a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) framework. This study addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive model for a cocoa CLSC system that considers value loss within the supply chain. Moreover, a profit-sharing strategy is introduced to foster sustained collaboration among stakeholders. Through the optimization of decision variables e.g. the size of transfer batch, this model aims to maximize total profit within the cocoa supply chain. The result shows that the optimal size of transfer batch is 459 units which leads to 44,782,000 IDR total profit. Additionally, by reusing cocoa husks as organic fertilizers within a closed-loop supply chain, this model also contributes to reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability within the cocoa industry.</jats:p>",

In the Maradi region, the average price of water is 500 FCFA/m3 for thermal AEPs and 375 FCFA/m3 for solar AEPs. On the Garin Maigari AEP, installations need to be monitored regularly to avoid exorbitant repair costs. If all the water were sold, the price per cubic meter would be 87 FCFA. The water supply system is economically profitable from the sale of 40% of daily production.

This system can provide large electrochemical driving forces while preventing the occurrence of electronic conduction due to electrolyte reduction. This electrochemical pumping system allows extraction/recovery of Li ions from the anode side to the cathode side, rather than the diffusion of other ions, due to the ion-diffusion-bottleneck size of the electrolyte material.

This paper analyzes the characteristics of older adults in situations of dependence, care strategies and the profile of caregivers for Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, El Salvador and Uruguay. The population in a situation of functional dependence is mostly female and over 75 years old. Between 54% and 70% receive some type of care, with unpaid family care being the main care strategy. Unpaid caregivers are mostly women, under 65, and economically inactive. We evidence a negative relationship between the status of elderly caregiver and employment, that is stronger for women. Although elderly informal care leads to a lower probability of employment among individuals of all ages and income quintiles, the employment gap between caregivers and non-caregivers narrows substantially among higher-income people. Improving care for older people would have positive effects on female employment and inequality.</jats:p>"

Over the past decades, they have become truly complex and global in scope. The long-term policy of ignoring these extremely important questions in the past has led to a staggering number of negative consequences that we are now seeing in all countries of the world. Today, it is no longer possible to continue to pretend that our activities have absolutely no impact on them. That is why, humanity is in constant search of new ideas that will be able to solve these problems, or at least slow down their pace. One of such, the most effective and promising examples was the creation of the extremely important concept of sustainable development. It has a very essential role in the spheres of logistics and management. Nowadays, all our activities in one way or another rely on them. In the global economy, the logistics sector is a major force that stimulates efficient trade and ensures the movement of goods. The logistics sphere works with a giant number of elements, various corporations, enterprises, companies, all possible transport vehicles and people. It connects them into a truly colossal in size and unified network. But it is always worth remembering that it has a huge impact on the above-mentioned problems. Currently, one of the key goals is to minimise the negative impact of logistics on the environment. That is why it is important to move this system in the direction of sustainable development, implementation of «green» initiatives, projects and technologies. In our time, the question of decarbonisation of logistics companies’ activities is really important and highly relevant, and therefore researchers should continue to monitor, study and analyse the prospects for the development of the logistics sector in this direction.</jats:p>"

All isolates had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for colistin in the range 1–64 μg/mL. Notably, 15 out of the 16 isolates demonstrated successful transfer of <jats:italic>mcr</jats:italic> genes via conjugation, indicative of their presence on plasmids. In contrast, the KK3 strain did not exhibit such transferability. Replicon types of <jats:italic>mcr-1</jats:italic>-containing plasmids included IncI2 and IncX4, while IncFIB, IncFII, and IncP1 contained <jats:italic>mcr-3</jats:italic>.

The relationship between vitamin D and allergic inflammatory cells, its modulating and tolerogenic potential is considered. The inhibitory effect of vitamin D on eosinophils, mast cells, the production of pro-inflammatory and proallergic mediators, and the synthesis of IgE has been shown. The protective role of vitamin D in the development of remodeling and hyperresponsiveness of the respiratory tract has been established by reducing the number of goblet cells, mucus hypersecretion, and the expression of metalloproteinases. The effects of vitamin D on the replication of respiratory viruses and experimental resistance to them through the induction of antimicrobial peptides and other mechanisms have been demonstrated. Data from clinical studies on the preventive effect of vitamin D on the incidence of respiratory infections and episodes of persistent wheezing in children are presented. Children with respiratory syncytial infection and vitamin D deficiency were more likely to require respiratory support and mechanical ventilation. The preventive role of vitamin D in the development of obstructive bronchitis in children and severe bronchiolitis in infants has been shown.

In the United Nations climate change negotiations, this need is only beginning to be acknowledged. Nevertheless, as some countries have already adopted supply-side climate policies, initial cooperative activities have started, and calls grow for a fossil fuel treaty, questions arise about the prospects and possible effects of international cooperation on limiting fossil fuel supply. Combining qualitative insights on possible participants in a supply-side coalition with a quantitative analysis based on integrated assessment general equilibrium modelling, this article addresses these questions. Through <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-means clustering based on fossil reserves per capita, fossil fuel rents and existing supply-side policies, we first identify which (groups of) countries are most likely to lead the formation of an international supply-side coalition, and which (groups of) countries are likely to follow. Drawing on these insights, we develop several scenarios for the evolution of international supply-side coalitions and compare these to a business-as-usual scenario. By doing so, we demonstrate the global and regional environmental, trade and macroeconomic effects of international cooperation on limiting fossil fuel supply and combining fossil supply restrictions with carbon pricing to meet the Paris goals. Our findings underscore the importance of pursuing supply-side and ambitious demand-side climate policies in parallel, and identify the scope and coverage, size of the coalition, and incentives for participation as key design elements for an international supply-side coalition.</jats:p>",

This paper provides a comparative review of supply chain integration in manufacturing between the United States (USA) and African industries. The study aims to shed light on the similarities, differences, and potential areas for improvement in both regions. In the USA, manufacturing industries have long embraced advanced technologies and adopted sophisticated supply chain management practices. The integration of information systems, automation, and real-time data analytics has enabled seamless coordination among various supply chain elements, from raw material procurement to final product delivery. Collaboration between manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors has been a hallmark of the American supply chain, facilitating quick response to market changes and reducing lead times. Contrastingly, African industries face unique challenges in achieving similar levels of supply chain integration. Factors such as infrastructure limitations, regulatory hurdles, and varying levels of technological adoption contribute to a more fragmented supply chain landscape. However, recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of the importance of supply chain integration in enhancing competitiveness, prompting initiatives and investments to overcome these challenges. Despite these disparities, both regions share common goals of improving supply chain visibility, responsiveness, and resilience. The study explores successful strategies implemented by the USA and identifies potential lessons that can be applied in the African context. For instance, best practices in the utilization of digital technologies, collaborative platforms, and lean manufacturing principles are examined to provide actionable insights for enhancing supply chain integration in African industries. This comparative review highlights the critical role of supply chain integration in manufacturing and draws attention to the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by the USA and African industries. By understanding the best practices and lessons learned from each region, stakeholders can develop targeted interventions to enhance supply chain integration, fostering sustainable growth and competitiveness in both contexts.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Supply Chain, Manufacturing, USA, Africa, Review.</jats:p>"

Non-government organizations and worker rights organizations can serve as crucial allies in supporting and safeguarding workers by assuming the role of a 'social intermediary' (SI) between supply chain firms and workers. However, these external organizations often hold limited power within these supply chains. In our paper, we examine the sources of power that SIs can cultivate and utilize to lead successful interventions against forced labour in supply chains. Through a comparative case study involving three SIs and their collaborative efforts with a global seafood brand, we explore various forms of non-mediated power and their underlying origins. By establishing these connections, we shed light on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of interventions against forced labour. Our research makes three contributions. First, we contribute to ongoing research on forced labour in supply chains by emphasizing the constructive role that SIs can play to protect vulnerable workers. Second, we address a critical gap in the existing literature concerning power of SIs in supply chain relations. More specifically, we specify sources and types of non-mediated power that SI can leverage to design effective interventions against forced labour. Third, by comparing unique data on two worker groups vulnerable to forced labour – vessel workers and workers in seafood processing – we provide much-needed insights into how working conditions in non-factory settings can still be regulated. </jats:p>"

A comprehensive survey was conducted on a sample size of 526 undergraduate students enrolled in business administration and international business courses. This study effort examined the impact of several subcomponents of GSCM on social performance. The inclusion of green production, green distribution, green supply chain management, and environmental education was seen. The coefficients of 0.24 and 0.115 suggest a favorable relationship between green procurement and internal environmental management and social performance. The existing scholarly literature presents several instances in which the implementation of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has resulted in enhanced societal performance. The objective of this study is to contribute to the existing literature by investigating the many factors that influence the performance of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in improving financial outcomes. The investigation also encompasses the examination of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) and its influence on societal performance. The authors propose that the extent to which graduates were exposed to GSCM education throughout their college years will have a substantial impact on their contributions to their respective fields and to society as a whole. Individuals who proactively pursue higher education by enrolling in college and focusing their studies on attaining a business degree are more likely to increase their chances of achieving success as entrepreneurs. Hence, these affluent proprietors of companies possess the potential to expand their operations and provide significant economic benefits at a macro level. In order to ensure the enduring viability of businesses, local communities, and the natural environment, educational institutions should provide curricula including corporate social responsibility, volunteerism, and ecologically conscious manufacturing methods. The integration of environmental stewardship with ethical business practices is crucial.</jats:p>"

However, the fluctuations of renewable generations and railway traction loads in RPSS may introduce data noise, which will jeopardize the accuracy of the generated pseudo‐measurements and thus impact the state estimation. Additionally, when learning the historical measurement data sequences, the traditional pseudo‐measurement model is likely to have overfitting, which will further impact the accuracy of pseudo‐measurements, thereby affecting the accuracy of state estimation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a high‐accuracy pseudo‐measurement‐based state estimation approach for RPSSs. Firstly, a denoising autoencoder‐based method is used to mitigate the impact of data noise on the accuracy of pseudo measurements, and a gated recurrent unit‐based method is used to adaptively learn the historical measurement data sequence, thereby improving the accuracy of pseudo measurements. Next, the pseudo‐measurement weights are obtained by generating pseudo‐measurement variances using the Gaussian mixture model. Finally, the pseudo measurements and real‐time measurements are integrated by weighted least squares to realize the state estimation of RPSS. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by simulation on a modified IEEE 33‐node system which includes a railway traction substation and renewable generations.</jats:p>",

It assesses the watershed's suitability for meeting agricultural water needs, particularly for rice cultivation. The study utilizes quantitative methods, applying the Penman–Monteith technique and benefit transfer analysis to measure the water footprint of agriculture. Key indicators include blue, green, and gray water footprints. The water footprint in the Kampar watershed is 173.84 m3/t, with rice cultivation in the Kampar regency having 57.96 m3/t blue, 32.19 m3/t green, and 14.52 m3/t gray water footprints. In the Pelalawan regency, the values were 41.09 m3/t blue, 25.59 m3/t green, and 2.49 m3/t gray water footprints. The findings suggest a significant need for ample water usage from surface and groundwater in both Kampar and Pelalawan regencies for rice cultivation. Regarding the water availability in each district: Kampar regency has 1,063,281,652 m3/year and Pelalawan regency has 987,542,991 m3/year. This surplus in the Kampar watershed ensures sufficient water for rice cultivation in both districts, especially in the Kampar regency. These hold promising further agricultural development in the Riau province.</jats:p>",

Issues may arise from natural occurrence, cross-contamination in the supply chain, and contamination at during production. The food and food service industries are responsible for providing and preparing foods that are safe for people with food allergies: we address the challenges inherent in risk assessment of botanical impurities. Conclusions: The presence of botanical impurities emerges as a significant risk factor for food allergies in the 2020s. We advocate for regulatory authorities to fortify labeling requirements and develop robust risk assessment tools.

This problem is getting worse and even continues in temperate climatic regions due to climate change. To address this problem, the use of biodegradable hydrogels is increasingly important for the application as water-retaining additives in soil. Furthermore, efficient (micro-)nutrient supply can be provided by the use of tailored hydrogels. Biodegradable polyaspartic acid (PASP) hydrogels with different available (1,6-hexamethylene diamine (HMD) and L-lysine (LYS)) and newly developed crosslinkers based on diesters of glycine (GLY) and (di-)ethylene glycol (DEG and EG, respectively) were synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and regarding their swelling properties (kinetic, absorbency under load (AUL)) as well as biodegradability of PASP hydrogel. Copper (II) and zinc (II), respectively, were loaded as micronutrients in two different approaches: in situ with crosslinking and subsequent loading of prepared hydrogels. The results showed successful syntheses of di-glycine-ester-based crosslinkers. Hydrogels with good water-absorbing properties were formed. Moreover, the developed crosslinking agents in combination with the specific reaction conditions resulted in higher water absorbency with increased crosslinker content used in synthesis (10% vs. 20%). The prepared hydrogels are candidates for water-storing soil additives due to the biodegradability of PASP, which is shown in an exemple. The incorporation of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions can provide these micronutrients for plant growth.</jats:p>"

How to ensure power supply security while realizing low-carbon transition is the key challenge faced by the construction of new power systems. In large cities with a shortage of local power generation resources, this problem is particularly prominent. The study takes Guangzhou city as a case study area, which has the typical characteristics of “serious energy shortage and extremely high-power load density” in China. This study explores the differences in power supply capacity, structure, carbon emissions, and power supply costs under the six different scenarios set up from the power supply side for future power supply structures. The optimal power supply modes have been matched for cities with different development characteristics and needs. The change in power supply structure and the realization path under the optimal power supply modes are discussed. The results show that the power supply capacity of Guangzhou is constantly improving under different scenarios, with the highest self-sufficiency rates of power production capacity and power production quantity reaching 80% and 50%, respectively, by 2030. Despite this, Guangzhou still does not have the basic conditions for building a new power supply system through the development of local high-proportion renewable energy only due to the limitation of resource endowment. The combination with increasing the ratio of renewable energy in outsourcing power is an inevitable choice for low-carbon transition for the city. This study provides a new idea on how to build a new power supply system for an energy shortage city. It can be used as a reference for safe power supply and low-carbon transition for the power supply sectors of other cities.</jats:p>",

The agri‐food supply chain is currently starting to incorporate metaverse technology. Retailers and prominent companies use this technology to achieve particular goals, such as ensuring traceability or boosting sales and reputation. Concurrently, there is an opportunity for the metaverse to affect food chain performance more broadly. Even so, the literature provides little evidence for this effect and primarily focuses on specific indicators, leaving little knowledge about it. By exploring the rapidly evolving field of metaverse technologies and their potential impacts on the security of agri‐food supply chains, this study aims to fill this knowledge gap. The study aims to improve collaboration and communication throughout the agri‐food supply chain by providing a structured framework covering a variety of metaverse technologies, from the development of immersive virtual worlds to the deployment of blockchain for traceability. The findings offer valuable insights, particularly for researchers, decision makers, and industry partners who aim to better comprehend the potential benefits and challenges related to integrating metaverse solutions into the agri‐food industry. The study concludes with recommendations for future research directions and strategic factors that could assist in ensuring the effective adoption of metaverse technologies and the security and resilience of agri‐food supply chains.</jats:p>",

Here we combine stable isotope tracing, geophysical surveys, and satellite analysis to unravel the links between transpiration and the discharge of groundwater nitrate to the waters surrounding a coral reef island (Lady Elliot Island in the Great Barrier Reef). Over a 2‐year study period (2020–2021) there was a net loss of freshwater from the island, that is, evapotranspiration (ET) exceeded rainfall, largely caused by high rates of transpiration (73% of ET). Transpiration was higher in forested areas, and groundwater salinity appeared to be higher there. By tracing the nitrogen stable isotope signature of groundwater nitrate into reef organism tissue we were able to map groundwater nitrogen discharge spatially and temporally. Groundwater nitrogen discharge was focussed on one side of the island and did not vary seasonally as expected, despite reduced rainfall and seabird guano inputs over the austral winter/spring. Based on our results, we propose that transpiration by island vegetation slows groundwater flow and concentrates nitrate in the groundwater being released to the surrounding reef system. High concentrations of nitrate in groundwater (up to 27 mmol L<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) were observed on Lady Elliot Island and these seem to have increased since 2014, but further work is required to understand if this is a normal scenario for tropical coral islands or the result of the islands' revegetation program.</jats:p>",

Thus, it is crucial to predict SMEs' credit risk accurately. However, redundant features and imbalanced sample data may decrease the accuracy of the prediction model. Therefore, a novel credit risk prediction framework is proposed called FS‐RS‐ML, which is short for Feature Selection–Resample Strategy–Machine Learning. In this approach, Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross‐Validation (RFECV) is applied to select key features influencing SMEs' credit risk prediction, and three resampling techniques are used to balance the sample data. Finally, five machine learning algorithms are adopted to classify high‐risk and low‐risk SMEs. The experiments based on Chinese SCF data demonstrate that the FS‐RS‐ML framework outperforms any single algorithm. Moreover, according to the analysis of empirical results, features derived from SMEs have the most important impact on credit risk prediction. And the effect of key features on predicting SMEs' credit risk is revealed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) deployed in battery energy storage systems (BESS) can reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity-generating sector and improve environmental sustainability. The aim of this study is to use life cycle assessment (LCA) modeling, using data from peer-reviewed literature and public and private sources, to quantify environmental impacts along the supply chain for cobalt, a crucial component in many types of LIBs. The study seeks to understand where in the life cycle stage the environmental impacts are highest, thus highlighting actions that can be taken to improve sustainability of the LIB supply chain. The system boundary for this LCA is cradle-to-gate. Impact assessment follows ReCiPe Midpoint (H) 2016. We assume a 30-year modeling period, with augmentation occurring at the end of the 3rd, 7th, and 14th years of operations, before a complete replacement in the 21st year. Three refinery locations (China, Canada, and Finland), a range of ore grades, and five battery chemistries (NMC111, NMC532, NMC622, NMC811, and NCA) are used in scenarios to better estimate their effect on the life cycle impacts. Insights from the study are that impacts along nearly all pathways increase according to an inverse power-law relationship with ore grade; refining outside of China can reduce global warming potential (GWP) by over 12%; and GWP impacts for cobalt used in NCA and other NMC battery chemistries are 63% and 45–74% lower than in NMC111, respectively. When analyzed on a single-score basis, marine and freshwater ecotoxicity are prominent. For an ore grade of 0.3%, the GWP values for the Canada route decrease at a rate of 58% to 65%, and those for Finland route decrease by 71% to 76% from the base case. Statistical analysis shows that cobalt content in the battery is the highest predictor (R2 = 0.988), followed by the ore grade (R2 = 0.966) and refining location (R2 = 0.766), when assessed for correlation individually. The results presented here point to areas where environmental burdens of LIBs can be reduced, and thus they are helpful to policy and investment decision makers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Warehousing policy framework as a business enabler has led to the growth of proficient warehouses as it facilitates firms to collaborate and compete. It provides a criterion for the specific needs of the food and beverages sector to synchronize materials, plan and manage capacities. While practitioners are recommending improvement in warehousing policy framework to enhance performance, there is no standard topology for these for various industries. Thus, presenting a gap to explore the warehousing requirements, procedures and documentations that are necessary for a dynamic food and beverages sector. Therefore, the major purpose of this study was to examine the moderating role of warehousing policy framework in the relationship between warehousing operations and supply chain performance of food and beverages processing firms in Kenya. The study adopted a mixed research design with both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The target population of the study was the 134 food and beverages manufacturing firms in Nairobi County. A sampling frame of this study included a list of the 134 manufacturing companies in Nairobi County that are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. The study utilized simple random sampling. A sample size of 100 was selected with the aid of Yamane 1967 formula. Both primary and secondary data was collected using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was tested pilot at 10 food and beverages manufacturing companies in Kiambu county. These pilot study questionnaires were filled out by warehouse managers. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25 was used to analyze the data. Using content analysis, the qualitative data was analyzed. Quantitative data was analyzed using statistical methods involving descriptive and inferential data. A multiple linear regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between the variables. Analysis was also performed on the correlation. In this study, the findings were presented using tables and graphs. Data presentation made use of percentages, frequencies, means and other means of central tendencies. The study revealed that majority of the food and beverages manufacturing firms in Kenya prioritized space optimization, maintaining adequate aisle space, and executing warehouse maintenance under regulatory restrictions. However, many these did not automate or mechanize warehouse workflow, suggesting the need for automation and mechanization technology to improve production and efficiency.</jats:p>"

To elucidate the roles of sediment supply, flow‐dependent transport capacity, and morphodynamic feedbacks on the evolution of emergent vegetation patches over a single hydrograph, we conducted two experiments with different reach‐scale sediment supplies: a high‐supply experiment (HSE) and low‐supply experiment (LSE). We measured flow velocities, bedload transport, and topographic changes around a full‐scale patch of live emergent willows in an outdoor laboratory flume. Erosion occurred in the patch‐adjacent channel areas irrespective of the sediment supply, whereas deposition within the patch interior was suppressed in the LSE and enhanced in the HSE. The magnitude of patch deposition in each experiment was controlled by the local sediment supply to the patch and local sediment mobility during each discharge in the hydrograph. The local sediment supply was affected by bed morphodynamics at the patch head, which modulated the reach‐scale sediment supply by redistributing the bedload in the channel. Sediment mobility within the patch was flow‐dependent and a function of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. For different discharges, the velocity in the patch changed proportionally with the freestream velocity; however, the turbulent kinetic energy was more sensitive, being elevated compared with the freestream during high flows and inhibited at low flows. Therefore, deposition and erosion within vegetation patches are not simply functions of the reach‐scale sediment supply or patch flow characteristics, as is often assumed, but additionally depend on the local sediment supply to the patch interior.</jats:p>",

Previous design methods for optimizing the structure and parameters showed very limited enhancement in suction force due to the compressibility of air, which limits the supply pressure and supply power. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative design for replacing the fluid medium from compressible gas to incompressible liquid (e.g., water). It was experimentally validated that the gripper using water can increase the supply power several times and the suction force dozens of times compared with that using air. Then, the pressure distribution and flow field of the gripper were investigated experimentally, implying that the flow field exists in the water-film zone and the bubble zone, with radial lines of water flow of equal cross section formed in the bubble zone. Furthermore, a model of pressure distribution was established, including the water-film zone, the bubble zone, and the boundary between the two. The theoretical results were basically consistent with the experimental results. This study provides an innovative idea, theoretical model, and experimental data for the optimal design and application of the Bernoulli gripper.</jats:p>",

In this study, we developed an ecological infrastructure optimization method based on ecosystem service supply, demand, and flow in Yantai City as the study area; identified the spatial extent of urban ecological infrastructure and its spatial and temporal changes based on the spatial quantification of multiple ecosystem services; assessed whether the existing ecological infrastructure could satisfy the needs of the urban residents by calculating the ecosystem service supply and demand indexes; and used the spatial quantification of ecosystem service flows to optimize the spatial layout of urban ecological infrastructure. This study shows that, from 2010 to 2018, ecological infrastructure in Longkou, Zhaoyuan, and Laiyang decreased, contrasting with the growth in the existing peripheral areas. The study found a clear spatial mismatch between the supply and demand of ecosystem services, especially in the central urban areas, suggesting that the existing infrastructure was unable to satisfy the needs of high-demand areas. This study assessed the peripheral areas of the city using comparative ecological radiation force (CERF), including 314.64 km2 of environmentally beautiful village units as key components of ecological infrastructure in Yantai City.

In this work, based on the single-input and single-output impedance model of China CRH5 trains, the node admittance matrices of the train–network system both in unilateral and bilateral power supply modes are established, including three-phase power grid, traction transformers and traction network. Then the modal analysis is used to study the oscillation modes and propagation characteristics of the unilateral and bilateral power supply systems. Moreover, the influence of the equivalent inductance of the power grid, the length of the transmission line, and the length of the traction network are analyzed on the critical oscillation mode of the bilateral power supply system. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are verified by the time-domain simulation model in MATLAB/Simulink.</jats:p>",

However, in practice, obtaining such information can be costly, and some members may be unwilling or unable to provide the necessary access to the data. As such, large collaborative supply chains with multiple members may operate under a mixed‐information scenario where point‐of‐sale demand information is not known for all customers. Other sources of demand information exist and are becoming more available along supply chains using Industry 4.0 technologies and can serve as a substitute, but the data may be noisy, distorted, and partially missing. Under mixed information, leveraging existing customers' point‐of‐sale demand to improve the intermittent demand forecast of customers with missing information has yet to be explored. We propose a supervised demand forecasting method that uses multivariate time series clustering to map multiple sources of demand data. Members with missing downstream demand data have their resulting demand forecast improved by averaging over customers with similar delivery patterns for their final demand forecast. Our results show up to a 10% accuracy improvement over traditional intermittent demand forecasting methods with missing information.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To solve the problems of unstable chain and poor supply chain (SC) function in the China’s agriculture industry, the relevant study is carried out on the function evaluation of the sustainable agricultural SC by structural equation modelling (SEM) under the background of digital technology. Primarily, the analysis is implemented on the research status of the sustainable SC and SC function. Then, starting with the relationship among big data (BD) application, information sharing, and sustainable SC function of agricultural production, a function evaluation model is implemented for the sustainable SC of SEM-based agricultural production. Next, a questionnaire is designed for the research on the impact of BD applications on the function of the sustainable agricultural SC. Ultimately, the statistical analysis of the obtained data reveals the correlation between the interaction and influence among the BD application, information sharing, and sustainable SC function of agricultural production. The results show that the BD application dimension, information sharing dimension, and all sub-dimensions have is beneficial to the function of the agricultural sustainable SC. The application of multidimensional cloud technology in BD has no obvious relationship with the dimensionality and level of information sharing, and the relationship between other corresponding dimensions shows a significant positive impact. A referenceable method is provided for the practice of sustainable SC management of agricultural production.</jats:p>",

There is a lack of scientific literature examining the interaction between social and economic sustainability within the apparel industry from the employee perspective. This study aims to assess the preferences of blue and white‐collar employees in the apparel supply chain to implement SSPs. The SSPs were identified through a literature study and a deductive approach was taken to conduct a discrete choice experiment. The experiment revealed that blue‐collar employees prioritised maternity leaves and proper sanitary facilities, whereas white‐collar employees preferred corporate social responsibility initiatives and providing proper sanitary facilities when designing the jobs for blue‐collar employees. The study also identified willingness to pay for the identified practices highlighting the importance of providing maternity leaves and proper sanitary facilities to enhance economic and social sustainability. This research contributes to bridging the gap between the expectations of blue‐collar and white‐collar employees towards SSPs and provide an understanding of the interaction between the social and economic pillars of sustainability in the global apparel supply chain.</jats:p>",

There is a difference in orientation between the upstream and downstream of the supply network, which causes structural differences between the upstream and downstream.

Using transaction data from the automotive industry, we compared the drivers that constitute supply networks and create upstream and downstream links. The Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to evaluate the significance of configuration drivers, including company attributes, dyadic attributes, and structural characteristics. As a result, the age of supplier, size of the purchaser, sales of the purchaser, asset of the purchaser, transitivity, and activity were found to be common drivers of upstream and downstream. On the other hand, the age of the purchaser, the difference in sales between the two companies, and popularity were found to be significant drivers only in the downstream network. These research results are the first to empirically compare the upstream and downstream supply networks, and have academic contribution as the first step in finding the cause of the differences in network structure between the upstream and downstream networks.</jats:p>",

It proposes a behavioral competition model in which firms use the average cost‐plus price to determine their supplies. Specifically, firms are assumed to increase (resp., decrease) their supplies as the market price rises over (resp., falls below) this reference price. The equilibrium market outcome lies between those corresponding to Bertrand and Cournot competition. It depends on the industry's margin target, which determines the slope of firms' supply functions. The more significant the markup target is, the lower are the firms' equilibrium supplies at any price level and the higher is the equilibrium market price. An industry‐wide commitment to targeting a markup thus reduces competition in equilibrium. The reduction in competition is more pronounced than when firms commit to linear supply functions.</jats:p>",

Rivers lose riparian vegetation, habitat heterogeneity, natural flow velocity, etc., due to hydromorphological alterations. We analyzed macroinvertebrate communities in a wide range of hydromorphological conditions – from near natural sites to significantly altered water bodies, focusing on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT). Considering that the EPT group is a quite sensitive and generally stenovalent group, we wanted to examine which of the hydromorphological pressures affects them the most. We also wanted to identify indicator taxa for different levels of degradation: minor, moderate, and severe. We collected samples from 84 karst rivers sites in Croatia. We found 52 taxa of EPT (Ephemeroptera – 21, Plecoptera – 11, Trichoptera – 20). Changes in river morphology proved to be the most important stressor affecting the distribution of the EPT group. Hydrological regulation did not show significance toward the EPT community, possibly due to the karst nature of the rivers studied. The most sensitive EPT taxa were those with the greatest preference for macrophytes and lithal habitats. More tolerant EPT taxa were those with a wide range of habitat preferences and/or taxa that feed on particulate organic matter.</jats:p>",

Identifying market convergence trends allows companies to respond quickly to market changes and improve supply chain resilience (SCR). Conventional approaches are one-sided and biased and cannot predict market convergence trends comprehensively and accurately. To address this issue, we propose a framework based on info2vec that solves the problem of matching multidimensional data by using the technology layer as the focal layer and the supply chain as the supporting layer. The framework enriches the supply chain dimension with the technology dimension. A knowledge graph is constructed to facilitate cross-domain information connectivity by integrating different data sources. The nodes in the knowledge graph were characterized using a representation learning algorithm, which enhanced feature mining during supply chain and market convergence. Changes in market demand were predicted based on link prediction experiments. Market convergence has an impact on firm cooperation and, thus, on SCR. The framework recommends potential technological and innovative cooperation opportunities for firms. In this way, it has been demonstrated to improve SSSCM through network resilience experiments. This method predicts market convergence efficiently based on the supply chain knowledge graph, which provides decision support for enterprise development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many firms have been shifting their supply chains away from countries with stringent control measures to mitigate supply-chain disruption. Nowadays, the global economy has reopened from the COVID-19 pandemic at various paces in different countries. Understanding how the global supply network evolves during and after the pandemic is necessary for determining the timing and speed of reopening. By harnessing the real-world and real-time global human movement and the latest macroeconomic data, we propose an evolutionary economic-epidemiological model to explore the evolutionary dynamics of the global supply network under various global reopening scenarios. We find that, for highly restrictive countries, the delay in reopening has limited public health benefits in the long run but leads to significant supply-chain loss. A longer duration of stringent control measures substantially hurts the profitability of firms in highly restrictive countries, leading to slower supply-chain recovery in 5 years. This research presents the first data-driven evidence of supply chain loss due to the timing and speed of reopening and sheds light on the post-pandemic supply-chain reformation and recovery. Insights learned from COVID-19 will also be a valuable policymaking reference for combating future infectious disease epidemics and geopolitical changes.</jats:p>",

In the context of complex climate change and socioeconomic development, there is an urgent need for systematic assessment and forecasting studies on how to combine physical, geographical, and socioeconomic factors to clarify patterns of change in the land use change and water supply–demand, as well as to respond appropriately to different climate and socioeconomic development scenarios in the future. Based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways-Representative Concentration Pathway (SSP-RCP) scenarios, a framework for simulating future land use change and assessing water supply–demand in the coupled SD-PLUS-InVEST model was constructed. The land use change in Guizhou Province from 2020 to 2050 was simulated using the SD-PLUS model, and the water supply–demand conditions were projected for 2030, 2040, and 2050 under multiple scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585). The research results indicated that (1) The land use change in the study area has significant spatial heterogeneity. It showed similar trends in the land use change in the SSP126 and SSP245 scenarios, with both artificial surfaces and forest showing an expansion trend, but the expansion of forest was most typical in the southwestern region in the SSP126 scenario, and there is a significant increase in the northeastern region in the SSP245 scenario. Additionally, there is a rapid expansion of artificial surfaces in the central region in the SSP585 scenario, and a more rapid expansion of cultivated land in the southeastern region, with a significant increase in the area of water bodies. (2) The changes in water supply from 2020 to 2050 under the three scenarios show a smaller increase (5.22–11.88%), a significant increase in water demand (29.45–58.84%), and an increase in the area of water shortage by about 2708.94–9084.40 km2, with the extent of the shortage increasing by about 23.71–79.50%. (3) According to the results of the SSP-RCP scenario projections, socioeconomic development has a significant impact on the growth of water demand, and climate and land use change may exacerbate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water supply–demand in the karst region. The systematic study of land use change and water supply–demand in Guizhou can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable management of regional ecosystems and the rational allocation of land and water resources.</jats:p>"

Existing diffusion-type oxygen supply enrichments for plateau regions lack quantitative conclusions and have not been implemented systematically in actual engineering. To refine the design parameters of the required method, this study utilized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to examine the optimal design parameters for oxygen supply equipment in a typical engineering project. The optimal scheme consisted of three rows of oxygen diffusion apparatuses with 0.07 m inlet diameter, 0.4 m lateral spacing and 60° tilt that maintain a constant oxygen supply rate. This configuration maximized oxygen concentration enrichment in workers’ breathing zones, with oxygen partial pressure in most target zones remaining below 3000 m altitude, except for the ventilation side where it was 3360 m. This study elucidated the effects of various design parameters on oxygen distribution and proposed the optimal combination for a typical tunnel engineering project. The findings provide a guidance for implementing diffusion-type oxygen enrichment in high-altitude tunnel construction, aiding both worker safety and project efficiency. </jats:p>",

This study meticulously evaluates the operational efficacy of a water production system by examining four pivotal factors: buried pipe length (TL), air flow rate (AFR), air temperature (AT), and air humidity (AH). A positive correlation between these variables and water vapor production is established, with AT exerting the most pronounced influence. Significantly, the analysis of variance reveals the main and interactive effects of the variables, except for TL × AFR, at a 5% significance level. To enhance understanding of the intricate interplay among these factors, a proficient least squares support vector machines model is devised, employing a radial basis function kernel. This model demonstrates an impressive 98% concurrence between projected and empirical data, with a minimal error of 0.66 mL and 5.99%. An in-depth sensitivity analysis underscores the differential impact of AT, AH, TL, and AFR on water vapor (WV) prediction. Optimal values of 3.98 m, 6.89 m3/h, 46.30 °C, and 86.62% for TL, AFR, AT, and AH, respectively, are obtained through subsequent optimization of independent variables using genetic algorithms, resulting in a notable water production of 23.61 mL.</jats:p>",

Firstly, each site’s economic fuel production plan is developed under a random demand and service level. Then, a transportation plan is proposed to collaborate between sites in case of unavailability site or unmet needs, minimizing the total cost. According to the correlation between production and maintenance, a periodically preventive maintenance strategy is developed for both refining machines and storage tanks, while minimizing the incurred costs by considering the influence of fuel production rate on their failure rates. Additionally, in this study, experimental tests are performed on an industrial tank, based on the real-life case of fuel companies, to investigate the tanks’ degradation due to corrosion phenomena. The resolution complexity of the analytical model arises from its stochastic nature due to random demands. Hence, a transformation to a deterministic form is performed. Numerical examples and a sensitivity study are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the obtained results. </jats:p>"

A substation is an indispensable building in the process of urbanization construction. However, in existing cold areas, the heating form of substations generally adopts electric heating, which consumes a large amount of energy. This paper optimizes the existing HVAC form of substations through the rational utilization of surrounding environmental resources and puts forward reasonable building energy-saving and carbon-reduction methods. It demonstrates the feasibility of combining solar photovoltaic power generation systems, air source heat pumps, and natural ventilation to optimize energy savings and carbon reduction in the main control building of a substation in a cold area. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to demonstrate the feasibility of natural ventilation during the summer and transition seasons. The data indicate that the installation of a solar photovoltaic power generation system results in an average annual power generation of 18.75 MWh. Additionally, using an air source heat pump can save 44.5% of electricity compared to electric heating. When both a solar photovoltaic power generation system and an air source heat pump are used to provide a building with cold and heat sources, the annual emissions of CO2 can be reduced by 4.90 tons compared to a traditional electric heating system.</jats:p>"

This study leverages the adaptive cycle framework to investigate the intricate dynamics between supply concentration and organizational resilience. We unveil a paradox where, up to a critical threshold, supply concentration fortifies resilience through tight‐knit buyer–supplier relationships and a bolstered resource base. Yet, surpassing this tipping point precipitates a rigidity trap, eroding the resilience fabric of organizations. Additionally, we scrutinize the nuanced roles of three dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation – proactiveness, innovativeness and risk‐taking – in shaping this complex interplay. We test our hypotheses using both secondary and primary data collected from Chinese firms, employing ordinary least‐squares regression and survival analysis. The results show that an inverted U‐shaped relationship emerges between supply concentration and organizational resilience. Furthermore, our research generally confirms the conjectured moderating influences of entrepreneurial orientation dimensions, enriching our understanding of how they calibrate the balance between concentration benefits and vulnerabilities. This study offers a new perspective on the implications of supply concentration for organizational resilience and contributes to the intersection of supply chain management, organizational resilience and entrepreneurship.</jats:p>",

This activity involves a lot of data, requiring efficient and effective data storage and access. The level in the simulation layout includes analysing system needs, using problem diagrams, compiling activity diagrams, deciding subprocesses, and filtering information. The analysis is carried out by comparing the use of supply chains with Blockchain and without Blockchain, which is then obtained to determine whether there is an increase. A sequentially stored data scenario describes a situation when the transaction process is in progress and is stored sequentially according to the process that occurs. Storing data in groups explains a problem when a transaction has been completed and stored in groups with similar data, making it easier to track specific data. In this regard, a simulation will be carried out using a website, namely a blockchain demo. The design stage starts with identifying system requirements, creating use case diagrams, compiling activity diagrams, determining subprocesses, and selecting information.

Along with the requirements attributed to the quality of this category of products, the requirements for their storage distinguish them from other products. This feature is due to the need to maintain the required temperature regime throughout the entire period of existence of perishable products, from the moment of their manufacture to the moment of consumption. Thus, the quality of the transported product is ensured, on which the safety of the population directly depends.\nThus, the process of transporting perishable products is considered actual in its essence. This makes it necessary to investigate, analyze and solve existing problems in the specified area. This article is devoted to the problem of transportation of eggs to the supply points of livestock products produced in farms.\nThe methodology and methods used are the theoretical and methodological basis of the research, the works of local and foreign scientists dedicated to the deployment of production forces, the transport provision of cargo transportation, as well as the operation of the collector transport system, scientific literature on statistics, probability, graphs and management theories, economic mathematical modeling.\nThe main scientific innovation put forward is the development of the methodology, mathematical model of the optimal location of supply and reception points in the territory according to the minimum cost of transportation and the maximum profit, and the determination of optimal centers.\nThe result of the research is the determination of the optimal location centers by establishing a mathematical model of the supply points of the eggs belonging to livestock products in Ganja-Dashkasan and Gazakh-Tovuz economic regions. Based on the software developed in the MathCAD computer optimization system, it is possible to determine the coordinates of the optimal location centers of the supply points, which are considered relevant as a large-scale problem in a short period of time. The high accuracy and authenticity of the obtained results indicate the possibility and significance of the wide application of the developed methodology in agriculture.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, previous studies that presented factors for selecting third-party logistics companies were reviewed. As a method of integrating the presented selection criteria, 4 items of ‘logistics service’, 3 items of ‘logistics information (IT) system’, 4 items of ‘logistics price (cost)’, 5 selection criteria of 3 items of ‘Corporate Reputation’ and 6 items of ‘Capacity and Infrastructure’ and 20 application items were selected. And using these contents, a survey was conducted on manufacturing companies.\r\nSurvey results As a questionnaire that can be used for AHP analysis, 51 companies in the efficient supply chain group and 35 companies in the reactive supply chain group were collected. The priority and weight of the selection criteria and application items were determined by performing pairwise comparisons on Tier II selection criteria and Tier III application factors, and calculating overlapping weights.\r\nThe priority and importance of the Tier II selection criteria and the Tier III application factors were confirmed, and the weights for the selection criteria and application items that should be applied preferentially were calculated by synthesizing them. In the efficient supply chain group, the importance of stability, service price, image, cost reduction, accuracy, financial stability, and compatibility was high. In the reactive supply chain group, the importance of stability, accuracy, image, service price, information capability, compatibility, and incentives was high.

Scenarios using local or centralized blue H2 production were evaluated using two different modes of H2 transportation (liquid H2 tanker trucks and pipelines). For each scenario, the average H2 supply costs were determined considering H2 production costs from facilities of different sizes and transportation costs for H2 that was not produced locally. Average H2 supply costs were 2.83 CAD/kg H2 for the scenario with local H2 production at each refuelling site, 3.22–3.27 CAD/kg H2 for scenarios using centralized H2 production and tanker truck transportation, and 2.92–2.96 CAD/kg H2 for centralized H2 production scenarios with pipeline transportation. Optimized scenarios using the cheaper transportation option (tanker truck or pipeline) for each highway segment had average H2 supply costs (2.82–2.88 CAD/kg H2) similar to those of using only local H2 production, with slightly lower costs for the scenario using the largest H2 production volumes.

This research uses isotopic composition of water (δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O and δ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>H) to explore the sources and fate of soil water in lower‐elevation agricultural areas of the Judith River watershed, in the headwaters of the Missouri River, USA. Extensive non‐irrigated cereal crop production in this area occurs on well‐drained soils and depends on careful water management. Our observations indicate that colder precipitation contributes isotopically distinct water to cultivated terrace soils relative to downgradient groundwaters and streams. Riparian waters also exhibit a higher fraction of contributions from colder precipitation relative to terrace groundwaters and streams. Apparent contributions from colder precipitation in terrace and riparian soil waters suggest that snowmelt is a key component of the water supply to these systems. Riparian waters also show evidence of evaporation suggesting that water spends sufficient time in some ponds and open channels in the riparian corridor to reflect fractionation by evaporation. The evolution of water isotopic composition from soils to shallow aquifers to stream corridors indicates source water partitioning as precipitation moves through this semi‐arid agricultural landscape. The apparent mixing processes evident in this evolution reveal source water dynamics that are necessary to understand plant transpiration, solute processing, and contaminant leaching processes.</jats:p>",

This research commences by scrutinizing the impact of digital transformation on enterprise supply chain (<jats:sc>ESC</jats:sc>) performance, elucidating the strategic application of precision management in the digital transformation process, and subsequently offers comprehensive elucidations encompassing digital transformation, <jats:sc>ESC</jats:sc> performance, and precision management from diverse analytical perspectives. Subsequently, an array of research hypotheses is postulated and systematically substantiated through rigorous data analysis. Notably, the outcomes of the experimentation attest to the robustness of the questionnaire designed for this research, manifesting Cronbach’s <jats:styled-content xml:lang=\"el-Grek\">α</jats:styled-content> coefficients that consistently surpass the threshold of 0.8 across all dimensions. Moreover, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (<jats:sc>KMO</jats:sc>) values, surpassing 0.82, further endorse the instrument’s reliability and validity, rendering it eminently suitable for experimental deployment. Subsequently, in the correlation analysis, a statistically significant relationship is discerned between the dual dimensions of digital transformation and the dual facets of <jats:sc>ESC</jats:sc> performance and precision management, ultimately affirming the validity of hypotheses H1a, H1b, H2a, H2b, H3a, H3b, H4a, and H4b. In the regression analysis, the coefficients of determination for the two regression models are 0.478 and 0.557, further confirming the hypotheses proposed in this research. The conclusion suggests that digital transformation is an evolving process, and enterprises should adopt a stance of continuous improvement and innovation. Regular assessments of the effectiveness of digital transformation should be conducted, with adjustments and improvements made based on feedback results. Therefore, this research provides valuable insights into the analysis of the relationship between digital transformation and <jats:sc>ESC</jats:sc> and precision management.</jats:p>",

We study the bidding decisions of suppliers that underestimate costs when the buyer uses first‐price or second‐price sealed‐bid procurement auctions. We study the effects of underestimating costs on the bid prices and performance decisions under different auction modes and propose renegotiations after procurement auctions to cope with supply disruptions. The results show that: (1) using first‐price or second‐price auctions, underestimating costs does not guarantee a positive profit on completion of the supply. When the winning supplier's degree of underestimation is high enough, underestimating costs may cause supply disruptions. (2) When the buyer faces supply disruptions, if the expected payment for re‐selecting another supplier is not less than a certain threshold value, the buyer can prevent supply disruptions through renegotiations after procurement auctions. (3) Compared to the situation where all suppliers' budgeted costs are accurate, underestimating costs always decreases the supplier's profit. For the buyer, when the supplier completes the supply under the original or renegotiated contract, underestimating costs can decrease the procurement costs.

Although actively debated, this process has been theorized to be induced by hypoxia and to involve activation of endothelial inwardly rectifying K\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            channels (K\n            <jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>\n            ) 2.1 by elevated extracellular K\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            to trigger conducted hyperpolarization via connexin40 (Cx40) gap junctions to upstream resistors.

Second-by-second capillary RBC flow responses were recorded as O\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            was altered. A stepwise drop in PO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            at the muscle surface increased RBC supply in capillaries of control animals while elevated O\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            elicited the opposite response; capillaries were confirmed to express Cx40. The RBC flow responses were rapid and tightly coupled to O\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            ; computer simulations did not support hypoxia as a driving factor. In contrast, RBC flow responses were significantly diminished in\n            <jats:italic>\n              Cx40\n              <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>\n            </jats:italic>\n            mice.

The development of FDEs, induced by anomalies in different environmental variables, may cause different responses to the ecosystem’s gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the GPP variations and underlying mechanisms during the FDEs have rarely been quantified. This study collected long-term (&gt;10 years) high-quality flux observations from the FLUXNET 2015 dataset to investigate GPP variations and their driving mechanisms during FDEs. Results showed that all vegetation types have two contrasting GPP variations during FDEs. One variation is a decreasing then increasing standardized GPP anomaly (V-shape response). The other shows an increase followed by decreasing standardized GPP anomaly (inverted V-shape response). The V-shape GPP response to FDEs was induced by increased soil water content deficit at the onset stage of FDEs. In contrast, the inverted V-shape GPP response to FDEs was induced by increased net radiation at the onset of FDEs. Such results indicated competing moisture supply and atmospheric moisture demand at the onset of FDEs, controlling the two contrasting ecosystem’s carbon responses with its development. Moreover, the contribution of water use efficiency to the magnitude of the V-shape GPP response (64.5 ± 22.4%) is greater than that to the inverted V-shape GPP response (47.6 ± 18.7%). This study identified the two contrasting types of GPP variations during FDEs and their driving mechanisms across multiple ecosystem types which can improve our ability to predict the future effects of more frequent FDEs on ecosystem productivity.</jats:p>",

It was found that the kidneys of animals consuming a highsucrose diet, irrespective of protein content, exhibited the highest increase in the activity of polyol pathway enzymes, namely aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Consumption of a high-sucrose diet enhances the generation of O2 •- in the kidneys by almost twofold, and hydroxyl radical by over fourfold compared to control indicators. This is accompanied by a twofold increase in the content of TBARS-active products and a threefold increase in the content of carbonyl derivatives of proteins, against the background of a decrease in the content of free thiol groups in proteins. The pronounced generation of hydroxyl radicals, accumulation of TBARS-active products, and reduction in the content of free SH-groups in proteins are characteristic of animals that consumed a high-sucrose diet in the context of dietary protein deficiency. It has been demonstrated that excessive sucrose consumption is a critical factor, influencing the activity of enzymes in the polyol pathway and the intensity of free radical processes. The obtained results may be considered as predisposing factors for disruptions in the structural and functional organization of the kidneys under conditions of nutrient imbalance.</jats:p>",

However, the availability of residues for biofuel production is uncertain, because farmers have the option to grow different crops and use the residues for alternative purposes, such as livestock bedding and feed, or leave them in the field to improve soil quality. Taking Canadian wheat straw supply as an example, we develop a dynamic programming model to investigate a farmer's wheat straw supply decision in response to different wheat straw and grain prices. Our model considers crop choices between wheat and canola in the context of disease risk, the trade‐off between the immediate payoffs a farmer may receive from bailing and selling wheat straw, and the long‐term adverse effects that removing wheat straw from the soil surface may have on wheat and canola yields. The results from this study provide insights into how farm‐level supply decisions, in response to wheat straw price changes, affect soil quality dynamics and scale up to regional wheat straw supply for biofuel production. This information also has implications for land use change and the sustainability of feedstock supply for biofuels.</jats:p>",

Runoff threatens in several ways: accelerating erosion, intensifying flooding, and reducing groundwater recharge. Therefore, purposely retaining rainfall in the urban water cycle rather than draining has several positive impacts on designing sustainable cities. This work presents a proposal on how to avoid flooding in cities by systematically harvesting, storing rainwater, and using it for multiple purposes. The concept of RWH presented here has the potential to be a radical innovation to solve the social, economic, and environmental challenges associated with flash flooding. Each residence is regarded as a water production unit. Depending on the climatic conditions, people can meet their water needs on a local household basis, or alternatively use piped water as a complement. By infiltrating rainwater, groundwater is locally recharged and downstream wells are more productive. The implementation of this idea involves entrepreneurial agency that challenges existing structures, rather than adapting to them. Clearly, social entrepreneurship and social innovation are expected to catalyse the realization of this social innovation, also in rural areas. It is about mobilizing ideas, capacities, and resources to create a sustainable social transformation.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to depict the current state of the art of the articles on SC optimization in I4.0 and identify the frontiers and limitations as well as the promising research avenue in this arena. In this study, the systematic literature review methodology combined with the content analysis is adopted to survey the literature between 2013 and 2022. It contributes to the literature by identifying the four OR innovations to typify the recent advances in SC optimization: new modeling conditions, new inputs, new decisions, and new algorithms. Furthermore, we recommend four promising research avenues in this interplay: (1) incorporating new decisions relevant to data-enabled SC decisions, (2) developing data-enabled modeling approaches, (3) preprocessing parameters, and (4) developing data-enabled algorithms. Scholars can take this investigation as a means to ignite collaborative research that tackles the emerging problems in business, whereas practitioners can glean a better understanding of how to employ their OR experts to support digital SC decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the impact of a potential entrant’s entry into the complementary goods market on the technology innovation of the basic product. We focus on an e-commerce platform supply chain comprising a manufacturer, an e-commerce platform, and a potential entrant. The manufacturer distributes a basic product and a complementary product through the e-commerce platform. The manufacturer has the option to improve the quality of the basic product through technology innovation. The determination of whether the potential entrant enters the market for complementary goods is contingent upon its observation of the manufacturer’s technology innovation strategy. Upon the potential entrant’s entry into this market, competition ensues between the potential entrant and the manufacturer in the realm of the complementary goods market. Our findings reveal a trade-off: on the one hand, the manufacturer’s decision to forgo technology innovation results in reduced profit, while, on the other hand, technology innovation attracts the potential competitor to enter the complementary goods market, which also leads to decreased profit. Under certain circumstances, the loss incurred by the former is less than that incurred by the latter. Consequently, the manufacturer may choose to forego technology innovation to prevent the entry of the potential entrant in the complementary goods market. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the entry of the potential entrant can yield a mutually beneficial outcome for the manufacturer, the platform, and the potential entrant, creating a win–win–win scenario. In addition, our results suggest that as the production cost of innovative products rises, the manufacturer may have a stronger incentive to intensify its innovation efforts in response to the potential entrant’s exit from the market. Finally, we establish that our main results remain robust even when some of our initial assumptions are relaxed. </jats:p>",

This paper aims to construct a new model of the power system and investigates the rational regulation and efficient control of electric vehicle battery charging at electric vehicle exchange battery stations in response to the real-time grid-side supply situation. Firstly, a multi-objective optimization strategy is established to meet the day-ahead forecasted swap demand and grid-side supply with the maximization of day-ahead electric vehicle battery swapping station (BSS) revenue in the core. Secondly, considering the variable tariff strategy, a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC) coordinated control system under real-time conditions is constructed with the objective function of maximizing the revenue of BSS and smoothing the load fluctuation of the power system. Then, the day-ahead optimization results are adopted as the reference value for in-day rolling optimization, and the reference value for in-day optimization is dynamically adjusted according to the real-time number of electric car changes and power system demand. Finally, verified by experimental simulation, the results show that the day-ahead-intraday optimization model can increase the economic benefits of BSS and reduce the pressure on the grid to a certain extent, and it can ensure the fast, accurate, and reasonable allocation of batteries in BSS, and realize the flexible, efficient, and reasonable distribution of batteries in BSS.</jats:p>"

There is an urgent need for responsive education and training to address these evolving harms and mitigate new risks. Since 2020, xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, has become increasingly common in the illicit opioid supply, especially alongside fentanyl. Training and technical assistance (TTA) programs employing an adaptive model can quickly disseminate emerging information and provide the tools to respond effectively. We describe our TTA program’s experience developing and delivering virtual instructor-led xylazine training to a diverse group of addiction care professionals. The training objectives included the following: (1) introducing epidemiologic trends, pharmacology, and existing literature related to xylazine; (2) reviewing xylazine-associated harms and management; and (3) discussing harm reduction strategies related to xylazine use. We conducted 14 training sessions between October 2022 and July 2023, which were attended by over 2000 individuals across 49 states. We review our experience developing innovative training content and managing flexible training logistics and highlight our lessons learned, including targeting multidisciplinary professionals, leveraging online synchronous delivery methods, and a need for sustainable funding for TTA programs. </jats:p>",

First, a survey among German companies (production, processing, logistics, wholesale, retail) was conducted to analyze the current temperature monitoring and data management conditions as well as the use of novel monitoring systems, such as Time–Temperature-Indicators (TTIs). Second, the temperature conditions in three different supply chains (B2C for raw pork sausage, B2B for fish, B2C e-commerce for mixed products) were investigated to analyze the applicability of TTIs with an app-based read-out system to identify weak points and to optimize cold chain management under practical conditions. The results of the survey showed that mainly static conditions are tested along the supply chain. Thus, the actors rely mostly on visual inspection or best-before date labeling while TTIs are not widely used. Currently, temperature data are barely exchanged by stakeholders. In the B2C chain, mean temperatures on different pallet levels were comparable, also reflected by TTIs and the app-based read-out system, respectively. In the B2B chain, temperature interruptions during the unloading process were detected, revealing main challenges in perishable supply chains. Temperature monitoring by TTIs on a box level was possible by positioning the label close to the product. Results in the e-commerce sector showed heterogeneous conditions in different boxes depending on initial product temperatures and loading. TTIs and the app-based read-out system showed reliable results based on different temperature scenarios, when TTIs are positioned close to the most sensitive product.</jats:p>",

Therefore, consuming metabolic substrates or limiting access to energy supply can be an effective strategy to impede tumor growth. Herein, a novel treatment paradigm of starving‐like therapy—triple energy‐depleting therapy—is illustrated by glucose oxidase (GOx)/dc‐IR825/sorafenib liposomes (termed GISLs), and such a triple energy‐depleting therapy exhibits a more effective tumor‐killing effect than conventional starvation therapy that only cuts off one of the energy supplies. Specifically, GOx can continuously consume glucose and generate toxic H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the tumor microenvironment (including tumor cells). After endocytosis, dc‐IR825 (a near‐infrared cyanine dye) can precisely target mitochondria and exert photodynamic and photothermal activities upon laser irradiation to destroy mitochondria. The anti‐angiogenesis effect of sorafenib can further block energy and nutrition supply from blood. This work exemplifies a facile and safe method to exhaust the energy in a tumor from three aspects and starve the tumor to death and also highlights the importance of energy depletion in tumor treatment. It is hoped that this work will inspire the development of more advanced platforms that can combine multiple energy depletion therapies to realize more effective tumor treatment.</jats:p>",

Recently, it has been reported that hydrogen peroxide (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) regulates axillary bud development. However, the role of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in trimming-induced tillering in bermudagrass, a kind of turfgrass, remains unclear. Our study unveils the significant impact of trimming on promoting the sprouting and growth of tiller buds in stolon nodes, along with an increase in the number of tillers in the main stem. This effect is accompanied by spatial-temporal changes in cytokinin and sucrose content, as well as relevant gene expression in axillary buds. In addition, the partial trimming of new-born tillers results in an increase in sucrose and starch reserves in their leaves, which can be attributed to the enhanced photosynthesis capacity. Importantly, trimming promotes a rapid H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> burst in the leaves of new-born tillers and axillary stolon buds. Furthermore, exogenous application of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> significantly increases the number of tillers after trimming by affecting the expression of cytokinin-related genes, bolstering photosynthesis potential, energy reserves and antioxidant enzyme activity. Taken together, these results indicate that both endogenous production and exogenous addition of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enhance the inductive effects of trimming on the tillering process in bermudagrass, thus helping boost energy supply and maintain the redox state in newly formed tillers.</jats:p>"

Many customers expect companies to adhere to these sustainable practices to achieve sustainability, not only in the environmental aspect but also in the social aspect as well. The main purpose of the study was to conduct an in-depth analysis on Green Supply Chain Practices (GSCP) and how this environmental sustainability can be achieved through this concept and how Sri Lankan companies embed GSCP into their supply chain to reduce environmental impact. For this, supply chain phases such as procurement, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and reverse logistics were considered when developing the framework for the study. In each of these stages it focuses on how the companies can use GSCP to reduce energy consumption, water usage, reduce waste and emissions of the supply chain. The data were collected from Sri Lankan manufacturing companies by referring to secondary sources. Gathered data were analyzed using the narrative analysis method and furthermore the study findings indicated that there is a positive effect on environmental sustainability by the implementation of GSCP.

An emerging challenge, known as ‘From Emissions to Resources,’ highlights the significant increase in demand for critical raw materials (CRMs) in clean energy technologies. Despite the presence of ample geological reserves, ensuring sustainable access to these materials is crucial for the successful transition to clean energy, taking into account the environmental and social impacts. The commentary centers on four renewable energy technologies namely solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, Li-ion batteries, and water electrolysers. Four pathways for mitigation are quantitatively examined to assess their potential in reducing the vulnerability of the CRM supply chain for these four clean energy technologies: (i) Enhancing material efficiency, (ii) employing substitutivity strategies, (iii) exploring recycling prospects, and (iv) promoting relocalisation initiatives. It is important to note that no single mitigation lever can completely eliminate the risk of CRM supply, rather the accelerated adoption of all four levers is necessary to minimize the CRM supply risk to its absolute minimum. Hence, the study underscores the significance of increased research, innovation, and regulatory initiatives, along with raising social awareness, in effectively addressing the challenges faced by the CRM supply chain and contributing to a sustainable energy transition.</jats:p>",

Major copper-producing countries such as Chile are located in areas with high seismic activity. Earthquakes often cause copper mines to shut down, copper prices to soar, and even mining disasters, affecting the stable supply of global copper. In order to study the impact of earthquakes on the global copper ore supply, information on resource endowments, production, and earthquake data from the past 30 years are collected. This article mainly analyzes (1) the spatial correlation between earthquakes and copper mine projects, and the spatial characteristics of earthquakes’ impact on copper mine production, using correlation analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR); (2) the impact of sudden earthquake events on the export volume and price of copper mines from the perspective of time, using the earthquake index constructed based on the magnitude of the earthquake, the depth of the epicenter, and the distance from the copper mine. The results indicate that the regions with high spatial correlation between copper mine projects and earthquakes are mainly located along the Pacific coast of South and North Americas. Earthquakes can lead to an increase in copper prices, but they will fall significantly in the short term. The impact of earthquakes on export volume generally has a delay period of 1–2 months, resulting in a short-term decrease in export volume. This article quantitatively evaluates the impact of earthquake risk on the supply chain from both spatial and temporal dimensions, providing reference for supply chain risk monitoring, risk impact assessment, and prediction. On the basis of the research results of this article, mineral resource management departments can quantitatively evaluate the spatiotemporal impact of natural risks such as earthquakes on the supply chain, adjust management policies in a timely manner, and improve the level of refined management of supply chain risks.</jats:p>"

Traditionally, highly-connected global food supply system was deemed to help overcome shortages easily in response to food supply shock. However, recent studies suggested that overconnected trade networks potentially increase exposure to external shocks and amplify shocks. Here, we develop an empirical–statistical method to quantitatively and meticulously measure the diversity of international food supply chain. Our results show that boosting a country’s food supply chain diversity will increase the resistance of the country to food shocks. The global diversity of food supply chain increased gradually during 1986–2021; correspondingly, the intensity of food shocks decreased, the recovery speed after a shock increased. The food supply chain diversity in high-income countries is significantly higher than that in other countries, although it has improved greatly in the least developed regions, like Africa and Middle East. International emergencies and geopolitical events like the Russia–Ukraine conflict could potentially threaten global food security and impact low-income countries the most. Our study provides a reference for measuring resilience of national food system, thus helping managers or policymakers mitigate the risk of food supply shocks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the global climate problem becoming increasingly severe, governments have adopted policies to encourage enterprises to invest in low-carbon technologies. However, the opacity of the carbon emission reduction process leads to incomplete consumer trust in low-carbon products as well as higher supply chain transaction costs. Based on this, this paper constructs Stackelberg game models with and without blockchain under different power structures and compares the impact of these models on low-carbon emission reduction decisions. The results show that: (1) blockchain does not necessarily improve enterprise profits and can only help enterprises maintain optimal profits within a certain range when the carbon emission cost is low; (2) when consumers’ environmental awareness is high, the blockchain can incentivize manufacturers to enhance carbon emission reduction, and it has an obvious promotional effect on retailers’ profits; and (3) the profit gap between enterprises in the supply chain is larger under different power structures, and the implementation of blockchain can coordinate profit distribution and narrow the gap between enterprises. Compared with the manufacturer-dominated model, the emission reduction in products is maximized under the retailer-dominated model. Our study provides theoretical support for the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as well as for the optimization of enterprises’ decision-making supported by blockchain.</jats:p>"

Climate change is expected to exacerbate this challenge, increasing the need for long‐term planning. Long‐term projections of water supply and demand that can aid planning are mostly published as agency reports, which are directly relevant to decision‐making but less likely to inform future research. We present 20‐year water supply and demand projections for the Columbia River, produced in partnership with the Washington State Dept. of Ecology. This effort includes integrated modeling of future surface water supply and agricultural demand by 2040 and analyses of future groundwater trends, residential demand, instream flow deficits, and curtailment. We found that shifting timing in water supply could leave many eastern Washington watersheds unable to meet late‐season out‐of‐stream demands. Increasing agricultural or residential demands in watersheds could exacerbate these late‐season vulnerabilities, and curtailments could become more common for rivers with federal or state instream flow rules. Groundwater trends are mostly declining, leaving watersheds more vulnerable to surface water supply or demand changes. Both our modeling framework and agency partnership can serve as an example for other long‐term efforts that aim to provide insights for water management in a changing climate elsewhere around the world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent days, supply chain and logistic industries have been going through a transformational wave of automation and digitization. Supply chain management (SCM) can involve machine learning (ML) abilities and prediction models to ensure that the demands are satisfied at a minimum cost. Intelligent models can be developed to determine whether adequate inventory is accessible to encounter the predictable rise in demands, and if not, the system spontaneously begins to adjust the orders with suppliers to source the raw materials for resolving the predicted future high demand. The conventional ways of SCM can be replaced by the design of recent artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By this motivation, this research presents a tree seed algorithm-based feature selection with optimum DL technique for supply chain management (TSA-ODLSCM). The proposed TSA-ODLSCM model involves the design of a feature subset selection approach using a tree search algorithm (TSA) algorithm. Besides, a new convolutional neural network with fuzzy cognitive maps (CNN-FCM) technique is designed for the classification process. Moreover, optimal parameter tuning of the CNN-FCM model was performed using the Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) technique. To exhibit the improved performance of the TSA-ODLSCM approach, a huge range of simulations were executed and outcomes were examined below several aspects. The experimental validation reported an enhanced 96.52% outcome of the TSA-ODLSCM approach over other methods. </jats:p>",

However, the spatial mismatch between the supply and demand of WESs is often overlooked, resulting in a lack of targeted decision-making. At the grid scale, while preserving both natural and social attributes, this study quantitatively analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in the supply and demand of WESs in the Southern River Basin from 2000 to 2020. Ecological zoning was performed based on the temporal changes in WESs supply and demand. The OPGD model was used to investigate the impacts of socio-economic and natural factors on different WESs supply factors and further explore the spatial correlation of WESs supply and demand changes in different zones. The results show that there is significant spatial heterogeneity in the changes in WESs supply and demand. Economic belts and megacities have experienced remarkable changes, with WESs supply decreasing and WESs demand increasing. WESs demand changes significantly affect WESs supply changes. The supply of WESs in all zones is influenced by WESs demand. In the high supply–low demand zone, WY has the highest explanatory power for WESs demand changes. From the high supply–middle demand zone to the low supply–middle demand zone and then to the high supply–high demand zone, the explanatory power of PE for WESs demand changes gradually increases. As WESs demand starts from the middle level, HAI gradually dominates WESs demand changes. The increase in land use changes may promote the impact of WESs demand changes on WESs supply changes. This study contributes to incorporating the supply and demand changes of WESs and their correlations into the ecological protection and restoration system, providing a new perspective and method for regional sustainable management.</jats:p>"

The result shows that (1) the coefficient for water expenditure has been examined as low.

In this context, Social Network Analysis (SNA) has proven valuable in analyzing how actors in a network connect and create interdependencies.

Methods: The aim of this study is to clarify the role and contribution of SNA when characterizing and understanding the challenges of contemporary supply chains. A literature review was conducted to achieve this. Results: The results reveal that SNA has been applied in a wide variety of areas (e.g., manufacturing and construction sectors), with an emerging application in the tertiary sector. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that metrics related to the network and to nodes have been used repeatedly, highlighting the need for new supply-chain-related metrics, such as the novel concept of semi-directedness. Conclusions: Despite the versatility of SNA, some aspects may limit its application to supply chain management, including shortcomings in data acquisition and the fact that SNA only allows for the visualization of network configurations, thus preventing the capture of nuances that characterize the relationships between the actors involved.</jats:p>"

Hiding by living plants is the most perspective way with positive side effects: thermal insulation, passive air-conditioning, solar radiation control, urban heat island prevention, air cleaning and sanitation, carbon sequestration, noise absorption, better rainwater management, increasing biodiversity, etc. The approach is shown in an example of a bank at the historical centre of Byczyna, Poland. As the building is too large, using a context collage is proposed to show the results. The fears of damage to the structures by fungi and attraction of biting insects are debunked using three ways – analysis of the facing state under the greening, estimation of the critical air state around the greening, and by field studies of the relative humidity under the greening. CFD simulation shows a significant heat insulation effect of the greening in the heating period. The problem of penetration of moustaches into the facing can be solved by winding the ampeleous plants on a wooden lathing or a grid.</jats:p>",

According to the research, import tariffs have a positive correlation with retailers’ retail prices and a negative correlation with manufacturers’ direct prices, wholesale prices, demand and profit from direct channels, and profit from retail channels. The export tax rebate policy will lessen the negative effects of import tariffs and maximize the best choices made by manufacturers and retailers.</jats:p>"

Analyses were conducted separately for each strategy, comparing groups assigned and not assigned the test strategy.

Replacing regular salt with salt substitute reduced mean systolic blood pressure by 7.14 (95% CI, 3.79-10.48) mm Hg, hypertension prevalence by 5.09 (95% CI, 0.37-9.80) percentage points, and cumulative MACEs by 2.27 (95% CI, 0.09-4.45) percentage points. At the end of the 2-year intervention, the mean cost was $25.95 less for the salt substitute group than the regular salt group due to substantial savings in health care costs for MACEs (mean [SD], $72.88 [$9.11] vs $111.18 [$13.90], respectively). Sensitivity analysis showed robust cost savings. By contrast, the salt restriction strategy did not show significant results. If the salt substitution strategy were rolled out to all eldercare facilities in China, 48 101 MACEs and 107 857 hypertension cases were estimated to be averted and $54 982 278 saved in the first 2 years.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions and Relevance</jats:title><jats:p>The findings of this cluster randomized clinical trial indicate that salt substitution may be a cost-saving strategy for hypertension control and cardiovascular disease prevention for residents of eldercare facilities in China.

The study proposes a type-2 fuzzy chance-constrained ordered multi-objective fractional programming (T2FCC-ORMOFP) model to address the allocation of water under uncertainties. The model incorporates type-2 fuzzy programming and chance-constrained programming into an overall framework to handle multiple uncertainties under multi-level and multi-objective conflicts, while using fractional programming to reflect the marginal benefits of the system. It prioritizes the principles of optimal, fair, and stable distribution by the upper-level governing authorities, while considering the social and economic environmental benefits of lower-level decision-making. The optimal water allocation scenarios were obtained under different hydrological guarantee rates, violation levels of water supply constraints, and net economic benefits of type-2 fuzzy numbers for 2030. Additionally, groundwater is replaced by reclaimed water in varying proportions for flexible water supply. The results show that the water demand in Taiyuan cannot be ignored, and the risk of water shortage is more sensitive for the agricultural and industrial sectors. The recycled water substitution strategy can optimize the water supply structure and improve social and economic benefits (9–12%). Also T2FCC-ORMOFP can improve overall efficiency (20%) compared with a single-level model.</jats:p>",

However, some models do not take into account the effects of inappropriate sub-models on the combination models. Based on this, a medium-and long-term runoff integrated forecasting method based on optimal sub-models selection was proposed. First, the sub-models, including linear regression (MLR), BP neural network (BPNN), wavelet neural network (WNN), and support vector regression (SVR), are optimally selected based on the nearness degree. Second, ridge regression (RR) is used to combine the optimal sub-models to predict runoff. Finally, the Guandi hydropower station is taken as an example to verify the effect of the integrated forecasting model. The results show that SVR, BPNN, and WNN are the optimal sub-models, and RR-3 is the optimal integrated forecasting model composed of the optimal sub-models. In addition, compared with the other two combination models, the RR-3 performs better.</jats:p>",
