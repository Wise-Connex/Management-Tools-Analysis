This has resulted in the need for an instrument to measure managers' oral communication capabilities. The main objectives of this paper are to identify the dimensions of the oral communication capability and to develop an instrument to measure this capability. To achieve these goals, a survey was conducted among German and Spanish buyers and supply managers. The results indicate that the oral communication capability construct has a second‐order structure with three dimensions: the ability to pass on information, the ability to persuade and the ability to listen and understand. Based on these results, the Oral Communication Capability Self‐test (OCCS) was developed. This study also investigates the typology of purchasing managers based on their oral communication capabilities.</jats:p>",

The latest survey complements two earlier studies in 1987 and 1995. All three surveys counted at least 280 responding large North American supply organizations, thereby providing a valuable opportunity to examine trends and changes over time. Major areas of investigation for respondents in both the manufacturing and services sectors include supply organizational structure, supply chain responsibilities, and chief purchasing officer (CPO) reporting line, title and background. This research provides solid evidence that in both manufacturing and services, today's CPOs have greater responsibilities, report higher in the organization and carry more significant titles than their predecessors. The conclusion is that, at least in large North American companies, supply has grown substantially in corporate status and influence since 1987, a particularly welcome discovery.</jats:p>",

Of great concern is the plight of the urban poor whose numbers are increasing rapidly across the developing world. Currently, a more market-like approach is being promoted as the way forward in the water sector. This approach is seen as an effective way of being demand responsive and hence a useful way of providing a sustainable water supply service for all groups of consumers. The authors advocate that a prerequisite for effectively using a marketing approach is a good understanding of the behaviour of the target consumers, that is, knowing what consumers think, feel, do and the things and places that influence and are influenced by what they think, feel and do. Consumer behaviour studies have widespread application in the marketing of goods and services and the application of some of these concepts could be useful in improving water services delivery. Better understanding of consumer behaviour could help in developing strategies for successfully marketing water as both a social and an economic good, thus enhancing the sustainability of water supply services.</jats:p>",

However, available extensions to the stochastic case cannot be readily used to obtain an optimal operating policy in practice because the uncertainty results in an explosion of the scenarios to be considered over an extended time horizon. In this article we represent the uncertainty through Markov chains and use an approach based on stochastic dynamic programming (DP), which can generate a dynamic operating policy that incorporates information about the uncertainty in the problem at each time step. DP is computationally infeasible because of the size of the state and action space for realistic problems. We propose a novel stochastic optimization algorithmic framework called “DP in a heuristically restricted state space.” The confined state space is generated by simulating various potential scenarios under centralized dynamic inventory and production policy generated by combining static local inventory policy heuristics. The resulting DP policy responds to the time‐varying demand for products by appropriately stitching together decisions made by the local static policies. This is a new formulation for effectively combining heuristic policies. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006</jats:p>",

Through numerical tests, we demonstrate that our method is superior, both for performance estimation and for policy parameter optimization. Using this technique, we then perform experiments that address the following issues. What proportion of the optimal total inventory should managers allocate to upstream production stages to minimize the sum of inventory and backorder costs? If managerial action could lower holding cost rate or add capacity, which stages of the supply system should be targeted for maximum net benefit? Such concerns have been the subject of several recent studies relating to supply networks with constant and random independent lead times.

Aiming to find the solution to such a severe challenge, this paper investigates Beijing's current and future water resources availability and water-use configurations, as well as past and current effort on both areas of water supply and demand. The analysis shows a continuously growing demand for water and an aggravating deficit of traditionally available water resources. The paper concludes that it is necessary to establish well-structured water-use data and employ more advanced forecasting methods if sound future decisions regarding water balance are expected to be made. In order to realize Beijing Municipality's full urban water conservation potential, it is suggested that a comprehensive and integrated long-term conservation program be implemented, which is technically feasible and economically justified, to conserve water consistently for many years.</jats:p>",

We model a retail fixed markup (RFM) policy, which can arise as a form of vertically restrictive pricing in a supply chain, and we examine its effect on supply chain performance. We prove the existence of the optimal pricing and replenishment policies when demand has a linear additive form and the distribution of the uncertainty component has a nondecreasing failure rate. We numerically compare the relative performance of RFM to a price‐only contract and we find that RFM results in greater profit for the supply chain than the price‐only contract in a variety of scenarios. We find that RFM can lead to Pareto‐improving solutions where both the supplier and the retailer earn more profit than under a price‐only contract. Finally, we compare RFM to a buyback contract and explore the implications of allowing the fixed markup parameter to be endogenous to the model. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Prior to 18 April 1906 the San Francisco Fire Department and knowledgeable persons in the insurance industry regarded a conflagration in San Francisco as inevitable. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and ensuing fire is the greatest single fire loss in U.S. history, with 492 city blocks destroyed and life loss now estimated at more than 3,000. This paper describes fire protection practices in the United States prior to 1906; the conditions in San Francisco on the eve of the disaster; ignitions, spread, and convergence of fires that generated the 1906 conflagration; and damage to the water supply system in 1906 that gave impetus to construction of the largest high-pressure water distribution network ever built—San Francisco's Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS). In the 1980s hydraulic network and fire simulation modeling identified weaknesses in the fire protection of San Francisco—problems mitigated by an innovative Portable Water Supply System (PWSS), which transports water long distances and helped extinguish the Marina fire during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The AWSS and PWSS concepts have been extended to other communities and provide many lessons, paramount of which is that communities need to develop an integrated disaster preparedness and response capability and be constantly vigilant in maintaining that capability. This lesson is especially relevant to highly seismic regions with large wood building inventories such as the western United States and Japan, which are at great risk of conflagration following an earthquake. </jats:p>",

In some particular industries (i.e., music), the Internet has also provided consumers with unprecedented opportunities to consider retail offers involving physical goods (i.e., CDs) alongside specialized services. As shown in this paper, these circumstances have important implications for the design and management of customer relationships. These circumstances also permeate relationships across retail and wholesale echelons in music supply chains. In particular, an empirical analysis shows that online consumer access to information on CD retail markups compels retailers to market a level of service quality that is consistent with that markup information. However, limitations in consumer access to markup data, available only to wholesalers and to Internet retailers, allow retailers to inversely link their markups to the fulfillment service quality offered to consumers with wholesaler support.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Mapping of dunes in the field and using air photographs shows a range of forms reflecting dominant northwest and westerly onshore wind regimes. Planting of maritime pine forests in the thirteenth and twentieth centuries was initiated because of sand invasion causing problems for human settlement and agriculture. Early Holocene dunes have a well-developed podsol and date to 9.7 and 8.2 ka, suggesting at least some of these sands may have been emplaced during a global cooling event. Significant transgressive dune accretion at 2.2 and 1.5 ka, implies abundant sand supply and strong onshore winds The most recent dune-building period dates to AD 1770-1905 and coincides with a predominantly negative winter North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAOi). Accretion of dunes along the Portuguese coast appears out of phase with dune development in southwest France, which may reflect different Atlantic storm tracks driven by changes in the dominance and state of the NAOi. </jats:p>",

Particle size analysis of hillslope sediments trapped during transport suggests sediment calibre is controlled primarily by sediment source. Freeze–thaw and rainfall processes impart a weak but recognizable size sorting signature on the trapped sediments. However, these variations are less significant in determining sediment supply to the basal fan, than those operating in the channel system. Channel sediment movement is strongly influenced by storm events, the type of flow process (debris flow or fluvial flow), the sediment characteristics, and the local channel topography. The importance of the channel–fan coupling is clearly demonstrated in that more than 90 per cent of fan sedimentation is derived from channel sediment sources.

We hypothesize that SID, operating in the form of mutual cross‐specialty referral, will cause earnings to increase with total physician density (all specialties taken together), but simultaneously, decrease with increasing competition within specialties. We used multiple regression analyses controlling for high‐user population, physician demographics and practice type. The evidence supports our hypotheses. Increasing total physician density (all specialties) is positively associated with earnings. Concurrently, within specialties, increased competition is associated with reduced earnings. The medical appropriateness of increasing health care utilization with increasing physician supply cannot be directly determined from the data. However, evidence of a steady earnings increase with increasing total physician density, which precludes a saturation point (of appropriate care levels) at some optimum physician density, substantiates SID in the office‐based practice market. Empirically, our data suggest that the average market effect of physicians on one another is synergic when all specialties are considered together, but competitive within each specialty.

The topography, altitude and orientation are some of the factors that determined the selection of the site. It was identified that the southwest of the region in the kingdom was the most suitable location for the fog‐collection process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of fog water collection and the site, three identical standard fog collectors (SFCs) with two different local collection materials were designed and manufactured. Experiments were conducted at two different locations in the area close to Abha, namely Soodha. The maximum amount of water collected was 22.9 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in a day and 7.25 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in a 2‐h period. It was found that there was a high probability of fog when the relative humidity was higher than 95%. The results from the chemical analyses of eight sets of fog water samples collected were compared with World Health Organization drinking water standards. It was found that the level of heavy metals was negligible and the level of Fe was marginally high for the first flush only. The study indicates that in terms of both quality and magnitude of yield, fog is a viable source of water and can be successfully used to supplement water supplies in the fog‐prone regions of the kingdom.</jats:p>",

This industry’s dramatic growth has tended to mask its high degree of volatility, which may be more useful in understanding employers’ motivations for hiring temporary employees. This article examines alternative explanations for the volatility of employment in the temporary supply industry from 1972 to 2000. Using a seemingly unrelated time‐series estimator, we compare the volatility of temporary employment to that of regular full‐time employment. We find that quarterly changes in temporary employment are more sensitive to the business cycle than regular full‐time employment are and argue that temporary employment is likely to have a number of disadvantages as a reemployment strategy during a recession, since temporary employment typically declines during that time. Additionally, employment growth during this period is better explained by employers’ efforts to achieve numerical rather than wage flexibility.</jats:p>",

In this article, thorough analyses are made to the equivalent circuits in each stage of the short circuit transient process of Cockcroft-Walton circuit. The results indicate that in this process, significant overcurrent only occurs in the rectifiers situated in the locations of the highest and lowest potentials of the voltage multiplier, but there is no significant overvoltage in any component. In order to quantitatively estimate the most possible maximum ∫0∞i2(t)dt value of the rectifiers corresponding to a certain protective resistance, a simplified equivalent circuit based on some reasonable assumptions is given and some formulas, which may enough be reasonably used as a basis of quantitative estimation in engineering design, are deducted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses on the price difference between depositary receipts (DRs) and the underlying securities issued by Taiwanese firms under foreign ownership restrictions. We examine two issues: (1) the price relationships between DRs and their underlying securities, and (2) the determinants of the price differences between DRs and their underlying securities. </jats:p><jats:p> The empirical results show that large daily price differences are observed between DRs and their underlying Taiwanese securities. However, these price differences do not exist for DRs traded in different free-entry countries. We examine the determinants of the price differences between DRs and their underlying securities, and find that the time-series qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) surplus, defined as the QFII ownership limit ratio minus the actual QFII ownership ratio, is inversely associated with the DR premium. As the foreign ownership restrictions become tighter, the QFII surplus decreases and the DR premium increases. </jats:p><jats:p> The results also indicate that a structural change in the relationships between DR premiums and investor sentiment variables occurred in 1997. The DR premiums are sensitive to non-QFII holdings, defined as the total foreign holdings minus the QFII holdings, before 1997. However, post 1997 the DR premiums become more sensitive to firm size, but less sensitive to non-QFII holdings post 1997. The change in demand caused by regulation and investor sentiment is reflected in DR prices, which leads to the variations in DR premiums. Furthermore, this study finds a supply-side effect on DR premiums. As firms increase DRs issues, the DR premiums become smaller. This study concludes that regulation, investor sentiment (both can be viewed as demand for DRs), and supply conditions explain the DR premiums. </jats:p>",

In a short‐term feeding experiment, glutamine or<jats:italic>trans‐</jats:italic>zeatin riboside (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>ZR) was added directly to the nutrient solution. NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>net uptake declined significantly in response to both treatments. Feeding with glutamine brought about an increase in concentrations of different amino compounds in the roots (glutamine, glutamate, alanine,<jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>‐amino butyric acid (GABA) and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, which negatively correlated with the net NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>uptake. The plants showed a reduction of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1 (GS1) transcript level in the roots. In addition, glutamine feeding changed the root‐to‐shoot distribution on N assimilation in favour of the leaves and plant internal N cycling.<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>ZR treatment resulted in expansion of zeatin‐type (Z‐type) cytokinins in the roots and increased nitrate reductase (NR)–mRNA level. The results indicate that both particular amino acids and active cytokinins are involved in the feedback regulation of N uptake and metabolism in poplar. We propose that inhibition of N uptake by cytokinins in poplar is more complex than that mediated by amino compounds, and other effectors are involved in this regulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the fluoride concentration in the public water supply and the prevalence of dental fluorosis in schoolchildren between 7 and 15 years old, living in a peripheral district of the municipality of Bauru. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this, fifty two water samples were collected on three different days of one week. These samples were analyzed for fluoride by means of the ion-sensitive electrode method (Orion 9609) coupled to a potentiometer (Procyon, model 720). In this method, 1.0 mL of TISAB II (Orion) was added to 1.0 mL of the sample. For the epidemiological survey of fluorosis, 52 schoolchildren of both genders, aged between 7 and 15 were assessed, with prior authorization from their caretakers. Only one person examined the children, after supervised toothbrushing and drying with cotton wool rolls. The TF index was used. RESULTS: The fluoride concentrations in the water samples ranged from 0.62 to 1.20 mg/L, with a mean of 0.9 mg/L. The prevalence of dental fluorosis was 33%, with severity ranging from TF1 to TF4 (Kappa of 0.73 and concordance of 83.33%). CONCLUSIONS: The results from the analysis of water samples indicated a fluoride concentration greater than recommended for Bauru. The fluorosis levels found were higher than expected for a peripheral district, in which water is one of the few sources of fluoride.</jats:p>",
