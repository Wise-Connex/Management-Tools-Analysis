Endogenous elements of National Forest supply include establishment of the appraised price, bid price, volumes sold and unsold, the uncut volume under contract, volumes harvested, and harvest price. Components of the model describe the distribution of volumes sold and harvested by bid price and contract duration classes. Estimation results for bid price relations in several western regions indicate that prices bid for stumpage depend on a short (one-year) distributed lag in product prices and production costs. Application of the full model in the Douglas-fir region suggests that short-term National Forest supply may be more elastic with respect to harvest price than industrial private supply. Model simulations track actual behavior in the Douglas-fir region stumpage market with reasonable accuracy over the period of extreme price and volume movements during 1977-1985. Model projections also appear reasonable and internally consistent in a projection to the year 2000 under a less volatile product market scenario. For. Sci. 35(2):401-424.</jats:p>",

A number of afforested water‐supply catchments have been monitored since 1984 with the aim of identifying trends in water quality, and the results indicate increases in colour, turbidity, acidity and aluminium in supplies after activities such as access road construction, ploughing and draining. Evidence is presented of the continued leaching of phosphate more than six years after the application of fertilizer.</jats:p><jats:p>To enable improved advance consultation and planning to protect public water supplies, there is a requirement to be able to indicate the likely sensitivity of individual supplies to the various effects of afforestation.</jats:p><jats:p>The Region is committed to a substantial ten‐year capital expenditure programme to upgrade water‐treatment works to comply with the recent European Community (EC) water‐supply standards imposed in 1985.

The indices were matched for all districts, where adequate data were available, and a strong correlation was noted. The water quality index was divided into categories (A,B,C) and it was observed that these were generally dependent upon the water supply service levels.

In these 36 patients, we compared the presence of a collateral blood supply during the early phase with the extent of final parenchymal brain damage obtained by computed tomography 3 months after the event. The presence of a collateral circulation during the first few hours after the stroke reduced the size of the final parenchymal brain damage in patients with middle cerebral artery stem-trunk occlusion. The collateral blood supply was more efficient in patients who had no significant stenosing lesions of the extracranial internal carotid artery. Our data confirm that the lenticulostriate arteries are end arteries not supplied by collateral blood vessels and suggest that lesions formerly thought to be caused by hemodynamic mechanisms (watershed infarcts) or arteriolar lesions (lacunar infarcts) may be due to middle cerebral artery occlusions.</jats:p>",

We find not only that the number of new certificants was sensitive to the demand for classroom teachers but also that certificants’ choices of subject field were sensitive to demand.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the second half of 1986 the impact of the improvement of water supply and excreta disposal facilities on diarrheal diseases and intestinal parasitosis was studied in 254 children up to six years of age from two favelas (shanty towns) of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The estimated incidence of diarrhea was 6.2 episodes/child year and the estimated period prevalence reached 31.0 episode days/ child/ year. The point prevalence of parasitosis was 70.7% (Ascaris lumbricoides: 55.4%, Trichuris trichiura: 19.6%, Giardia lamblia: 17.9%). The estimated prevalence of diarrhea decreased with improvement of water supply and sanitation facilities to 45% and 44% respectively, but no statistically significant impact was observed in the case of parasitosis. School education and weaning practice were found to be other important determinants of diarrhea.</jats:p>",
