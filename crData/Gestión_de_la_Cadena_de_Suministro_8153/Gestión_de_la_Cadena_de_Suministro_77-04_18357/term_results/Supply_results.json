This, however, is not realistic if we are to maintain our current standard of living. Historically, the United States has experienced about a 4% annual increase in energy consumption. Even with very significant conservation efforts, and we must practice conservation of our known resources by directing them to the best and most efficient uses, we feel that the growth rate should be a little less than 3% annually during the next decade or two. Zero growth in energy equals zero growth in economic activity.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The energy crisis is in large measure a political crisis. Our country has potentially political crisis. Our country has potentially enough energy in various forms to meet all its needs for heating homes, running factories and providing transportation. But the energy industry, instead of being encouraged to develop these sources, has had to contend with ever increasing restrictions and obstacles.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The long-term gas supply future will depend upon how fast we are able to move on a synthetic gas industry. If we don't, there isn't much of a future. By long-term future we mean the year 200 and beyond. In the interim, however, our only alternative is new natural gas from Lower 48, gas from Alaska and imported natural gas in the from of LNG.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Good morning. I'm very happy to be here today and to meet you at this very critical juncture in the development of our nation's energy capability. As you know, many of us in the gas industry, for several years, have been warning that a cold winter would bring our growing supply problems into sharp focus. Well, we got somewhat more than we bargained for during the past few months but, at last, we did get the nation's attention. And next week we will see how the President proposes to solve our very serious problems.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>I'm also rather pleased that this winter has put storage in the spotlight for a change. Much of my career at Natural Gas Pipeline Company was spent in the Storage Department and I sometimes felt we were just a little left out of things during most of the year. You might say we sat on the bench during the summer, waiting to be called into action to help out the transmission people when the first cold snap arrived. Well, this winger, storage has been the star player on the team.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It is shown that because of the treatment of personal interest receipts and payments under the progressive U.S. individual income tax, there is reason for low-income persons to prefer bond-financed tax postponement, while higher-income persons have reason to oppose government borrowing. Since the income level separating the groups with opposing preferences depends on both interest rate ratios and the income tax rate structure, it is possible to predict the effect of tax reforms, inflation, and political reforms upon the quantity of government borrowing and the interest rates which apply to it. </jats:p>",

The supply of active medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathy (DOs) as well as active post-graduate MDs and DOs in the U.S. is projected to increase by approximately 50 percent in the decade ending in 1985. The number of active physicians per 100,000 population is similarly expected to increase by approximately one-third. The production of surgical specialists, in particular, appears to be excessive. In response, the average length of physician graduate training programs is anticipated to be shortened as more MD and DO graduates enter shorter, general practice residencies. The authors expect that the effects of this projected increase in the supply of physicians may relieve geographic disparities in physician distribution, rationalize the organization of medical practice, and reduce physicians' incomes relative to other professional groups and possibly in absolute terms. The projected increases in the supply of physicians will give the federal government much more flexibility and bargaining power should it choose to implement a national health insurance program with salaried physicians.</jats:p>",

In the absence of overland flow the most important process of sediment supply is splash erosion. This is confined to areas of exposed mineral soil produced mainly by the burrowing activity of animals. The amount of splash erosion reflects not only burrowing but also the yearly cycle of litter‐fall and decay. The concentration of suspended material in the catchment river is not related to the discharge but in most cases to rainfall intensity. Turbidity measurements made at 1‐minute intervals showed a considerable degree of detail which illustrated the role of splash in supplying sediment to the river, although other processes can be important. The difficulty of estimating the output of material from a small catchment by means of a simple rating curve is stressed as is the need to consider slope and sediment supply processes in an ecological context.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summaey</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of several detillering treatments on dry-matter production and grain yield in barley were investigated in a series of pot experiments using two water regimes. When ample water was provided, even quite severe reductions in the number of tillers only slightly reduced grain yield in spite of large effects on total shoot dry weight. When all the plants were grown with the same amount of water, however, the plants with few tillers tended to have greater grain yield, higher water use efficiency (in terms of grain yield) and higher harvest index than the plants permitted to tiller freely. This effect was probably related to the greater transpiration rates from the freely tillering plants which led to their suffering a greater degree of water stress than the plants with few tillers. This led to the freely tillering plants having a greater proportion of sterile ears and a lower harvest index. Water stress apparently had no effect on the grain yield of the main shoot or first tiller. It is concluded that genotypes which produce few large tillers having a high rate of survival should be able to achieve relatively high yields in drought conditions without sacrificing yield potential under optimal conditions.</jats:p>",

This paper reports the results of a study of the loan demand during six weeks in March/April 1977. Of the requests received during that period 77% arrived through the post and 23% by telex. Although most requests were for English language material only half were for British items. Of these 56% were for monographs and about a third were for humanities material (compared with a figure of only 11% of total demand on the Division). Most requests (73%) came from Europe, especially Scandinavia, and in this respect the distribution is quite different from the overseas photocopy demand, of which less than 50% comes from Europe. 51% of all requests are satisfied from stock, with a further 20% being passed to other libraries in the UK. The figures are 50% and 33% for British publications, where the Division is under more of an obligation to search throughout the country.</jats:p>",
