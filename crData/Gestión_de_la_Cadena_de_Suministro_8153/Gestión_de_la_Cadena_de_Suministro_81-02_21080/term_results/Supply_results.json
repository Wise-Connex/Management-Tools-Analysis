Those theories, however, do not enable certain important political issues to be elucidated, in particular the relationship between produce price and land price. A different approach is therefore suggested, which considers the supply of land to consist of a supply of stocks of land differentiated by fertility, location, etc., the production function for an industry being different for each type of land used. By using the conventional tools of neo-classical analysis, the relationships between land price, product price, and the intensity of land use are derived, also the effect on land and product prices of competition for land between different industries. </jats:p>",

The decrease in size in S. vittatum between 20 and 15 °C and 25 and 20 °C was not proportional, with the decrease in size being very much larger with a temperature increase from 20 to 25 °C. This was reflected in the fecundity of the autogenous females. The changes in development times were, however, almost proportional. With S. verecundum size changes approached a proportional change but the development times did not, being markedly elongated at 15 °C. Therefore the nature of the effect of temperature changes can not be predicted from one species of simuliid to another. An examination of growth in relation to quantity of food availability and temperature indicated that the quantity of food required for maximum growth increased exponentially with increasing temperature. </jats:p>",

Lengthening of the basal layer and the capillaries showed high positive correlations with thickening of the cell layer. Lengthening of the capillaries exceeded the lengthening of the basal layer and the thickening of the epithelium but fell short of the increased anabolic performance of the epithelium as quantitated in previous investigations.</jats:p>",
