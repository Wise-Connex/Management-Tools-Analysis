The vibration stopped when the valve bypass was opened or full seal pressure was applied. Theory indicates that intermittent valve leakage and corresponding oscillating penstock pressure can be self-sustaining in some instances, and that opening a bypass around the leaking valve can suppress them. Field tests were performed to confirm the general theory and prove the reliability of utilizing the bypass to prevent future vibration.</jats:p>",
