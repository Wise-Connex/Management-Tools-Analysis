In the first section the conventional neoclassical paradigm is augmented by consideration of the agency relationship in which the physician is considered not only as the agent who controls the supply of health care, but also as the decision maker who articulates demand because patients forego this role and rely on “expert” advice. The next section is concerned with the effects of pricing on consumer demand and draws on the available empirical evidence to present estimates of price elasticity, cross elasticity, and other characteristics of the choice process. This analysis is completed by integrating the agency relationship into the discussion and arguing that if the policy objectives are expenditure containment and greater efficiency in resource utilization, the price mechanism should be used to affect the behavior of the primary demander and the supplier: the physician. In the final section the implications of this analysis are discussed in the contexts of two competing perspectives: the liberal market perspective and the collective “needology” perspective, and an attempt is made to distinguish some of the characteristics of the two views of the world. </jats:p>",

The testicular artery originates from the abdominal aorta just cranial to its bifurcation and forms compact coils and reveals a tortuous course in the region of the pampiniform plexus and along the attached border. The artery divides at the caudal extremity of the testis into 2–4 branches. The epididymal artery, which is a branch of the testicular artery, was seen to anastomose with the deferential artery, but no anastomosis occurs between these arteries and the testicular artery. The convoluted part of the testicular artery was 20 cm in length, but when unravelled totalled 240 cm. This is not affected by seasonal variations. The possible significance of these results was discussed and compared with similar findings of other mammals.</jats:p>"

Copper concentration in whole grain increased markedly with copper level but differed little with nitrogen level. The dry weight and copper content of the embryo expressed as a proportion of the whole grain varied little among treatments, so that copper concentration in the embryo responded to treatment in a similar way to copper concentration in the whole grain. Copper concentrations in the embryo were at least 2.5 times as high as in the endosperm or whole grain at all levels of copper and nitrogen. It is suggested that where copper deficiency decreases grain number without decreasing the weight of individual grains the copper concentration in the mature whole grain, or in the embryo, is not causally related to grain development, and may be a poor indicator of the potential response of grain yield to copper application.</jats:p>"

In particular, the placental and fetal plasma lipids displayed a 3-fold higher oleic acid/stearic acid ratio and contained a significantly higher proportion of arachidonic acid than the maternal unesterified fatty acids. These differences correlated well with the high Δ9- and &amp;#9653;6-desaturase activities, respectively, shown to be present in sheep placental tissue &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The levels of these enzymes in placental tissue contrasted with the relatively low desaturase activities found to be present in adult and neonatal sheep liver and in the placentas of other, non-ruminant, species. The possible role of such high levels of desaturase activity in the sheep placenta is discussed in relation to the particularly poor essential fatty acid status imposed upon the fetal ruminant.</jats:p>"

Infusion of threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine and arginine (designated group 2) resulted in significant increases in uptake of all these amino acids. Group 1 amino acid uptake was not significantly affected. Infusion of all the essential amino acids (i.e. groups 1 and 2 together) resulted in significant increases in all their uptakes. Using as index ‘the predicted rate of protein synthesis’, infusion of group 1 and 2 together led to an apparent 27% increase in protein synthesis.
