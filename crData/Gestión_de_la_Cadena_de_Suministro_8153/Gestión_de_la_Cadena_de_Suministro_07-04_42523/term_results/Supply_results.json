The purpose of this article is to describe and conceptualise how a firm initiates the development of a supply network, and how the structure of the firm's supply network and supply base change over time as a consequence of the type and duration of initiative taken?</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Empirically, the article is based on a longitudinal, single case study, which is real‐time, theory‐led and contextual. The case study concerns the efforts of a main contractor (within the construction industry) who changed its sourcing strategy, initiated the development of a supply network, and restructured part of its supply base. Theoretically, the article reviews both supply base and supply network management literature, highlights important issues related to both concepts, and discusses similarities and differences between them.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>It is possible to discern between supply network initiatives of more permanent versus more temporary character. Supply network initiatives of a more permanent character comprise the establishment of, for example, organisational structures, functions, manuals and (explicit) routines aimed at continually supporting the maintenance of the supply network. Supply network initiatives of a more temporary character are organised as projects and aim to set in motion a process that may result in the creation of a supply network which develops over time without institutionalised network support structures. A single temporary supply network initiative is useful to consider in relation to the pre‐initiative stage, the ongoing initiative stage and the post‐initiative stage of the initiative. Furthermore, supply networks may be managed through an emergent series of temporary supply network initiatives aimed at supporting the supply network as it emerges over time in a changing context.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Managers may benefit from considering whether a supply network initiative is of a more permanent or a more temporary nature. If it is of a more temporary character, managers may consider analysing the initiative in its pre‐initiative, ongoing initiative, and post‐initiative stages in order to reflect on and learn from the initiative. Furthermore, if the initiative is temporary but form part of a planned or an emerging sequence of initiatives, managers may search for and consider earlier initiatives which may be viewed as “experiments” in a emerging trial‐and‐error learning process aimed at managing supply networks.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The article illustrates how a temporary supply network initiative can be used as a means to instigate reform of a supply base.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Findings indicate that short‐term interest rates lead and forecast changes in the PMI by 10 months. Additionally, the paper focuses on the PMI as a predictor. Of the many variables the PMI can fit or predict, results reveal inventories as the most relevant example for supply chain managers, showing the PMI is a predictor of real inventory changes 8 months out.</jats:p>",

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Background to the topic: For food safety and security reasons, hundreds of pesticides, veterinary drugs, and environmental pollutants should be monitored in the food supply, but current methods are too time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. As a result, only a tiny fraction of the food is tested for a limited number of contaminants. Original proposal objectives: Our main original goal was to develop fast, practical, and effective new approaches for the analysis of hazardous chemicals in the food supply. We proposed to extend the QuEChERS approach to more pesticides, veterinary drugs and pollutants, further develop GC-MS and LC-MS with SMB and combine QuEChERS with GC-SMB-MS and LC-SMB-EI-MS to provide the “ultimate” approach for the analysis of hazardous chemicals in food. Major conclusions, solutions and achievements: The original QuEChERS method was validated for more than 200 pesticide residues in a variety of food crops. For the few basic pesticides for which the method gave lower recoveries, an extensive solvent suitability study was conducted, and a buffering modification was made to improve results for difficult analytes. Furthermore, evaluation of the QuEChERS approach for fatty matrices, including olives and its oil, was performed. The QuEChERS concept was also extended to acrylamide analysis in foods. Other advanced techniques to improve speed, ease, and effectiveness of chemical residue analysis were also successfully developed and/or evaluated, which include: a simple and inexpensive solvent-in-silicone-tube extraction approach for highly sensitive detection of nonpolar pesticides in GC; ruggedness testing of low-pressure GC-MS for 3-fold faster separations; optimization and extensive evaluation of analyte protectants in GC-MS; and use of prototypical commercial automated direct sample introduction devices for GC-MS. GC-MS with SMB was further developed and combined with the Varian 1200 GCMS/ MS system, resulting in a new type of GC-MS with advanced capabilities. Careful attention was given to the subject of GC-MS sensitivity and its LOD for difficult to analyze samples such as thermally labile pesticides or those with weak or no molecular ions, and record low LOD were demonstrated and discussed. The new approach of electron ionization LC-MS with SMB was developed, its key components of sample vaporization nozzle and flythrough ion source were improved and was evaluated with a range of samples, including carbamate pesticides. A new method and software based on IAA were developed and tested on a range of pesticides in agricultural matrices. This IAA method and software in combination with GC-MS and SMB provide extremely high confidence in sample identification. A new type of comprehensive GCxGC (based on flow modulation) was uniquely combined with GC-MS with SMB, and we demonstrated improved pesticide separation and identification in complex agricultural matrices using this novel approach. An improved device for aroma sample collection and introduction (SnifProbe) was further developed and favorably compared with SPME for coffee aroma sampling. Implications, both scientific and agricultural: We succeeded in achieving significant improvements in the analysis of hazardous chemicals in the food supply, from easy sample preparation approaches, through sample analysis by advanced new types of GC-MS and LCMS techniques, all the way to improved data analysis by lowering LOD and providing greater confidence in chemical identification. As a result, the combination of the QuEChERS approach, new and superior instrumentation, and the novel monitoring methods that were developed will enable vastly reduced time and cost of analysis, increased analytical scope, and a higher monitoring rate. This provides better enforcement, an added impetus for farmers to use good agricultural practices, improved food safety and security, increased trade, and greater consumer confidence in the food supply. </p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The global energy trend forecasts point out an increasing demand over the next decades, especially for electricity and automotive fuel. Over the next 25 years, the growing activity of the transport sector will involve increasing quantities of liquid fuels. On the supply side, the crude oil share in the total primary energy supply should remain to around 35% until 2030. Thus, the non conventional supply, coming from non-conventional oil (tar sands, extra-heavy oil and oil shale) as well as technologies transforming gas or coal to liquids should give a significant and necessary contribution to the global crude oil availability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We have analysed the potential development of the non conventional supply in a worldwide model which aims to satisfy the oil products demand until 2030. In this analysis, several geographical areas have been distinguished, to take into account the regional dimension of the supply and the demand. This paper is organised as follow: section 1 concerns the resources availability, section 2 deals with the production technologies, ongoing and future known projects, section 3 gives an overview of the modelling approach and, finally, the results are given in the last section.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Heavy crude which often result from a bacterial oxidation of conventional oils inside the reservoir rock, have different physical and chemical properties, generally degraded: they have much higher viscosity, higher heavy metals and higher sulphur and nitrogen contents. Due to those specific properties, their exploitation implies specific methods to extract, transport and transform them into final products. Different categories of heavy crude are usually defined according to their density: -the heavy oils, the API° degree of which is between 10 and 22.3;-the extra-heavy oils and bitumen, the API° degree of which is less than 10. The « in situ » level of viscosity makes the distinction between extra-heavy oils and natural bitumen: -extra-heavy oils have a viscosity smaller than 10 000 centipoises (cP), which means that they are flowing at reservoir conditions;-natural bitumen, also called tar sands or oil sands, have a viscosity greater than 10 000 cP; they are not flowing at reservoir conditions.</jats:p>",

With the emergence of e-commerce and enterprise information systems, a number of processes, locations, and partners can be linked globally—and in real time. Motivated by the need to achieve global integration, a Canadian aerospace manufacturer has embarked on a company-wide digitization initiative to integrate several members of its supply network. This pilot study illustrates how three separate business practices (i.e., process integration, supply chain management, and quality management) may relate to—and indeed reinforce—each other in this industry. Furthermore, this network-wide initiative can enhance new product development activities by integrating customer relationships management with collaborative design. From the perspective of the participating firm, we sug-gest that a truly global supply network needs to integrate several business practices in parallel in order to prosper as a digital extended enterprise.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the beginning of the 1990s, comprehensive reforms of the Ghanaian water sector were initiated by the Bretton Woods Institutions. The Government of Ghana was obliged to restructure the sector by establishing regulatory bodies, opening the sector to private sector participation and separating responsibilities for urban water supply from rural water supply. The parastatal Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) was created to be solely in charge of urban water supply. In spite of external assistance, GWCL continued to suffer from massive financial, managerial and technical problems. The gap between supply and demand increased while demand for potable water in the cities was on the rise and the supply systems were degenerating.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to introduce greater efficiency, two options for public–private partnerships (PPP) were developed and contested, over a period of 10 years. At first private companies were invited to take over the GWCL by a lease contract. Numerous factors, among them a massive anti-privatisation campaign and global economic trends unfavourable to private investment, particularly in the water sector, caused a comprehensive revision of the policy and the modification of the PPP programme from lease to short-term management contract with an ensuing affermage concession in 2004. This process was to be supported by external donor agencies substantially upgrading the water supply infrastructure. However, it seemed doubtful if the recent policy would lead to a sustainable system of urban water supply and substantial improvements in the supply situation of the poor. Patronage relations were not sufficiently addressed and alternative PPP options based on local potential had not been considered. The case of Ghana raises issues of imposed PPP policies that are not based on adequate information about local, national and international framework conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture is the main economic activity of the majority of the population living in Ghana. It contributes over 40% of Gross Domestic Product and employs about half of Ghana’s labour force. Due to that much attention has been placed on sustainable management of agricultural resources in the country. About 13,628,179 hectares representing 57.1% of Ghana’s total land area of 23,853,900 hectares, is suitable for agriculture. However, total area under cultivation in 2000 was 5,808,600 hectares representing 42.6% of the agricultural area. Agriculture in Ghana is mainly on a smallholder basis, although there are some large farms and plantations, particularly for cocoa (1,200,000 ha); oil palm (285,000 ha); seed cotton (62,000 ha); tobacco (1,600 ha); and coconut, banana, kola, etc.(1,502,500 ha). The main system of farming is traditional with the use of hoe and cutlass. Even though there is little mechanised farming, subsistence farming is widespread, especially in northern Ghana. In the 1970s, Ghana was virtually selfsufficient in the production of maize, cocoyam, cassava, and plantain. In 1981-1983, the demand for all these crops except cassava exceeded production. From 1969 to 1983, annual total agricultural production declined by almost 1% while per capita production declined almost 4%. Food supply per person dropped almost 30%. Supply (import and export) and utilisation (for food, feed, seed, farm manure, waste and other uses) of food crops have consequences for food production in Ghana. Using data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture Census, this paper assesses production, supply and utilisation of food crops in Ghana from 1960 to 2000. It also assesses the trend and pattern of population growth for the same period. Multiple regression models are used to ascertain the statistically significant predictors of food crop (rice, maize, millet, sorghum, cassava, yam and plantain) production in five periods, namely 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The analysis shows that wastage, food imports, growth in human population, the utilisation of certain food crops as feed, food and on farms as manure, significantly influenced the production of food crops in Ghana at one point in time or the other in the five decades.</jats:p>"

The authors modified a conventional NFT system (cNFT) and propose a modified NFT (mNFT) that enables the production of lettuce (<jats:italic>Lactuca sativa</jats:italic>) plants of uniform fresh weight along elongated cultural beds. Two experiments were carried out to compare the systems when long cultural beds are used (18 m) in terms of uniformity of plant and nutrient solution characteristics. The results indicated that fresh weight of plants in cNFT decreased as the distance from the nutrient inlet increased, whereas no such trend was observed in mNFT. Leaf nitrate concentration in mNFT was uniform, whereas it was higher near the outlet of cNFT. Ascorbic acid concentration was also uniform in mNFT, but it was found to be lower near the outlet of cNFT. During Expt. 2, the oxygen content along the bed decreased from inlet to outlet in cNFT; however, in mNFT, it remained relatively constant at all sampling positions. Regarding the concentration of the nutrient solution along beds, no significant differences were found between inlet and outlet in both systems. It is suggested that the lower concentration of oxygen found at the outlet of cNFT might have reduced nutrient uptake, thus attenuating the difference in concentration between inlet and outlet. The temperatures of the nutrient solution along mNFT during Expt. 2 tended to be slightly lower than those of cNFT. However, temperatures were still too high and plant growth was negatively affected. The results of this study demonstrate that plants of uniform size and quality can be achieved in long cultural beds (up to 18 m long) supplied with a low-concentration fertilizer solution by using the proposed mNFT.</jats:p>",

Applying this framework to pseudo‐panel data from successive Current Population Surveys indicates that the increase in wives' employment has diminished the growth in family earnings inequality especially for well‐educated couples. Inferences about the level and change in earnings inequality depend on the degree of labor market attachment of the people studied especially in the case of wives.</jats:p>",

Although autonomous intelligent agents, or electronic robots (e-bots), can be used to inform this endeavor, the article advocates the development of e-sensors, i.e., software based units with capabilities beyond intelligent agent’s functionality. E-sensors are hardware-software capable of perceiving, reacting and learning from its interactive experience through the supply chain, rather than just searching for data and information through the network and reacting to it. E-sensors can help avoid the “bullwhip” effect. The article briefly reviews the related intelligent agent and supply chain literature and the technological gap between fields. It articulates a demand-driven, sense-and-response system for sustaining e-collaboration and e-business operations as well as monitoring products and processes. As a proof of concept, this research aimed a test solution at a single supply chain partner within one stage of the process.</p>",

Positive correlation between MAP in the inlet water and heterotrophic plate count (correlation coefficient 0.95) in biofilm, as well as for the total bacteria number (correlation coefficient 0.71), was observed.

Its main accelerator is a 3‐GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). Two types of resonant excitation systems, parallel and cascade, are introduced to excite DC biased 25‐Hz AC currents through its main magnets. The parallel excitation is adopted for the dipole magnet power supply system, and the cascade excitations are adopted for the seven family quadrupole magnets system. In this paper, the two systems are investigated and analyzed, and an explanation is given as to why the different types are adopted in each system. The authors believe that such hybrid exciting systems are most suitable for a high‐power RCS. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Cofilin is also involved in stimulus-induced actin filament assembly during lamellipodium formation. However, it is not clear whether this occurs by replenishing the actin monomer pool, through filament disassembly, or by creating free barbed ends, through its severing activity. Using photoactivatable Dronpa-actin, we show that cofilin is involved in producing more than half of all cytoplasmic actin monomers and that the rate of actin monomer incorporation into the tip of the lamellipodium is dependent on the size of this actin monomer pool. Finally, in cofilin-depleted cells, stimulus-induced actin monomer incorporation at the cell periphery is attenuated, but the incorporation of microinjected actin monomers is not. We propose that cofilin contributes to stimulus-induced actin filament assembly and lamellipodium extension by supplying an abundant pool of cytoplasmic actin monomers.</jats:p>",

This suggests that the direction for further analysis lies in the understanding of the regional differences and whether there are policy alternatives to address these different patterns.</jats:p>",

Based on interviews with environmental managers of selected companies, the paper highlights the importance of taking a long‐term perspective in terms of both the cooperation with suppliers and developing the supply chain perspective for EMSs. The role of cultural influence from foreign partner companies in building the proactive environmental focus and stimulating the spread of EMSs is underlined here. In addition, the paper looks at the development, use and control of supply chain environmental requirements and their possible integration into the buyer's and supplier's EMSs. Finally, important shortcomings of EMSs, such as the lack of enforcement forbearance and the credibility of ISO 14001 certification, are discussed.

The British authorities issued regulations to prohibit the drug's use as early as 1900, and yet by the start of World War I, cocaine's appeal had become socially diverse and geographically wide. This account of a significant market for a powerful new drug suggests that Indian society was able to rapidly develop a demand for such products even when the colonial state had no part in their introduction. Indians used these new products in complex ways—as medicines, as tonics, and as intoxicants, albeit through the localized medium of the everyday<jats:italic>paan</jats:italic>leaf.

In this work, a unified thermodynamic argument is proposed to explain this rather unusual phenomenon. According to this argument, two necessary conditions must be met. The number one condition is that at least one of the reactive constituents of the solder must be present in a limited amount, and the second condition is that the soldering reaction has to be very sensitive to its concentration. With the growth of intermetallic, more and more atoms of this constituent are extracted out of the solder and incorporated into the intermetallic. As the concentration of this constituent decreases, the original intermetallic at the interface becomes a nonequilibrium phase, and the spalling of the original intermetallic occurs.</jats:p>",

The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated. However, as the number of suppliers increases, our model predicts that the retailer may be able to take advantage of both competition and diversification. </jats:p>",

Under different criteria, we format three types of models for the decision makers: expected cost optimization model, chance-constrained model and chance maximization model. A genetic algorithm based on fuzzy simulation is developed to solve the proposed fuzzy models. Moreover, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of models and solution algorithm. </jats:p>",

In terms of supply, as long as there is willingness to plant more area with oil palm in environmentally sensitive areas, there will be continued growth in the oil palm industry. This development is likely to be led primarily by Indonesia with increasing areas planted with oil palm, notably in Kalimantan, and by continued yield improvements in Malaysia.</jats:p>",

Five treatments supplied with different nitrogen forms were compared: homogeneous nitrate (NN) and homogenous ammonium (AA) supply, spatially separated supply of nitrate and ammonium (NA), half of the root system supplied with N‐free nutrient solution, the other half with either nitrate (N0) or ammonium (A0). The results showed that 10 d after onset of treatments, root dry matter (DM) in the nitrate‐supplied vessels treated with NA was more than two times higher than that in the ammonium‐supplied vessels. Water uptake from the nitrate‐supplied vessels treated with NA was 281% higher than under ammonium supply. In treatments N0 and A0, the local supply of N resulted in clearly higher root DM, and water uptake from the nitrate‐supplied vessels was 82% higher than in the ‐N vessels. However, in A0 plants, water uptake from the ‐N nutrient solution was 129% higher than from the ammonium‐supplied vessels. This indicates a compensatory effect, which resulted in almost identical rates of total water uptake of treatments AA and A0, which had comparable shoot DM and leaf area. Ammonium supply reduced potassium and magnesium absorption. Water uptake was positively correlated with N, Mg and K uptake.</jats:p>",

In such approaches, firms work with vendors to develop the environmental profile of supplied materials (for example) by reducing materials' toxicity or the amount of packaging used. While large firms can mandate that their suppliers comply with such initiatives, more cooperative approaches are generally likely to be more fruitful. This article presents the results from an exploratory, two phase study of the conditions under which firms engage in cooperative supply‐chain environmental management. First, the authors conducted interviews with 14 leading‐edge firms. In the second phase, the authors conducted a theoretical‐sample survey to examine a model of the antecedents of cooperative supply‐chain environmental management. The results suggest that inter‐firm trust, uncertainty and pro‐active environmental management most directly affect the extent to which firms engage in cooperative supply‐chain environmental management.

We have recently shown in mice divergently selected for growth potential that in some lines, the absolute penalty of sub-clinical parasitism on high growth mice was higher than in their low growth counterparts (Houdijk and Bünger, 2006).

These agreements typically apply to a piece of equipment that the customer has purchased, and they specify the type and timing of service that will be provided. If a customer operates in multiple locations, service agreements may cover several pieces of equipment at several locations. In this paper, we describe a continuous-review inventory model for a multi-item, multiechelon service parts distribution system in which time-based service-level requirements exist. Our goal is to determine base-stock levels for all items at all locations so that the service-level requirements are met at minimum investment. We derive exact time-based fill-rate expressions for each item within its distribution channel, as well as approximate expressions for the gradients of these fill-rate functions. Using these results, we develop an intelligent greedy algorithm that can be used to find near-optimal solutions to large-scale problems quickly, as well as a Lagrangian-based approach that provides both near-optimal solutions and good lower bounds with increased computational effort. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of these algorithms on three example problems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the past decade, a major transition evolved in the Dutch fresh meat industry with ramifications for the entire meat business. In 1995, more than 95% of all fresh meat products for consumers were either sold loose or packed in the traditional way, i.e. on a white styrofoam tray with stretch wrap. Almost a decade later, about half of the meat industry has adapted the modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technology. Strikingly, the first trials with this technology had already been conducted in The Netherlands in 1964, but it took four decades for the technology to conquer the Dutch meat industry. This paper argued that the partial adaptation of MAP diminished the product losses in fresh meat sales and hence the environmental impact of meat production and consumption.

This study presents EO exposure assessment results and examines the effectiveness of control measures. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>: Detailed surveys, including exposure monitoring, were conducted at 10 factories. Airborne EO was collected using an HBr‐coated charcoal tube and analyzed using GC/MS. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Sterilizer operators had an average short‐term EO exposure level of 27.61 ppm during unloading; mean time‐weighted average workshift exposure was 7.35 ppm. High EO concentrations were also present throughout the facilities. Specifically, mean EO concentrations in the aeration area, near the sterilizer and in the warehouse were 10.19, 5.75, and 8.78 ppm, respectively. These findings indicate that immediate controls are needed, and that EO emissions from sterilized products during storage cannot be overlooked. Worker short‐term exposures during unloading was inversely correlated (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) with the numbers of poststerilization purge cycle applied. The specific controls implemented and their usefulness is discussed. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: Increasing the number of poststerilization purge cycles is a simple approach to eliminating extremely high exposure during unloading. Improvements to ventilation, particularly in the aeration area and warehouse, were also effective in minimizing worker exposures. Use of effective respirator is recommended until the EO exposure levels, averaging 3.41 ppm after the controls, fall below the permissible exposure limit. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the era of global business and competitiveness, supply chain management has emerged as the critical factor for the success of companies. The past few decades have witnessed the importance of the linking channels among suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. The distribution centre (DC) location problem is a very fundamental and basic decision-making problem in terms of an efficient and effective supply chain. The decision concerning DC location, bearing in mind the current and future business perspective, is a cumbersome task and involves a large amount of investment. The selection of a site is a multicriterion decision-making problem and requires a thorough analysis of both qualitative and quantitative factors. The comparative study of different potential sites on a common set of criteria can help to handle the problem systematically and effectively. In general, most of the decision-making approaches such as the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) seem inefficient in handling the imprecise and vague linguistic comparisons of the different criteria. In this paper, a fuzzy integrated hierarchical decision-making approach is developed to solve the DC location selection problem. A case study adopted from previous literature is also discussed in this paper to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology over the existing conventional hierarchical approaches. </jats:p>",
