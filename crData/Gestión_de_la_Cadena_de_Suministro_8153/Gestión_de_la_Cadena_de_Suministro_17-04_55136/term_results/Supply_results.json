In 1879 a group that came to be called the Exodusters began their much-publicized mass migration from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Although some relocated to Indiana as well, many acquired “Kansas fever.” They were on their way by February and arrived in “avalanchelike proportions” between March and May. Although the rate of arrivals later slowed, they continued their trek to Kansas until mid-1881. Moreover, unlike the more prosperous blacks who had settled the colonies during the late 1870s, the Exodusters were largely destitute. Because they arrived over such a short period, involved such large numbers, and required so much public assistance, they provoked widespread attention and instilled in white Kansans the fear that they would “certainly be swamped.”</p>",

The concept was introduced in the last decade in international guidance documents and has been applied widely across a varied range of water supply systems, particularly, the public water utilities and to a lesser extent towards small systems. Mainstreaming water safety intervention for small systems however, would ensure safe household water to a wider population, alleviate poverty and hunger through water for use in support of livelihood activities, and help towards achieving the sustainable development goals. Self-supply hand-dug wells in Abeokuta, Nigeria, were assessed using the step-by-step World Health Organization WSP model, mainly from the relevant system assessment to operational monitoring and management procedures. This paper reviewed the methodology of water safety planning and flagged the issue of ‘who’ conducts WSP for small systems. The paper also evaluated major control measures critical to self-supply and suggested an apt WS planning model for the systems. The WSP framework for self-supply systems incorporated an institutional aspect for WSP coordination.</jats:p>",

At the same time, supply chain risk management is important for practitioners to consider because it outlines ways through which firms can allay internal and external threats. Predicting and addressing the risks that social issues cause in the supply chain is of paramount importance to the sustainable enterprise. The aim of this research is to explore the application of big data analytics in mitigating supply chain social risk and to demonstrate how such mitigation can help in achieving environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The method involves an expert panel and survey identifying and validating social issues in the supply chain. A case study was used to illustrate the application of big data analytics in identifying and mitigating social issues in the supply chain. Our results show that companies can predict various social problems including workforce safety, fuel consumptions monitoring, workforce health, security, physical condition of vehicles, unethical behavior, theft, speeding and traffic violations through big data analytics, thereby demonstrating how information management actions can mitigate social risks. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating big data analytics with sustainability to explain how to mitigate supply chain risk.</jats:p>"

It appears that the essence of the twenty-first-century labor question no longer resides at the point of production in a struggle between workers and the owners of the factories in which they labor. Instead, the site of value production is found at every link along a set of global supply chains, in which the manufacturer and the warehouse operator, the ports and the shipping companies, as well as the retailers and their branded vendors jockey for power and profit. In this disaggregated system, legal ownership of the forces of production has been divorced from operational control, making accountability for labor conditions diffuse and knowledge of the actual producers far from transparent.</p>",

This work uses modern satellite terrain data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data to assess this system and provide an improved description of its route, total length and gradient profile. Forty-four validated GPS Control Points were correlated with ASTER GDEM V2 digital satellite data and archaeological information in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. We concluded that the total length of the water supply system was 426 km, and possibly even 565 km if the fifth-century aqueduct continued in parallel all the way to Constantinople rather than merging with the fourth-century aqueduct. The gradient of the channels varied across their length, being steepest near the spring sources, with a gradient mostly in the region of 5 m/km, and flattest at around 0.4 m/km in the most downstream section nearest the City. This reconstruction of the gradient profile provides valuable insight into the physical characteristics of the system, allowing future study of its hydraulic function.</jats:p>",

Recent research has shown that some behavior factors may influence the decision making of supply chain members. The authors utilize a linear utility function to depict such behavior factors and incorporate these into the newsvendor model. The linear utility function provides sufficient flexibility to better capture people's various behavior factors. By supposing the agents are concerned with behavior factors, the authors first investigate how the factors affect the supply chain under wholesale price contract, and find that they do not influence coordination condition, but can adjust the distribution of profits. Then they extend their study to other four common contracts with a similar method and systematically demonstrate that the behavior of agents in such a linear setting has no effect on the conditions of coordinating supply chain.</p>",

An attempt has been made to determine the major contributors of supply chain risk as viewed by automotive professionals in today's competitive market. This study empirically validates the effects of the three critical constructs on overall supply chain risk exposure. The limitations of this study can be seen in the use of perceptual data from single informants and the focus on automotive firms in a single country. The detailed operationalization of the constructs sheds further light on the major risk sources, drivers, and mitigation strategies in supply chain networks. Clear evidence of proactive strategies in mitigating risks provides managers with a business case to invest in such initiatives.</p>",

Further investigation was done to understand the role of big data and predictive analysis (BDPA) in managing the supply uncertainties. The paper finally uses partial least square regression analysis to study the relationship among buyer-supplier relationship, big data and predictive analysis and supply chain performance. The analysis supported the second and third hypothesis. Therefore, it is established that firstly, there is a positive relationship between big data, predictive analysis and supply chain performance and secondly, there is a positive relationship between and big data, predictive analysis and buyer-supplier relationship. The study is a unique contribution to the current literature by shedding light on the practical problems persisting in the South African context.</p>",

The environmental problems (vehicle part disposal, carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen oxide [NOx] and hydrocarbons [HC]) associated with transportation are mostly not accounted for by industries.Objectives: The main objective of this article is to minimising negative externalities cost in e-commerce environments.Method: The 0-1 mixed integer linear programming (0-1 MILP) model was used to model the problem statement. The result was further analysed using the externality percentage impact factor (EPIF).Results: The simulation results suggest that (1) The mode of ordering refined petroleum products does not impact on the cost of distribution, (2) an increase in private cost is directly proportional to the externality cost, (3) externality cost is largely controlled by the government and number of vehicles used in the distribution and this is in no way influenced by the mode of request (i.e. Internet or otherwise) and (4) externality cost may be reduce by using more ecofriendly fuel system.</jats:p>"

(ii) Has the policy influenced labour market dynamics? (iii) Has the policy had differential effects by age groups? Evidence suggests that the policy improved overall health status, as the likelihood of suffering illnesses associated with inability to carry out normal activities decreased by 28.6 percent. In addition, the number of days where people were unable to perform normal activities due to illnesses suffered within the previous four weeks decreased by 34 percent. Regarding labour market dynamics, no effects are found on the likelihood of being employed or contributing to the National Insurance Scheme. However, consistent with a reduced number of days lost due to illnesses, we find a positive effect of 2.15 additional weekly labour hours. Finally, we find that all of these positive effects are concentrated within adults in the 40-64 year-old age range. Overall, these effects suggest that the policy added a yearly average of US$PPP 26.6 million worth of net real production to the Jamaican economy during the period 2008-12.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper evaluates whether fiscal and foreign exchange policy shocks canexplain both credit and credit supply in Venezuela. Empirical evidence suggests that between 65 and 90 percent of credit growth is linked to the buildup of banks' deposits caused by the monetary effects of fiscal expansions. For these cases, since credit is provided at equal or reduced interest rates, credit supply takes place. Loan supply can occur either endogenously, when fiscal domestic spending increases with expansionary aggregate supply shocks, or exogenously, when fiscal policy shocks emerge. The role of exogenous fiscal shocks in accounting for credit supply is preponderant in the long run. This evidence suggests fiscal shocks represent a non-conventional bank lending channel. Because this exogenous fiscally-triggered credit supply does not significantly contribute to boosting real activity, its major cost might be associated with high credit volatility.</jats:p>"

An externally pressurized circular thrust gas bearing with single gas supply hole was used as the test bearing to investigate the suitability of this technique. The test bearing was 30 mm in diameter, with a gas supply hole of diameter 0.7 mm. A coat of PtTFPP, the substance used as the PSP, was applied to the bearing surface using an air-assisted spray. The PSP luminescence characteristics were calibrated before the tests because of their dependency on temperature and pressure. The pressure distribution was obtained by averaging 50 images captured by a 12-bit complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. These experimental results were compared with the results of a numerical analysis based on the divergence formulation method. There was good agreement between the experimental and analytical results, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of using PSP for pressure distribution measurements.</jats:p>",

It is fast and convenient to promote these rapid developments. Traditional transportation usually are fueled by oil which is burning non-renewable, and fuel that cannot be completely burned. Normally, they will be mainly released into the air in the form of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, so fuel trucks bring serious energy and pollution to human’s environment. Therefore, according to the current development situation, this development trend is clearly inconsistent with the laws of human survival, so every country has to develop and improve their green environment. In recent years, some developed countries the electric car to protect the human living environment. The electric car is mainly use the power that stored in the battery stored as a power source to reduce the toxic gas emissions to the air. It can save the oil energy at the same time, so the battery charge is very important. This paper is based on DSP to design an electric vehicle charging power system, charging the battery, mainly for the current development of the status quo, designed clean and environmentally friendly car charging power. From the view of the above problems, this design is based on DSP to design an electric vehicle charging power system, through the DSP event manager to generate PWM control signal to drive thyristor, and then through the power electronics technology, AC-DC conversion DC power supply, and finally to Battery power supply, complete the design. Therefore, this article mainly from the following aspects: (1) DSP is applied in this design. The design of the use of DSP is mainly to the back of the power electronic circuit to provide thyristor drive signal, we know that the 2000 series DSP can provide dead zone PWM to control signal. In Texas Instruments, there are almost 2000 series of DSP are attributed for the MCU series. (2) The application of power electronics in this design. This design is to complete the charge to the battery, to obtain a certain DC power supply. Therefore, there will be using the power electronics technology, from the AC into DC, and lastly to the battery power supply, the entire design contains AC-DC circuit, SCR trigger Circuit, output voltage stabilization circuit.</jats:p>"

Sensors are useful in predicting the best warranty policy and warranty period to offer a customer for remanufactured components and products. The conditions and remaining lives of components and products can be estimated prior to offering a warranty based on the data provided by the sensors. This helps reduce the number of claims during warranty periods, determines the right preventive maintenance (PM) policy, and eliminates unnecessary costs inflicted on the remanufacturer. The renewing, one-dimensional Free Replacement Warranty (FRW), Pro-Rata Warranty (PRW), and combination FRW/PRW policies’ costs for remanufactured products and components were evaluated with/without offering PM for different periods in this paper. To that end, the effect of offering renewable, one-dimensional, Free Replacement Warranty (FRW), or Pro-Rata Warranty (PRW), or combination FRW/PRW warranty policies for each disassembled component and sensor embedded remanufactured product was examined, and the impact of sensor embedded products on warranty costs was assessed. A case study and varying simulation scenarios is examined and presented to illustrate the model’s applicability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Analytical channel design tools have not advanced appreciably in the last decades, and continue to produce designs based upon a single representative discharge that may not lead to overall sediment continuity. It is beneficial for designers to know when a simplified design may be problematic and to efficiently produce alternative designs that approximate sediment balance over the entire flow regime. The Capacity/Supply Ratio (CSR) approach, an extension of the Copeland method of analytical channel design for sand channels, balances the sediment transport capacity of a design reach with the sediment supply of a stable upstream reach over the entire flow duration curve (FDC) rather than just a single discharge. Although CSR has a stronger physical basis than previous analytical channel design approaches, it has not been adopted in practice because it can be a cumbersome and time-consuming iterative analysis without the use of software. We investigate eighteen sand-bed rivers in a comparison of designs based on the CSR approach and five single-discharge metrics: the effective discharge (Qeff), the 1.5-year recurrence interval discharge (Q1.5), the bankfull discharge (Qbf), and the discharges associated with 50th (Qs50) and 75th (Qs75) percentiles of the cumulative sediment yield curve. To facilitate this analysis we developed a novel design tool using the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language in Excel&amp;reg; to produce stable channel slope-width combinations based on the CSR methodology for both sand- and gravel-bed streams. The CSR Stable Channel Design Tool&amp;rsquo;s (CSR Tool) code structure was based on Copeland&amp;rsquo;s method in SAM and HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center&amp;rsquo;s River Analysis System) and was tested with a single discharge to verify outputs. The Qs50 and Qs75 single-discharge designs match the CSR output most closely, followed by the Qbf, Qeff, and Q1.5. The Qeff proved to be the most inconsistent design metric because it can be highly dependent on the binning procedure used in the effectiveness analysis. Furthermore, we found that the more rigorous physical basis of the CSR analysis is potentially most important in designing &amp;lsquo;labile&amp;rsquo; channels with highly erodible substrate, high perennial flow &amp;lsquo;flashiness,&amp;rsquo; low width-to-depth ratio, and high incoming sediment load. The CSR Tool provides a resource for river restoration practitioners to efficiently utilize in-depth design techniques that can promote sediment balance in dynamic fluvial systems.</jats:p>"

This trend has been reinforced by governing authorities with the introduction of increasing number and complexity of chemical regulations which shifts added responsibility to industry to manage product supply chains in a more sustainable fashion. This has no exemptions to the oil and gas industry which calls for the embedment of product safety, product regulatory compliance and the overarching product stewardship agenda into the core of a product's value chain at every life cycle stage. This paper gives a brief overview of major emerging regulations in the Asia Pacific region relevant to industry and examines the impact of these regulations towards a product's supply and value chain. This paper also highlights the prospects for early adopters to transform the perceived burden of compliance into strategic opportunities to enhance product stewardship performance as well as secure long term access to markets by adapting key areas in the product's supply chain as well as leveraging supply chain intelligence. This is with the goal of implementing structured data driven approach or \"data to decision\" frameworks in securing existing product market access and bringing new products into target markets thereby reducing \"time to market\" from a product regulatory compliance stand point as well as adequately managing product HSE risks systematically.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In present-day railway power supply systems using an AC frequency lower than the one in the public power system of 50/60 Hz, high voltage overhead transmission lines are used as one measure of strengthening the railway power supply system grids. This option may be economically beneficial, compared to strengthening the grid purely by increasing the density of converter stations or increasing the cross section areas of the overhead catenary wires.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>High voltage AC transmission lines in the railway power supply system allow larger distances between converter stations than would otherwise be possible for a given amount of train traffic. Moreover, the introduction of AC transmission lines implies reduced line losses and reduced voltage level fluctuations at the catenary for a given amount of train traffic.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, due to the increased public and government resistance for additional overhead high voltage AC transmission lines in general, different alternatives will be needed for the future improvements and strengthening of railway power systems. For a more sustainable transport sector, the share and amount of railway traffic needs to increase, in which case such a strengthening becomes inevitable.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Earlier, usage of VSC-HVDC transmission cables has been proposed as one alternative to overhead AC transmission lines. One of the main benefits with VSC-HVDC transmission is that control of power flows in the railway power systems is easier and that less converter capacity may be needed. Technically, VSC-HVDC transmission for railway power systems is a competitive solution as it offers a large variety of control options. However, there might be other more economical alternatives reducing the overall impedance in the railway power system.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In public power systems with the frequency of 50/60 Hz, an excess of reactive power production in lowly utilized cables imposes an obstacle in replacing overhead transmission lines with cables. In low frequency AC railway power system, the capacitive properties are less significant allowing longer cables compared to 50/60 Hz power systems. Moreover, in converter-fed railways, some kind of reactive compensation will automatically be applied during low-load. At each converter station, voltage control is already present following the railway operation tradition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Therefore, in this paper, we propose AC cables as a measure of strengthening low-frequency AC railway power systems. The paper compares the electrical performances of two alternative reinforcement cable solutions with the base case of no reinforcement. The options of disconnecting or toggling the cables at low load as well as the automatic reactive compensation by converter voltage control are considered. Losses and voltage levels are compared for the different solutions. Investment costs and other relevant issues are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food waste stemmed from food contamination and ineffective quality control is a significant challenge to food management. Supply chain traceability has become an essential task of the food industry for guaranteeing food quality and safety and reducing food waste. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has emerged as a lead technology in the development of traceability systems, which enable automatically capturing of food information along the supply chain. However, the significant investment cost has been a major obstacle in the diffusion of traceability systems in the food industry. This study conducts a cost-benefit analysis of a RFID-enabled traceability system for a two-level perishable food supply chain, which consists of an upstream supplier and a downstream retailer. Consumer perceptions of food quality and safety are jointly considered when evaluating the value of a traceability system. The optimal decisions of the supply chain participants are derived in both centralized and decentralized systems, in terms of wholesale price, order quantity, price markdowns, and granularity level of the traceability system. The results show that a dynamic pricing policy supported by the traceability system could significantly reduce food waste and improve the retailer’s performance. We further propose a two-part tariff contract to coordinate the supply chain and to distribute benefits and costs of the traceability system between supply chain participants. This study demonstrates that a well-developed traceability system could significantly improve the supply chain performance and become a profitable investment for the food industry.</jats:p>"

This research integrates the two most recent in-depth studies of the cisterns to determine that there have been at least 211 cisterns attributed to the Byzantine city. The distribution of the cisterns indicates that the size and number of cisterns constructed reduced over time, with more and larger cisterns developed prior to the 7th century. Cisterns are concentrated in the older area of the city and sparser on the periphery, but with later ones more common in the peripheral areas, suggesting that water provision was extended over time, and although the majority of cisterns are small, most storage volume is concentrated in the three largest open-air cisterns. The extended, detailed list produced will allow more in-depth investigations to proceed. Analysis of the distribution of cisterns across the city creates a framework for understanding the development and functioning of Byzantine Constantinople's complex water supply system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In supply chain management, economical objectives have traditionally guided decisions of the supply chains. However, with increased global environmental and social concerns, in recent years, green aspects have been incorporated in supply chain decisions. These expansions lead to new research areas about green or sustainable supply chain management that includes applying various green practices in order to reduce negative impact on the environment or providing sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining network design of the green supply chains. In multi-objective frame of the proposed model, total profit maximization and environmental impact minimization objectives are considered in order to obtain best network configuration for economic and environmental performance of the green chain. The proposed model is validated with numerical experiments. Obtained results showed that the model can be used as a strategic decision tool in problems with multi and conflicting objectives.  Keywords: Green supply chain management, multi-objective modelling, network optimization;  </jats:p>"

The range of parameters (acceptor concentration and insulator thickness) wherein such an electron-supplying mechanism becomes plausible is defined. Generally, the supply effect can be expected for a doping between (5–6) × 1018 and (2–3) × 1019 cm−3, e.g., for the SiO2/p+−Si(1019 cm−3) structures with the oxide thickness exceeding ∼3 nm. The electron density provided due to a resonant tunneling can reach rather high values (∼1012 cm−2 and more). Consequently, the quasi-Fermi level in the well is substantially shifted approaching that of the semiconductor bulk. However, a deformation of the band diagram due to electron charge in the quantum well in the regimes close to activation of a resonant transport is small.</jats:p>",

Students work in a team environment that also helps them discover budget process issues. The project consists of two parts. The first part requires students to grasp the mechanics of master budget creation and develop an understanding of how the individual budgets fit together and how information flows from one budget to other budgets. The second part of the project requires students to create new budget information when given a different organizational structure and incentive system. Both parts of the project expose students to budget process issues related to communication, cooperation, public/private information, information sharing, truth telling, and the influence of incentives on the budget process. The project is directed at undergraduate students in Managerial or Cost Accounting courses. We also present modifications that emphasize the budget process issues that would be useful for a graduate-level managerial accounting course (Master's in Management or M.B.A.).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traceability has recently gained considerable attention in the textile industry. Traceability stands for information sharing about a product including the product history, specification, or location. With the involvement of globally dispersed actors in the textile supply chain, ensuring appropriate product quality with timely supplies is crucial for surviving in this industry with ever increasing competition. Hence it is of paramount importance for a supply chain actor to track every product and trace its history in the supply chain. In this context, this paper presents a framework to implement traceability in the textile supply chain. A system approach has been followed, where firstly the usage requirement of traceability is defined, and then a framework for implementing intra-actor or internal traceability and inter-actor or external traceability is discussed. This article further presents a sequential diagram to demonstrate the interaction and information exchange between the actors in the supply chain, when the traceability information is requested. An example is also illustrated for data storage using a relational database management system and information exchange using XML for the textile weaver. Finally, the article discusses challenges and future studies required to implement traceability in the textile supply chain.</jats:p>"

Since a fixed-price contract cannot attain channel coordination, we focus on time-based incentive contracts. Our proposed contract requires optimization of the material delivery schedule as well as the fraction and the timing of a delayed payment to each supplier. Under the contract, the manufacturer’s profit is affected by the variance but not by the mean of a supplier’s lead time. Each supplier benefits from a reduction in the mean or variance of his own lead time, whereas the supplier’s profit is independent of the duration of the on-site tasks and the lead times of other suppliers. The contract is also robust in various scenarios: in particular, coordination can be achieved even if the manufacturer’s estimate of the average delivery lead time is inaccurate. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

The two smooth polynomial approximations considered here minimise the absolute and relative errors, respectively, from the original non-smooth HW head loss function over a range of flows. Since quadratic approximations are used to formulate head loss constraints for different optimisation problems, we are interested in quantifying and controlling their absolute errors, which affect the degree of constraint violations of feasible candidate solutions. We derive new exact analytical formulae for the absolute errors as a function of the approximation domain, pipe roughness and relative error tolerance. We investigate the efficacy of the proposed quadratic approximations in mathematical optimisation problems for advanced pressure control in an operational water supply network. We propose a strategy on how to choose the approximation domain for each pipe such that the optimisation results are sufficiently close to the exact hydraulically feasible solution space. By using simulations with multiple parameters, the approximation errors are shown to be consistent with our analytical predictions.</jats:p>",

The basis of this type of supply chain is the collection of used products, without which the remanufacturing of new products would be out of the question. In this paper, we considered the effect of stochastic disturbance on the collection process in a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer is responsible for collecting the used products. Considering stochastic disturbance, in this research, we proposed a stochastic collection model, and derived the feedback control strategies for both the manufacturer and retailer. Next, we investigated the evolutionary path and probability distribution of the stochastic return rate. Finally, we proposed a contract to coordinate the decentralized closed-loop supply chain. The results showed that the manufacturer would improve the level of return effort as the intensity of stochastic disturbance increases. However, the disturbance would not affect the pricing strategies of the supply chain members. As a result of the stochastic disturbance, the return rate always hovered around the expected return rate, while the expectation and variance of the return rate remained stable from a long-term perspective. The expected value and variance of the return rate could decrease or increase with time, depending on the value of the initial return rate of the system.</jats:p>"

The course of this aqueduct and of its likely branches, destined for two small towns, Saticula and Calatia, is hypothesized, in part based on the re-use in the seventeenth century of about 8 miles (i.e. 11.8 km) of the ancient aqueduct for another water supply that served Naples, namely the Carmignano aqueduct. The subsequent transformation in the eighteenth century in a new water supply along a new route at a higher altitude is described. This third water supply served the Bourbon royal palace of Caserta, a magnificent construction built in the same period. In summary, the historical evolution of the Augustan aqueduct of Capua is discussed in the context of the communities served and in the context of the organization and history of the territory supplied, demonstrating the richness of information that may be obtained by an integrated study of the transformation, over time, of this important water infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Red quartz powder and natural quartz sand were employed in the study and acted as suspended particles and porous media, respectively. Particles were injected into the sand box in two modes, i.e., pulse injection and continuous injection. Tests were performed at various particle concentrations, flow velocities, deposition rate coefficient and longitudinal dispersion coefficient by both injection modes. The breakthrough curves were described with the analytical solution of a convection–dispersion equation, in which first-order deposition kinetics were taken into account. Different behavior of suspended-particle transport and deposition in porous media was observed under different injection modes and experimental conditions. The results show that effluent concentration was approximately linear with the initial particle concentration. The deposition rate coefficient depends strongly on particle size and flow velocity, and the transport and deposition process was very sensitive to it. Furthermore, the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases with increasing flow rate, and particles are easier to transport through pores as the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases. This study shows the importance of particle concentration, flow velocity, deposition rate coefficient and longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the transport and deposition process of suspended particles.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a leakage reduction technique using pressure management by optimizing the water level in storage tanks, along with optimized control and localization of pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) in WDSs. A new mathematical tank and pump simulation algorithm is presented for controlling pressure in WDSs, by optimizing the water storage level in the tank depending upon the demand variations. The tank is used as a decision variable for the leakage reduction model. A modified reference pressure algorithm is introduced for improving PRV localization. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to find the optimized operational control setting of the PRV for leakage minimization. The proposed algorithm leads to a leakage reduction of 26.51% in Anytown WDS and 20.81% in a modified benchmark WDS. This technique leads to an appreciable reduction in leakage rate, with fewer PRVs required, taking into account constraints such as maintaining a lower hydraulic failure index (&amp;lt;0.01), emergency storage, etc. It can be concluded that the proposed novel leakage reduction technique provides a more cost effective and efficient solution for leakage control.</jats:p>",

A simple water quality measurement and determination of Legionella was carried out. The results showed that residual effective chlorine—which guarantees bactericidal properties—was not detected in tap water supplied in hotel rooms in Vietnam, and nitrite (an indicator of water pollution) was detected in 40% of buildings. In the hotels in Japan, the prescribed residual chlorine concentration met the prescribed levels, and nitrite was not detected. Additionally, while there was no Legionella detected in the Japanese cases, it was detected in most of the Vietnamese hotels, which were found to manage the hot water storage tank at low temperatures of 40–50 °C. It was found that there were deficiencies in cold and hot water supply quality, and that there was no effective system in place for building operation maintenance and management.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the nonlinearmathematical model of extended star-ring supply chain network is developed.Methods: Planning a distribution network plays a vital role in minimizing the total expenditure of the project; to prove this, a ring network topology is taken to supply goods to the SWs and extended star network topology to supply goods to the selling stores. However, setting up separate SWs for each and every selling store will be highly expensive. Hence, keeping the minimum number of SWs is very important. Selection of SWs from the available SWs is done by replacing diverse values based on the distance limitation.Results: The suggested model is validated with the mathematical problem, and the optimum set of SWs is identified from the result. The result has been substantiated using analytic hierarchy process. Conclusion: The system of optimum number of SWs is obtained from the result. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This paper describes the perceived effects of implementing lean production in a Swedish SME contract manufacturer. Especially focused are the effects on, and possible trade-offs between, cost-efficiency and flexibility.Design/methodology/approach: SME suppliers need basic capabilities of qualitative production performance which may then be stepping-stones to develop more system supplier capabilities for added customer value: leadership to manage systems and processes, SCM, communications and relations management. Development of stable production processes is seen as a way to reach stable basic performance, efficient and with higher resource utilization. Quality is a precursor to delivery performance as well as to cost reduction and flexibility. This is a longitudinal single case study of a SME supplier striving to become a system supplier. Two main sources of data collection are used: interviews and the main author’s presence as employee and business developer, participating in and following up the ongoing change process.Findings: Two specific findings appeared: (1) An initial effect was an important “eye-opener” for the balance between cost efficiency and flexibility in the organization. (2) Process orientation, as the basis of both lean and agile approaches, allows many improvements without any conflicts or trade-offs between these two goals. Stability in the production leads to increased controllability, initially resulting in both higher cost-efficiency and higher flexibility. As the organization develops however, strategic considerations relating to the chosen market strategy might occur: cost leadership or differentiation.   Research limitations/implications: These results reflect the experiences of one SME supplier and further studies are needed for generalizability.Originality/value: The study increases the understanding of how a SME may develop stable processes in its different supplier-customer contexts. The study points at some necessary basic components of this process approach as a first step for the transition to system supplier.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to consider these special properties of process industries when developing a mathematical model that can be used as a decision support tool for the supply chain planning for a chemical process industry in Sweden. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed, and solutions to the model present how the products will be transported between the different sites of the company, the levels of the inventories, the setups and purchases from the external suppliers and also the production rates. The mathematical model takes many special properties regarding process industries into account. By using the results from the model and test different scenarios, the model can be used as an important support tool when making decisions. The decision support tool can for example be used in the company's budget process and thereby improve the chances of future profits increases.</jats:p>",

The proposed system takes into account the return of used end-of-life products from the market. Manufactured and re-manufactured products are stored in the manufacturing stock. The used end-of-life products are stored in the recovery inventory for remanufacturing. The vehicle transports products from the manufacturing stock to the purchasing warehouse. The objective of this work is to simultaneously evaluate the optimal capacities of manufacturing stock, purchasing warehouse and the vehicle, as well as the optimal value of returned used end-of-life products. Those four decision variables minimize the total cost function. A discrete flow model, which is supposed to be the most realistic, is used to describe the system. An optimization program, based on a genetic algorithm, is developed to find the decision variables. Numerical results are presented to study the influence of transportation time, unit remanufacturing cost and configuration of the manufacturing/remanufacturing machines on the decision variables.</jats:p>"

The term water supply includes the ensure of high quality water in general terms, for households, public needs and economic activities. The Republic of Serbia disposes with considerable underground and surface water resources, which are used for supplying, but it is required their rational utilization. The aim of this study is to show the current state of water supply on the territory of Serbia based on the analysis of the different indicators. One of the goal is to scan prevalent conditions and problems related to it and to propose optimal solutions. The survey includes an explanation of the long - term needs of the Republic of Serbia for fresh water (as well as share of different sources in the total water supply) and estimation of the possibility of satisfying that needs from available resources. On the base of that, there are adopted conclusions about basic directions of further development in the field of water management and water supply in Serbia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Analytical channel design tools have not advanced appreciably in the last decades, and continue to produce designs based upon a single representative discharge that may not lead to overall sediment continuity. It is beneficial for designers to know when a simplified design may be problematic and to efficiently produce alternative designs that approximate sediment balance over the entire flow regime. The Capacity/Supply Ratio (CSR) approach—an extension of the Copeland method of analytical channel design for sand channels—balances the sediment transport capacity of a design reach with the sediment supply of a stable upstream reach over the entire flow duration curve (FDC) rather than just a single discharge. Although CSR has a stronger physical basis than previous analytical channel design approaches, it has not been adopted in practice because it can be a cumbersome and time-consuming iterative analysis without the use of software. We investigate eighteen sand-bed rivers in a comparison of designs based on the CSR approach and five single-discharge metrics: the effective discharge (Qeff) or discharge that transports the most sediment over time; the 1.5-year recurrence interval discharge (Q1.5); the bankfull discharge (Qbf); and the discharges associated with 50th (Qs50) and 75th (Qs75) percentiles of the cumulative sediment yield curve. To facilitate this analysis, we developed a novel design tool using the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language in Excel® to produce stable channel slope/width combinations based on the CSR methodology for both sand- and gravel-bed streams. The CSR Stable Channel Design Tool’s (CSR Tool) code structure was based on Copeland’s method in SAM and HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System) and was tested with a single discharge to verify outputs. The Qs50 and Qs75 single-discharge designs match the CSR output most closely, followed by the Qbf, Qeff, and Q1.5. The Qeff proved to be the most inconsistent design metric because it can be highly dependent on the binning procedure used in the effectiveness analysis. Furthermore, we found that the more rigorous physical basis of the CSR analysis is potentially most important in designing “labile” channels with highly erodible substrate, high perennial flow “flashiness”, low width-to-depth ratio, and high incoming sediment load. The CSR Tool provides a resource for river restoration practitioners to efficiently utilize design techniques that can promote sediment balance in dynamic fluvial systems.</jats:p>"

The results of the linear three-step algorithm were almost coincident with, and in some cases superior to, those produced by more complex and burdensome algorithms.

It has been proved that in this period the supply of the skilled labour was steadily on the increase that was determined by the growth of both the number and share of people with higher education. The demand for the skilled labour of rural workers showed slower growth rates that resulted in an increasing gap between supply and demand. The research proves that education and qualification of rural workers are being underutilized, and the scale of education-occupation mismatch has been rather big. The most obvious contradiction between education underutilization and its non-purpose use - when people do not work in accordance with their specialization -  refer to the workers with technical and agricultural training.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the current status of energy supply and demand in Malawi; examines the major sources of energy, current exploitation status and their potential contribution to the electricity supply of the country; discusses key issues facing the energy sector; and identifies broad strategies to be implemented to tackle the energy supply challenges. Using secondary data for its critical analysis, the paper also presents modelling of long-term energy demand forecast in the economic sectors of Malawi using the Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) for a study period from 2008-2030. Three scenarios namely reference (REF), moderate growth (MGS) and accelerated growth (AGS) were formulated to simulate possible future long-term energy demand based on socio-economic and technological development with the base year of 2008. Results from all scenarios suggest an increased energy demand in consuming sectors with biomass being a dominant energy form in household and industry sectors in the study period. Forecast results reveal that energy demand will increase at an annual growth rate of 1.2% and reach 5160 ktoe in 2030 under REF scenario. The growth rates for MGS and AGS are projected at 1.5% each reaching 4639 ktoe and 5974 ktoe in 2030, respectively. The final electricity demand of about 105 ktoe in the base year will grow annually at average rates of 13.8%, 15.3% and 12.6% for REF, AGS and MGS, respectively. Over the study period 2008-2030 the annual electricity per capita will increase from about 111 kWh to 1062, 1418 and 844 kWh for the REF, AGS and MGS, respectively. The final energy intensity will decrease continuously from about 13.71 kWh/US$ in the base year to 3.88 kWh/US$, 2.98 kWh/US$ and 5.27 kWh/US$ for the REF, AGS and MGS, respectively in the year 2030. In conclusion, the paper outlines strategies that could be utilized to ensure adequate supply of modern energy which is a key ingredient for achieving sustainable social and economic growth.</jats:p>"

Determination of the water productivity index (WP) using the methods of optimization of cropping patterns and optimal water allocation is the most effective tool in water management in the agricultural sector. In this study, a non-linear optimization model was used to calculate the maximum WP in the Qazvin plain irrigation network. The proposed model was applied to six different water supply scenarios including 100% and 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of full irrigation volume. The results showed that the scenario of 60% of full irrigation could increase the WP index by 8.5%, while with the implementation of this scenario, the net benefit from the sale of agricultural products was reduced to the amount of 247 × 109 Iranian Rials (IRR), which was 28% less than the existing conditions in the region. Therefore, the 60% water supply was selected as the economical and efficient scenario in the irrigation of Qazvin plain. It can be claimed that the most important index in agricultural water management is the WP index.</jats:p>",

Leak detection is considered as one of the challenges faced by municipalities operating WDNs because it either involves shutting down the system or requires using expensive equipment and technologies. In this paper, a novel noninvasive and nondestructive methodology for detecting leaks in water pipes was tested. Ground penetrating radar was used for accurate determination of pipe location, followed by infrared (IR) thermographic imaging for determining the leak location using four different operating conditions. Results were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and pairwise comparison methods. Several factors were found to affect the accuracy of the proposed methodology in predicting the leak location, namely, the characteristics of the studied surface (i.e. emissivity), the characteristics of the surrounding environment (i.e. ambient temperature and relative humidity), and the operating conditions of the IR camera (i.e. speed and height of the camera). The results obtained in this study have also shown that under high ambient temperatures and high relative humidity conditions, a higher speed of the IR camera would reduce the impact of noise on the collected thermal contrast and therefore, would give better leak location prediction results. The tested methodology proved the flexibility of the approach and the ability of accurately predicting the leak locations under different conditions.</jats:p>",

This fact pushes organizations to a continuous search of the best strategy that will enable them to stand out in the market. Supply Chain Management, in its dual concept of coordinated demand and supply chains, represents an excellent opportunity to enhance the competitive advantage of companies. In relation to the demand chain, it can help to improve the knowledge of the customers and their needs, to develop their capacities for innovation and response, as well as to differentiate their products. With respect to the supply chain, it will focus the attention on increasing the flexibility in production capacity and delivery of products and services with less use of resources. For this reason, this study proposes to analyze the relationship between value creation and business results in some Spanish companies through supply chain processes. In order to do so, it describes a transactional non-experimental research employing the Technological Innovation Panel Database (PITEC).</jats:p>"

The World Customs Organization's SAFE Framework with its Authorized Economic Operators (AEO) program is one of the prominent supply chain security initiatives. At the time of its introduction in 2005, 168 member countries signed their support for its implementation. However, the last AEO Compendium reports only 69 countries currently have AEO program in place. This relatively slow development indicates the complexity of issues that might challenge countries to implement the initiative. Against this background, this paper aims to look at the AEO implementation in an environment where supply chain security initiative is relatively new. It focuses on policy development perspectives where the case study of Indonesia might represent challenges of other countries. Involving methods of desk research, interviews, and field observation, this paper starts with the development of various international supply chain security programs where the AEO finds it prominence. It follows with a discussion on the Indonesian AEO implementation where challenges and its policy development process are explored.</jats:p>",

High current is passed to the sample specimen placed inside the heater which needs to be heated at a very high temperature. The current pulse is generated by the capacitor discharge system.  Power supply for regular heater is suspended temporarily and capacitor is allowed to discharge using the Capacitor discharge heating. This is achieved by the instructions through the computer to the microcontroller. Current injection at the particular instant is done with the help of a software by initiating an interrupt from the computer. The interrupt pin of the microcontroller becomes high by this and the operation is initiated correspondingly. Thus the MSP430 receives the command to give the necessary pulse of current for heating at the required time. Feedback is received with regard to the position of the switches whether the particular SSR is ON or OFF.

In this study three different risk-based functions are used to drive optimal location of a given number of sensors in a water distribution network. A simple function based on likelihood of leak non-detection is compared with two other risk-based functions, where impact and exposure are combined with the leak detection likelihood. The impact is considered proportional to the demand water volume while the exposure is related to the importance of the connections and it is evaluated in social, economic or safety terms. The methods are applied to a district metered area of the Harrogate network by means of a modified EPANET model, to take into account the pressure-driven functioning conditions of the system. The results show that the exposure can lead to a different sensor location ranking with respect to other criteria used and hence the proposed methodology can represent a useful tool for water system managers to distribute the sensors in the network, complying with hydraulic, social and economical requirements.</jats:p>",

The TF-activated fVII (fVIIa) complex is an essential initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation process. Interactions between cancer cells and immune cells via coagulation factors and adhesion molecules can promote progression of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). This process is not necessarily advantageous, as tumor tissues generally undergo hypoxia due to aberrant vasculature, followed by reduced access to plasma components such as coagulation factors. However, hypoxia can activate TF expression. Expression of fVII, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines can be synergistically induced in EOC cells in response to hypoxia along with serum deprivation. Thus, pro-inflammatory responses associated with the TF-fVIIa–ICAM-1 interaction are expected within hypoxic tissues. Tumor tissue consists of multiple components such as stromal cells, interstitial fluid, albumin, and other micro-factors such as proton and metal ions. These factors, together with metabolism reprogramming in response to hypoxia and followed by functional modification of TF, may contribute to coagulation factor-driven inflammatory responses in EOC tissues. The aim of this review was to describe potential coagulation factor-driven inflammatory responses in hypoxic EOC tissues. Arguments were extended to clinical issues targeting this characteristic tumor environment.</jats:p>"

Traditional facility location models for supply chain design focus on the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of proximity, i.e., the distance between facilities and customers. These strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain’s agility, i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In particular, we show that it is optimal to increase the density of distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost parameter increases. Through these findings, our work conveys the message that traditional, proximity-based facility location models can be inadequate for designing modern responsive supply chains, and calls for the need to develop a new class of models for the task. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

However, there is no foolproof way of knowing whether the treated water is free of contaminants harmful for drinking and hence reliance on certified bottled water has increased worldwide. The bottling process right from treatment to delivery is highly unsustainable due to huge energy demand along the supply chain. As a step towards sustainability, we investigated various ways of coupling of membrane distillation (MD) process with solar domestic heaters for co-production of domestic heat and pure water. Performance dynamics of various integration techniques have been evaluated and appropriate configuration has been identified for real scale application. A solar combi MD (SCMD) system is experimentally tested for single household application for production 20 L/day of pure water and 250 L/day of hot water simultaneously without any auxiliary heating device. The efficiency of co-production system is compared with individual operation of solar heaters and solar membrane distillation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Against the backdrop of the claim that the rising growth rate of money is one of the major factors behind India’s recent bout of elevated and sticky inflation, this article asks: Is money supply exogenous or endogenous, and can it predict future inflation. This question is investigated using the monetarist framework of inflation. In the empirical analysis of data spanning from 1970–71 to 2009–10, the results of both the monetarist and the error-correction models suggest that money supply accounts for inflation in India. There is also the presence of an error-correction mechanism among money, inflation and output. However, a monetarist equation does not tell anything about causality. Thus, the vector autoregression (VAR) method is used to detect the direction of causality between money supply and the inflation rate. Findings from Granger causality tests suggest weak evidence of inflation (Granger) causing money supply. As a robustness check, we estimate VAR models using quarterly data and, further, using core inflation. The results of the causality tests from the quarterly data, the impulse response function and forecast error variance decomposition suggest that money supply is weakly endogenous. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: E31, E51, E52 </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway has produced conflicting results with regard to its benefit after cerebral ischemia, we examined one component of this pathway to determine its effects. We tested the hypothesis that activation of Akt would decrease infarct size and improve microregional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance after cerebral ischemia‐reperfusion. This was tested in isoflurane anesthetized rats with middle cerebral artery blockade for 1 hr and reperfusion for 2 hr with and without SC‐79 (Akt activator, 0.05 mg/kg, three times). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>‐iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small vessel (20–60 μm diameter) arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. There were no significant hemodynamic or blood gas differences between groups. The control ischemic‐reperfused cortex had a similar O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic‐reperfused cortex with many areas of low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (42 of 80 veins with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation below 50%). SC‐79 did not significantly affect cerebral O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption, but significantly improved O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance in the reperfused area (18 of 80 veins with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation below 50%). This was associated with a reduced cortical infarct size after Akt activation (13.3 ± 0.5% control vs 6.7 ± 0.3% SC‐79). This suggests that Akt activation is important for not only cell survival, but also for the control of local oxygen balance after cerebral ischemia‐reperfusion.</jats:p>",

Given this, a critical question that emerging research seeks to address is: is it even worth managing diverse workforce? Partly, this study addresses this question by examining the implications of managed-workforce diversity (MWD) on internal supply chain (SC) integration and business performance. Data was collected from one hundred and twenty six respondents using mainly questionnaires. The constructs employed to measure managed-workforce diversity, internal supply chain integration and business performance were together subjected to ANOVA, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Model (SEM) in LISREL 8.5. Analysis of the data gathered indicated that MWD is most likely to be beneficial in enhancing internal SC integration and then SC responsiveness; with the former benefit acting as a conduit through which the latter benefit is experienced. The study therefore argues that effective workforce diversity management is one that creates and maintains MWD (which is a positive affective climate where employees do not feel intimidated, looked down upon, or discriminated against just because of background differences), all of which are necessary for driving internal SC integration, SC responsiveness, and financial outcomes. The managerial implications and the theoretical relevance of the study’s findings are discussed in details.</jats:p>"

The biomass production facility of Biomass User Company is one of the most modern plant in Central Europe. It uses wooden and agricultural biomass to produce heat in biomass-fired steam boiler. The objective of the paper is to investigate the environmental impact with the use of life cycle assessment method. In our study, we define different scenarios for biomass transportation, concerning its supply as well as distribution. Life cycle assessment method is used to estimate environmental impact and to perform sensitivity analysis on transport modes, fuel mix structure and destination of self-cropped biomass. LCA ReCiPe endpoint indicator is used to measure environmental performance. As the results show, transport efforts are not significant factor while environmental impacts are concerned but are rather impact intensive type of activity and should be addressed with company environmental policies.</jats:p>",

This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the impact of river streamflow on the joint occurrence of water quality variables in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin (HRB). Using data from three representative stations, joint distributions were set up for two key water quality indexes, CODMn and NH3-N, for three different streamflow scenarios: low, medium and high streamflows, and the joint probabilities of different water quality combinations were calculated. The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between streamflow and the water quality index, while the water quality indexes were significantly positively correlated. In general, the higher the river streamflow, the lower the joint probability of water quality variables under the three scenarios in each station. It is concluded that, in both the main stream and the tributary, high streamflow scenarios do help to improve the joint probability of water quality combination under a higher water quality grade, compared with a decrease under a lower quality grade. This study is expected to provide scientific references for water quality management and implementation of water pollution prevention in the HRB.</jats:p>",

Content validity of the questionnaire has been confirmed by experts in this field; its reliability has been confirmed by using Cronbach's alpha and Fisher’s test. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to ensure normality of the data obtained from questionnaire. The hypotheses are tested using SmartPLS software. Results show that the model is well fitted to the data. Findings show that a lean and agile supply chain is effective on supply chain performance and supply chain performance is effective on firm performance. Efficiency of information systems moderates the effect of lean supply chain on supply chain performance and firm performance. However, flexibility of information systems does not moderate the effect of agile supply chain on supply chain performance and firm performance.</jats:p>"

The methodology used is the case study approach. The Authors examined the Port of Salerno (Italy) and re-conceptualized it as a smart port service system. The originality of the work lies in the application of service science as a lens to re-conceptualize the port supply chain, that allows the implementation of a logistic framework. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided to enrich the literature about port supply chains and to support port operators.</jats:p>"

However, barriers presently exist that prevent Vietnamese firms from fully integrating into the supply chain of these global actors. Weak FDI overflow and block trading has government officials and business executives troubled that Vietnamese firms are still on the periphery of these global supply networks. Even as MNCs operating in Vietnam import many semi-finished products from other countries, Vietnamese firms are not benefiting from the opportunities to incorporate into the supply chain because of the lack of global experience, FDI, an educated workforce and outdated facilities. Vietnamese firms must upgrade their facilities and equip their labor forces to acquire MNC contracts and find global partners who can supply financing and knowhow.</jats:p>",

The quantitative data collected was further analysed using SPSS for descriptive and inferential statistics while the qualitative data was analysed using content analysis.Findings: The study findings showed that procurement process contributed to effective and efficient service delivery in MONUSCO. However, the found relationship between procurement process and service delivery to be very weak. It was found that contracts were awarded to suppliers who met products/materials technical specifications which ensured clear meeting of product standards and service delivery in all MONUSCO user departments. Contracts were awarded to vendors who offer lower price which implied that the bidder with the lowest price is always considered for contract award in MONUSCO ESB. The study found that some vendors did not meet all the terms of contracts as agreed at the time of contract award at the MONUSCO ESB and that to some extent the organization had not taken full appropriate correction measures against non performing vendors. This has to some extent affected the service delivery levels of MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base. It was also found that to a larger extent most vendors had a delivery schedule as per the user department requirements. This meant that the vendors draw and share the supply delivery schedule with the user departments in MONUSCO ESB.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the management needs to ensure that the procurement activities are accomplished in line with the outcome measures. MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base should focus on implementing strict procurement practices that must be followed with contract value thresholds dictating the procurement practices to be adopted by all MONUSCO sections.</jats:p>"

Over the two last decades, the studied desalination unit was supplying a 1,200 bed hotel. The feed water was driven from a well near the sea. The desalination unit has two stages giving an average recovery equal to 81%. The behaviour of all water streams with respect to aggressiveness and scaling tendency was assessed. The second stage reject water was shown to exhibit a very high scaling behaviour with an instantaneous precipitation in the absence of feed water pH adjustment. The analyses have shown that the produced water was very aggressive. The second stage module autopsy has revealed a sharp decrease in the membrane performances because of mineral as well as organic fouling. The inorganic scale was essentially made of coesite, calcite and kaolinite clay. The presence of silica and clay was attributed to an inadequate pre-treatment process, whereas the presence of calcite crystals at the membrane surface reveals that the chemical inhibition performed at the pre-treatment process without adjusting the pH was not able to prevent calcium carbonate precipitation. A periodic acid wash of the second stage membranes is then necessary to guarantee the desired objectives of this stage.</jats:p>",

To date, however, no empirical research has integrated these two research streams. Drawing upon social exchange theory, the authors propose a holistic research framework to explore the relationships among collaborative activities, the inter-organizational relationship quality, and supply chain performance. Specifically, they examine the mediating effect of relationship quality on the association between collaborative activities and supply chain performance. The research model is then tested using survey data (n=219). The authors' results illustrate a positive impact of both collaborative activities and relationship quality on enhancing supply chain performance. Moreover, this paper also supports the hypothesis that relationship quality mediates the relationship between collaborative activities and supply chain performance in third party logistics.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chains of complex construction projects are characterized by multi-disciplinary participants, adversarial short-term relationships and fragmentations in project delivery procedures. Multi-disciplinary participants tend to make deci­sions on project activities based on their own objectives and value systems independently with little regard of holistic project performance. The lack of common values results in a limited understanding of how behaviors of one discipline impact on the related disciplines. This has led to tons of interface conflicts which ultimately affect project effectiveness. This paper investi­gates this problem by discussing Interface Value for the core players to understand the value-driven behaviors on the boundaries among owner and multiple prime contractors in complex construction projects. Two types of interface conflicts are recognized and defined. Value Optimization Strategy is proposed under status quo delivery methods by adjusting and reallocating interface responsibilities between related contractors. Improvements of procurement procedures are the key solutions to interface con­flicts. Prospects of integrated project delivery (IPD) in eliminating interface conflicts are also discussed. The paper concludes that Value Optimization Strategy and IPD-based approach are expected to eliminate interface conflicts of complex construction projects, integrate the complex supply chain and lower the potential risks for project delivery delay and cost overrun.</jats:p>",

The study found that procurement planning had led to improved levels of MONUSCO operations in the areas of humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, development assistance to affected communities. The study further found that staff are involved in the identification and definition of the needs of user sections and that the Statement of Requirements (SOR)/or Scope of Work (SOW) was important in their respective sections. These had aided in full scale involvement of relevant stakeholders in the procurement planning activities of MONUSCO ESB.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends a clear determination of specifications in terms of required quality and quantities by the end-user departments in MONUSCO ESB. Planning and determination of needs should be done early to allow enough time to initiate the procurement process. The study further recommends that the procurement department should always engage all concerned stakeholders in determining the materials and service specification for quality assurance during service delivery.

The study made an effort to find out, how different kinds of ISs help the supply chain to achieve greater OP. Three constructs, namely, operational IS, strategic IS and infrastructural IS, have been identified from literature. Four plant-level supply chain constructs, namely, strategic supplier partnership, information sharing and information quality, purchasing management and inventory management, have been identified. The co-relation between ISs, supply chain practices and OP has been tested. Finally, both ISs and supply chain impact on OP have been evaluated. The ISs create an indirect impact on OP via supply chain practices, which results in OP. The OP can be in the form of reduction in number of defects in operations, quality improvement in products, delivery of products or raw material at right place, at right time and in right quantity. The study leads to interesting implications for practitioners. The ISs should be connected at various levels, that is, operational, strategic and infrastructural, to support the entire supply chain. With the changing dynamics of accuracy and speed in operations and the target of achieving economies of scale, the role of ISs becomes critical in the entire supply chain. The supply chain and information technology practices impact on OP has been studied by the number of authors. However, the classification of ISs and plant-level supply chain impact on OP has not been studied in detail by authors. </jats:p>",

Here we find that mTORC1 controls a transcriptional program encoding amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes through a mechanism also used to regulate protein synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of mTORC1‐responsive mRNAs identified a promoter element recognized by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key effector of the integrated stress response. ATF4 translation is normally induced by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) through a mechanism that requires upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the ATF4 5′ UTR. mTORC1 also controls ATF4 translation through uORFs, but independent of changes in eIF2α phosphorylation. mTORC1 instead employs the 4E‐binding protein (4E‐BP) family of translation repressors. These results link mTORC1‐regulated demand for protein synthesis with an ATF4‐regulated transcriptional program that controls the supply of amino acids to the translation machinery.</jats:p>",

This does not include the numerous undocumented signs of prostate cancer identified postmortem. In 2015, it was estimated that in 2016 there would be180,890 new cases of prostate cancer and the disease would cause 26,120 deaths. The vasculature of the prostate differs among individuals, and is not completely understood. Typically, the prostate is supplied by arteries arising from the internal pudendal artery, however there are many undefined variations. The position of the prostate makes it difficult to study during standard gross anatomy course dissection. This study involved development of a protocol for isolation and examination of cadaveric prostates.</jats:p><jats:p>It was found that observation of the prostate gland was enhanced by isolating the pelvic region. This involved careful removal of the sigmoid colon followed by cuts through both thighs including the femur just inferior to the inguinal region ligament. The vertebral column was detached from the sacrum by cutting through the intervertebral disc between L5 and the sacrum. Once the pelvis was isolated it could be positioned to allow access to the internal iliac artery. The branches of internal iliac were then identified. This was then followed by a midsaggital cut through the entire pelvis enabling greater access to the prostate gland. This also allowed for confirmation of the targets of the branches of the internal iliac and for further dissection revealing how those branches continued into the prostate. Future studies will involve examination of the arterial supply of the prostates of 12 male cadavers. Further understanding of the prostate arterial supply may lead to innovation regarding treatment of prostate cancer.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>Work supported by the Department of Biology and Mathematics, D'Youville College.</jats:p>",

The target population comprised of 261 employees of MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base holding international, United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and National contracts. Random and purposive sampling techniques were specifically used to select samples for this study. Data was collected using questionnaires and interview guides. The quantitative data collected was further analysed using SPSS for descriptive and inferential statistics while the qualitative data was analysed using content analysis.Findings: The study findings showed that procurement process contributed to effective and efficient service delivery in MONUSCO. However, the found relationship between procurement process and service delivery to be very weak. It was found that contracts were awarded to suppliers who met products/materials technical specifications which ensured clear meeting of product standards and service delivery in all MONUSCO user departments. Contracts were awarded to vendors who offer lower price which implied that the bidder with the lowest price is always considered for contract award in MONUSCO ESB. The study found that some vendors did not meet all the terms of contracts as agreed at the time of contract award at the MONUSCO ESB and that to some extent the organization had not taken full appropriate correction measures against non performing vendors. This has to some extent affected the service delivery levels of MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base. It was also found that to a larger extent most vendors had a delivery schedule as per the user department requirements. This meant that the vendors draw and share the supply delivery schedule with the user departments in MONUSCO ESB.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the management needs to ensure that the procurement activities are accomplished in line with the outcome measures. MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base should focus on implementing strict procurement practices that must be followed with contract value thresholds dictating the procurement practices to be adopted by all MONUSCO sections.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we generated an optimal geostatistical model for measuring groundwater levels. Furthermore, we proposed that universal kriging is a suitable method for examining groundwater spatial variations, whereas a raster-based model can provide high accuracy for studying groundwater fluctuations; the nugget effect value of groundwater levels increases with increasing exploitation intensity. Our results indicated that groundwater levels increased overall in the early stages of wastewater irrigation development, followed by local increases in some pockets in the middle stages of development, large-scale increases in the late stages and an increasing variation of magnitude over time. The results also showed that groundwater level declined less on farmlands than that in urban areas, suggesting that wastewater irrigation facilitates groundwater conservation by reducing groundwater exploitation and enhancing groundwater recharge. Our results are conducive to developing an effective groundwater management plan and for improving the accuracy of groundwater resource assessments.</jats:p>",

To scientifically analyze its economic efficiency, this paper employs a projection pursuit clustering model based on the real-coded accelerated genetic algorithm to reduce the number of output index systems for each year, and the relative economic efficiency is obtained for 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province during the period 2007–2012 using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The spatial distribution regulation is described based on the average efficiency derived for the period 2007–2012. Finally, the output values are optimized for ineffective cities under the optimization principle according to the 2012 values. The results show that the output index system is different for each year. Most cities exhibit comprehensive effectiveness, and the development of water conservancy is generally good. The spatial distribution regulation of economic efficiency tends to be high in the south and low in the north because it is related to local economic development and water policies. To achieve comprehensive effectiveness, the output indices need to be adjusted. This study assists with the promotion of efficient development plans for water conservancy systems and the economic efficiency of water conservancy investment in Heilongjiang Province.</jats:p>",

High temperature experiments were performed to investigate the melting length of Fe-C alloy under different power and frequency conditions. The heating effect was analyzed, and the method of magnetic shielding to reduce the power loss of power supply was put forward. The results show that when the power is 40 kW and frequency is 25 kHz, the melting length of the Fe-C alloy is 89.2 mm in 120 s, which meets the requirements of steel teeming. In addition, when magnetic shielding material is installed under the induction coil, the power loss is reduced by about 64 %, effectively improving the heating effect of power supply.</jats:p>",

This dust‐borne input of Fe is particularly important to the Southern Ocean, which is arguably the most biogeochemically important ocean because of its large spatial extent and its considerable influence on the global carbon cycle. However, there is large uncertainty in estimates of dust emissions in the Southern Hemisphere and thus of the deposition of Fe‐containing aerosols onto oceans. Here we hypothesize that sparsely vegetated surfaces in arid and semiarid regions are important sources of Fe‐containing aerosols to the Southern Ocean. We test this hypothesis using an improved dust emission scheme in conjunction with satellite products of vegetation cover and soil moisture in an atmospheric chemistry transport model. Our improved model shows a twofold increase of Fe input into the Southern Ocean in austral summer with respect to spring and estimates that the Fe input is more than double that simulated using a conventional dust emission scheme in summer. Our model results suggest that dust emissions from open shrublands contribute over 90% of total Fe deposition into the Southern Ocean. These findings have important implications for the projection of the Southern Ocean's carbon uptake.</jats:p>",

The effects are amplified when the region has high population density and important economic activities such as the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR), whose population is 3.8 million inhabitants, corresponding to 51% of the urban population in Pernambuco State. The Pirapama reservoir was designed to produce 5.6 m3/s, which corresponds to 37% of the total water demand of the RMR. The objective of the paper is to define strategies for the Pirapama reservoir operation by using guide curves and taking into account the climate variability, particularly drought events, to minimize or even avoid the conditions of rationing and collapse of its storage. The rainfall-runoff model SMAP was used to simulate input streamflow in the period 1933-2014 and the water allocation model Acquanet was used to simulate the operation rules proposed. The guide curves were defined based on the Standard Runoff Index, which classify the input inflow in drought categories. For each drought category, a response goal was defined for withdrawal reduction. This strategy may be an efficient tool to deal with the climate variability present in Northeast Brazil, which can be amplified with the effects of the climate change. In this sense, the development of sustainable operation rules can be considered an adaptation measure for reducing the impacts of possible climate changes in the future.</jats:p>"

Within food groups, the consumption of more nutritious options (i.e. compliant with NNPS) did not appear to be associated with their availability (Figure). In dairy products, grain‐based products, sweets and beverages, and processed fruits, more nutritious options were more likely to be consumed. The opposite was observed in the other food groups.

For some groups there was a selection towards products with a better nutrient profile, meaning that the reformulation of these categories may be more easily accepted by consumers. For categories in which consumption of foods with a better profile was low, more efforts should be put on the sensory characteristics of reformulated products.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>This study was funded by Nestec SA.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Given that 31–40% of the food produced in the US is wasted, this food may contain substantial amounts of macronutrients, micronutrients, and fiber. This is especially important in light of the fact that some nutrients are underconsumed in the US, including dietary fiber, calcium, potassium, and vitamin D. The objective of this research was to estimate the nutrient composition of food wasted at the retail and consumer levels in the US, and to express the magnitude of these losses in relation to the current and recommended dietary intakes for adults in the US.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>The US Department of Agriculture Loss‐Adjusted Food Availability Data Series was used to identify the amount of per capita annual food loss from the retail and consumer levels for 213 commodities in 2012. Each commodity was matched to a representative food or group of foods in the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference‐Release 28 (SR‐28), and then SR‐28 was used to determine the nutrient composition for a standard amount (100g) of each commodity. The amount of each nutrient present in the amount of wasted food at the retail and consumer levels was summed by nutrient to estimate overall losses per capita per day in the US food supply. The magnitude of losses was expressed in comparison to recommended dietary intakes, gaps between recommended and mean current intakes, and the amount of food that could be cost‐effectively recovered.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>REUSLTS</jats:title><jats:p>For 213 commodities representing the US food supply in 2012, waste at the retail and consumer levels represented an average per capita per day loss of 1217 calories, 147 g carbohydrates, 33 g protein, 57 g total fat, 5.9 g dietary fiber, 186 mg calcium, 88 mg potassium, and 1.7 mcg vitamin D. To use dietary fiber as an example, the amount of dietary fiber wasted per the total 2012 US population is equivalent to the gap between mean current intakes and recommended intakes for 206 million adult women or 104 million adult men. The contribution of various food groups to the loss of each nutrient is explored; for example, 39% of the loss of dietary fiber was due to waste of grains, 34% to waste of vegetables, and 22% to waste of fruits.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title><jats:p>This study is the first estimate of the loss of a comprehensive array of nutrients for a set of commodities that represent the US food supply. The findings demonstrate that a substantial amount of nutrients is embedded within food wasted at the retail and consumer levels of the US food supply, including nutrients that are currently underconsumed. These findings should not imply that all nutrient content from wasted food could realistically be recovered for human consumption, but they highlight the importance of promoting efforts to improve food recovery and prevent food waste; these efforts have the potential to prevent waste of important nutrients, while also saving money and natural resources.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>This research was funded by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) with a gift from the GRACE Communications Foundation (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://www.gracelinks.org\">www.gracelinks.org</jats:ext-link>).

In addition, the cerebellum is known to be related with the cognitive function. The dentate nucleus is the largest deep nucleus in human cerebellum. The dentate nucleus is known to have somatotopic arrangement in itself in relation with the upper limb and lower limb. Series of cognitive function tests revealed that the areas for different cognitive domains are located in specific arrangement in the dentate nucleus as well. However, the mapping of arterial supply to each regions of the dentate nucleus by cerebellar arteries has not been clarified anatomically. The aims of this study are to clarify the arterial territories in the dentate nucleus and to match them with the known somatotopy and the arrangement of cognitive area in the dentate nucleus which should be useful for research and clinical situation of various cerebellar diseases. Fourteen cerebellar hemispheres from seven adult cadavers were used in this study. Red‐colored radio‐opaque silicon dye was injected into the vertebral arteries or their branches supplying the cerebellum. Computed tomographs of the cerebellar hemispheres were taken. The cerebellar hemispheres were sliced into sections of 5 mm thickness. The sliced cerebellar hemispheres were stained by Mulligan method. The stained sections were microdissectioned under surgical microscopes. Most of the dentate nuclei were mainly supplied by three or four direct branches of superior cerebellar arteries and two or three direct branches of posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. Between the known suppliers to the dentate nucleus, the superior cerebellar artery is more dominant for dorsal side of the dentate nucleus, whereas the dominant artery for the ventral side of the dentate nucleus is the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.</jats:p>",

The decrease of water losses in water supply networks can help preserve such a rare resource. Low number of water meters and intermittent supply make it difficult to quantify the leaking volumes of water. This article presents an analysis of the consumption for drinking water based on an extrapolation from a sample of consumers on whom data are available. Comparison of the volumes of water produced allows a determination of the losses in the water supply system. This analysis is completed by measurements of night flows. The results obtained may be relied on for an evaluation of the needs for drinking water in the South of Algeria, and for future regional development. The study indicates a high rate of water losses in the distribution network, reaching about 40%, and over-consumption due to an insufficient number of water meters and discontinuous supply. It is recommended that water meters come into general use and defective parts of the network are rehabilitated.

The target population comprised of 261 employees of MONUSCO Entebbe Support Base holding international, United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and National contracts. Random and purposive sampling techniques were specifically used to select samples for this study. Data was collected using questionnaires and interview guides. The quantitative data collected was further analysed using SPSS for descriptive and inferential statistics while the qualitative data was analysed using content analysis.Findings: The study findings showed that there is procurement planning in most MONUSCO sections; that funds are available before planning; that staff are involved in procurement planning in their respective sections; and that procurement planning contributes to achieve the maximum value for expenditures on goods/services and works to be delivered at MONUSCO sections. The study found that procurement planning had led to improved levels of MONUSCO operations in the areas of humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, development assistance to affected communities. The study further found that staff are involved in the identification and definition of the needs of user sections and that the Statement of Requirements (SOR)/or Scope of Work (SOW) was important in their respective sections. These had aided in full scale involvement of relevant stakeholders in the procurement planning activities of MONUSCO ESB.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends a clear determination of specifications in terms of required quality and quantities by the end-user departments in MONUSCO ESB. Planning and determination of needs should be done early to allow enough time to initiate the procurement process. The study further recommends that the procurement department should always engage all concerned stakeholders in determining the materials and service specification for quality assurance during service delivery. This will enable the sections to always get the quantity of items as requested by end-users, in their right quantity, right quality and at the right time.</jats:p>"

The effects are amplified when the region has high population density and important economic activities such as the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR), whose population is 3.8 million inhabitants, corresponding to 51% of the urban population in Pernambuco State. The Pirapama reservoir was designed to produce 5.6 m3/s, which corresponds to 37% of the total water demand of the RMR. The objective of the paper is to define strategies for the Pirapama reservoir operation by using guide curves and taking into account the climate variability, particularly drought events, to minimize or even avoid the conditions of rationing and collapse of its storage. The rainfall-runoff model SMAP was used to simulate input streamflow in the period 1933-2014 and the water allocation model Acquanet was used to simulate the operation rules proposed. The guide curves were defined based on the Standard Runoff Index, which classify the input inflow in drought categories. For each drought category, a response goal was defined for withdrawal reduction. This strategy may be an efficient tool to deal with the climate variability present in Northeast Brazil, which can be amplified with the effects of the climate change. In this sense, the development of sustainable operation rules can be considered an adaptation measure for reducing the impacts of possible climate changes in the future.</jats:p>"

In this contribution, we show that through a suitable ignition assistance, via temporary application of a high voltage (∼600 V) to the substrate holder or auxiliary electrode, the magnetron discharge can be ignited using a conventional mid-frequency power supply without matching network. Once the discharge is ignited, the assisting voltage can be reduced to less than 50 V, and after the boron target surface is at elevated temperature, thereby exhibiting sufficient conductivity, the assisting voltage can be turned off. The deposition of boron and boron nitride films has been demonstrated with a deposition rate of approximately 400 nm/h for a power of 250 W.</jats:p>",

For a company to survive, it is necessary to attract enough customers to generate profitability and because of high uncertainty in the environment, it requires a more rapid response to the needs of customers. Changing competitive conditions and increasing levels of environmental complexity have caused companies to consider agility conception. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the positive effects of supply chain agility on green performance in the Yazd ceramic tile manufacturing industry. To achieve this goal, after studying the literature review of each variable, a conceptual model with seven hypotheses was proposed. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore these relationships. Thus, according to the findings of this study, supply chain agility positively influences green performance by mediating organizational strategy, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. Additionally, development of this relationship involves improvement in applying new technology (agility), setting goals (strategy), solving consumer problems (customer satisfaction), profitability (financial performance), and environmental policies (green performance).

This was done to ascertain the level of organic contamination in the wells located in the study area. The analysis of water samples from boreholes close to the dumpsite was done to constrain the interpretation of electrical resistivity data on the reality of the effect imposed by dumpsite leachate on the hydrolithofacies. The resistivity values of the underlying layers were observed to be lower than the overlying layer, an effect which may be associated with the infiltration of leachate into the underlying layers. The geohydrolayer resistivities range from 78.4 to 1,669.8 Ωm. The contour maps generated display the variations of the parameters. The elevation contour map indicates the flow of groundwater in a southwest–northeast direction which also depicts the direction of leachate flow. The physicochemical water samples show differences in concentrations of the physicochemical parameters. The concentrations of the ions in the water samples measured are compared with the WHO standard for drinking water. The sodium absorption ratio and sodium percentage show that the groundwater within the dumpsite has no negative effect on the subsurface.</jats:p>",

This condition has led to reductions in available groundwater resources, and has even restricted the economic development of Beijing. However, an opportunity has been provided for groundwater recharge, since considerable storage space has been created by this overexploitation. At the beginning of the South-to-North Water Diversion, more water will be transferred to Beijing, because of the supporting infrastructure that is under construction in other cities. Therefore, the underground reservoir in Miyun, Huairou and Shunyi (MHS) district was taken as the study object, and geological exploration and GIS overlay techniques were used to determine the extent and storage capacity of this underground reservoir. The rivers in MHS district were investigated to identify which ones provide suitable places for recharge. Furthermore, a numerical model was built to forecast the groundwater flow field and water level, and an optimal storage program was proposed. The results of this study provide technical guidance for recharge, as well as the safe storage and rational use of the water provided by the South-to-North Water Diversion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Operational-level flexibility in the choice of silvicultural treatments allows mitigatation of the impact of uncertain demand on supply chain performance. Silvicultural treatments dictate the species and quantity harvested from forest stands. However, their impact on wood supply sustainability is not clearly understood. This study proposes a simulation–optimization system to model hierarchical forest management planning with an objective to examine the impact. The system consists of mathematical models to develop hierarchical plans, i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational. In the system, the strategic model is first solved to determine the annual allowable cut. Next, the tactical model allocates cutblocks to annual plans, also prescribing silvicultural treatments. The subsequent operational-level model generates monthly plans in a rolling planning basis to satisfy prevailing demand. Upon execution of all operational-level plans, the forest inventory is updated and the change in annual allowable cut is evaluated. The system was implemented in a case study in Quebec, Canada. Permitting silvicultural flexibility at the operational level led to profit improvements between 2% and 3.7% over a 100 year horizon. Significant impact on long-term wood supply was not observed in this case. The proposed system can help forest planners and supply chain managers better integrate their respective needs. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the authors have tried to propose an agile strategy for the supply chain of a steel company, which ranks 3rd in Iran in Gross Sale with 16,000 employees, in order to respond quickly to ever-changing needs. To do this, through the literature review the framework of balanced scorecard was utilized to structure agility factors in the supply chain of the steel industry. Then the experts were interviewed to reconcile on the factors identified. Utilizing 24 questionnaires by the use of Interpretive Structural Modeling framework, the relationship and sequence of factors were obtained from experts. The final model developed in the paper presents the agility factors for the steel industry supply chain. Also, these factors are grouped within the four perspectives of the BSC to better enhance the results and pursue action. The ISM method identifies the priority of each factor which provides a better understanding of the underlying relationship of the factors for the managers to implement the strategies more reliably. The proposed model for strategy formulation can be utilized in strategy formulation problems over various types of supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, the vulnerabilities in the IoT supply chain have raised serious concerns about the security and trustworthiness of IoT devices and components within them. Testing for device provenance, detection of counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) and systems, and traceability of IoT devices are challenging issues to address. In this article, we develop a novel radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based system suitable for counterfeit detection, traceability, and authentication in the IoT supply chain called\n            <jats:italic>CDTA</jats:italic>\n            . CDTA is composed of different types of on-chip sensors and in-system structures that collect necessary information to detect multiple counterfeit IC types (recycled, cloned, etc.), track and trace IoT devices, and verify the overall system authenticity. Central to CDTA is an RFID tag employed as storage and a channel to read the information from different types of chips on the printed circuit board (PCB) in both power-on and power-off scenarios. CDTA sensor data can also be sent to the remote server for authentication via an encrypted Ethernet channel when the IoT device is deployed in the field. A novel board ID generator is implemented by combining outputs of physical unclonable functions (PUFs) embedded in the RFID tag and different chips on the PCB. A light-weight RFID protocol is proposed to enable mutual authentication between RFID readers and tags. We also implement a secure interchip communication on the PCB. Simulations and experimental results using Spartan 3E FPGAs demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. The efficiency of the radio-frequency (RF) communication has also been verified via a PCB prototype with a printed slot antenna.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bioenergy is an important renewable energy source in the UK, but the bioenergy industry and in particular the wood fuel sub sector, is relatively under-developed. Socioeconomic factors have been identified as critical for facilitating deployment levels and sustainable development. However, previous studies have mostly assessed these factors using quantitative methods and models, which are limited in assessing pertinent contextual factors such as institutional/regulatory governance, supply chain structure and governance, capital resource availability as well as actor decisions. As a step further, this research engages with these under-explored aspects of the system by developing a new analytical framework: the Resilience and Livelihoods in Supply Chains (RELISC) framework, which was designed by linking Value Chain Analysis, the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach and a supply chain resilience framework. Its application to a UK wood fuel supply chain produced useful insights. For example, the structure of the chain revealed a high level of dependency on a particular end user and contractor. Key institutional governance was critical in sustaining natural resources and providing access to finance. Internal supply chain governance was limited in ensuring the sustainability of resources and lack of actor awareness and interest were also limiting factors. In addition, five capital analyses revealed gaps in skills, networking and physical infrastructure. Finally, the design of the novel RELISC framework enables it to engage with diverse aspects of the system holistically and its application generated practical recommendations and strategies for supply chain resilience and sector growth, which are useful and applicable to other emerging sectors.</jats:p>"

The metabolic role of GNMT in folate‐mediated one‐carbon metabolism and how glycine supply may affect one carbon metabolic kinetics are under investigated in the present study. Hepatocyte‐derived cell‐lines with and without GNMT expression were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) with and without high glycine supply. Methylene‐tetrahydrofolate (mTHF) utilization and endogenous formate biosynthesis were carefully investigated using stable isotopic tracers and GC‐MS. We discovered that high glycine inhibits the M+1 specie enrichments in deoxythymidine (dT+1) from <jats:sup>2,3,3</jats:sup>D3‐serine, suggesting that high glycine may inhibit endogenous formate production in these <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> models. In a parallel experiment that exogenous formate was used as the 1C source, enrichments in dT+1 significantly increased from exogenous formate, supporting our hypothesis that high glycine inhibits endogenous formate production for thymidine synthesis. Mice fed in amino acid based diet supplemented with high glycine had significantly lower plasma formate concentrations that provide in vivo evidence on our hypothesis. On the other hand, high glycine promotes M+1 specie enrichments in methionine from <jats:sup>2,3,3</jats:sup>D3‐serine, indicating that high glycine supply may favor the utilization of methyleneTHF derived one carbon for homocysteine remethylation. High glycine supply can promote folate dependent methionine synthesis in our cell models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The placenta performs an indispensable function delivering essential nutrients for fetal growth. In humans, evidence indicates that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) acts as a placental nutrient sensor that could alter the activity of placental amino acid (AA) transporters. We hypothesized that increasing methionine supply during late pregnancy improves placental nutrient transport in dairy cows through the mTOR pathway. To test our hypothesis, sixty‐one multiparous cows were fed the experimental treatments consisting of a basal control [CON; n=31; 1.47 Mcal/kg dry matter (DM) and 15.3% crude protein (CP)] diet with no added methionine or the basal diet plus rumen‐protected methionine (MET; Mepron®, Evonik Nutrition &amp; Care GmbH, Germany; n=30). Placentome samples were collected from 15 cows per treatment based on body condition score of the cows at −30 days before parturition (3.64 ± 0.3; scale 1 to 5), number of days that the cows received the treatments (27 ± 1.8), calf sex (eight females and seven males per treatment) and calf birthweight (94 kg ± 10). Methionine was supplied from −28 days to parturition at a rate of 0.09% of diet DM. From −45 to −29 days before expected parturition, all cows received the same diet (1.33 Mcal/kg DM and 13.9% CP) with no MET. <jats:italic>mTOR</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>RPS6KB1</jats:italic> (ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta‐1) had greater (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ 0.07) mRNA expression in cows that received MET compared with CON, whereas <jats:italic>AKT1, EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, EEF1A1, ELF2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>IRS</jats:italic> expression was not altered (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.10).

In contrast, expression of the betaine transporter (<jats:italic>SLC6A12</jats:italic>) was lower (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.06) in cows fed MET. The genes <jats:italic>SLC1A1, SLC1A5</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>SLC6A6, SLC7A8, SLC38A6</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SLC38A7</jats:italic> that encode amino acid transporters were not affected (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.10) by methionine supply. Among glucose transporters analyzed, both facilitated transporters <jats:italic>SLC2A1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SLC2A3</jats:italic> had greater (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.06) mRNA expression in MET cows, while <jats:italic>SLC2A8</jats:italic> was lower (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.07).

Regarding the fatty acid transporters, MET cows had lower (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.06) expression of <jats:italic>SLC27A1,</jats:italic> while <jats:italic>SLC27A2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SLC27A3</jats:italic> were not affected (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.10)<jats:italic>.</jats:italic> The sodium/multivitamin and iodine cotransporter (<jats:italic>SLC5A6</jats:italic>) had greater expression (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.09) in MET cows.

Overall, our results indicate that increasing methionine supply during late gestation increases utero‐placental transport of nutrients and it is mediated, at least in part, by the mTOR pathway.</jats:p>",

With respect to the total cost, the aim is determining opened plants and DCs and designing transportation trees between the facilities. Considering the capacity of suppliers, plants and DCs are limited and there is a limitation on the maximum number of opened plants and DCs, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of the problem is presented. Since multi-stage supply chain networks have been recognized as NP-hard problems, applying priority-based encoding and a four-step backward decoding procedure, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely GAIWO, based on the best features of genetic algorithm (GA) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) is designed to solve the problem. In small size problems, the efficiency of the GAIWO is checked by solutions of GAMS software. For larger size problems, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with four evolutionary algorithms in both aspects of the structure of the GAIWO and the efficiency of the proposed encoding–decoding procedure. Besides usual evaluation criteria, Wilcoxon test and a chess rating system are used for evaluating and ranking the algorithms. The results show higher efficiency of the proposed approach. </jats:p>",

These galaxies are among our best candidates for being massive galaxies near the end of their active formation period, when intense star formation, quasar activity, and powerful radio jets all co-exist. All galaxies have VLT/SINFONI imaging spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical line emission, showing extended emission-line regions with large velocity offsets (up to 1500 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and line widths (typically 800–1000 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) consistent with very turbulent, often outflowing gas. As part of the HeRGÉ sample, they also have FIR estimates of the star formation and quasar activity obtained with <jats:italic>Herschel</jats:italic>/PACS and SPIRE, which enables us to measure the relative energy and momentum release from each of the three main sources of feedback in massive, star-forming AGN host galaxies during their most rapid formation phase. We find that star formation falls short by factors 10−1000 of providing the energy and momentum necessary to power the observed gas kinematics. The obscured quasars in the nuclei of these galaxies provide enough energy and momentum in about half of the sample, however, only if both are transferred to the gas relatively efficiently. We compare with theoretical and observational constraints on the efficiency of the energy and momentum transfer from jet and AGN radiation, which favors the radio jets as main drivers of the gas kinematics.</jats:p>",

A preset questionnaire was used for recording the biomass weight of different ASF and fish in every four days interval in March, 2016. It was found that the supply of ASF (beef, chevon, chicken and egg) and fish in the metropolitan markets (80.20 and 35.89 t/d, respectively) was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than any municipality wet market in the district (7.66 and 3.03 t/d, respectively). The market supply of biomass and its protein value of ASF were 3.64 and 4.33 times higher than fish. The chicken shared the highest amount of protein (28.19 %) followed by fish (26.8%), beef (26.21%), eggs (11.46%) and chevon (7.34%) during the study period. However, this initial work does not include milk, and the wet market of ASF and fish may have seasonal variations which needs to be explored through further research. In addition to them, socioeconomic status of consumers and regional variations are important which needs to be studied for addressing resource base safe food production help the strategic reduction of food insecurity in the country by 2030.Res.

However, in real-life operation the variability of said parameters decreases the link profits. Thus, a cooperative arrangement may be devised in which a link agrees to reduce the variability of its behavior to enhance the performance of other links, receiving compensation in return. This work shows the application of simulation and decision trees to assess the feasibility of this cooperation scheme, from the perspective of the central link of a three member supply chain. First, the operational parameters of the link are optimized for mean values of the variables set by adjacent members. Then, by simulating the system for different probability distributions of these variables, graphs of the expected link gain versus the variances of the distributions are plotted. The results are incorporated to decision trees to evaluate the collaboration feasibility. It was found that the increased variability of the behavior of one neighboring member decreases the benefit of lowering the variability of the behavior of the other. The manuscript closes with a discussion of the practical viability of this collaboration scheme.</jats:p>"

Pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other health products make up a large share of total health expenditure in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and they are critical for delivering health services. Therefore, programmes which achieve cost savings on these expenditures may help improve a health system's efficiency, whereas programmes that increase availability of health products may improve a health system's effectiveness.

Primary care teams are stronger if they contain doctors with postgraduate training in family medicine. The contribution of such family physicians to the performance of primary care systems has not been evaluated in the African context. Family physicians with postgraduate training entered the South African district health system (DHS) from 2011.Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of family physicians within the DHS of South Africa. The objectives were to evaluate the impact of an increase in family physician supply in each district (number per 10 000 population) on key health indicators.Setting: All 52 South African health districts were included as units of analysis.Methods: An ecological study evaluated the correlations between the supply of family physicians and routinely collected data on district performance for two time periods: 2010/2011 and 2014/2015.Results: Five years after the introduction of the new generation of family physicians, this study showed no demonstrable correlation between family physician supply and improved health indicators from the macro-perspective of the district.Conclusion: The lack of a measurable impact at the level of the district is most likely because of the very low supply of family physicians in the public sector. Studies which evaluate impact closer to the family physician’s circle of control may be better positioned to demonstrate a measurable impact in the short term.</jats:p>"

Degradation of 1,1,1-TCA was 49.5% and 95% in the absence and presence of RA. Probe tests confirmed the generation of major hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and minor superoxide species (O2–•), and scavenger tests verified the key role of OH• and less of (O2–•) radicals. Degradation of 1,1,1-TCA decreased significantly in the presence of Cl− and HCO3–, while NO3– and SO42– had negligible effects in the absence of RA. Addition of RA significantly enhanced 1,1,1-TCA degradation by generating more OH• and (O2–•) radicals in the presence of anions. Degradation of 1,1,1-TCA increased in the acidic range (1–5), while an inhibitive trend from neutral to basic (7–9) was observed. In contrast, a significant increase in 1,1,1-TCA degradation was observed with the addition of RA at all pH values (1–9). In conclusion, the anions and pH significantly influenced the generation and intensity of ROSs and 1,1,1-TCA was effectively degraded in the Z-nZVI-catalyzed SPC system in the presence of RA.</jats:p>",

The proposed framework is grounded on fuzzy logic and in particular on a monotonic hierarchical fuzzy inference tool, as an effective means to gather the judgements and scores against the key performance indicators (KPIs) of each sustainability perspective into an aggregated index. In developing the fuzzy inference tool, we also solve some typical issues related to the assessment of sustainability, e.g., the identification of benchmark values to rate the company’s performance against each sustainability KPI. The architecture of the fuzzy inference tool was embodied in an ad hoc software developed in Microsoft ExcelTM (Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA), which makes it easy to use the proposed framework in practical situations. The potential of the software tool developed is illustrated by means of a case study, targeting a food machinery company, for which the overall evaluation of sustainability is carried out.</jats:p>"

These biorefineries will require an annual feedstock supply of around 250–375 metric ton (t) to meet their feedstock demand. However, there is a dearth of studies based on sustainable ways to supply a vast quantity of feedstock to the biorefinery gate, thus this study focuses on stochastically evaluating the life‐cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHGE</jats:styled-content>) of the different components of corn stover based feedstock supply system of a 114 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MLPY</jats:styled-content> cellulosic biorefinery in the Midwest by using production‐scale experimental field data collected in Iowa. Different components of the supply chain considered includes corn stover harvesting in a large rectangular bale form, field collection, storage, handling and transportation. This study also evaluates the energy use and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHGE</jats:styled-content> of nutrients removed from the field with collected stover.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the transition period, which comprises three weeks prepartum until 3 weeks postpartum, dairy cows experience a state of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Because the energy consumed by the cow is not enough to meet the energy required for milk production, adipose tissue is mobilized and provides a source of energy for tissues like the liver. However, excessive release of fatty acids from adipose tissues impairs liver function. Furthermore, high plasma concentrations of fatty acids (NEFA) contribute to oxidative stress and uncontrolled inflammatory responses often leading to health problems. Besides being an important building block for milk protein synthesis, methionine is a precursor for synthesis of VLDL, antioxidants and other methyl‐group requiring compounds. Thus, we hypothesized that increasing the intestinal supply of methionine could help alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, and improves liver function during the peripartum period in dairy cows. Sixty‐one multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized complete block design and were fed the experimental treatments consisting of a basal control (CON; n=31) diet with no methionine supplementation or the basal diet plus rumen‐protected methionine (MET; Mepron®, Evonik Nutrition &amp; Care GmbH, Germany; n=30). Methionine was supplied from ‐28 days to 60 days relative to parturition at a rate of 0.09% and 0.10% of dry matter (DM) during the prepartum and postpartum period, respectively. From −45 to −29 days before expected parturition, all cows received the same diet [1.33 Mcal/kg DM and 13.9% crude protein (CP)] with no MET. The basal “close‐up” (from −28 days to parturition), early lactation (from 1 to 30 days) and high‐production (from 31 to 60 d) diets contained 1.47 Mcal/kg DM and 15.3% CP, 1.67 Mcal/kg DM and 17.7% CP, and 1.61 Mcal/kg DM and 17.4% CP, respectively. Blood samples from 15 cows/group without clinical diseases after calving were collected at −30, −14, 1, 7, 21, 30 and 60 days relative to parturition and analyzed for biomarkers of energy balance, liver function, inflammation and oxidative stress. The indicators of energy balance β‐hydroxybutyrate, glucose and NEFA were not affected by supply of methionine. Among the five biomarkers of liver function analyzed, MET led to overall greater (P = 0.01; 94.8 <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> 84.0 U/mL) paraoxonase (negative acute‐phase protein) and lower (P = 0.01; 15.1 <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> 22.9 U/L) γ‐glutamyl transferase compared with CON. For cholesterol, a treatment × time (P = 0.07; 4.0 <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> 3.5 mmol/L) was observed due to a greater increase over time in MET than CON cows. Aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were not affected by supply of methionine. Among inflammation biomarkers measured, MET led to greater (P = 0.01; 38.1 <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> 37.1 g/L) albumin (negative acute‐phase protein) while alkaline phosphatase, ceruloplasmin (positive acute phase protein), and myeloperoxidase were not affected by methionine supply. The lower concentrations of reactive oxygen metabolites (P = 0.07; 15.2 <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> 16.8 mg of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/100 mL) in MET compared with CON cows indicated a state of reduced oxidative stress. Overall, the results indicate that increasing methionine supply by feeding rumen‐protected methionine is an effective approach to help mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress as well as to enhance liver function during the peripartum period in dairy cows.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The periparturient period is accompanied by metabolic and oxidative stress. Niacin is known to decrease lipolysis but is also reported to have anti‐oxidative effects. Therefore, we examined the effects of energy supply and a nicotinic acid (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NA</jats:styled-content>) supplementation on anti‐oxidative serum parameters and on the expression of oxidative stress‐related genes in blood leucocytes of periparturient dairy cows, differing in parity. Twenty‐nine pluriparous and 18 primiparous cows were allocated to four different feeding groups 42 days before expected parturition until 100 days postpartum and fed a ration with either a low concentrate proportion of 30% (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LC</jats:styled-content>) or a high concentrate proportion of 60% (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HC</jats:styled-content>). After parturition, all animals received 30% concentrate which was increased to 50% either within 16 (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LC</jats:styled-content> group) or 24 days (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HC</jats:styled-content> group). Half of the animals per group were supplemented with 24 g <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NA</jats:styled-content> per day from 42 days prepartum until 24 days postpartum. All investigated parameters varied significantly over time compared to parturition (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .05). Ferric reducing ability (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FRA</jats:styled-content>) exhibited a nadir before parturition, and the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GPX</jats:styled-content>) and superoxide dismutase (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content>) showed peak activities around parturition. Expression levels of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GPX</jats:styled-content>1, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content>2, xanthine dehydrogenase (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">XDH</jats:styled-content>) and nuclear factor (erythroid‐derived 2)‐like 2 (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NRF</jats:styled-content>2) peaked before calving. The concentrate level influenced <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GPX</jats:styled-content> activity and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">mRNA</jats:styled-content> abundance of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content>2, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">XDH</jats:styled-content> and poly (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ADP</jats:styled-content>‐ribose) polymerase 1 (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PARP</jats:styled-content>1). Pluriparous animals exhibited higher serum <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GPX</jats:styled-content> activities, a more distinct nadir for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FRA</jats:styled-content> and higher expression levels for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GPX</jats:styled-content>1, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content>2 and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">XDH</jats:styled-content>. Primiparous cows displayed higher serum <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content> activities. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NA</jats:styled-content> supplementation increased serum <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOD</jats:styled-content> activity antepartum in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LC</jats:styled-content> animals. Parturition was characterised by an increased need for antioxidants and an increased expression of oxidative stress‐related genes that clearly differed with parity and was influenced by energy supply while <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NA</jats:styled-content> exerted only minor effects on the investigated parameters.</jats:p>",
