In the time available I can do little more than sketch the principal characteristics of information provision, but by so doing I hope to provide something of a background and context against which to consider the more specialist papers which follow during the remainder of the day. I should also say that I use the phrase ‘EC information’ rather loosely as a convenient short‐hand expression to describe any kind of information by or about the EC which members of the business community might reasonably require in the conduct of their business activities.</jats:p>",

The results\nare based on one particular supply chain, for which the use of systems\nsimplification techniques has generated valuable insight into supply\nchain design. Although different strategies are compared for reducing\ndemand amplification as witnessed by one particular supply chain model,\nthe conclusions are nevertheless thought to have wide application and,\nindeed, implication. Comments in depth on the significance of the\nsimulation results for the demand chain as a whole, and for the role of\nan individual business within the chain. In the first instance, supply\nchain integration, and in particular free exchange of information, is a\nprerequisite for progress. In the second case, shows that reduction in\nlead times throughout the supply chain via JIT is similarly beneficial.\nClearly pinpoints the limitation to supply chain improvement which can\nbe obtained as a result of using JIT alone. This can be an expensive and\nongoing process of improvement with many spin‐off benefits.\nNevertheless, shows that the improvement possible by JIT operation of an\nindividual business can be negated by the failure to design and manage\nthe supply chain dynamics as a total system. The message for an\nindividual business is thus quite specific. Not only must lead times be\nreduced via JIT, but also the business must seek to be part of the right\nsupply chain, if it is to remain competitive and stable.</jats:p>",

Glucose, sucrose, starch and dry matter (DM) contents were measured at intervals in composite samples of pericarp/nucellus (PN), and in endosperms taken from developing kernels. Total kernel DM per ear at maturity was higher in the partially shaded treatment than control and shaded treatments due to higher kernel set in apical regions of ears. In PN at 11 days after pollination (DAP), DM and sucrose contents were slightly greater in partially shaded than control and shaded plants. Glucose contents were substantially greater than controls in PN of partially shaded plants and were less than control in shaded plants. In endosperms from apical kernels at 5 to 10 DAP (during cell division), DM, glucose and sucrose contents were substantially less in shaded than control and partially shaded plants, sucrose contents were greater in endosperms of partially shaded than control plants. Sugar contents in endosperms from basal kernels were nearly the same in the three light treatments. At 10 DAP, apical and basal endosperms in shaded plants had fewer nuclei than those of the other light treatments.

The focus of the estimation procedure is the selection of an appropriate functional form for regressions and on the price variable that best represents the price to which producers respond in making area and yield decisions. In the case of both area and yield, the econometric criteria favour the acceptance of log‐linear equations with the ratio of the guaranteed price of paddy to fertiliser price. On the basis of overall supply elasticity estimates, it is concluded that while pricing policy, irrigation programmes and institutional credit provide incentives to the expansion of paddy production, concessional sales of rice act as a disincentive.</jats:p>",

Widely used in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, LP/R is being adopted in Indonesia, Nepal and Malaysia. The community benefits that the technique can provide in the Thailand situation of weak urban land‐use controls and inadequate provision of urban network infrastructure are outlined. The landowner benefits the technique can provide that make it a fully acceptable and feasible technique are identified. Pilot LP/R projects should be undertaken to demonstrate and learn the technique in the Thai context. A draft scheme for one such project, to install distributor roads and utility lines in advance of private land development, is outlined. These pilot projects would also provide the local experience for designing a law, administration and procedures for the wide use of LP/R in Thailand. The main elements of such a national LP/R system are outlined. A similar approach is recommended for the adoption of LP/R by the other developing countries of Asia.</jats:p>",

In the Corn Belt and Northern Plains, large year‐to‐year changes in the oats harvested‐to‐planted acreage ratio suggest specifying harvested rather than planted acreage equations. Oats demands for feed, food, seed, and stock use are simultaneously estimated in this study, and impacts of alternative policies on oats production, prices, and returns are simulated. Changes in corn and dairy policies associated with the 1985 farm bill are shown to have significant consequences for the U.S. oats industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of nitrate availability on characteristics of the nitrate assimilatory system was investigated in N‐limited barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum valgare</jats:italic> L. cv. Golf), grown with the seminal root system split into initially equal‐sized halves. The cultures were continuously supplied with nitrate‐N at a relative addition rate (RA) of 0.09 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which resulted in relative growth rates (RG) that were ca 85% of those observed under surplus nitrate nutrition. The total N addition was divided between the subroots in ratios of 100:0, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50. For comparison, standard cultures were grown at RAs ranging from 0.03 to 0.18 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Initially, biomass and N partitioning to the subroots responded strongly and proportionally to the nitrate distribution ratio. After 12‐14 days no further effect was observed. The V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> for net nitrate uptake and in vitro nitrate reductase (NR) activity were measured in acclimated plants, i.e., after &gt; 14 days under a certain nitrate regime. In subroots fed from 20 to 100% of the total N addition, V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> for net nitrate uptake increased slightly, whereas NR activity was unaffected. Uptake and NR activities were insignificant in the 0%‐subroot. Uneven nitrate supply to individual subroots had negligible effect on the whole‐plant ability for nitrate uptake, and the relative V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> (unit N taken up per unit N in whole plant tissue and time) remained about 7‐fold in excess of the demand set by growth. Balancing nitrate concentrations (the resulting external nitrate concentrations at a certain RA) generally ranged between 2 and 10 μ<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> at growth‐limiting RA, both when predicted from uptake kinetics and when actually measured. When comparing split root and standard cultures when acclimated, it appears that uptake and NR activities in roots respond more strongly to over‐all nitrate availability than to nitrate availability to individual subroots.</jats:p>",

Results were compared with those obtained previously [Y. M. Yu, D. A. Wagner, E. E. Tredget, J.A. Waleszewski, J. F. Burke, and V. R. Young. Am. J. Physiol. 259 (Endocrinol. Metab. 22): E36-E51, 1990] in eight dogs similarly studied but given amino acids by constant enteral feeding (EN). We used primed continuous intravenous infusions of L-[1-13C,15N]Leu and measurements of arteriovenous isotope and Leu balance across the gut, liver, and Sp to estimate parameters of whole body and organ Leu metabolism [Leu-N and Leu-C flux, Leu----KIC; KIC----Leu, Leu oxidation and rates of Leu appearance (B) from and disappearance (S) into proteins]. Whole body Leu kinetics were the same for both routes of amino acid administration. With PN, KIC----Leu, Leu----KIC, and total metabolic processing were lower than for EN in Sp, and overall Leu balance (S - B) was higher in Sp for EN. Leu appearance from protein breakdown in gut was higher with PN. The rate of KIC----Leu was higher in liver for EN. These findings reveal that route of amino acid (Leu) administration, under these acute feeding conditions, alters the processing and metabolic fate of Leu in Sp but that whole body parameters of Leu metabolism are stable. The implications of these metabolic findings in relation to the maintenance of intestinal function and integrity are discussed.</jats:p>",
