During the Antarctic winter of 1986 (April to October), regular bacteriological examination of the water supply and surrounding sea took place. Samples were collected and examined every 2 weeks by the methods described in the Department of Health and Social Security Report No. 71, on the Bacteriological Examination of Drinking Water Supplies (DHSS, 1982), for membrane filtration and colony counting. The results of these examinations are presented in this paper. The results obtained suggest that water of good bacteriological quality was produced by the desalination plant, but some samples from the distribution system contained coliforms or presumptive <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> in small numbers. The possible reasons for this low-level contamination are discussed. No cases of gastroenteritis occurred on the base during this time.</jats:p>",

Although the supply was originally designed for testing conventional superconductors at high current levels, it has also been successfully used in measurements on the high-critical-temperature ceramic superconductors where the maximum current output was less than 1 A. The supply can produce 1000 A output current with a noise level of approximately 0.05 A peak-to-peak. The specifics of the current supply’s design and performance are given.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the major activities pursued by oil field operators that determine the level of production from those fields. Reported reserve additions reflect the consequencies of these activities for the productive capability of old fields and, thus, should be expected to be related to the costs and benefits of investing in such activities. A simple econometric, analysis is presented that demonstrates the influence of oil prices, lifting costs, taxes, and crude oil price controls on reported reserve revisions and extensions for the United States for the period 1970–1986. The strength of the relationship evaluated is particularly striking in light of the year-to-year variability of revisions data noted in other studies. Based on the economic perspective of reserve additions outlined here, U.S. reserves data for 1986 are used to provide a look at the activities that may thus be presumed to have led to the production losses recorded in that watershed year. </jats:p>",

The estimates indicate that sheep supply is positively related to lamb price in the short run and the intermediate run (ten plus years), although inelastic in the short run. The supply response to wool price also is positive and quite elastic in the intermediate term.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A study of water resources development in South Sweden revealed that water consumption unexpectedly stopped growing after construction had begun on a large project to expand water supplies. The project had a long lead time for completion, and planning had been based on traditional deterministic forecasts of future water use. </jats:p><jats:p> To explore the implications of such an uncertain structural shift in future consumption patterns, we develop a model for determining the timing for initiating such a project. In this model, the original consumption forecast may be disrupted at some random future time by an event called a “surprise.” As in the Swedish situation, we have modeled the surprise as an unexpected stagnation in future demand growth and benefit levels. We show that this form of uncertainty makes desirable delaying the initiation of the project beyond the time optimal under the original forecast. We then extend the model to include the lead time for the project as a variable, and demonstrate that the lead time should be reduced from that optimal under a deterministic future. Finally, we incorporate the option of abandoning the project when the surprise occurs, and show that higher salvage values for the project lead to earlier optimal commitment times. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Full integration of projects and programmes for rural water supply and sanitation has yet to take place in most developing countries, thus contributing to a situation in which long‐term success in the sector has been difficult to demonstrate. It is suggested that full integration in individual countries will require reorientation of project planning procedures, and the development of a community support programme (CSP) to provide backup to communities after project completion. Ultimately, full integration of projects and programmes is an iterative process, requiring the evaluation of past efforts in the field. Experience in the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981–90) has demonstrated that coverage alone — as the de facto indicator of success — is not sufficient (particularly in rural areas). The 1990s represent a fresh chance to modify indicators for success, and to go beyond coverage by integrating projects and programmes for rural water supply and sanitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and total coliforms (TC) are two major microbial indicators that are used to monitor the potability of water. Although the presence of heterotrophs has been hypothesized to predict the presence of TC, there have been few documented reports. Intensive sampling of raw, treated effluent and distribution water from a public water supply serving 400,000 people provided an opportunity to study the relationship between these two indicator groups of bacteria. A total of 26,158 samples were analyzed, including 12,970 from 1986 and 13,188 from 1985. There were 13,429 samples from the distribution system, 5,524 from treatment effluents, and 7,205 from raw water. The associations between HPC and TC were made on both a hits-and-misses and numerical comparison (CFU per milliliter) basis. The periodicity of the two indicators was also analyzed to determine whether the presence of one group could predict the presence of the other. Atypical bacteria were also related to the presence of these two indicator bacteria. Venn diagrams and nonparametric statistics revealed the following correlation coefficients for HPC and TC for 1985 and 1986 combined: raw water r = 0.45, treated effluent r = 0.06, and distribution system r = 0.10. Atypical bacteria showed a similar relationship with HPC. There was no predictive periodicity for HPC and TC within +/- 10 days of isolation of each other. Therefore, in a 2-year survey of a public water supply, the presence of HPC had a low correlation coefficient with TC, as determined by hits-and-misses and numerical comparisons. The enumeration of one group was found to be independent of the other.</jats:p>",

In early and mid‐pregnancy the number of adrenergic nerves increased from the adtubal part of the horns to corpus uteri, being more abundant in non‐placental than in placental regions. No obvious difference in the distribution of cholinergic nerves was observed among the regions examined. The cervix was richest innervated by both types of nerves throughout gestation. The diameter of the adrenergic nerves decreased during pregnancy, while cholinergic nerves showed no such a decrease. In late pregnancy and at parturition the adrenergic innervation was richest at the adtubal part of the horns and in the cervix and scanty in the rest of the uterus. Adrenergic nerves were seen both in vascular and in non‐vascular smooth muscle, while cholinergic nerves were mostly associated to blood vessels.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Adrenerge und cholinerge Innervierung des Myometriums und der Cervix beim Schwein.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> “Nuclear winter,” more properly called “nuclear fall,” could be caused by injection of large amounts of dust into the atmosphere. Besides causing a decrease in temperature, it could be accompanied by “nuclear drought,” a catastrophic decrease in precipitation. Dry land agriculture would then be impossible, and municipal, industrial, and irrigation water supplies would be diminished. It has been argued that nuclear winter/fall poses a much greater threat to human survival than do fall out or the direct impacts of a conflict. However, this does not appear to be true, at least for the U.S. Even under the unprecedented drought that could result from nuclear fall, water supplies would be available for many essential activities. For the most part, ground water supplies would be relatively invulnerable to nuclear drought, and adequate surface supplies would be available for potable uses. This assumes that conveyance facilities and power supplies survive a conflict largely intact or can be repaired.</jats:p>",
