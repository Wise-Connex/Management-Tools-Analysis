In this article, we focus on structural changes in the supply chain, the results of which are the reengineering of materials management, physical distribution and sales activities. Using case studies, we identified five different structural changes which affected the organization of logistics, marketing and sales activities. By using modern information technology, it was possible to centralize physical and administrative activities and, at the same time, maintain a decentralized sales organization. Total distribution costs were reduced by 30â50 per cent and customer service was significantly improved.</jats:p>",

These paddock- and systems-based results provide a context within which component research on soil and plants can be interpreted. Soil surface damage was higher in farmlets with heavier cattle (390 kg vs. 200 kg steers) and on paddocks where feeding was restricted through the use of a slow rotation (100-120 days vs. 35-45 days). Where cattle grazed under wet conditions, with a pre- and post- grazing herbage mass of 2400 and 650 kg DM/ha respectively, damage levels reached 60-70% of the soil surface. Under these conditions, 300-350 kg DM/ha of initial forage on offer was pushed onto or into the surface soil; and pasture growth rates during early-mid spring would be reduced by 10 kg DM/ha/day. In practice the objective of grazing plans and management should be to minimise these negative impacts within the constraints of the required feeding regimes. Recommendations are made for the alignment of stock class and enterprise with land capabilities and the feed allocation processes of a winter rotation.

Thus the two opposite ends of the impact speed distributions are the regions of interest in the bioastronomical context, whereas much modelling work on impacts delivers, or makes use of, only the mean speed. Here the probability distributions of impact speeds upon Mars are calculated for (i) the orbital distribution of known asteroids; and (ii) the expected distribution of near-parabolic cometary orbits. It is found that cometary impacts are far more likely to eject rocks from Mars (over 99 percent of the cometary impacts are at speeds above 20 km/sec, but at most 5 percent of the asteroidal impacts); paradoxically, the objects impacting at speeds low enough to make organic/volatile survival possible (the asteroids) are those which are depleted in such species.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the birds suffered weight losses during days with high wind-forces, probably caused by increased energy expenditure and decreased foraging activity during these days. Moreover, the number of insects, and hence the food supply, decreased after periods with rainfall and with progress of the season. These factors were, at least partly, the reason why the birds showed overall low fat scores and were unable to accumulate extra fat at the locality. However, individuals that left the area early in the season were relatively old and carried relatively large fat reserves. These birds probably performed a short-distance migration, and presumably had the advantage of reaching more favourable sites in terms of foraging conditions.</jats:p>"

William Cary (1974) and his followers have argued that managers abuse their discretion to incorporate in states that benefit managerial interests at the expense of share holder interests; Ralph Winter (1977) and his followers (see, e.g., Easterbrook &amp; Fischel 1991) have argued that, because managersâ discretion is constrained by promoters or by the threat of a potential takeover, managers will tend to incorporate in states that provide laws which maximize the value of corporate equity.</jats:p>",

Alaska)\nseedlings, and the effects of applied IAA on growth of internode zones were\ninvestigated. Experiments were conducted with plants grown in red light (R),\nwith supplementary use of plants grown in white light (W). Growth of the\ninternode was first characterised without IAA application. Internode zones\nelongated at an identical and constant rate per unit length until each zone\nsharply ceased elongation at a certain distance from the apex. The elongation\nrate was similar even between R-grown and W-grown plants, the major difference\nbeing an earlier cessation of zone elongation in W-grown plants. Following IAA\napplication, the growth rate of zones increased (maximally about two times)\nbut, after a few hours, it declined to the pre-stimulation rate. This\nshort-term growth stimulation (SGS) was observed when IAA was applied directly\nto the zone monitored for growth and when IAA was applied to an apically\nseparated region. It was demonstrated that SGS was caused not because radial\ngrowth was enhanced in place of elongation, nor because energy became\nlimiting. Based on the kinetic differences observed by applying IAA to\ndifferent regions of the internode and also on the data obtained by applying\nIAA again at the post-stimulation phase, two independent regulatory elements\ncould be resolved for SGS: (1) reduction of the tissue responsiveness for IAA,\nand (2) reduction of IAA supply to the target tissue. These regulations are\nconsidered to operate in response to increases in the tissue content of IAA.</jats:p>"

Quadratic, modified exponential and square root models resulted in higher estimates of optimum Nâsupply than did 2âregressions and plateau type spline models with differences as high as 130 kg N/ha between models. Residual variance was lower with the latter two models. Data were grouped at 40 kg/ha intervals of Nâsupply for analysis of variance and resulted in the lowest estimates for optimum Nâsupply. Based on the overall average, the optimum fertilizerâN dressings were 80 kg N/ha for root and sugar yield and 70 kg N/ha for white sugar yield while mineral soilâN in spring was 70 kg N/ha.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the authors first explain the definitions and procedures designed by international regulations concerning typical foodstuffs with controlled denomination of origin. The authors have investigated the interests and the opinions of tourists and subjects in trade and catering, about typical foodstuffs from Istria. By comparing the regulations, it was concluded that Croatian regulations do not follow the trends in West-European countries. The research results show that foreign tourists are very interested in typical istrian foodstuffs. However, their interest is lessened because those products are relatively expensive and have no guaranty of quality and origin.</jats:p>"

Cluster roots were found at 90% of the sites surveyed. By\ncontrast, arbuscular mycorrhizae occurred at only 45% of sites and the\nextent of colonisation was low. No ectomycorrhizae were found during this\nsurvey. Formation of arbuscular mycorrhizae and cluster roots in\nC. cunninghamiana seedlings in relation to external P\nsupply was investigated in glasshouse experiments. Inoculation with the\narbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus, significantly\nincreased seedling dry weight at low P supply (10 mg P per kg soil), but had\nno effect in the absence of P or at P supply rates greater than 10 mg P per kg\nsoil. Mycorrhizal colonisation of roots was highest at 0 and 10 mg P per kg\nsoil and declined with further increases in P supply. No mycorrhizae formed at\nor above 100 mg P per kg soil. The number, dry weight and proportion of root\nbiomass allocated to cluster roots in solution culture decreased with\nincreasing P supply, and followed a generally similar pattern to that observed\nfor arbuscular mycorrhizae in sand culture. No cluster roots formed at P\nsupply of 100 ÂµM P or higher, and the form of nitrogen available to the\nplant (either adequate supply of mineral nitrogen or dependency on symbiotic\nN2 fixation) had no effect on cluster root formation at\nany level of P supply. Casuarina cunninghamiana occurs\nnaturally along stream and river banks and cluster roots may be advantageous\nat these sites by providing a reliable mechanism to enhance nutrient uptake in\nseasonally inundated environments that are unlikely to be favourable to\nmycorrhizal formation and activity.</jats:p>"

Iron, heme iron and zinc contents were analyzed in following muscles: pork (<jats:italic>longissimus dorsi</jats:italic> muscle and shoulder), beef (<jats:italic>longissimus dorsi</jats:italic> muscle and shoulder), veal (<jats:italic>longissimus dorsi</jats:italic> muscle) and chicken (breast and thigh). Beef and pork shoulder were the best sources of iron, heme iron and zinc. Pork and veal <jats:italic>longissimus dorsi</jats:italic> muscle and chicken were relatively poor in these trace elements. With an average daily lean meat consumption of 105 g, iron and zinc intake were about 1.1 mg/d and 3.8 mg/d, respectively. Recommendations for daily iron intake were met to 11% (men) and 7% (women) and for zinc to 25% (men) and 32% (women). Applying a modified <jats:italic>Monsen</jats:italic> model, the requirements for absorbed iron were met in the range of 10â30% and 7â20% for men and women, respectively. Taking into account a zinc absorption rate from meat of about 20â36%, the daily requirements for absorbed zinc were covered to 32â56%. In conclusion, the average amount of lean meat as consumed in Switzerland was high enough to be an important source of available iron and zinc, particularly for people with low iron and zinc status.</jats:p>",

Frequent defoliation reduced %TNC.\nIncreasing P supply to the clover plants had the opposite effect, but to a\nlesser extent, and tended to reverse the decline in %TNC resulting from\nfrequent defoliation. Stolons were the plant parts where most of the\nnon-structural carbohydrate reserves were stored, with concentrations varying\nfrom &lt;2 to &gt;11% TNC on a dry weight basis, according to the\ntreatment received. Minimal changes occurred in the %TNC for the leaves\nor roots as a result of treatments. The fluctuations in non-structural\ncarbohydrate concentration in the stolons were mainly due to changes in the\nstarch concentration, since the stolon sugar concentration was relatively\nconstant between various treatments. A logistic curve closely defined the\nrelationship (r2 =\n0Â·98) between the starch concentration in the stolons and dry matter\nyield of leaves, suggesting that stolon starch reserves are a function of the\nsize of the leaf canopy. Canopy size, in turn, was dependent on the duration\nof the regrowth period and, to a lesser extent, on the P supply. The maximum\nstarch concentration in the stolons was around 8% under the conditions\nof this experiment.</jats:p>"

The growth and ability of 12 summer-growing\nannual and perennial legumes to fix nitrogen and the response of a subsequent\nwheat crop was examined in a field trial on a deep cracking clay soil in the\nCentral Highlands of Queensland. Twelve legumes\n[Lablab purpureus cv. Highworth,\nVigna radiata cv. Satin,\nMacroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro,\nMedicago sativa cv. Trifecta,\nVigna trilobata (CPI 13671),\nMacroptilium bracteatum (CPI 27404),\nGlycine latifolia (CQ 3368),\nDesmanthus virgatus cv. Marc,\nDesmanthus virgatus cv. Bayamo,\nStylosanthes sp. aff scabra (104710),\nClitoria ternatea cv. Milgarra,\nCajanus cajan cv. Quest)] and grain sorghum\n(Sorghum bicolor cv. Tulloch) as a non-legume control\nwere established in November 1994 and their growth monitored until March 1995.\nThe legumes averaged greater than 5 t/ha dry matter production and 77 kg\nN/ha (above-ground only). Dry matter production ranged from less than 2\nt/ha for G. latifolia and\nM. sativa to greater than 9 t/ha for\nD. virgatus cv. Bayamo and\nC. cajan. Annual legumes initially had much higher\nrelative growth rates than the perennial legumes but they rapidily exhausted\nall the plant available water content of the soil thus allowing the\nwell-established perennials to eventually match this production. The\nproportion of plant nitrogen (above ground) derived from\nN2 fixation was generally low, reflecting high soil\nNO3, but varied widely between species ranging from less\nthan 20% for D. virgatus cv. Marc and\nG. latifolia to over 45% for\nC. ternatea, S. scabra and\nV. trilobata. The quantity of nitrogen derived from\nfixation was correlated with above-ground dry matter and nitrogen content.\nThere was a significant (P&lt;0.05) growth response by\nwheat following legumes compared with that following sorghum in the increasing\norder V. radiata =\nM. atropurpureum =\nL. purpureus &gt; C. cajan\n= M. sativa =\nV. trilobata =\nM. bracteatum =\nG. latifolia &gt; S. scabra\n= D. virgatus =\nC. ternatea. Previous legume growth had no significant\n(P&gt;0.05) effect on yield or nitrogen concentration in\na second âplant-backâ crop (sorghum). It was concluded that a wide\nrange of pasture-ley legumes have the potential to improve cereal crop\nproduction in this region.</jats:p>"

Late highstand palaeogeographies and stacking pattern variations highlight spatial and temporal variations in sediment supply, which promote the contemporaneous development of prograda-tional, aggradational and retrogradational stacking patterns. This questions the derivation of relative sea-level curves from specific stacking patterns and highlights the potential for miscorrelation in areas with major sediment supply variations.</jats:p>",

Seven different N addition regimes were compared in a nutrient solution experiment. In the treatments N111 (severe deficient), N222 (moderate deficient), N333 and N444 (optimal for maximum growth) different N concentration ranges were held constant during the entire growing season. In the treatments N144, N414 and N441 plants were subjected to low (1) N concentration in one of three experimental periods, whereas the N concentration was high (4) in the other two periods. Depending on the N demand of the plants, N concentrations were adjusted to 250â500 Î¼M (N1), 500â1000 Î¼M (N2), 1250â2500 Î¼M (N3) and 2500â5000 Î¼M (N4) when the N concentration in the N222 treatment had dropped below 100 Î¼M. The other elements in the solution were replenished according to the estimated element ratios in the plants. As a reference the potassium concentration in the solution was measured regularly.</jats:p><jats:p>During the first year plants with a nonâlimited N supply (N444) produced new tillers and increased the length of individual tillers until the end of the growing season. This resulted in a 48% shoot dry matter increase late in the growing season between August and October and a linear increase of cumulative N uptake between July and October. Limited N supply during the entire growing season (N111, N222) caused lower shoot yields but rhizome and particularly root dry weights were less affected. Significant final yield losses were also observed when the N supply was limited only during the first 7 weeks of growth (N144). By contrast, final shoot yield was hardly affected when the plants were exposed to limited N supply over a period of 9 weeks at the end of the growing season (N441). In the second year regrowth of shoots in spring was affected by the previous year's N supply, since five weeks after the beginning of regrowth, shoot dry matter was significantly positively correlated with N contents in rhizomes and shoots in the previous October. Our results show, that N supply at the beginning of the growing season has a major effect on final yield in the first establishment year of <jats:italic>M. sinensis</jats:italic>. However, from the second year on, the capacity of N reserves in rhizomes and roots affects spring growth much more than current N supply.</jats:p>",

We quantified the transpirationâindependent water transport from root to shoot in submerged plants relative to the transpiration stream in emergent plants and tested the importance of transpiration in sustaining nutrient flux and shoot growth. The acropetal water flow was substantial in submerged <jats:italic>Mentha aquatica</jats:italic>, reaching 14% of the transpiration stream in emergent plants. The transpirationâindependent mass flow of water from the roots, measured by means of tritiated water, was diverted to leaves and adventitious shoots in active growth. The plants grew well and at the same rates in water and air, but nutrient fluxes to the shoot were greater in plants grown in air than in those that were submerged when they were rooted in fertile sediments. Restricted O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to the roots of submerged plants may account for the smaller nutrient concentrations, though these exceeded the levels required to saturate growth. In hydroponics, the root medium was aerated and circulated between submerged and emergent plants to minimize differences in medium chemistry, and here the two growth forms behaved similarly and could fully exploit nutrient enrichment. It is concluded that the lack of transpiration from leaf surfaces in a vapourâsaturated atmosphere, or under water, is not likely to constrain the transfer of nutrients from root to shoot in herbaceous plants. Nutrient deficiency under these environmental conditions is more likely to derive from restricted development and function of the roots in waterlogged anoxic soils or from low porewater concentrations of nutrients.</jats:p>",

Recent studies have shown very high energetic costs of lekking for great snipe males, <jats:italic>Gallinago media</jats:italic> (Latham, 1787) and that breeding great snipes prefer to feed in soft soil with a high abundance of earthworms. We here evaluate the hypothesis that the breeding occurrence of great snipe is restricted to areas with very high availability of food. All the 125 registered great snipe leks in Scandinavia were situated in open habitats along the tree line. The occurrence of leks were analysed in relation to bedrock quality, soil chemistry and earthworm biomass. There was a strong positive relationship between soil pH and earthworm biomass. High pH values were found on or in the close vicinity of baseârich bedrocks. No great snipe leks were documented in areas with acid soil, even if the extent of acid bedrocks along the tree line predicts that 31% of the leks should be situated on acid soils. Hypotheses, including both natural and sexual selection, for why breeding occurrence of great snipe is restricted to areas with high abundance of high quality food are evaluated, and we find indications for this to be a consequence of the very high energetic costs for the lekking males. These costs have probably evolved through female mate choice and indicate that sexual selection may have important consequences for a species distribution. Populationâlevel effects of sexual selection have previously received little attention. The stringent habitat demands here documented may also make great snipes vulnerable to environmental changes and can contribute to explain the dramatic reduction in breeding range of this species in western Europe during the past 150 years (LÃ¸faldli <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., 1989).</jats:p>",

Buildings locating inside SPIDs need not provide any parking facilities and can be developed more intensively than buildings located outside SPIDs. Buildings constructed outside SPIDs must have at least two parking stalls for every 1,000 ft<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (92.9 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) of gross leasable area and are limited to about 30 floors. The extent to which these policy objectives have been fulfilled by Atlantaâs parking supply policies as they are applied around Midtown MARTA stations is analyzed. Findings are mixed. Development was attracted to SPIDs, and transit ridership among employees working within SPIDs was substantially higher than among those working outside SPIDs. On the other hand, new parking has proliferated throughout Midtown with some evidence to suggest that transit ridership has fallen as a result. It is concluded that without areawide parking supply efforts, policies patterned after Atlantaâs SPID program will have limited success in improving transit ridership. </jats:p>",

All specimens were studied after arterial injection with India ink. Samples were fixed, frozen, then sectioned and processed using a modified Spalteholz technique. In all specimens, the intraosseous blood supply arose from the nutrient artery with its associated branches and the metaphyseal arteries. In smallâbreed dogs, there was decreased vascular density at the distal diaphysealâmetaphyseal junction compared with largeâbreed dogs. The reduced vascularity corresponded to the region associated with a poor prognosis for fracture healing in smallâbreed dogs.

In glasshouse experiments, the leaves of acutely deficient\nplants were spindly, erect, and dark green, whereas in field experiments, the\nleaves were pale green.\nIn acutely P-stressed plants, leaf senescence, phasic development, and\nanthesis were delayed. The disorder restricted tiller development and\ntherefore the rate of appearance and the number of leaves per plant. It\ndepressed grain yield principally by reducing the number of fertile tillers.\nSevere P deficiency depressed shoot growth within 15 days of sowing and\nultimately reduced plant height, root mass, and grain yield. In all\nexperiments, shoot yield responses to applied P increased progressively until\nstem elongation (Zadoks Scale 30) and changed little thereafter. As a result,\nthe external requirement for P (i.e. P level required for 90% maximum\ngrowth) increased with time during vegetative development in most experiments.\nSevere P deficiency also affected the distribution of dry matter between the\nroots and shoots and between the leaf blades and conducting tissues (sheaths\nand stems). Both of these responses intensified with advancing plant age.\nTreatment differences in P uptake in shoots also occurred early in growth and\npersisted until grain maturity. The partitioning of P between roots and shoots\nfavoured P uptake or retention in the roots of P-deficient plants.\nUnder conditions of acute and moderate P stress, the resources of the wheat\nplant appear to be directed towards maintaining root growth (at least\ninitially), limiting and delaying shoot proliferation, and maximising the leaf\n: stem ratio. These regulations appear circumstantially to be adaptive\nmechanisms for conserving suffiient P to ensure the survival of at least 1\nweak, but fertile, tiller on each plant.\n</jats:p>"

Measurements of net leaf photosynthetic rate (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>) and stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) of wellâwatered plants were taken over both seasons; a drought treatment was applied in the middle of the second growing season to a separate sample of beech drawn from the same population. The net leaf photosynthetic rate of wellâwatered plants was stimulated in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> by an average of 75% in beech and 33% in oak; the effect continued through both growing seasons at both nutrient levels. There were no interactive effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration and nutrient level on <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> in beech or oak. Stomatal conductance was reduced in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> by an average of 34% in oak, but in beech there were no significant reductions in <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> except under cloudy conditions (â22% in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). During drought, there was no effect of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration on <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> in beech grown with high nutrients, but for beech grown with low nutrients, <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> was significantly higher in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, causing more rapid soil drying. With high nutrient supply, soil drying was more rapid at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> due to increased leaf area. It appears that beech may substantially increase wholeâplant water consumption in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, especially under conditions of high temperature and irradiance when damage due to high evaporative demand is most likely to occur, thereby putting itself at risk during periods of drought.</jats:p>",
