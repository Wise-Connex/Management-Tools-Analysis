I n order to avoid economic and technical <jats:italic>cul de sacs</jats:italic>, resulting from the usual procedures of amelioration, drainage should be considered a residual engineering task, incidental to and following the use of water resources.</jats:p><jats:p>If it is desired to irrigate a maximum area of land, a priority of sequences must be fixed at an early stage for the measures taken to exploit successively the total inventory of surface and subsurface waters. A general scheme of priorities establishes the following precedences: (a) water supply before drainage and flood control, (b) use of subsurface before surface waters, (c) abstraction from foreland ground‐water horizons before mountain ground water, (d) development of hill before valley springs, and (e) use and creation of underground storage before surface storage.</jats:p><jats:p>It is not possible to devise a rational drainage scheme and to plan the maximum exploitation of local water resources without operating wells on a year‐round basis. If this premise is accepted, wells must be sited and installed so as to serve several purposes: (a) to extract the average annual replenishment and gradually most of the fossil reserve, (b) to drain marshy lands in the plain, (c) to accept recharge from winter‐spring flows, floods, and foreland wells, and (d) to extract subsurface winter flow in the foreland and to recharge it into mountainwells (recycling).</jats:p>",
