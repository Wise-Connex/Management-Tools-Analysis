      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In today's growing complexity of global networks of supply chains and hypercompetitive business environments, firms are confronted with the need to manage supply chain activities across functions and between firms. While prior research has noted the benefits of collaboration between functional areas for enhanced supply chain performance, there is not yet empirical evidence on whether an orientation toward working collectively among different functions for a firm's supply chain could influence customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. A structured questionnaire was administered to U.K.‐based food service suppliers, and 112 usable mail responses were obtained. Measures supporting cross‐functional orientation (CFO) were developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and hypotheses were tested via path analysis. The findings show that a CFO positively affects customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. The length of Internet adoption was also found to play a critical role in enhancing CFO, through positive moderating relationships with customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>While there have been numerous reports of benefits associated with adoption of early supplier involvement (ESI) in product design, particularly in reducing the duration of the design process and improving design outcomes, this study extends a recent stream of research indicating that ESI may be a useful tool for managing supply risk. Utilizing a case‐study approach, the current research explores the extent to which ESI reduces the likelihood of supply disruptions and other negative supply events for an aerospace supplier. Although initial adoption of ESI was intended to reduce supply costs, results indicated that ESI serves to reduce perceptions of supply risk at this firm. Factors associated with risk reductions are discussed in the context of agency theoretic variables, and a series of research propositions are presented to build theory in supply risk management.</jats:p>",

Findings, based on responses from 182 firms, reveal that a firm's degree of knowledge‐sharing with research institutions and customers is positively influenced by the firm's resource commitment. As expected, the firms' satisfaction is positively related to the frequency of communication. Consistent with the proposed hypotheses, knowledge tacitness diminishes the effect sharing knowledge with suppliers has on satisfaction. Contrary to expectations, tacitness positively moderates the effect sharing knowledge with customers has on satisfaction. Overall, this paper establishes the foundation for a more fine‐grained analysis of knowledge‐sharing with customers, suppliers and research institutions in a network setting.</jats:p>",

While the antecedents to these relationships have been studied extensively in the marketing channels and supply chain management literature, relatively little research has considered the performance outcomes of such exchanges. The current study contributes to this stream of research by extending Morgan and Hunt's key mediating variables (KMV) model to examine how the five key endogenous variables from the KMV model affect supplier logistics performance. The findings suggest that cooperation and uncertainty are significantly related to supplier logistics performance, while supplier acquiescence, functional conflict and propensity to leave the relationship have no significant impact.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In den vergangenen Jahren sind in vielen Unternehmen einseitig ausgerichtete Optimierungs‐Programme (Cost‐Cutting) durchgeführt worden. Diese haben die Abhängigkeiten von Zulieferern, Gebäuden, Anlagen und Maschinen sowie Serviceeinrichtungen spürbar erhöht. Dementsprechend führen unvorhergesehene Störungen der Versorgungskette (etwa durch Qualitätsmängel bei einem bedeutenden Zulieferer oder den Ausfall von Warehousing‐Funktionen nach einem Rechner‐Defekt) heute auch zu deutlich höheren Schadenpotenzialen. Die Gründe dafür liegen auf der Hand: Single‐Sourcing‐Ansätze, die Konzentration von bestimmten und wesentlichen Funktionen auf nur einen – oder einige wenige – Standorte/Anlagen und die generell steigende Abhängigkeit der Produktions‐ und Logistikprozesse von der Verfügbarkeit der IT‐Systeme könnten im Falle des Falles das Unternehmen schlagartig treffen und den Wertschöpfungsprozess abrupt unterbrechen. Als Folge des Rückganges von Betriebsleistungen (beispielsweise aufgrund schlagartig gesunkener Kapazitäten, fehlender Rohstoffe und Halbfertigwaren oder der Nicht‐Verfügbarkeit von Daten und Anwendungen) wird die Gewinn‐ und Verlustrechnung des Unternehmens durch Ertragsausfälle und/oder zusätzlich entstehende Kosten zur Schadenminderung und zur Stabilisierung des Marktes direkt belastet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many municipal governments are currently confronted with the need to restructure water supply systems. This paper examines how municipalities are restructuring water supply utility management in the province of Ontario (Canada), which has recently experienced significant and rapid legislative and regulatory reform in the water sector. The paper analyses restructuring in six different municipalities (Hamilton, Kingston, Peel, Peterborough, Toronto and York). It identifies six distinct business models adopted as an outcome of the restructuring process (delegated management to a private operator, corporatization of services provision, delegated management to a public operator, a municipal commission, a municipal ‘business unit’ and a municipal department) and examines the different approaches to governance adopted during the restructuring process. The case study is conceptualized through a discussion of the governance and restructuring challenges faced by municipalities. As municipalities are often confronted with a bewildering array of business models, governance frameworks and contract types when engaging in a review of restructuring options, the paper situates the analysis of the Ontario case within a general survey of business models for networked water supply. The paper concludes with a discussion of “lessons learnt” relevant to municipalities and higher orders of government when engaging in restructuring of networked water supply provision.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a low‐cost water treatment/pretreatment technology that is used in many countries around the world for water supply. When wells are situated close to rivers or lakes and pumped, the surface water is induced to flow to these wells. During soil and aquifer passage, chemical, biological, and particulate contaminants are removed. Many European cities have been using RBF as the primary source of drinking water production for over a century. In the United States, RBF is gaining popularity owing to favorable regulatory provisions. In siting and designing RBF systems, the river hydrology and site hydrogeology must be carefully considered so that scouring and clogging are avoided and the aquifer is conductive to produce the desired amount of water. The source water should be of reasonably high quality to avoid the development of anoxic conditions, which ultimately may lead to the reduction of iron, manganese, and other redox‐sensitive species. Three‐dimensional computer models are increasingly being used for the placement and operation of RBF systems. The collection system can be vertical wells, horizontal collector wells, infiltration galleries, or combinations of any two or all three. Site‐specific conditions, pumping needs, and the availability of treatment plants for further treatment of the filtrate dictate the type of collection system. The capital cost is tied to the type of collection system, conveyance system, and land acquisition. Numerous studies have pointed out the benefits of RBF in removing turbidity, pathogens, dissolved chemicals, natural organics (which are regarded as precursors for disinfection by‐products for systems using chlorine as the disinfectant), and a whole host of micropollutants.</jats:p>",

In our model, the manufacturer allows the retailer access to inventory status at the warehouse. To take advantage of this new information, the retailer changes from a single-level base-stock policy to a two-level, state-dependent base-stock policy. We provide an exact method for computing performance and develop a procedure for evaluating optimal policy. We demonstrate the impact of the new policy on the manufacturer and other customers.

External demands follow independent Poisson processes, and unsatisfied demands at each stage are fully backordered. The processing (e.g., production) cycle times and transportation lead times are assumed to be stochastic, sequential, and exogenously determined. We derive recursive equations for the backorder delays (because of stockout) at all stages in the supply chain. Based on the recursive equations, we characterize the dependencies of the backorder delays across different stages in the network, and develop insights into the impact of safety stock positioning in various supply chain topologies. We present approximations and algorithms to coordinate the base-stock levels in these supply chains, so as to minimize systemwide inventory cost subject to meeting certain service-level requirements of the external customers. </jats:p>",

When several environmental measures are possible, these can be ranked according to their cost per unit of environmental improvement, after which an eco‐efficient set of measures can be selected that yields a given level of environmental improvement at least cost. This procedure can be visualized as a supply curve for environmental improvement. Such a curve plots cumulative cost or cost per unit of environmental improvement against cumulative environmental improvement, with measures ordered according to increasing cost per unit of environmental improvement. This paper presents supply curves for environmental improvement on the basis of a set of possible environmental measures for a company in the Dutch oil and gas producing industry.</jats:p><jats:p>To measure aggregated potential environmental improvement for a given measure, different environmental impacts are lumped together using weighting factors. We compare five methods for weighting environmental impacts, covering a wide range of current practices.</jats:p><jats:p>The supply curves that were determined for each of the five weighting methods show relatively small differences, except for one (the distance‐to‐target method). The ranking of measures differs significantly, though, and as a result, so do the measures that are selected if total costs are restricted to a certain budget. Also, the consequent reduction in emissions of specific substances, in particular nitrogen oxides (NO<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>), depends on the weighting method selected.</jats:p>",

Mandatory preconditions are: (a) a low hydraulic retention time to wash out suspended cells competing with mass transfer limited biofilm cells for alkalinity as limiting substrate; and (b) an oxygen flux adapted to the surface loading rate to prevent complete nitrification to nitrate. pH control or ‘NH3 inhibition’ of nitrite oxidation are neither useful nor necessary. By this strategy, oxygen limited biofilms with simultaneous presence of NH4-N and NO2-N were enriched, which allowed for growth of anaerobic ammonium oxidizers. It could be demonstrated that a deammonifying reactor can be purposefully started up within a reasonable span of time and without prior inoculation, if this explicitly described strategy is applied. Depending on surface loading and air flow rate, N removal rates of 4–5 g N/m2 d could be achieved at DO concentrations between 1.0 and 4.0 mg/l.</jats:p>",

Auch im Rahmen einer „Konstitutionellen Politischen Ökonomie“, nach der bei der Bereitstellung öffentlicher Güter der gleiche soziale Mechanismus wirksam werden muss wie beim Zustandekommen eines imaginären Gesellschaftsvertrages, entsteht letztlich aufgrund einer mangelnden Wertverpflichtung der Akteure ein „Gefangenen-Dilemma“. Diese Konsequenz lässt sich im Bezugsrahmen der Klassischen Politischen Ökonomie vermeiden, da sich hier individuelle Nutzenorientierung und normative Wertverpflichtung gerade nicht ausschließen, so dass die Akteure in der Lage sind, die Dilemma-Situationen zu überwinden.Wertverpflichtungen müssen deshalb neben Markt, Staat und Gemeinschaft als zentrale Mechanismen der Koordination sozialen Handelns berücksichtigt werden, wobei sich allerdings solche reinen Mechanismen der Handlungskoordination empirisch zu komplexen Koordinationsweisen verdichten.</jats:p>",

This study determined the fraction of biomass partitioned to roots vs. shoots in corn and velvetleaf in response to nitrogen (N) supply. Pots measuring 28 cm in diam and 60 cm deep were embedded in the ground and each contained one plant of either corn or velvetleaf. Each plant received one of three N treatments: 0, 1, or 3 g N applied as ammonium nitrate in 2001, and 0, 2, or 6 g N in 2002. Measurements of total above- and belowground biomass were made at 10 sampling dates during each growing season. The root:shoot ratio decreased over time for both corn and velvetleaf as a result of normal plant growth and as N supply increased. Root:shoot ratio was greater for corn than for velvetleaf at comparable stages of development and at all levels of N supply. Both corn and velvetleaf display true plasticity in biomass partitioning patterns in response to N supply. Velvetleaf root:shoot ratio increased by 46 to 82% when N was limiting in 2001 and 2002, respectively, whereas corn root:shoot ratio increased by only 29 to 45%. The greater increase in biomass partitioned to roots by velvetleaf might negatively impact its ability to compete with corn for light when N supply is limited.</jats:p>",

The main conclusions are: (i) the region of greatest risk is Africa; (ii) stabilization at 750 ppm avoids some but not most of the risk, while stabilization at 550 ppm avoids most of the risk and (iii) the impact of climate change on risk of hunger is influenced greatly by pathways of development.

After 6 weeks, the plants were harvested, separated to above- and below-ground parts, oven-dried, and weighed. The mycorrhizal inoculant significantly increased plant growth and reduced root:shoot ratios. At an N:P supply ratio of 30:1, plants with AM fungi had significantly greater biomass than those plants without AM fungi. However, at 1:1 N:P supply ratio, plants without AM fungi had greater biomass. Plants without AM fungi had higher root:shoot ratios at 0 and –4 cm water depth than plants with AM fungi. In general, C. tribuloides had the lowest growth, and unlike P. arundinacea and R. orbiculatus, was not affected by the water depth treatment. Growth of the wetland plants was limited more by nitrogen than by phosphorus. Our results suggest that at high N:P nutrient supply ratios and non-flooded conditions the growth of wetland seedlings can benefit by being inoculated with AM fungi. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>A method for perfusion of the isolated trout heart coronary circulation with red blood cells (RBCs) was developed. The method was used to analyse the influence of RBC perfusion on myocardial O2 supply and O2 consumption and to test the hypothesis that nitrite is converted to vasoactive nitric oxide in the RBC-perfused coronary circulation. Perfusion with RBCs significantly increased myocardial O2 supply and O2 consumption by increasing the incoming O2concentration and the O2 extraction. Coronary flow did not differ between RBC perfusion and saline perfusion, but RBC perfusion established a strong linear increase in myocardial O2 consumption with coronary flow. Nitric oxide was measured in the atrial effluent of the preparation. Perfusion with saline under hypoxic conditions was associated with NO production. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NA obliterated this NO production and significantly decreased coronary flow, showing that the NO was vasoactive and probably of endothelial origin. RBC perfusion at low PO2 similarly caused an L-NA-inhibitable NO production. The change in NO production upon subsequent nitrite addition, by contrast, was not inhibited by L-NA. Nitrite entered trout erythrocytes independent of degree of oxygenation, but the O2 saturation of RBCs showed a major decrease in the coronary circulation, and[NO2-] decreased while methaemoglobin rose, suggesting that deoxyHb-mediated reduction of nitrite to NO may have occurred. However,other possibilities (e.g. NO2-→NO conversion in myocardial cells) cannot be excluded. The NO formation associated with nitrite had no effect on coronary flow, possibly because NO was produced after the resistance vessels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We studied the variations caused by stress in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, LPL-mRNA, and local blood flow in LPL-rich tissues in the rat. Stress was produced by body immobilization (Immo): the rat's limbs were taped to metal mounts, and its head was placed in a plastic tube. Chronic stress (2 h daily of Immo) decreased total LPL activity in mesenteric and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) and was accompanied by a weight reduction of these tissues. In limb muscle, heart, and adrenals, total LPL activity and mRNA levels increased, and, in plasma, LPL activity and mass also increased. Acute stress (30-min Immo) caused a decrease in total LPL activity only in retroperitoneal WAT and an increase in preheparin plasma active LPL, but the overall weight of this tissue did not vary significantly. We propose an early release of the enzyme from this tissue into the bloodstream by some unknown extracellular pathways or other local mechanisms. These changes in this key energy-regulating enzyme are probably induced by catecholamines. They modify the flow of energy substrates between tissues, switching the WAT from importer to exporter of free fatty acids and favoring the uptake by muscle of circulating triacylglycerides for energy supply. Moreover, we found that acute stress almost doubled blood flow in all WAT studied, favoring the export of free fatty acids.</jats:p>",

These devices have four to six metal layers with the top layers predominately used to route the large power supply lines. To gain access to these lower signal lines, focused ion beam (FIB) must be used to cut large windows through the large power supply lines; this is very difficult. This paper demonstrates how EKC265 can be used as a copper metal etch to remove the copper of the power supply lines. This allows the FIB to cut large windows through the material layers to gain access to the lower metal layers for probing or FIB edits. Results are shown for FIB work using EKC265 and for FIB work without the using EKC265. EKC265 eliminates the need to use the FIB to remove copper giving a much more uniform milling result.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Perchlorate is a goitrogenic anion that competitively inhibits the sodium iodide transporter and has been detected in forages and in commercial milk throughout the U.S. The fate of perchlorate and its effect on animal health were studied in lactating cows, ruminally infused with perchlorate for 5 weeks. Milk perchlorate levels were highly correlated with perchlorate intake, but milk iodine was unaffected, and there were no demonstrable health effects. We provide evidence that up to 80% of dietary perchlorate was metabolized, most likely in the rumen, which would provide cattle with a degree of refractoriness to perchlorate. Data presented are important for assessing the environmental impact on perchlorate concentrations in milk and potential for relevance to human health.</jats:p>",
