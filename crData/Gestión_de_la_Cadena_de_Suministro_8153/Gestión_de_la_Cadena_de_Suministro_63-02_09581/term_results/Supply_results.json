Illus. 1963.—Examination of the placental region in the carpel of <jats:italic>Paeonia</jats:italic> indicates a complexity and super‐abundance of vascular supply beyond that usually found in angiosperms and certainly more than is necessary for adequate nutrition and water supply of the ovules. From this it is concluded that the ovules once were borne on a larger and more complex structure than the present carpel. Vascular strands leading to the aril and the hypostase are interpreted as being relictual. The large multifid aril of <jats:italic>Myristica</jats:italic> has a well‐developed vascular system composed of several sizes of branched bundles.</jats:p>",

The four treatments were: (1) 3 lb meal per pig per day reduced to 2 lb at 13 weeks of age; (2) 3 lb meal per pig per day throughout; (3) 2½ lb meal per pig per day throughout; and (4) as (1) but the daily allowance of meal increased to 2½ lb/pig at 20 weeks of age. There were five pens of nine group-fed pigs on each treatment, involving a total of 180 pigs. The pigs were on experiment from 8–9 weeks of age to bacon weight. Comprehensive carcass measurements were made on all the pigs.</jats:p><jats:p>Mean differences in rate of growth, efficiency of food utilization and carcass quality between the four groups of pigs were small and were not statistically significant. The significant differences in the proportions of meal and of whey consumed by the pigs on the different treatments during the growing period are discussed in relation to relative prices of the two foods. It is concluded that where unrestricted whey feeding is to be used, the feeding system employed in treatment 3 could be recommended in most of the environmental and economic situations likely to be encountered in practice.</jats:p><jats:p>The superior performance of the pigs in the experiment compared with that in earlier trials is discussed in relation to the stock improvement work and concurrent improvements in housing and management carried out during the intervening years on the Cow and Gate farm in Dorset where the experiments were conducted.</jats:p>",
