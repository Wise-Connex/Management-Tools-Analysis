      "abstract": "<jats:p>The total quantity of water supplied to an established lucerne stand, and the frequency of water application, were varied independently. The total quantity of water supplied during summer, autumn, and early winter was expressed as a proportion of class A pan evaporation (Epan), and ranged from 0.04 to 3.5 Epan. Dry matter production, at total water supply equal to Epan, varied between 8.6 kg ha-1 day-1 in early winter (May–June) and 97 kg ha-1 day-1 in summer (January–February), and was correlated (r = 0.99) with mean minimum temperature. The form of the response curve of log, dry matter production to water supply, relative to Epan, was similar during all seasons. Dry matter production increased approximately logarithmically with increasing water supply up to the equivalent of 0.5 Epan reached a maximum at about 1.5 Epan, and declined above this. A response surface was constructed, based upon total water supply and mean minimum temperature.Frequency of application, at a given total water supply, had no significant effect on dry matter production when total supply exceeded 0.5 Epan in any season. At a total water supply equal to 0.2 Epan, frequent small applications of water (5 mm) produced 50% more dry matter than less frequent large applications (20 and 80 mm) during summer, but only 30% as much as the less frequent applications in the subsequent autumn. Water use efficiency (ratio of dry matter production to total water supplied) was greatest at 0.5 Epan at all frequencies of application in summer. During the 6 months after irrigation treatments ceased, dry matter production was generally related to the amount of available water in the soil, but production was less, even 18 months later, on plots that had previously received the heaviest irrigation (130mm month-1). Frequency of application had no significant effect upon subsequent yield, but frequent small applications in one summer reduced the capacity of lucerne to extract soil water at low water potentials in the following summer.</jats:p>"

A stabilized regression technique was used in which the effect of each input was estimated separately by grouping farms to give six levels of the test input while all other inputs were held near the mean level. The responses in fat production per cow and per hectare to the inputs measured were: sown tropical pastures with superphosphate, 1.5 � 0.8 kg per 0.1 ha of pasture per cow and 33 � 28 kg per ha ; summer forage, 2.1 � 2.2 kg per 0.1 ha per cow and 9 � 45 kg per ha ; superphosphate on areas other than sown tropical pastures, 10.3 � 1.6 kg per 100 kg per cow and 23 � 3 kg per 100 kg per ha ; irrigation, 5.9 � 1.5 kg per 0.1 ha per cow and 203 � 27 kg per ha; fertilizer nitrogen 0.7 � 0.2 kg per kg nitrogen per cow; temperate pastures, 4.1 � 0.9 kg per 0.1 ha per cow and 90 � 20 kg per ha; supplementary feed, 3.8 � 0.6 kg per 100 kg supplement per cow and 8.1 � 1.5 kg fat per 100 kg supplement per hectare. Restricting the area of night grazing reduced fat production per cow. Sowing tropical pastures and summer forage led to only small increases in production per hectare since stocking rate was not increased, while superphosphate on areas not sown to tropical pastures, irrigation, temperate pastures, and supplementary feed not only increased production per cow but also increased the carrying capacity of the farm.</jats:p>"

This substitution process has occurred in two areas that, although historically related, can be seperated. One substitution process has been the replacement of specie with foreign sexchange as the asset used by monetary authorities for stabilizing their exchange rates. As early as the latter part of the 19th century, authorities who were stabilizing the gold values of their currencies by buying and selling gold would occassionally enter the foreign exchange market directly. By the end of World Way II, most of the major countries in teh western world outside the United States had altogether ceased stabilizing exchage rates via the gold market. Most countries are now maintaining fixed exchange rates by direct purchases and sales in the markets for foreign exchange rates by direct puchases and sales in the markets for foreign exchange. The other substitution process, about which more is known, has been the partial replacement of gold with interest bearing securities in the international reserve of monetary authorities.</jats:p>"

The effect of water supply on photosynthesis and movement of assimilates was greater for leaves than ears, so that drought increased the proportion of assimilate contributed by ear photosynthesis to grain filling from 13% to 24% in the awnless ears, and from 34% to 43% in the awned ears.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C assimilated by the ears was most important to the economy of the upper spikelets and to the distal florets in each spikelet, whereas flag leaf assimilate went mainly to the spikelets in the lower half of the ear, and to the proximal florets.</jats:p><jats:p>Awns increased grain yield in the dry but not in the irrigated treatment, despite the large contribution of awned ears to grain filling. Either the supply of assimilate did not limit grain yield when water supply was not limiting, or there were compensating disadvantages to awns. However, they did not seem to have any adverse effect on the development of the upper florets, nor did they reduce grain number per ear.</jats:p>",
