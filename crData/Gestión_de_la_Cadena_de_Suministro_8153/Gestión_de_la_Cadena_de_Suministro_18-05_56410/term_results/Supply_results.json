To fill this gap in the literature, we investigate the effects of supply chain integration on contract manufacturing efficiency using the objective measure of return on contract manufacturing. Unlike prior studies, this research uses finer‐grained dimensions of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCI</jats:styled-content> by not only differentiating between customer and supplier integration but also by separating integration activities depending on their purpose for either product development or process improvement, thus enhancing our understanding of the underlying theoretical dynamics by disentangling each dimension's respective contribution to a firm's contract manufacturing efficiency. Using archival survey data from 322 manufacturing firms collected by the Korea Productivity Center, we demonstrate that integration activities with customers and suppliers, depending on whether they focus on <jats:italic>products</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>processes</jats:italic>, generate contradicting outcomes in terms of return on contract manufacturing, thereby challenging the implicit assumption about the equivocal benefits of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCI</jats:styled-content> across manufacturing systems. Furthermore, our findings substantiate the positive moderating effects of cross‐functional integration on the external integration–performance links by demonstrating the amplified effects, either positive or negative, of integration on return on contract manufacturing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The components of national freight logistics costs are still optimised in isolation, instead of systemic optimisation between logistics and other supply chain elements. The risk is the tragedy of the commons effect, where a positive return for economic activities in isolation could lead to a negative collective result in the long-term. Therefore, there is a need to elevate the systemic view of logistics to the macroeconomic realm.Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to further the macrologistics discipline through its formal definition and to develop an instrumentation construct to support macroeconomic trade-off analysis. The secondary objective was to apply instrumentation outputs to national-level logistics challenges.Method: A review of macrologistics was conducted, followed by a discussion on macrologistics instrumentation, which is twofold: a freight-flow model and a related logistics costs model. A disaggregated national input–output table was developed, followed by gravity modelling, to determine freight flows. Logistics cost calculations relate these flows to the costs of fulfilling associated logistics functions.Results: This review contributes to the developing theory of macrologistics, while the instrumentation outputs improve the systemic understanding of the national freight-flow landscape, enabling informed debate and prioritisation analysis. This systemic view enabled macrologistics proposals to address South Africa’s logistics challenges, including proposals regarding a domestic intermodal strategy externality cost internalisation; international trade facilitation; infrastructure investments; and rail branch line revitalisation.Conclusion: The elevation of logistics to the macroeconomic realm will enable the management of logistics as a national production factor, thereby contributing to reducing national freight logistics costs and improving national competitiveness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Traditional electricity planning in the United States has typically been focused on forecasting future demand and identifying the need for new large generating facilities that involve one-way flows from central power plants to customers. However, legal innovation has incentivized the deployment of more energy resources at the customer end of the electricity network and technological innovation has facilitated rapid expansion in the number and capacity of these distributed energy resources. These changes now require innovation in the type of planning for future energy resources that must be employed to ensure an efficient and reliable electric energy network. Deployment of the rapidly growing number of distributed energy resources —solar and wind generation, combined heat and power, fuel cells, battery storage, demand response and energy efficiency—is facilitated by an increasingly smart grid. This chapter proposes a new, distributed resource-planning process to better integrate all of these distributed resources into the grid.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Early innovators in CHP-DH, the Soviet Union opted for the large-scale deployment of CHP-DH to ensure the centralized supply of heat and electricity, while in most countries’ heat production and supply was developed based on individual boilers. Currently, Russian heat production installations have low energy efficiency. CHP-DH penetration rate has been decreasing as consumers have started to switch to individual boilers. This ‘chaotic boilerization’ trend threatens to nullify the innovation gains achieved by Russia. To attract investments in the modernization of the CHP-DH infrastructure, Russia adopted an innovative approach to regulation: market-based principles in heat supply. Surprisingly, despite government interference, authorities have concluded that the market—instead of subsidies—must drive innovation. Russian experience highlights the difficulty of implementing innovative market-based reforms to attract investments in CHP-DH systems. Price limits avoid abuses of the heat suppliers’ de facto monopoly and thus remain a crucial regulatory task to ensure affordability.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholars in the field of supply chain management have started to embrace the idea of simultaneous cooperation and competition (“coopetition”) in supplier networks but have mainly looked at coopetition from a structural perspective. In this article, we complement the structural view with a paradox perspective to investigate the competitive tensions that evolve when buying firms are trying to engage both forces simultaneously in their relations with core suppliers. Our comparative case study of four major carmakers reveals different strategies buying firms use to manage coopetition in their supplier networks, the responses they trigger from their suppliers, and the resulting paradoxical tensions. Our inductive analysis reveals that irrespective of the managing approach chosen, the “coopetition capabilities” of the buying firm determines whether negative tension dynamics can be avoided. At the core of such coopetition capabilities are “evaluative capabilities” allowing the buyer to provide cost improvement suggestions to suppliers for the sake of joint value creation and to control the division of value appropriation through a deeper understanding of the supplier's cost structures. By highlighting the nature of coopetition capabilities as <jats:italic>organizational</jats:italic> capabilities, we also contribute to paradox research, going beyond its current focus on the individual cognitions of managers.</jats:p>",

The performance of SMEs in Kenya has, however, been poor, despite their significance. This poor performance is attributed to the high costs of logistics operations in the country. Manufacturing SMEs can, however, improve the performance of their logistics operations by adopting appropriate logistics outsourcing strategies.Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of logistics outsourcing among manufacturing SMEs in Nairobi.Setting: Manufacturing SMEs in Nairobi operate from the industrial zones of the Nairobi City County. The enterprises’ logistics operations are characterised by long cycle times, high transportation costs and limited resources. The high operational costs experienced by the SMEs threaten their survival, and they are therefore required, among other things, to manage their logistics more efficiently to improve overall performance.Method: A quantitative research design was used in this study. Data were collected from 163 manufacturing SMEs using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and (a one-way analysis of variance) ANOVA were used to analyse the data.Results: Most (94%) of the manufacturing SMEs opted to outsource their logistics operations, although the extent of outsourcing was limited (1% – 50% of logistics operations were outsourced). Logistics outsourcing by the SMEs is intended to reduce logistics costs and supplement the limited in-house capabilities. In addition, there were significant differences in the extent of outsourcing of operational, information processing and value-added categories of logistics activities.Conclusion: The results motivate SME owners and managers to acquire logistics resources and capabilities that are lacking in-house through logistics outsourcing to achieve the required efficiencies. Although the majority of SMEs have embraced logistics outsourcing, the low extent of its usage within the enterprises might have limited the ability to achieve high efficiencies.</jats:p>"

The findings from this study have implications for theory and practice, as Lean and Agile firms can be found in the automotive SC without any relationship to the value-adding process. To speculate as to why the findings contest existing views, resource dependence theory and, more specifically, a power perspective, was invoked.

However, there is a lack of understanding of the costs water tariffs should cover to enable its environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable use. Nestlé uses different tools to orient its business regarding water, including water scarcity indices and the notional cost of water. A new methodology to determine the cost of water stewardship could become a game changer. Unlike current practice, where externalities of water are calculated ex-post, this methodology guides decision makers to better pricing decisions prior to the occurrence of negative externalities, based on the observed gap of financing. Preliminary results indicate that, first, urban water tariffs seem higher than the full cost of water stewardship; second, we often overestimate the financial means required to close the water supply-demand gap; third, costs of action upon water challenges are lower than the costs of inaction.</p>",

A plethora of methods and technologies combined with a variety of objectives creates a barrier for managers to decide how to act, while researchers investigating the impact of Analytics oftentimes neglect this complexity when generalizing their results. Based on a cluster analysis applied to 46 case studies of Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) we propose 6 archetypes of initiatives in SCA to provide orientation for managers as means to overcome barriers and build competitive advantage. Further, the derived archetypes present a distinction of SCA for researchers seeking to investigate the effects of SCA on organizational performance.</jats:p>"

How organizations respond to these disruptions has an impact on the relationship between the parties involved. This study explored what factors influenced buyer-supplier relationships in either a strengthening or weakening manner within a disruption context. A generic qualitative research approach was used to gather data by conducting semi-structured interviews with 24 participants that consisted of 3PLs and clients who have experienced a recent disruption between each other. This study reported on the relational factors within pre-, during- and post- disruption phases. A total of 18 strengthening factors were identified with the majority being classified into the during-disruption phase. The factors that added to existing disruption literature included having a mutual business understanding, problem solving ability and an introspective focus when resolving disruptions. Twelve weakening factors emerged from the data. Common business problems, a lack of, or weak prior relationship, no mutual business understanding and the occurrence and late detection of the disruption are novel findings. Practitioners gain value from this study as it equips them to manage supply chain disruptions successfully by highlighting important strengthening and weakening relational factors to consider when working with supply chain members to resolve disruptions. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by being one of the first empirical studies conducted on the relational effects of supply chain disruptions in a developing country context.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogen mobility is one option for reducing local emissions, avoiding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and moving away from a mainly oil-based transport system towards a diversification of energy sources. As hydrogen production can be based on a broad variety of technologies already existing or under development, a comprehensive assessment of the different supply chains is necessary regarding not only costs but also diverse environmental impacts. Therefore, in this paper, a broad variety of hydrogen production technologies using different energy sources, renewable and fossil, are exemplarily assessed with the help of a Life Cycle Assessment and a cost assessment for Germany. As environmental impacts, along with the impact category Climate change, five more advanced impact categories are assessed. The results show that from an environmental point of view, PEM and alkaline electrolysis are characterized by the lowest results in five out of six impact categories. Supply chains using fossil fuels, in contrast, have the lowest supply costs; this is true, e.g., for steam methane reforming. Solar powered hydrogen production shows low impacts during hydrogen production but high impacts for transport and distribution to Germany. There is no single supply chain that is the most promising for every aspect assessed here. Either costs have to be lowered further or supply chains with selected environmental impacts have to be modified.</jats:p>"

A reinterpretation of the meaning of supply and demand is suggested as the basis for bringing The Law back into the corpus of economic theory, that is, supply and demand should be conceived of the same way Adam Smith and the whole classical school conceived of them—as simple quantities.</jats:p>"

Previous literatures have found the separate roles of green entrepreneurial orientation and inter-organizational learning in understanding green innovation issues. However, few studies have done a comprehensive analysis of integrating three streams of research: green entrepreneurial orientation, green innovation and supply chain learning capability. Based on the resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, we examine the direct of green entrepreneurial orientation on green innovation as well as indirect effect through the mediation of supply chain learning capability. Meanwhile, an empirical data set of 228 manufacturing companies in China (Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Shandong) was used to test our hypotheses. Findings from our empirical study suggest that supply chain learning capability partially mediates the positive relationships between green entrepreneurial orientation and its two consequences&amp;mdash;green incremental innovation and green radical innovation. In addition, this research implies that when enterprise has a strong green entrepreneurial orientation, the enterprise should make an effort to enhance the level of supply chain learning capability so as to fully develop their green innovation.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve this, they are adopting new business models and strategies that allow them to move towards sustainability. Strategies such as CSR (Corporate social responsibility) and supply chain management have become essential for ensuring a company&amp;rsquo;s permanence and financial consolidation. The literature has stated that the theories of Stakeholders and Sustainability are fundamental pillars for the development and sustained growth of business. The purpose of this article is to examine the effects of CSR and the SC (supply chain) on innovation, image and reputation, and in turn, their influences on profitability in SMEs. This research is based on a sample of 143 companies in the city of Guaymas Sonora, in Mexico. For the analysis and validation of the results, we used the SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) statistical technique based on the variance, through PLS (Partial Least Squares) (using SmartPLS version 3.2.6 Professional). The findings show that SMEs that develop social and sustainable practices increase their level of innovation, and improve their image, their reputation, and their financial profitability. This work contributes mainly to the development of Stakeholders and Sustainability.</jats:p>"

The model is started by risk identification which showed that there were 52 risks along the whole chain. Then these risks were evaluated by using risk index measurement which showed that the dairy farmer sphere has the highest risk proportion on the whole chain. Finally, the optimum prices were obtained by using risk sharing model which is generated from the result of risk evaluation and the result of stakeholder efficiency measurement by using DEA method. We also found that the prices fluctuation among the DMU became smoothly after the optimization which occurred as a result of risk distribution along the chain.</jats:p>"

The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) helps to improve collaboration and improve the construction process. The improved installation precision provided by BIM Model-Driven Prefabrication can decrease on-site labor time and increase productivity. Prefabrication, Modularization, and off-site construction transfers activities that would have been performed on site to earlier stages of the supply chain. The implementation of Just-In-Time (JIT) delivery transfers the costs and risks associated with inventory to the supplier. Construction Supply Chain Integration can help reduce cost and waste across the supply chain particularly for large and complex buildings. This paper presents a methodology that utilizes a BIM based construction supply chain integration to reduce cost and waste in the construction and offsite manufacturing processes. It utilizes the integration of BIM with the on-site schedule and the manufacturing or fabrication schedule of the different supply chain members. The methodology utilizes the onsite schedule, lead times of prefabricated elements or modules and the transportation logistics to help reduce cost across the supply chain. The information, material and cash flows as well as the transportation logistics is utilized in generating an optimized just-in-time delivery schedule for large and complex buildings. The optimized delivery schedule takes into account the variations in the on-site and off-site schedules to forecast delivery dates of precast elements or fabricated modules.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vegetables are an important commodity for a country. Vegetable prices contribute to the inflation rate in some regions of Indonesia. Inflation and deflation are inseparable from the type of food and vegetable groups because the majority of the population have jobs as vegetable farmers. SeloBoyolali is a vegetable producing area, but currently it can not meet the needs of its own region. Supply of vegetables began to decrease due to pests and vegetable turnover into tobacco. If the delivery of vegetables is hampered there will be a scarcity of vegetables that result in price increases. The length of the distribution channel has a negative impact, namely the price of commodities set by the middlemen or traders who distribute vegetables from the producers. So sometimes local farmers do not have bargaining power on the price determination of vegetables. This study aims to analyze the pattern of price formation and vegetable distribution in Boyolali. The analytical framework used in this research is supply chain management framework. The method used in this research is quantitative and qualitative. Respondents from this study were 101 people. Farmers in the slopes of Mount Merapi and Merbabu such as the villages of Selo, Cepogo, Ampel, and Musuk. These villages became the basis of vegetable production sufficient for Boyolali area and became the main supplier of vegetables in Soloraya and Yogyakarta. Modern channels are traders who channel the modern market such as supermarkets, supermarkets and other modern shops. In this channel, only goods that have the best quality and the price can be 2-5 times the price in the traditional market. Traditional channels are traders who are in the traditional market, in this channel the incoming goods are not limited and all kinds of goods can enter with all the existing quality from best to worst mixed here. However, the prices that apply here are also not as high as the modern market. Mixed channels are widely used by middlemen or farmers. Here the goods that have good quality are separated and then sold to the modern market in hopes of getting more profit. While the goods with the second quality go to the traditional distribution channels are cheaper. At this level the price of vegetables is strongly influenced by the quality of vegetables, the amount of vegetable availability and the amount of vegetable demand itself.</jats:p>"

Such FDI might be called “Quality FDI” that contributes to the creation of decent and value-adding jobs, enhancing the skill base of host economies, facilitating transfer of technology, knowledge and know-how, boosting competitiveness of domestic firms and enabling their access to world-wide markets, as well as operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. To attract such quality FDI, host countries need mindfully tailored policies. Recent research offers evidence for strategies in developing countries that successfully turned FDI into such quality FDI.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on the macroeconomic policy and public policy especially causality between two variables namely inflation and money supply in Indonesia. This study uses Indonesian macroeconomic data of inflation and money supply from the Bank of Indonesia publication during 2007.1–2017.7. Inflation is measured by the consumer price index, reflects the annual percentage change in costs of acquiring a basket of goods and services to the average consumers that may change at specified intervals. Meanwhile, money supply is measured by the currency, demand deposits, time deposits, and saving deposits. Methodically, this study uses the Granger Causality model to determine the causality between inflation and money supply. The results show that there is a one-way causality between inflation and money supply in Indonesia. These findings imply that money supply causes inflation, but not vice versa. This condition implies that the role of Indonesian Government and Bank of Indonesia were very crucial in managing and controlling macroeconomic policy and public policy. Then, analysis of money supply and inflation also related to impacting factors such as money laundering, role of banks, taxation, tax evasion, and corruption.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Often studies on tourism come from the consumer perspective. However, this study focuses on the supply side of the industry using the wonders of Niah Cave which is located in interior Sarawak, Malaysia. Amongst others, Niah Cave has hundred thousands of swiftlet population and the world’s famous archaeological site to attract tourists. This article explores a venue whereby the tourism’s supply side, in this instance, the swiftlet population could be bridged with the industry’s consumer side. The evolvement of sustainability conscious consumers, particularly in the millennium era results in the advocation of consumption in a more sustainable manner, irrespective whether the products are man-made or in the forms of the natural environment. An interpretative research method with the like of observation and semi-structured in-depth interviews formed the data gathering tool. The Niah Cave was explored in late January 2017. Findings show that Niah Cave was literally on the tourist map due to its world’s famous archaeological site. The huge population of swiftlets with their nests attracted harvesters for decade. The processes of harvesting these nests which remarkably endured through climbing bamboo ladders and dangling ropes from cave ceilings, hundreds feet from the cave floor, charmed tourists</jats:p>"

In the model, equilibrium rental rates are determined so that the number of households choosing each neighborhood is equal to the number of housing units in each neighborhood. We use the estimated model to simulate how rental rates would respond to an exogenous increase in the number of housing units in a neighborhood. We find that the rent elasticity is low, and thus marginal reductions in supply constraints alone are unlikely to meaningfully reduce rent burdens. The reason for this result appears to be that rental rates are more closely determined by the level of amenities in a neighborhood—as in a Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium framework—than by the supply of housing.</jats:p>"

However, no guidance has been provided on how SC members could collaborate on their sustainability development efforts to achieve the intended economic performance. This study addressed this research gap by proposing different contractual governances, based on a game-theoretic approach, for both manufacturer and retailer to better engage in JSD. Specifically, multiple JSD contractual arrangements regarding profit and associated cost sharing between manufacturers and retailers were defined and evaluated. Our analyses show that the manufacturer behaves opportunistically when the impact of a retailer’s effort on consumer demand is low. In other words, the retailer increases its sustainability effort, but not the manufacturer. However, such opportunistic behavior can be removed under a revenue sharing arrangement. That is, the manufacturer becomes cooperative with the retailer, and both retailer and manufacturer increase their JSD efforts. Several numerical experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of various revenue sharing arrangements (no sharing, partial profit sharing, and total profit sharing) in devising and implementing a mutually beneficial JSD program. Accordingly, several guidelines for the SC JSD implementation are provided.</jats:p>"

Creating a reliable model of WDS requires a large amount of system response data for different case scenarios. Commonly used software for creating models of WDS is EpaNet. Ongoing processes in WDS, such as pipe bursts, permanently closed valves which are not registered in the data base and other inconsistencies will change WDS network topology, so WDS validation tests are to be applied from time to time. This paper presents the WDS network topology validation test conducted on one district metered area of Belgrade with two inflows. The pressure drop test combined with genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization are simple hydroinformatic tools available for network topology validation. The system's reaction under a pressure change during the isolation test was measured at two observation points. Obtained results are then compared with assumed WDS topology using 55 potential locations of inconsistencies in the EpaNet model. This step is repeated until a good enough match between results from the real system and the created model's version is obtained. Heuristic optimization algorithms are used for speeding up the process of finding a satisfactory match (unknown locations of inconsistencies) by minimizing or maximizing the defined criteria function.</jats:p>",

Although the Malaysian Water Association (MWA) had introduced a list of PIs, these indicators do not include aspects of water resources, and emphasize very little on personnel aspects. Many other international organizations, such as International Water Association (IWA), The World Bank Group (WBG), Office of Water Services, United Kingdom (OFWAT) and the Indonesian Water Supply Association (PERPAMSI), have introduced their very own list of indicators to assess the performance of their respective water supply services industry. However, these indicators as suggested by the various organizations are tailored for different objectives and priorities and thus may not be readily applicable to the Malaysian context. This paper describes and discusses on the establishment of a new set of performance indicators that covers all six major aspects of water supply services industry, namely, the management of water resources, personnel, physical assets, operation, quality of service and financial, for water supply services in Malaysia. The final list of PIs has further enhanced the existing PIs by covering all six key aspects in water supply services besides classifying the PIs into three levels of information grading, i.e., for public assessment, internal assessment and decision-making.</jats:p>"

It is imperative to recognize that not all customers are equal, as each has different requirements for their products and delivery of same to their final customers, and it is therefore important to consider all the factors that influence that outcome. The case study was developed in a company producing plastic containers in Cd. Obregon, Sonora. The study has selected the manufacture of the 737 gr salt container from resin, as this is a product demanded by one of its three main customers. The problem in the plant was the number of salt containers to be produced with different production policies, generating three scenarios.Método:  To respond to the problem, a study of the entire production process associated with the links in the supply and distribution was conducted based on the methodology of system dynamics to evaluate each of the variables and parameters included in the links in the supply chain via a simulation.Resultados: The results show three different scenarios that are executed through an interface with the user, allowing to observe the behavior of the profits, the sales of finished product and the use of the resin in the manufacture of bottles of 737 gr for a company that manufactures and distributes salt proposals were validated by drawing upon the judgment of experts on the subject and the experience of employees, as well as the actual data of the companyDiscusión o Conclusión: The findings reveal different modes of behavior of four critical variables in the process: profits, sales, the finished products warehouse, and resin use. The simulation was performed with the use of Stella ® 10.1.2 software, trying different policies and considering delay and initial inventory theories in processes and final products for the three different proposed scenarios derived from this study to interested parties (employers and customers); the case study was developed within the context of the National Center for Innovation in Intermodal Transportation and Logistics of Mexico.</jats:p>"

The results of the NNGA tool were compared with two pumping plans: the plan based on the pumping regulation model, and the plan used by the company of water and sewage of the city of Algiers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our analysis documents that the existence of hidden “holes” in the capital of not yet failed banks - while creating intertemporal pressure on the actual level of capital - leads to changing of maturity of loans supplied rather than to contracting of their volume. Long-term loans decrease, whereas short-term loans rise - and, what is most remarkably, by approximately the same amounts. Standardly, the higher the maturity of loans the higher the credit risk and, thus, the more loan loss reserves (LLP) banks are forced to create, increasing the pressure on capital. Banks that already hide “holes” in the capital, but have not yet faced with license withdrawal, must possess strong incentives to shorten the maturity of supplied loans. On the one hand, it raises the turnovers of LLP and facilitates the flexibility of capital management; on the other hand, it allows increasing the speed of shifting of attracted deposits to loans to related parties in domestic or foreign jurisdictions. This enlarges the potential size of ex post revealed “hole” in the capital and, therefore, allows us to assume that not every loan might be viewed as a good for the economy: excessive short-term and insufficient long-term loans can produce the source for future losses.</jats:p>"

An increasingly important alternative is to shift from centralized to hybrid systems, often in response to climate variability and demographic changes. In a hybrid system, water is supplied and discharged through a mix of centralized and decentralized systems. There is usually no single objective that justifies the choice of hybrid water systems, but they typically are justified based on the consideration of a number of different criteria in order to evaluate the overall quality of service provision. The most important criteria include meeting water demand, as well as reducing demand for fresh water and instead using local alternative water supplies. Integration of multiple objectives to evaluate the hybrid water supply systems can be accomplished by multi-criteria decision aid techniques. This paper evaluates a number of hybrid water supply scenarios using a case study based on the Northern Growth Area of Melbourne, Australia. It uses the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) and Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Decision Aid (GAIA), one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods through D-Sight software, to rank the hybrid water supply scenarios, and this ranking is validated by means of sensitivity analysis. The centralized system combined with stormwater harvesting and the centralized system combined with treated wastewater and rainwater tanks yielded the first and second most preferred scenarios, while the centralized water supply system combined with treated wastewater yielded the worst hybrid water supply option.</jats:p>"

At Sikorsky, our sand cast components only seem to be getting more complex, with more demanding dimensional and metallurgical requirements.

This research aimed at figuring out the performance of the existing UGM-DWSS against the current service pipeline distribution network so that the technical condition of the pipes’ pressure, the water consumption’s discharge, and the pumps’ use can be identified. The method used for analyzing is by implementing simulating the network performance using WaterNet program version 2.2 by which pipes network and its facilities performance including optimization of pipe diameter can be described. The simulation indicated that there was 80% idle capacity of the available water capacity. It is uneconomical to make any changes to the existing pipes’ condition considering the very high cost of the pipeline construction. Therefore, pump replacement was considered more feasible optimization approach.

The aim is to put forward a simple guideline that companies can follow and guide them in achieving their carbon emission targets, as well as obtaining attractive supply chain savings.Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature review and benchmarking this paper proposes a methodology based on three pillars: 1) Corporate Carbon Strategy; 2) Carbon emission roadmap; and 3) Implementation and tracking. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were used in order to create a green strategy and support the decision-making processes to select the most interesting alternatives for carbon emission reduction and supply chain savings. The supply chain of a metallurgical company is used to illustrate the case study where the proposed methodology is used. The criteria used for the carbon alternatives selection was based on three factors: 1) the supply chain cost of the alternative; 2) carbon emission impact in terms of CO2 tonnes; and 3) marketing effect.Findings: The paper identifies some specific steps for developing a Green Supply Chain Strategy. The case study developed, demonstrates the importance of following a proper methodology based on a set of steps, it also demonstrates that some alternatives focus on improving the supply chain, such as the facilities location, can also improve the key performance indicator related with carbon emission. Originality/value: The study provides guidance for manufacturing companies in implementing their Green Supply Chain Strategy.</jats:p>"

An evaluation indicator system of regional agricultural water use efficiency was constructed using data from 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province from 2013 to 2015. In addition, the comprehensive ranking of agricultural water use efficiency in each year was obtained by using an iterative combination method to correct the evaluation of individual models, including the analytic hierarchy process), matter element model and projection pursuit model (PPM). The results showed that the agricultural water use efficiency in Heilongjiang Province exhibited some regional differences in the 3 years evaluated spatially. And then, factors that influenced agricultural water use efficiency were analysed according to various criteria, and the rankings of cities and strategies were proposed to improve the agricultural water use efficiency according to this analysis. The results of the present study will have important theoretical and practical significance for guiding the scientific and rational formulation of agricultural water use strategies and improving the efficiency of agricultural water use in Heilongjiang Province.</jats:p>",

The industry consumes 7% of all energy produced in the world, increasing the costs of operations that cannot be fully passed on to users, especially in developing countries such as Brazil. The worldwide projection of rising electricity prices further aggravates the situation, motivating a mapping of the energy efficiency of the sector in order to identify points of improvement. Several articles on the topic have already been published, but information for Brazil is scarce. This paper presents a review on the energy consumption in each stage of the water and wastewater sector, including the Brazilian scenario. Searches on the site www.sciencedirect.com, using as keywords wastewater, water, energy, consumption and Brazil and government websites resulted in 20 documents that compose this work. The objective of this work was to review the energy consumption in collective water supply and wastewater systems, from raw water abstraction to the final disposal of the treated sewage, by compiling information and adding data on the Brazilian scenario. In general, the current system is inefficient and require political integration in water and energy in order to overcome the challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Other problems in Kotamobagu were related to the supply, backwash, insufficient electrical power supply, no water meter, reservoir leakage, and intake pipes leakage in Poyowa and Bilalang. This research aims to find the root of the problem in terms of Clean Water Supply System (CWSS)'s network system, organization, regulation, and management. The research focused on Poyowa Besar's CWSS and Bilalang-1's CWSS networks in Kotamobagu. The research methods included observation, survey, and policy analysis where respondents were required as sources of information. The respondents were from Sia's and Pontodon's CWSS that represented 162 house connections. Additional respondents representing 30 house connections were selected randomly at Poyowa Besar's and Bilalang-1's CWSS for comparison. The results indicated that the community, CWSS managers, and the Central Government support the existence of Kotamobagu CWSS management. The 30 house connections at Poyowa Besar's and Bilalang-1's CWSS have never been served with water, but the respondents positively hope that the matter will be solved in the near future. They were willing to keep waiting for the water network of Kotamobagu's CWSS. The root of the problem in the Poyowa Besar's and Bilalang-1's implementation was due primarily to a network system that was built by the Ministry of Public Works for the Municipal Government of Kotamobaguwas reportedly not in accordance with procurement regulation. There was disagreement between the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) and the CWSS managers related to the items that have to be fulfilled for network infrastructure handover.</jats:p>"

Considering the manufacturers’ cooperation or noncooperation strategies, we first give the centralized pricing model as a benchmark. According to market power among the supply chain, we analyze two types of supply chains: supplier-led type where the green driving factor comes from the suppliers and retailer-led type where the core member retailer leads the green supply chain. We then give two decentralized pricing models through considering strategic cooperation between two manufacturers and different structures. Corresponding closed-form expressions for equilibrium pricing strategies are established. Finally, many valuable managerial results are acquired through comparing the profits and equilibrium decisions of these models. Our paper shows that consumers are indifferent as to who is the leader of the two echelons when the manufacturers adopt non-cooperative action; the two complementary products get the same optimal wholesale/retail prices, maximum retail margins, and maximum demands regardless of the manufacturers’ cooperation or noncooperation strategies.</jats:p>"

For the family farmer, the short chains constitute anexcellent way of diversifying their produce, gaining higher added value and thus warranting steadier revenues. This paper thus aims to discern the distinguishing features that the short chains offer, in general, to the family farm. To accomplish this, a literature review was performed to study the works done and approaches conducted on the short chains in the academy, in terms of family farm, and identify their specifications. Positive characteristics related to family farmers were recognizable in comparison with short chains. This article emphasized the significance and need for future research, as well as the necessity for a more extensive exploration of the subject of short chains, focusing attention on this sector, and pinpointing the determinants to be developed in the market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate how recycling can be a strategic source of supply in the presence of a changing supply market. This research is inspired by the metal cutting tools industry, where challenges regarding a key raw material present an opportunity for the manufacturers to create an alternative supply source by recycling. In this study, there is a virgin material market that supplies two manufacturers differentiated in their recycling ability. The problem is formulated as a game, where the manufacturers first make a decision to recycle or not, and then decide on their respective production quantities, and recycling rates. Depending on the fixed recycling cost relative to the unit cost of the virgin material, as well as the recycling cost structure of the two manufacturers, there are four possible equilibria: both manufacturers recycle, neither manufacturer recycles, only the more recycling‐capable manufacturer recycles, or a scenario with two Nash equilibria (either manufacturer recycles whereas the other does not). We show that recycling is indeed a strategic supply source resulting in higher quantities and profits. Interestingly, a manufacturer may recycle less if the unit cost of the virgin material increases, at high recycling rates. This result emphasizes the importance of carefully modeling the recycling cost structure. Although a recycled unit has necessarily a lower life‐cycle environmental impact than a unit made of virgin materials, the industry‐wide environmental impact can be higher in a recycling scenario due to higher production quantities overall. Welfare, however, is higher with recycling. </jats:p>",

This model is capable of minimizing the deviation between observed and calculated drawdowns of pumping test data. To assess the applicability of the model, its results are compared with the graphically obtained solutions from Boulton's equation. To this end, real pumping test data obtained from an unconfined aquifer in Dayton, Ohio, are considered as the case problem to evaluate the efficacy of the model. In the fuzzy approach, pumping rate is considered as an uncertain variable. For evaluation of the model, several statistical error indices are utilized. Results show better matches for the model as evidenced by much smaller errors. As an example, mean absolute relative error for the proposed model and graphical Boulton's solution is 2.52% and 4.98%, respectively. It is concluded that the model is accurate and may replace the graphical Boulton's solution. T and Sy were found to be more sensitive to uncertainty in the pumping rate measurement, when compared with S and r/Dt.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern radio electronic equipment (REE) in various areas of economic activity performs increasingly complex tasks at sites with increased levels of responsibility. This circumstance increases the dependence of the operation of the REE on the uninterrupted power supply and its quality level, as well as on the level of fault tolerance of an important auxiliary part of the REE - power supply system (PSS), which significantly affects the ability of the REE to perform its tasks. The results of the analysis of existing and search for promising ways to ensure a given level of reliability of REE associated with its power supply problems show the need for an integrated approach to choosing the most effective option. It consists in the cumulative implementation of the process indicated by the newly introduced term «reliability of the power supply chain (PSC) of the REE», combining the continuity of supplying REE with electricity of the established level of quality and trouble-free operation of the PSS performing the conversion of the initial electricity to the form and the values of its parameters acceptable for the power supply of the functional units REE. Ways to improve the reliability of the PSC of the REE of ground stationary objects are considered for two of its characteristic types - a computer system (CS) and a telecommunication system (TS) with a single-phase voltage of 220V; 50Hz and the value of power consumption to 3-5kW. In terms of increasing the continuity of electricity supply, the feature of the proposed solutions is the achievement of the set goal by additional use of existing resources of the facilities of the REE installation. In some cases, their limited increase is also envisaged. In order to increase the fault tolerance, the PSS REA suggests: in the centralized part of the PSS - the application of the trunk-modular architecture, the choice of the effective structure, and also the adaptive methods and algorithms for management and redundancy, in the distributed part of the PSS - optimization of the structure and minimization of the number of constituent parts.</jats:p>"

In operating the Dynamic Positioning System, a master helped by a deck officer who had Dynٰamic Positioning or Dynamic Positioning operator certificate. Only a Dynamic Positioning Operator that operated the Dynamic Positioning equipment. To become a Dynamic Positioning Operator, she/he had to gone through Dynamic Positioning Basic or introduction course and Dynamic Positioning Advance or simulator course. All the required documents for Dynamic Positioning Operator called Dynamic Positioning log. After all the requirements are fulfill the Dynamic Positioning log is sent to London to be processed and registered for the Dynamic  Positioning Operator certification. The role of a Dynamic Positioning Operator is very important in operating the Dynamic Positioning System as well as the maintenance the availability of the spare part on board of the vessel. Based on the report, most vessels’ accidents were because of human factor or human error. This become a prove that in order to smoothen work on board of vessel is not only about the condition of the vessel but also the conditional of the equipment, officers/ crews on board, work etiquette also if it is being reversed, it will increase the accident risk. Because working on board of a vessel, especially rig’s supply vessels are hard work as well as challenging, high risk also dangerous.

Wealthy Chinese consumers demand food of superior quality. However, with the national grain security goal focused primarily on self-sufficiency, China has no choice but to keep increasing the scale of agricultural industrialization and modernization, which inevitably brings in unwanted chemical input that puts food safety at risk. China’s consumers started to adopt an alternative food supply method.

This paper has then verified the disturbed coordination strategy through using the actual data of Jiangsu Yueda Kate New Energy Co. Ltd.

Sustainability, as a complex and challenging concept, affects the approach to establishing and maintaining relations, extending their scope and scale. Next to the traditional understanding of relations in a supply chain, additional goals emerge, resulting in both positive effects and challenges which its different links need to face. The concept of sustainability means that a business organisation takes on shared responsibility for the whole supply chain to achieve its long‑term goals. Relationships are an important factor affecting the ability to create and manage a sustainable supply chain. Relationship Management seems to be the basis for the creation of a stable and continuous chain which presents characteristics of maturity. The aim of the article is to introduce the issue of maturity which determines the degree of achievement of sustainable development objectives in a supply chain.

Noise is mainly caused by the inability of the monitoring equipment to accurately register water consumption and data-loggers to register, without distortion, the signal received from the water meter. A universal filtering algorithm has been developed to remove noise and simplify water consumption flow traces with the aim of improving future automatic end-use identification algorithms. The performance of the proposed filtering methodology is assessed through the analysis of 21,647 events. Water consumption data were sourced from two different water end-use studies, having consumers and monitoring equipment with dissimilar characteristics. The results obtained show that the algorithm is capable of removing an average of 70% of the data points that constitute the flow traces of the complex events examined. The simplified flow traces allow for faster and more accurate disaggregation and classification algorithms, without losing significant information or distorting the original signal. The ability of the proposed filtering algorithm to fit the original flow traces was benchmarked using the Kling–Gupta efficiency coefficient, obtaining an average value above 0.79.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Climate change is a global stressor that can undermine water management policies developed under the assumption of stationary climate, necessitating robust solutions to reducing the risk of system failures for uncertain future climates. While the response-surface-based assessments have provided convenience to explore responsive behaviours of expected system performance to climatic stresses, they were unable to predict the risk of system failures from individual climate projections. In this study, we proposed to use the logistic regressions for evaluating the probability of non-successive outcomes against pre-defined thresholds directly from climate projections, which may be more informative for decision making processes than the expected performances. As a case study, water supply and ecological reliabilities within a large river basin were assessed by combining the eco-engineering decision scaling framework and the logistic regressions. The impact assessment for the South Korean river basin showed that optimal water supply performance at the sub-basins were expected to be satisfactory for the upcoming 20 years of 2020–2039, while the human-demand-only operations could lower the ecological reliabilities. When considering ecological demands in water operations to reduce the ecological vulnerabilities, the stakeholders should accept increasing risks of unsatisfactory supply at the sub-basins with low demands. This study highlights that binary conversions of the performance metrics from the stress tests allow users to measure the risks of system failures varying across sub-components and standpoints with minimal computational costs.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In steep headwater reaches, episodic mass movements can deliver large volumes of sediment to fluvial channels. If these inputs of sediment occur with a high frequency and magnitude, the capacity of the stream to rework the supplied material can be exceeded for a significant amount of time. To study the equilibrium conditions in a channel following different episodic sediment supply regimes (defined by grain size distribution, frequency, and magnitude of events), we simulate sediment transport through an idealized reach with our numerical 1D model BESMo (Bedload Scenario Model), which was configured using flume experiments with a similar scope. The model performs well in replicating the flume experiments (where sediment was fed constantly, in 1, 2 or 4 pulses) and allowed the exploration of alternative event sequences. We show that in these experiments, the ordering of events is not important in the long term, as the channel quickly recovers even from high magnitude events. In longer equilibrium simulations, we imposed different supply regimes on a channel, which after some time leads to an adjustment of slope, grain size, and sediment transport that is in equilibrium with the respective forcing conditions. We observe two modes of channel adjustment to episodic sediment supply. 1) High-frequency supply regimes lead to equilibrium slopes and armouring ratios that are like conditions in constant feed simulations. In these cases, the period between pulses is shorter than a fluvial evacuation time, which we approximate as the time it takes to export a pulse of sediment under average transport conditions. 2) In low-frequency regimes the pulse period (i.e. recurrence interval) exceeds the fluvial evacuation time, leading to higher armouring ratios due to longer exposure of the bed surface to flow. If the grain size distribution of the bed is fine and armouring weak, the model predicts a lowering in the average channel slope. The ratio between the fluvial evacuation time and the pulse period constitutes a threshold that can help to quantify how a system responds to episodic disturbances.\n                        </jats:p>"

The results revealed that the tourist hotels consider several factors before deciding to source vegetables and fruits from smallholder farmers. The most prominent factors for the tourist hotels to source vegetables and fruits were consistent quality, regular supply, compliance to legal practices, and hygiene conditions. Interestingly, proximity to the tourists’ hotels and competitive price of fruits and vegetables were not among important driving forces contributing to the choice of sourcing points. This suggests that the tourist hotels are willing to pay premium prices so long they are assured of quality and regular supply, comply to legal practices and observe hygiene conditions. With the fact that smallholder farmers lack access to appropriate market information, produce at subsistence level and lack logistic infrastructure this call for a change of mind-set among smallholder farmers and position strategically to take advantage of emerging markets.</jats:p>"

We have analyzed the broad-scale margin physiography and seismic stratigraphic patterns based on high-resolution bathymetric data and previously interpreted seismic data. In addition, we have evaluated regional supply conditions and the uplift-subsidence regime of the different shelf sectors. The upper Quaternary record is strongly dominated by shelf-margin regressive wedges affected by the prevailing 100 ka cyclicity. However, the margins exhibit considerable lateral variability, as the result of the balance between the amount of sediment supply and the uplift-subsidence relationship. Three major shelf sectors with distinct morpho-sedimentary features have been defined. The relatively narrow northern shelves (Roses, La Planassa and Barcelona) are supplied by discrete river outlets that collectively constitute a linear source and are mainly affected by tectonic tilting. The wide middle shelves (Ebro Shelf, the Gulf of Valencia, and the Northern Arc) receive the sediment supply from the large Ebro River and other medium rivers. Although the tectonic regime changes laterally (strong subsidence in the north and uplift in the south), shelf growth is maintained by lateral advection of sediments. The southern shelves (the Southern Arc and the northern Alboran Shelf) are very abrupt and narrow because of the uplifting Betic Cordillera, and the torrential fluvial regimes that determine a very efficient sediment by-pass toward the deep basin. Submarine canyons deeply incised in the continental margin constitute a key physiographic feature that may enhance the transport of sediment to the deep sea or individualize shelf sectors with specific sedimentation patterns, as occurs in the Catalan margin.</jats:p>"

If the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) could sell products directly and collect used products, OEM has to compete with both forward retailer and reverse collector, simultaneously, and OEM possesses different bargaining powers. Specifically, we examine the following models: (1) M1: OEM holds the first position in both forward and reverse channels; (2) M2: OEM holds the first (second) position in the forward (reverse) channel; (3) M3: OEM holds the second position in both channels. We conduct a systematic comparison of forward competition, reverse competition and dual competitions across the above models. From the perspective of the entire supply chain, the outcome of model selection hinges on the extent of competition. If the competition is sufficient, two forward leaders will engage in a price battle which results in great losses for both. Then M1 is preferred. Otherwise, M3 outperforms.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a dynamic coupling coordination model is introduced to study the coordinated development of WRS. The weight of each index is obtained using an improved entropy weight method. The coupling and coordination degrees between resource subsystems and other subsystems and an entire system of water resources can be obtained using this model. Taking Heilongjiang, China, as an example, the results show that in 2005–2014, the WRS exhibited low coupling and low coordination characteristics due to a substantial contradiction between the resource subsystem and the social and economic and ecological subsystems. Therefore, strengthening the overall development of water resources, society, economy and ecology and improving the coupling abilities between resource subsystems and each of the other subsystems are effective strategies for promoting the coordinated development of WRS.</jats:p>",

Present study was designed to analyze factors impeding citrus supply chain in Toba Tek Singh District of the Punjab province. Through multistage sampling technique 120 citrus growers were selected. Data were collected through face to face interview technique with the help of structured, validated, reliable and pre-tested questionnaire. Collected data were analyzed by using Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings unveiled that black marketing of fertilizers, shortage of labor; lack of technical knowledge and shortage of finance were major factors impeding production of citrus crop. Monopoly of middle-man; late payments by the dealers; lack of storage facilities; high storage cost and less price of citrus set by the government were leading barriers of marketing. Study recommended that development of effective marketing system, subsidies on inputs and initiation of direct marketing for small farmers in particular. Study further urges development of affordable machinery for growers to encounter labor shortage problems.</jats:p>"

Policies to overcome such problem are usually by shortening the chain, by which farmers sell the products directly to retailers. Using an action research in AEDEF (Aceh Economic Development Financing Facilities) Program, conducted in the province of Nangro Aceh Darussalam (NAD) Indonesia, the paper shows that shortening the commodity supply chain is not the best solution to such problem, as it causes loss of jobs in the villages. High price disparity between farm-gate and retailer is not necessary brought about by long supply-chain but by the efficiency of the chain instead. Efficiency of the chain can be improved by creating enabling business environment such that every actors and players work in a fair manner. This can be achieved by transparency in price and quality grade. With development achieved in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), having a good and reliable flow of such information is not difficult. In addition to information flow, the availability and quality of infrastructure to support flow of goods from farm-gate to end-user is of reasonably important.</jats:p>",

Wherein, Hubbert theory, Weibull distribution, and intensity of demand are used to estimate silver mining supply, recycling supply, and manufacturing demand, respectively. The results show that silver supply shortage for manufacturing demand will occur from 2030. Technology improvements in the PV industry could delay when the shortage begins, but they will not prevent it, while silver supply shortage for c‐Si PV could be eliminated under the total effects scenario. Reducing dependency on silver as a raw material for c‐Si PV industry through technological progress and recycling retired panels is recommended.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Critical infrastructure such as power and water delivery is growing rapidly in the developing world and there are developed assets that must be maintained in developed nations. One underground component that is difficult to inspect is water supply pipelines. Most of the water line accidents occur in buildings is due to pipeline damage. To minimize accidental loss, a risk assessment method is needed to continuously assess risk and report any abnormality for preventative maintenance. In this work, a blended hierarchical fuzzy logic model for water supply pipeline risk index assessment is proposed. Four important parameters are inputs to the proposed blended hierarchical fuzzy logic model. The blended hierarchical fuzzy logic model dramatically reduces the number of conditions in the rule base. Rule reduction is important because the transparency and interpretation are compromised by an overly large set. Further, it is challenging to accurately design a large number of rules because rule design requires expert knowledge and uncertainty in predictions can lead to unforeseen incidents. A blended hierarchical fuzzy model is designed with a structure that takes fewer rules as compared to conventional fuzzy logic. For the four parameters, the proposed model takes 85 rules and for the same four parameters, the conventional fuzzy logic approach requires 900 rules. In this paper, four parameters are considered because these are available measurements. The proposed reduction method is also applicable for systems with more parameters. The numbers of rules increase exponentially in the conventional fuzzy logic as new parameters enter into the system. The blended hierarchical fuzzy logic is deployed on a water distribution network to compute the risk index of supply pipelines. The results indicate improved performance of the blended hierarchical fuzzy logic. This approach is usable in practical applications where the calculated risk index values of the water supply pipeline are plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) map to provide a graphical interface for the caretaker. The risk index visualization is necessary to trace the risk index location and to take preemptive measures to avoid failures.</jats:p>"

Drawing data from 172 Chinese firms, the model studied the moderating role of firm size on the SSCM practices and the sustainable performance of the firms (economic, environmental, and social), using hierarchical regression analysis on SPSS 22.0. The results suggest that SSCM practices and firm size are positively related to the firm’s environmental and social performance. Firm size moderates the effect of SSCM practices on economic performance. Additionally, SSCM internal practices have a significant positive impact on the economic performance of large enterprises, but not so much on the economic performance of the Small and medium enterprises(SMEs). This paper proposes a comprehensive SSCM practice performance model that identifies firm size as a moderating role. Through research on the moderating effect of firm size, the implementation and recommendation of SSCM for different firm size are given.</jats:p>"

The focal technology is licensed to specialist design firms and designed into products, which are fabricated by dedicated large-scale manufacturers. We examine a technology supplier’s licensing decision in such emerging multiparty networked supply chains in which a downstream design firm’s capability may not be publicly known. We find that the supply chain and firm profits are critically affected by whether or not a license agreement between a technology supplier and a design firm is kept confidential from a manufacturer. Instead of licensing to two downstream firms, a technology supplier may also license to an integrated firm with both design and manufacturing capabilities, which forms a conventional vertical supply chain. We compare a networked supply chain with a vertical supply chain and show that the network model can, under some conditions, outperform the integrated configuration and increase profits for all supply chain entities. In particular, a downstream firm can be better off decentralized, with design and manufacturing functions taken by different firms. Our research helps explain the emergence of such networked supply chains and offers insights on how to structure them to improve outcomes. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0619 . </jats:p>",

As their effects are likely to be context-dependent, evaluating their effects in a wide range of settings is important for establishing the external validity of the non-contributory pension literature. We use a new monthly panel dataset and a difference-in-differences strategy to study the effect of a new non-contributory pension in Singapore (the Silver Support Scheme or SSS) on labour supply, work expectations, private cash transfers, and expenditure, 1 year after its implementation. We find no evidence that receiving SSS payouts led to a fall in labour supply, work expectations, or the receipt of private cash transfers in the first year after SSS implementation—our estimated effects for these outcomes are statistically insignificant and are either negative but close to zero or positive. Our point estimates of the effects of receiving SSS payouts on expenditure are positive but too imprecise to allow us to make any definitive conclusions. Lastly, we do not find evidence of anticipatory effects among younger individuals who are not age-eligible for payouts yet. These results, when coupled with our finding in a companion paper that the SSS improved recipients’ subjective well-being, suggest that the SSS was successful in improving recipients’ welfare without substantial crowding out of private transfers or changes in labour market behaviour of current and future SSS beneficiaries.</jats:p>",

Using the appropriate scale and technology, the US state of Minnesota is poised for increased forest bioenergy production due to the large existing forest products industry. Forest bioenergy investments have been slow to materialize despite state and federal incentives, and this research aims to determine what barriers there are to bioenergy development from the perspective of supply-chain actors by applying theories of natural resource governance. Findings from interviews include the need to create an equitable playing field in terms of energy subsidies and integrate forest bioenergy production with bio-based markets, including traditional forest product markets. Additionally, interviews indicate poor coordination and shared responsibility among state agencies, industry associations, and nonprofit organizations, resulting in a fragmented policy system. Principles to guide enabling forest bioenergy development are identified and discussed in the context of the study findings.</jats:p>"

As a developing country, China has outstanding environmental problems. However, there are not many empirical studies on the influencing factors of sustainable supply chain in domestic enterprises. Therefore, according to the manufacturing industry in China, a hypothesis model of influencing factors of sustainable supply chain management is set up. The sustainable supply chain practice is based on three dimensions: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and social sustainability. The influencing factors of sustainable supply chain include internal management cognition, industry pressure, consumer pressure, and government participation. A structural equation model was used to analyze the questionnaire data of 167 enterprises in Beijing, China. The results show that internal management cognition and government participation has a direct effect on the sustainable supply chain management practice, and internal management cognition has a strong positive influence. Consumer pressure and industry pressure have a small positive impact on internal management cognition, while the effect of government participation on industry pressure is very significant.</jats:p>"

Benefits of standard product identifying technologies and automated validation systems are also explored to minimize workflow interruptions. Different scenarios are compared for patient safety, care delay, and system efficiency. The results show that validation points during PAR picking or bedside product administration, and warehouse picking operations provide optimal overall system performance.

Nutrient profiling, dietary guidelines and the extent of food processing provided comparable assessments of the nutritional quality of Australia’s packaged food supply. Individual measures of nutrient composition did not, but may be of value for identifying specific foods of concern.</jats:p>"

A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of measurement scales. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Results: Four green supply chain management activities, namely green purchasing, reverse logistics, environmental collaboration with suppliers and green manufacturing, exerted a positive influence on operational performance. Environmental collaboration with suppliers exerted the highest influence on operational performance when compared to green purchasing, reverse logistics and green manufacturing. In turn, operational performance exerted a strong positive influence on supply chain performance. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that manufacturing SMEs in developing countries could benefit by adopting green supply chain management activities, with improvements being realised in terms of increases in both operational and supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

However, several studies have demonstrated that the energy available on such sites could be used to generate electrical energy, instead of being dissipated as head loss; therefore, a more efficient and sustainable solution could be applied for pressure control. Due to the low amount of power available, the use of pumps as turbines (PATs) is highly recommended. However, manufacturers do not provide pump curves operating as turbines, making PAT selection challenging. Different empirical methods can be found in the literature for estimating PAT performance based on the pump operating conditions. Thus, this paper presents a comparative analysis of nine different methods, using real data from 14 pumps. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these methods for PAT selection is evaluated in a hypothetical network.</jats:p>",

Increased production from variable renewables however implies higher levels of optimal interconnection capacity than in the past. Rather than using scenario building to determine new optimal levels of interconnection capacity, this paper presents a new methodology for Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) based on empirical market data, using the French-German electricity trade as an example. Employing a very fine dataset of hourly supply and demand curves (aggregated auction curves) from the EPEX Spot market, it constructs net export (NEC) and net import demand curves (NIDC) for both countries. This allows assessing hourly welfare impacts for incremental capacity and, summed over the year, the annual welfare benefits for each discrete increase in interconnection capacity. Confronting benefits with the annualised costs of increasing interconnection capacity determines the socially optimal increase in interconnection capacity between France and Germany on the basis of empirical market micro-data. </jats:p>",

One of the important elements to support the green campus program is the existence of drinking water supply system.Universitas Gadjah Mada Drinking Water Supply System (UGM-DWSS) is a drinking water or potable water supply service to supply drinking water for the campus. This research aims at analyzing UGM-DWSS potential and its performance to support Green Campus. This research was based on primary data collection in UGM campus. Data collection techniques consist of observation of UGM-DWSS facilities, interview with UGM-DWSS water managers and users, and questionnaires distribution to UGM academic community. The daily water production of UGM-DWSS was 10 l/s drinking water. Every day the water discharge distributed from UGM-DWSS to 49 water fountains and 12 water dispensers was1.71 l/s, while the estimated daily water consumption rate was0.07l/s. It is assumed that those who did not consume water from UGM-DWSS facilities bought plastic drinking water bottle. Every day, it is estimated that the number of generated plastic drinking water bottle waste was 19,168 bottles with capacity 600 ml/bottle. Indeed, by comparing to the total water production capacity being produced daily, the idle capacity was 99.3 %.The tendency of negative response from the majority of UGM inhabitants for using UGM –DWSS was due to hesitation about water quality, continuity of water supply, and ease of access to the nearby water fountains and water dispensers. Improvement of UGM-DWSS facilities that are supported by massive socialization programs including innovation to utilize produced drinking water is recommended to optimize the role of UGM-DWSS to create Green Campus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies a global sourcing problem where a buyer sources a product from a supplier to satisfy uncertain market demand. With the increasing length and complexity of today’s global supply chains, the buyer may face two issues when designing the sourcing contract: adverse selection (i.e., the supplier’s cost structure is private information) and noncontractible capacity (i.e., the supplier’s capacity investment is not contractible). We show that noncontractible capacity does not necessarily lead to a lower profit for the buyer, but it may require a more complex contract format to achieve the optimal (second-best) profit. Interestingly, we find that a single, linear contract (or a two-part tariff) could be optimal for the buyer under certain conditions. Even when such a contract is suboptimal, it can deliver close-to-optimal profit for the buyer for a wide range of situations. These findings indicate that the value of using a complex menu of contracts is negligible in such a supply chain setting. A simple two-part tariff is an attractive option for buyers whose goal is to ensure supply while facing both cost uncertainty and contractibility issues. The paper also provides a new explanation for the prevalence of such simple contracts in practice. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0628 . </jats:p>",

We also evaluated the effects of planting density and site on biomass accumulation and carbon stocks in different plantation compartments, on biomass partitioning at the stand-level, on soil carbon stocks and on soil nutrient supply rate after 14 years. The experimental design consisted of three replicate poplar stands located along a site fertility gradient. Each stand contained six planting densities (ranging from 494 to 1975 trees/ha) and a single genotype (Populus canadensis × P. maximowiczii hybrid). Planting density had a large effect on stem dimensions, but a minor effect on stand volume, aboveground woody biomass production, and aboveground biomass carbon stocks. Site selection and tree survival were more important factors affecting these variables. At all sites, and independent of planting density, mean annual volume increments were also higher after 14 vs. 8 years. On fertile sites, strong correlations between area per tree at planting and biomass partitioning, carbon allocation belowground, soil nutrient supply rate and soil carbon stocks were observed. Aboveground, higher competition for light with increasing planting density resulted in an increase in the stem to branch ratio. Belowground, higher competition for soil resources with increasing planting density reduced soil macronutrient availability (except for potassium), which likely stimulated carbon allocation belowground and carbon accumulation in the soil. Over the longer-term, higher density plantations of poplars could provide greater benefits in terms of carbon storage belowground (soil and roots).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> India is taking several steps to decarbonize electricity as part of the climate change mitigation efforts. One of those steps has been to promote electricity generation from biomass. Past research has focused on risks related to technology, cost, financing, policy, and supply chain in case of biomass power, but there have been limited studies on risks arising due to climate change. Climate change can have major implications for the supply chain of biomass power plants by affecting the underground water availability and land productivity and thereby affecting the availability of biomass for power plants. The effect could be more acute for single-fuel biomass power plants rather than for multi-fuel biomass power plants. Using data from an 8 megawatt (MW) biomass power plant and by developing a conceptual model, this article models risks arising due to climate change and assesses their likely impact on single-fuel biomass power plants. Two key insights emerge from the analysis: (a) A supply chain that is not sustainable and resilient to climate change impacts poses a major risk to the profits of a biomass power plant; and (b) Single-fuel biomass power plants may need to change their businesses and sourcing strategies by either turning into multi-fuel biomass power plant or by increasing the catchment area of their sourcing. </jats:p>",

Economic aspects play a key role for the successful implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) measures. Financing mechanisms are of great influence regarding how water and wastewater facilities are designed, built and operated and how these facilities contribute to an efficient long-term management of scarce water resources. Research projects in Southern Africa have shown the need of water management efficiency and the essential role of sustainable water finance for an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable management of these resources.</jats:p>",

Oleaginous trees have potential to provide bioenergy supplies through biodiesel-producing seed yield as well as contributing to carbon sequestration. This paper aims to show the provisions of bioenergy and carbon savings through forest rotation management and it will investigate the potential of oleaginous forest management in China. We use the land expectation value (LEV) model to calculate the optimal joint values of timber, seed and total carbon savings, including carbon sequestration from forest and carbon reductions through energy substitutions. The results indicate that combining both values of seeds and carbon savings increase the LEV and rotation age (167,611 Yuan/ha, 78 years) compared to sole timber value (26,053 Yuan/ha, 55 years). The optimization of the LEVs and the resulting optimal rotation ages are significantly sensitive to the discounting rate. Annual biodiesel potential production from Pistacia chinensis can take up 1.7% of the national diesel consumption in China. We conclude that China can use improved forest rotation management as an effective means for achieving goals in its low-carbon energy strategy.</jats:p>"

The average snow porosity was 72.3% for the entire snowpack, and the changing rate of porosity ranged from 4% to 19% during the accumulation period and from 7% to 25% during the snowmelt period. The porosity of the bottom layer displayed the fastest decline and the largest range. The air temperature, snow temperature and solar radiation showed significant positive correlations with the liquid water content of the snow, and the calculated correlation coefficients were all above 0.9. In addition, relative humidity and temperature were negatively correlated. All meteorological factors studied affected the melting capacity of snow to varying degrees.

Hereby, this work devotes to monitoring treated water parameters and the formation of pipe scales in the whole distribution system in Jianghan oilfield. Our results showed that the cause of water deterioration in the distribution system is due to the increased suspended solids. Coupon tests indicated that the rates of pipe corrosion and scale formation significantly increased, which was in line with our monitoring data. This further demonstrates that the deterioration of injection water leads to significant pipe corrosion and scale formation after the long distance transportation from effluent wastewater treatment plants to injection wells. The chemical composition of the collected pipe scale is consistent with that of suspended solids extracted from water samples. This indicates that the increased suspended solids in water are likely due to the contribution of pipe scale that can be on the walls of pipelines, consequently deteriorating the injection water quality. The findings of the present study show an important significance in understanding the mechanism of injection water deterioration in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

We employed institutional theory to identify different kinds of pressures, and resource dependence theory to explore the impact of internal and external GSCM practices on performance. An empirical study was conducted by collecting data through a structured questionnaire administered in Pakistan to the executives in the manufacturing industry. A total of 207 responses were used for data analysis by employing the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Normative pressures were found to be the most significant in both internal and external GSCM practices, while coercive and mimetic pressures positively affected internal and external GSCM practices, respectively. Internal GSCM practices proved to be more significant in improving environmental performance, and also had a substantial impact on external GSCM practices. In contrast, External GSCM practices had a significant positive effect on economic performance, while environmental performance also contributed to improving economic performance. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed for academics, policymakers, and industry practitioners.</jats:p>"

Respiratory therapy materials are essential to life support, and have a major impact on clinical complications. To provide respiratory therapy materials with appropriate hygiene in a hospital is a challenge for manager due to clinical and costs impact. OBJECTIVE: To compare costs of different methods of providing respiratory therapy materials in a general, extra, tertiary and public hospital. METHODS: It consisted of an observational study, based on document review and critical analysis of hospital management indicators, and analyzed materials used in respiratory therapy, classified as semi-critical products, including manual resuscitator, nebulizer, kit for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), ventilatory circuit for non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Compared to the supply process of disposable materials acquisition, the supply process in the Institutional Central Sterilization Supply Department generates an annual savings with values calculated at US$ 289,679.26; while compared to the Outsourced Central Sterilization Supply Department the supply process in the Institutional Central Sterilization Supply Department saves an amount of US$ 257,041.11 annually. CONCLUSION: This was the first Brazilian study to conduct a cost analysis in this context. The supply process with the cleaning of respiratory physiotherapy materials in the Institutional Central Sterilization Supply Department was more advantageous with lower costs when compared to the Outsourced Central Sterilization Supply Department or cost of acquisition of disposable materials. The annual savings estimated considering the average monthly consumption in this study exceeded US $ 250,000.00. Detailed cost analysis provides crucial information and can enable better financial management.</jats:p>"

Additionally, it was noted that the influence of the different risk factors is different for the different performance indicators of quality, speed, cost, dependability and flexibility.

A recent comprehensive review indicates an increasing interest in incorporating knowledge management in supply chain management, but supplier development has been rarely researched from the perspective of knowledge management. This study incorporates the knowledge chain theory to supplier development and investigates the importance of each knowledge management activity in supplier development. Using the survey data from a sample of active scholars and consultants who are committed to supplier development, this study supports the significant role of knowledge management in supplier development. Specifically, these scholars and consultants suggest that both buying and supplying firms should at least moderately conduct each knowledge management activity in supplier development in order to achieve desired outcomes. We also find that the roles of buying and supplying firms vary across 9 knowledge management activities. In addition, our respondents indicate that the definition of supplier development raised based on the the knowledge chain theory is at least moderately successful in all the evaluation criteria. Based on the quantitative and qualitative evidence from our respondents, this study revises the definition slightly to make it more comprehensive and clear. This study contributes to extant research by confirming the necessity of implementing knowledge management activities in supplier development, validating the heterogeneous roles of knowledge management activities in supplier development, and raising a revised definition of supplier development from the knowledge management perspective.</jats:p>",

This system configuration makes possible the use of a simple and reliable two-level voltage source inverter (VSI) topology for grid connection, owing to the galvanic isolation provided by the HF transformer. This topology provides a viable alternative to the commonly used non-isolated PV supplies equipped with Si-based boost MPPT converters cascaded with relatively more complex inverter topologies, at competitive efficiency figures and a higher power density. A 20 kHz, 25 kVA prototype system was designed based on the dynamic model of the multi-string PV panels obtained from field tests. Design parameters such as input DC link capacitance, switching frequencies of MPPT converter and voltage source inverter, size and performance of HF transformer with nanocrystalline core, DC link voltage, and LCL filter of the VSI were optimized in view of the site dependent parameters such as the variation ranges of solar insolation, module surface temperature, and grid voltage. A modified synchronous reference frame control was implemented in the VSI by applying the grid voltage feedforward to the reference voltages in abc axes directly, so that zero-sequence components of grid voltages are taken into account in the case of an unbalanced grid. The system was implemented and the proposed design methodology verified satisfactorily in the field on a roof-mounted 23.7 kW multi-string PV system.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) and their preferences to improve WSS in China, to support governments in water regulation policy design and water providers in investment-decisions. A discrete choice experiment method with the consideration of not only attributes of WSS but also attitudinal and demographic variables have been adopted to assess consumers’ WTP and preferences for WSS improvement. The results show that Chinese urban residents are willing to pay a significantly higher price for improved WSS. Demonstrated marginal mean WTP for the change of the attributes range from 0.18 RMB/m3 (0.03 USD/m3) (1 RMB was around 0.154 USD in 2016) for decreased water supply interruption to 2.33 Yuan RMB/m3 (0.35 USD/m3) for improved drinking water quality. Investments in water processing facilities and water distribution networks should come first. Cross-subsidy concerning different developing districts is the most efficient policy instrument. The study contributes to the recent literature not only by introducing attitudinal variables in choice experiment survey in water supply field, but also by revealing the correlation of choice modeling applications in WSS improvement programs.</jats:p>"

Based on household data from the China Family Panel Studies of 2012, the present paper quantifies the potential distortions in China's agricultural production and examines their underlying determinants across regions. The results reveal that there are different levels of distortions across regions. The Middle region is facing the greatest distortion. Increases in machinery input, the proportion of non‐farm income and effective labor input will reduce distortions. Household saving, farmland rent and farmland size are significantly positively related to distortions. There is a complementary effect between labor and farmland in alleviating production inefficiency, but substitution effects exist between capital and farmland and also capital and labor. The increase in farmland size will aggravate the impact of capital on distortions. Given the constraint of super small‐scale farmland, facilitating land transfer is a necessary precondition for improving allocative efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous literature suggests that without regulations firms have incentives to collude by fixing price or reducing quantity. This paper sets up an infinitely repeated game to examine the interplay between the manufacturer’s channel strategy and the downstream retailers’ collusive behavior. The results show that the manufacturer can deter retailer collusion by strategically changing its channel strategy. This effect occurs when the discount rate (used to calculate the present value of future profits) is relatively large and the manufacturer’s direct selling efficiency is relatively high (i.e., the variable cost of direct selling is relatively low). With the deterrence of direct selling, retailers abandon collusion and “no collusion” is a win-win strategy for both levels in the supply chain. However, when the manufacturer is not efficient in direct selling or the discount rate is small, direct selling is not effective in deterring retailer collusion and the manufacturer is worse off. These findings provide insights into channel strategies and supply chain management. </jats:p>",

They provide fresh water to communities of users by draining groundwater from aquifers. In Iran, authorities are reporting about 37,000 active qanats contributing about 11% of the country's total groundwater supply. Yazd Province, located in the central part of Iran's plateau, is among the driest regions of the country with more than one million people. It counts 3,193 known qanats with an annual discharge estimated today at about 350 million m3. Ghassem Abad qanat irrigates the agricultural lands of Ghassem Abad village in the Province of Yazd. Its water is managed by an administration headed by a mirab. This paper describes the qanat's mechanism and provides an overview about qanats in Iran. It also promotes, through the study of Ghassem Abad qanat, the related water management system as an example of eco-friendly traditional knowledge leading to social equity and sustainability. It explains how water is distributed to stakeholders (through water shares and irrigation cycles). Nevertheless, and for its survival, the qanat of Ghassem Abad has to continuously deal with social and economic challenges. The farmlands are continuously menaced by urban expansion.</jats:p>",

Similarly, the paper aims to recognize and understand, from a value-creation perspective, the correlation between DD and BD generation and between DD and SCM.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The approach utilized in the present study consists of two steps: first, a systematic literature review was conducted aiming at finding out to determine the existing relationship between “Big Data Analytics” (BDA), “SCM” and the “DD”. A total of 595 articles were considered, and analysis showed a clear relationship among BDA, SCM, and DD. Next, the Vector autoregressive (VAR) approach was applied in a case study to prove the correlation between DD (as part of internet usage) and internet acquisitions, and in general terms the relationship between DD and Trade. Internet usage and internet acquisition in imports and exports at the European level were considered as variables in an empirical study of European trade. The novelty of this two-tiered approach consists in its application of a systematic literature review, the first of its kind, to generate inputs for the longitudinal case study of imports and exports at the EU level. In turn, the case study tested the accuracy of the theorized relationship among the main variables.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>By analyzing the connection between DD and internet acquisitions, a positive and long-lasting impulse response function was revealed, followed by an ascending trend. This suggests that a self-multiplying effect is being generated, and it is reasonable to assume that the more individuals use the internet, the more electronic acquisitions occur. We can thus reasonably conclude that the improvement of the BD and SCM process is strongly dependent on the quality of the human factor. Tackling DA is the new reading key in the decision-making process: quantifying the added value of the human factor in SCM is challenging and is an ongoing process, based on the opportunity cost between automation in decision-making or relying on the complexity of human factors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>One of the biggest limits in our research is the lack of the time series available on consumer orientations and preferences. Data on the typology of customer preferences, and how they are shaped, modified, or altered, were non-accessible, though big companies may have access to this data. The present longitudinal study on European trade helps clarify how and to what extent BDA, SCM, and DD are inter-related. The modeling of the theoretical framework likewise highlights several identifiable benefits for companies of adopting BDA in their business processes.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding the obstacles to DD in trade companies and states, and identifying their influence on firm performance, serves to orient the decision-making process in SCM toward reducing DD to generate important economic benefits. Enhancing internet usage may accelerate longer-term investments in human resources, offering developing countries unprecedented opportunities to enhance their educational systems and to improve their economic policies, widening the range of opportunities for businesses and poor states.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>BD generation will undeniably influence microeconomic decisions: they will become evaluation tools of more efficient economic progress in small and/or large economies. However, an economically efficient society will be achievable only in those countries in which qualified human resources can generate and manage BD, to unlock its potential. This twofold effect will surely affect the socio-economic and geopolitical situation. The economic progress of conventional countries may vacillate if it is not adequately flanked by qualified human resources able to progress the information and communication technology (ICT) prevalent in contemporary economies. Consequently, the social impact of investments in ICT capacity building will necessarily affect future socio-economic scenarios. New indicators will become necessary to measure the conventional progress, and one of them will surely be DD.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The novelty of the present study is twofold: first, it is the first meticulous meta-analysis developed using a very wide analysis of the published literature to highlight a previously hidden relationship among DD, BD, and SCM. This comparative approach made it possible to build a theoretical framework for the real evaluation of the impact of BDA on different organizational elements, including SCM. Second, the research emphasizes the need to reform and reshape the studies on BDA, convincing companies that it is necessary to understand that the obstacles (DD and DA, i.e. internet usage) must be addressed with conscious decision-making processes, strategically and resolutely, to transform points of weakness into opportunities.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

When it exceeds a certain threshold limit, the response time for the control request increases nonlinearly due to the over CPU utilization and congestion. When the controller gets overloaded, typically the OpenFlow‐enabled Devices (OFDevices) are migrated from the current controller to another under loaded controller domain. This migration might cause large degradation of end users' QoS metrics. To resolve this issue, we introduce basic demand and supply curve based DSSDN, a new load balancing method that utilizes the load factors of Software Defined Wide Area Networks controllers. This method selects the OFDevice which causes maximum load on the controller and traversing minimum users traffic through it. The Karush‐Kuhn‐Tucker conditions are employed during the optimal controller selection by the OFDevices to improve the response time effectively. During implementation, virtual threads running on the controller representing the OFDevices are used to take the optimal decision instead of actual OFDevices. The experimental results show that during migration, the DSSDN stabilizes the load hikes, improves QoS, and increase the end users' utility without much disruptions in the network state.</jats:p>",

Shahid Rajaee dam with a large reservoir is located in Mazandaran Province, Iran. Shahid Rajaee reservoir falls in the warm monomictic stratified category. Available data from the period 2012 to 2015 have been used for modeling temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in this reservoir using CE-QUAL-W2. Temperature–depth diagrams have been drawn and thermocline characteristics have been determined from the first-year data. Moreover, two operation scenarios have been defined. The effect of 20% reduction of the TDS loads in both upstream rivers or the major river on the TDS concentration of the reservoir at a specific point has been evaluated. The model's results show 20% and 14.2% reduction in the maximum values of the TDS time series, respectively and 19.4% and 13.4% reduction in the minimum values of the TDS time series, respectively. Moreover, the Iran Water Quality Index for Surface Water Resources – Conventional Parameters (IRWQISC Index) Index has been used for determining the reservoir's water quality. The index showed a ‘good’ water quality for the reservoir before and after the salinity reduction scenario.</jats:p>",

Seven molecules were quantified in raw waters with a maximum concentration of 91 ng/L reached for desethyl-atrazine. No metabolites generated through advanced degradation pathways were quantified. Concentration profiles for five DWTP treating ground or surface waters were very similar and remained stable over time. Only one DWTP treating groundwater presented differences between sampling periods due to variations in wells' operations. As expected, most treatment units (settling, ozonation, nitrification, sand filtration, chlorination) did not allow for efficient removal of these micropollutants. Adsorption on granular or powdered activated carbon (PAC) was highlighted as the best available technology for the majority of quantified compounds. Combined PAC and ultrafiltration treatment was especially adapted for the removal of hydroxy-atrazine, one of the most refractory components evaluated during this study. Indeed, among quantified pesticides, only hydroxy-atrazine and desethyl-deisopropyl-atrazine were measured in treated water, with concentrations below 12 ng/L.</jats:p>",

This paper develops a mixed-integer CLSC model that is inspired by the automotive industry. In this model, we consider three Decision Makers (DM): Plant, Dismantler Center and Customer. Each DM has individual objectives and is responsible for only its own objective function under same constraints. In order to tackle the trade-offs among the objectives, we used four different Interac-tive Fuzzy Programming (IFP) approaches.

Yet, there may be risks inherent within a firm's portfolios of supply chain relationships that are manifested in the credit risk of a firm. Moreover, portfolio characteristics may serve as a signal to the external market regarding these risks. While customer and supplier portfolio characteristics may impact the firm's exposure to risks, the specific issue of how portfolio characteristics relate to credit risk has rarely been examined by supply chain scholars. This research bridges extant works in supply chain management and finance to relate supply chain characteristics to a critical reputational outcome, namely credit ratings. In this research, we utilize a sample of firms that recently underwent an initial public offering to empirically examine the theoretical predictions of Resource Dependence Theory regarding the relationships between different supply chain portfolio characteristics and credit risk.</jats:p>",

The following stages were evaluated: (i) cultivation, (ii) the extraction of oil, and (iii) the biodiesel manufacturing process. The results showed that the overall process has an accumulated energy demand of 37.9 MJ/kg biodiesel, and generates 2.16 kg CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg of biofuel. The cultivation stage had the greatest contribution towards its energy and carbon footprints, taking up 45% and 60%, respectively.

The CAP Health Check of 2008 and the 2013 CAP Reform confirmed this change, adopting measures including the further decoupling of production, the abolishment of set-aside and the phasing-out of milk quotas. It is therefore expected that price transmission has been affected radically. This study investigates the price transmission mechanism along the European food supply chain, based on an asymmetric panel vector error correction model (VECM). Panel data on agricultural commodity (farmer), producer (processor) and consumer (retailer) prices from nineteen European countries are considered. The sample is split into two sub-periods, before and after the CAP Health Check, to examine how the price transmission mechanism has been affected. Cointegration is confirmed among the price series through the Pedroni tests and the long-run relationship is obtained with two estimation methods (i. e. fully modified OLS and dynamic OLS). Prior to the CAP Health Check, positive asymmetry is detected from farmer to processor and from processor to retailer. However, after the CAP Health Check price transmission becomes symmetric, thus suggesting that decreased support has resulted in a more efficient price transmission mechanism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Operational collaboration in a supply chain is important due to the fierce competition among supply chains. However, the collaboration in a supply chain is often hindered by its distribution channel’s lack of funds. It is of significance to alleviate the capital constraint problem of the distribution channel and explore new joint operational and financial collaboration solutions. In this paper, we focus on exploring the optimal solution of operational collaboration in the presence of manufacturer collateral. We consider a supply chain consisting of a well-capitalized manufacturer and a capital-constrained retailer that faces difficulties obtaining credit from the bank. To help the retailer access financing for a purchase order, the manufacturer promises to pay the lender a proportion of the retailer’s loan if the retailer goes bankrupt. We find that when the bank credit with manufacturer collateral is considered as a mix of trade credit and bank credit, the retailer’s financing equilibrium depending on the maximum wholesale price what the manufacturer can set, can be neither trade credit nor bank credit alone, but a combination of them. Moreover, the retailer’s order quantity and the chain’s operational collaboration level will benefit from the manufacturer collateral. </jats:p>",

The stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) were applied to explore the interactions between the TGR mainstream and the tributary, Zhuyi River. A heat budget of the TGR tributary bay was constructed for the year 2014 using data for water temperature, meteorological data and water mixing ratio. The results showed that approximately 91% of the water in the tributary bay was from the TGR mainstream. And the heat budget reveals that the tributary bay net heat flux is dominated by the mainstream advective heat, and the average contribution rate is 87% during the whole year, while the tributary advective heat and atmosphere make a minor contribution to the tributary bay heat budget.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers sell their low-carbon products through e-commerce platforms. Thus, the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform form a low-carbon e-supply chain system. The manufacturer makes products with carbon emission reduction efforts, while the e-commerce platform provides a sales service. In this paper, we described models for a decentralized decision mode and a centralized decision mode in the low-carbon e-supply chain, and compare the decision results. Our findings show that the centralized decision mode has a better performance than the decentralized one, the ability of the e-supply chain to respond to consumers’ preference for a low-carbon product has a direct effect on its operation, and the manufacturer’s carbon emission reduction behavior will be a potential source for enterprises to gain more revenue. Further, we designed a coordination contract for them that can be accepted by both sides in the decentralized decision mode. We find that if the e-commerce platform can share the carbon emission reduction costs of the manufacturer, the performance of the e-supply chain will be greatly improved. A practical case study and numerical examples validate our analysis.</jats:p>"

By using exploratory factor analysis and linear multiple regression, the findings show that except green purchasing rest of the two variables (green transportation and green distribution) have been found positive and significant to estimate organizational performance. Therefore, the managers and directors of the FMCG firms should adopt green practices in their distribution and transportation operations to enhance overall organizational performance. The key contribution of this study from theoretical side is that it is possible to sign a negative impact of green purchasing on organizational performance in the context of Pakistani FMCG industry. </jats:p>",

Quinolone-type antibiotics are such contaminants, and their concentrations in the intertidal sediments are important indicators for the whole spectrum of antibiotics used in the estuary and adjacent areas. The impacts of sediment types and environmental factors on the distribution of 16 quinolones were probed based on nine Bohai and 42 Yellow Sea intertidal sediment samples. The samples were collected from locations along the coastal areas in China. Quinolones were detected in all samples, while moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were detected at a frequency &amp;gt;50%. Sediment types, pH, organic carbon content, K, Na and Fe concentrations had little correlation with quinolone distributions in intertidal sediments. However, combined concentrations of Ca + Mg (46.7 g/kg in Bohai and 13.7 g/kg in Yellow Sea samples) appeared to correlate with oxolinic acid detecting frequencies (88.9% and 4.8%, respectively) and concentrations (2.0–10.1 μg/g and up to 3.09 μg/g, respectively). Different detection frequencies of the quinolones could be attributed to the formation of cation bridges between oxolinic acid and Ca + Mg, which results in dominant sorption of oxolinic acid at different locations and sediment matrices.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, based on game theory, the optimal strategies of SSC are obtained. Mathematical reasoning and numerical simulations show that, firstly, quality preference has impact on optimal strategy and members’ utilities under different constraints. Secondly, utility of supply chain with integrator as a leader is greater than the case with suppliers as the leader.</jats:p>",

To do this, we conducted case studies within companies in the real estate services sector in France. We have employed the theoretical framework of complexity. This theoretical framework allows us to situate the factors of uncertainty in the internal and external environment. Identification of these factors promotes proactivity when confronted with environmental evolution. It is clear from our study that the balanced scorecard, in the management of supply chain uncertainty, is a communication tool that helps coordinate intraorganizational and interorganizational relations. It is also a tool that leads to a strategic supply chain, a source of competitive advantage for the stakeholders of the chain. Finally, it is a tool for organizational learning because it participates in the construction of knowledge and allows for knowledge capitalization. This know‐how and knowledge contribute to reducing uncertainty.</jats:p>",

Despite these advantages, the implementation of cold chains also calls for massive investment. Considering both costs and benefits of cold chains, our research established an optimization model for a fresh food supply chain to maximize its members' profits. Optimal investment levels of cold chain construction and advertisement, along with optimal pricing, were determined. The analysis shows that collaborative cold chain investment and collaborative pricing are superior strategies for the supply chain. Furthermore, we discuss the role of consumer food safety awareness and observe relatively high levels of cold chain investments and the mutually reinforcing effect of supply chain members' cold chain investments in a food safety sensitive market. Therefore, we suggest that governments should encourage improved food safety awareness among consumers to motivate cold chain investment and thus guarantee food safety.</jats:p>",

What are the requirements on the transport network pervading a tissue to provide a uniform supply of nutrients, minerals or hormones? To theoretically answer this question, we present an analytical scaling argument and numerical simulations on how flow dynamics and network architecture control active spread and uniform supply of metabolites by studying the example of xylem vessels in plants. We identify the fluid inflow rate as the key factor for uniform supply. While at low inflow rates metabolites are already exhausted close to flow inlets, too high inflow flushes metabolites through the network and deprives tissue close to inlets of supply. In between these two regimes, there exists an optimal inflow rate that yields a uniform supply of metabolites. We determine this optimal inflow analytically in quantitative agreement with numerical results. Optimizing network architecture by reducing the supply variance over all network tubes, we identify patterns of tube dilation or contraction that compensate sub-optimal supply for the case of too low or too high inflow rate.</jats:p>",

Statistical criteria for validation, significance, accuracy and adequacy confirmed the suitability of the quadratic polynomial model employed. Response plots and regression equations suggested that the permeate flux response improved with increased feed temperature, reduced permeate temperature and enhanced feed flow rate. Optimizing DCMD process showed that maximum permeate flux of 60.76 L/m2·h could be achieved at the following optimum operational conditions: feed temperature and flow rate of 70 °C and 2 L/min, respectively, as well as the permeate temperature of 15 °C. At this point, the mean annual energy required for 90% water recovery (36 m3/h off the RO brackish rejected stream) at EORC refinery was found to be 96 GJ, which could be supplied using solar or conventional energy systems at Isfahan, facing a very critical water shortage at present.</jats:p>",

While the IT investment for VMI implementation can be significant, the benefits of VMI to different supply chain members are not obvious based on anecdotal evidences and empirical studies. This paper studies the effects of VMI on a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to shed light on when an IT investment for VMI adoption can be justified. We show that whether the two supply chain members benefit from VMI depends on how the holding or shortage cost increment from the manufacturer to retailer compares with two corresponding critical values. We then develop comparative statics results on how these critical values change with respect to different parameters. Interestingly, the retailer is more likely to benefit from the adoption of VMI when its inventory holding cost is low, and the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from VMI adoption when its inventory holding cost is high, contradicting what our intuitions would suggest and what has been prescribed in the literature. </jats:p>",

Recently, a new low‐cost railway power conditioner has been proposed to solve the power quality problems in traction substations based on a half bridge converter. In this paper, an adaptive hysteresis current controller is presented to limit switching frequency variations in the half bridge converter‐based railway power compensators (HB‐RPC). Adaptive hysteresis current controller instantaneously calculates the hysteresis bandwidth which results in smoother and more constant switching frequency. In order to maintain the normal operation of HB‐RPC, compensation reference currents are extracted by considering DC‐link stabilization energy, DC‐link capacitors voltage balance, and instantaneous power theory. Also, a dynamic reference design approach has been used to regulate the DC‐link capacitor voltage. Finally, the simulation results in MATLAB\\Simulink software have effectively verified the proposed control method.</jats:p>",

Deviations of phytoplankton stoichiometry from Redfield proportions (106C : 1P) could therefore have a significant impact on carbon cycling, and understanding which environmental factors drive these deviations may reveal new mechanisms regulating the carbon cycle. To explore the links between environmental conditions, stoichiometry, and carbon cycling, we compared four different models of phytoplankton C : P: a fixed Redfield model, a model with C : P given as a function of surface phosphorus concentration (P), a model with C   P given as a function of temperature, and a new multi-environmental model that predicts C : P as a function of light, temperature, and P. These stoichiometric models were embedded into a five-box ocean circulation model, which resolves the three major ocean biomes (high-latitude, subtropical gyres, and tropical upwelling regions). Contrary to the expectation of a monotonic relationship between surface nutrient drawdown and carbon export, we found that lateral nutrient transport from lower C : P tropical waters to high C : P subtropical waters could cause carbon export to decrease with increased tropical nutrient utilization. It has been hypothesized that a positive feedback between temperature and pCO2, atm will play an important role in anthropogenic climate change, with changes in the biological pump playing at most a secondary role. Here we show that environmentally driven shifts in stoichiometry make the biological pump more influential, and may reverse the expected positive relationship between temperature and pCO2, atm. In the temperature-only model, changes in tropical temperature have more impact on the Δ pCO2, atm (∼ 41 ppm) compared to subtropical temperature changes (∼ 4.5 ppm). Our multi-environmental model predicted a decline in pCO2, atm of ∼ 46 ppm when temperature spanned a change of 10 °C. Thus, we find that variation in marine phytoplankton stoichiometry and its environmental controlling factors can lead to nonlinear controls on pCO2, atm, suggesting the need for further studies of ocean C : P and the impact on ocean carbon cycling.\n                    </jats:p>"

The Government has also issued a policy in the field of defense industry, which among others regulates matters related to the procurement of the TNI’s main weapon systems. This research is intended to examine the impacts of the policy on the operations and supply chain strategies of PT PAL and PT DRU in producing warships. By using descriptive qualitative analysis method, the Researcher analyzed empirical data obtained in the field research supported by several theories, namely theory of strategy, theory of operations and supply chain strategy, theory of public policy, and theory of self-sufficient. From the analysis, there are several findings. The policies have given a certain level of positive impacts on the industries, such as: the improvement of cooperations among them, the improvement of manufacturing process due to the product’s standardization, the improvement of self-reliance level of the industries, and the capability improvement of the companies due to cooperation with foreign parties. However, the policies still give negative impacts to the companies, such as: the low level application of the supply chain management, low level use of the domestic materials and ship’s components, and the low level of fair competition among domestic defense industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: operation strategy, supply chain, warship, PT PAL, PT DRU, Navy, Government of Indonesia, defense industry policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, there has been a tendency in the industry to use electrochemical processing methods based on the use of milli- and microsecond pulses of different polarity and amplitude instead of a direct current. The use of a pulsed current in many cases makes it possible to obtain the desired effect by cheaper means and to provide additional controllability of the electrochemical process by adjusting the time parameters of the current pulses. This also ensures reduction of the energy costs of the polishing and cleaning process of surfaces as compared to direct current processing and increasing the efficiency of processing when the rate of smoothing the surface microroughness referred to the total removal of the metal rises significantly. For example, the application of bipolar pulses in polishing of many metallic materials eliminates the use of expensive and hazardous chromium electrolytes. The use of pulse mode during electrolyte-plasma polishing makes it possible to achieve the reduction of energy consumption and to increase of process efficiency while maintaining high intensity, processing quality and environmental safety. In order to study the effect of pulses parameters and the duration of a pause between them on the characteristics of the surface of parts made of various metallic materials in electrochemical and electrolyte-plasma processing modes the special power supply was modeled, designed and manufactured. The power supply provides the possibility of regulation frequency, the duration of the positive and negative pulses and the duration of the pauses between them a wide range. It makes it possible to generate current pulses up to 50 A at a voltage of 0 to 400 V of positive and negative polarities and is able to regulate their duration in the range from 10.0 μs to 8.1 s with the possibility of changing the ratio of the pulse duration and pauses from 1:1 to 1:9.<jats:bold /></jats:p>"

This study aims to identify the major author collaborative networks and thematic trends of this field by conducting a bibliometric review based on 371 peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2017 using CiteSpace. The results show that this field is an emergent and fast-growing field which has been recognized by multiple disciplines. In terms of authors, the top ten influential authors represented by Sarkis, J., Zhu, Q.H., Vachon, S., and Klassen, R.D. were identified. Further, the four largest collaborative networks with varying research topics such as green supplier selection/evaluation and sustainable sub-supplier management were found. As for the research themes, the six largest research themes were abstracted: green supplier assessment, sustainable supplier/supply chain management, green supplier management, green supplier selection, environmental purchasing, and green supply chain management (GSCM). Further, the research thread over time was summarized as four stages: infancy stage, grow-up stage, surging stage, and deep-going stage. Finally, future research directions were given. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review of this field using bibliometric analysis, comprehensively acknowledging the current research status of this field and that of the future.</jats:p>"

The target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling network plays a key role in the coordination of growth and cell proliferation with the nutrient environment and, importantly, nutrient limitation reduces TOR complex 1 (TORC1) signalling. We have performed global quantitative fitness profiling of the collection of<jats:italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</jats:italic>strains from which non-essential genes have been deleted. We identified genes that regulate fitness when cells are grown in a nutrient-rich environment compared with minimal environments, with varying nitrogen sources including ammonium, glutamate and proline. In addition, we have performed the first global screen for genes that regulate fitness when both TORC1 and TORC2 signalling is reduced by Torin1. Analysis of genes whose deletions altered fitness when nutrients were limited, or when TOR signalling was compromised, identified a large number of genes that regulate transmembrane transport, transcription and chromatin organization/regulation and vesicle-mediated transport. The ability to tolerate reduced TOR signalling placed demands upon a large number of biological processes including autophagy, mRNA metabolic processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Importantly, novel biological processes and all processes known to be regulated by TOR were identified in our screens. In addition, deletion of 62 genes conserved in humans gave rise to strong sensitivity or resistance to Torin1, and 29 of these 62 genes have novel links to TOR signalling. The identification of chromatin and transcriptional regulation, nutritional uptake and transport pathways in this powerful genetic model now paves the way for a molecular understanding of how cells adapt to the chronic and acute fluctuations in nutrient supply that all eukaryotes experience at some stage, and which is a key feature of cancer cells within solid tumours.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Calibration is a critical aspect of model development that has long been recognized by researchers as a challenging issue. In particular, difficulties arise when the observed data used for calibration do not match the model output, which is the case in the majority of transport planning models. In the traditional calibration process, the origin–destination (OD) matrices are the key interface between demand and supply models, which could lead to issues when observed traffic link counts are used to update the OD matrix, causing a loss of key demand characteristics in the process. Developing a unified structure for modeling both demand and supply requires a calibration process that meets the requirements of both types of models, a serious issue which has received less attention in the literature. In this paper, the existing processes of developing and integrating demand and supply models are discussed and then examined using a case study in the Melbourne area. The numerical results show that the standard OD calibration procedure causes unrealistic changes in the OD matrix. Finally, some possible solutions to address the current limitations in development of a unified structure are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The combination of insufficient funds and limited information regarding the demand in regions of desperate need presents a great challenge to many humanitarian organizations. This study examines how a humanitarian organization can minimize the expected shortage in delivering relief aid to regions of need, either though surface or air transportation, in the presence of demand uncertainty with a budget constraint. The study makes four contributions. First, we show that when there is reserved supply for air transportation, it is optimal to provide a higher service level through surface shipment to regions with greater demand uncertainty. Second, we show that the demand variation plays a significant role in the allocation of funds between surface and air shipments. The reaction of the humanitarian organization to higher degrees of demand uncertainty can be determined by the optimal level of inventory purchased for surface shipment. If the optimal inventory for surface shipment is less than the mean demand, then we show that increasing degrees of demand uncertainty leads to increasing reliance on the air shipment option with greater levels of inventory reserved for air transportation and decreasing levels of inventory reserved for surface shipment. Third, when there are opportunities to invest in better forecasting, we find that a humanitarian organization should focus its resources on improving the demand forecast in one region as opposed to evenly allocating resources to all regions. Fourth, we show that the expected amount of shortages reduces with a higher number of regions to serve due to a risk‐pooling effect. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Minnesota, technological and economic shifts in the grain supply chain have altered the way grain producers and sellers navigate their local freight network. In particular, many producers have been increasing their personal trucking capacity and taking longer trips to intermodal and domestic market options. This logistical reshaping of local grain supply chains pressure transportation officials to reconsider the consequences for road infrastructure and congested freight corridors. Studies are discussing the potential of disaggregated commodity flow survey (CFS) data as a critical tool in understanding small-scale freight movement and informing infrastructural investment decisions. Utilizing ArcGIS’s Network Analyst and Hot spot tools to analyze inter-county grain trucking, our study effectively differentiates highly active freight corridors. The model is used to further inform an ongoing infrastructure development project in the Twin Cities metro area by contextualizing road usage within the economic framework of the grain supply chain. However, this study finds CFS data alone fails to account for shifting supply chain conditions, and their consequent impact on the road network. Employing United States Department of Agriculture crop production and cropland data, this study additionally builds an original, computational model that simulates corn producer shipment reaction to market price competition within two key grain-producing counties. Results visualize how producers, during spot months, may be incentivized to haul longer distances to more competitive markets—especially emerging biofuel industries. This lesson proves crucial for state and local transportation officials who wish to identify freight infrastructure development opportunities that invigorate and accommodate growth in Minnesota’s expanding agricultural industry cluster. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Indian thermal power industries, being perceived as the most polluting, are experiencing tremendous pressure to implement sustainable supply chain practices. In this light, the purpose of this article is to explore the factors that initiate sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) adoption in Indian thermal power industries and understand the interrelationship existing among them. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique is employed to extract the structural relationship existing among the SSCM enablers and portray the same through a hierarchical model. Further, MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement) analysis has been employed to classify the enablers by taking their driving and dependence power as a measure. Eleven SSCM enablers have been explored through an extensive review of the literature. The interpretive structural model of selected enablers indicates that SSCM adoption in thermal power plants is mainly due to “pressure from environmental advocacy groups” and “government policies and employee pressure”. Prior knowledge of these influential factors and their interdependence will help the decision makers to develop suitable strategies that would enable the organizations to reduce the impact of barriers while optimizing the benefits derived from the enablers. </jats:p>",

High-resolution source zone characterization shows the evolution of deep penetration to the back-diffusion conditions seen at the present day. Metolachlor, a common herbicide, was released into the overburden overlying a fractured dolostone aquifer within a short time window (1978–81). In 2000, the plume front arrived at a municipal supply well located 930 m down-gradient, increasing to a maximum concentration of 2 μg l\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            . Groundwater monitoring with high-resolution, depth-discrete multi-level sampling systems since 1992 shows a clearly delineated bedrock plume. Numerous rock core samples show metolachlor in the low-permeability rock matrix at the bottom of the aquifer. The mass distribution and bedrock hydraulic head pattern strongly suggest that metolachlor entered the bedrock as a free-phase dense non-aqueous phase liquid penetrating to the aquifer bottom, preferentially accumulating in some horizontal fractures, dissolving quickly as a result of the rapid groundwater flow and then diffusing into the rock matrix, where back-diffusion sustains a dilute, persistent and stable plume. Strong plume retardation by matrix diffusion and sorption has greatly mitigated the impact on water quality in the down-gradient supply well, allowing for its continued use, while back-diffusion and degradation maintain a persistent, dilute plume managed by appropriate monitoring.\n          </jats:p>",

A discrete choice structural labour supply model is estimated, where specialists choose from a set of job packages that are characterized by the number of working hours in the public and private sectors. The results show that medical specialists respond to changes in earnings by reallocating working hours to the sector with relatively increased earnings, while leaving total working hours unchanged. The magnitudes of the own‐sector and cross‐sector hours elasticities fall in the range of 0.16–0.51. The labour supply response varies by gender, doctor’s age and medical specialty. Family circumstances such as the presence of young dependent children reduce the hours worked by female specialists but not male specialists.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Public, privé ou les deux?

Un modèle structurel de choix discret d’offre de travail est calibré ans lequel les spécialistes choisissent entre des arrangements caractérisés par le nombre d’heures de travail dans le secteur public et le secteur privé. Les résultats montrent que les spécialistes répondent aux changements dans la nature des gains en réaménageant leurs heures de travail vers le secteur qui offre des gains relativement plus élevés, tout en gardant leurs heures totales de travail inchangées. Les magnitudes des élasticités de l’offre des heures à l’intérieur d’un secteur et entre secteurs se situent dans un intervalle entre 0.16‐0.51. La réponse de l’offre de travail varie selon le genre, l’âge et la spécialité.

It is by far the most studied and reliable alkane generating pathway. Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (i.e., ADO, key enzyme in this pathway) obtained from different cyanobacteria species showed diverse catalytic abilities. This work indicated that single aldehyde reductase deletions were beneficial to Nostoc punctiforme ADO-depended alkane production in Escherichia coli even better than double deletions. Fatty acid metabolism regulator (FadR) overexpression and low temperature increased C18:1 fatty acid supply, and in turn stimulated C18:1-derived heptadecene production, suggesting that supplying ADO with preferred substrate was important to overall alkane yield improvement. Using combinational methods, 1 g/L alkane was obtained in fed-batch fermentation with heptadecene accounting for nearly 84% of total alkane.</jats:p>",

This paper formulates the calibration of the large‐scale DTA model as a bi‐level optimisation problem with a non‐closed objective function such that it can only be evaluated through simulation. The Kriging surrogate model is adopted to construct the response surface between the objective value and the decision variables. The SBO approach first evaluates a number of initial samples, then fits the response surface and searches for the optima via an infill process. It reduces the number of large‐scale DTA runs for evaluating the objective values and saves much computational time. For demonstrative purposes, a real‐world large‐scale DTA model in the state of MD is calibrated with the proposed SBO approach. After 400 initial points and 100 infill points, the SBO approach reduces the calibration matching gap from 29.68 to 21.90%. It is also presented that the proposed SBO is significantly faster than the genetic algorithm in searching for better solutions. The results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of SBO in DTA calibration problems.</jats:p>",

The investigation of a large outbreak of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> O157 PT34 infection in the United Kingdom in 2016 indicated that catering venues associated with multiple cases had used salad leaves sourced from one supplier. Our aim was to investigate whether catering venues linked to cases were more likely to have used salad leaves from this supplier. We conducted a matched case–control study, with catering venues as the units of analysis. We compared venues linked to cases to those without known linked cases. We included 43 study pairs and obtained information on salad leaf products received by each venue. The odds of a case venue being supplied with salad leaves by Supplier A were 7.67 times (95% confidence interval: 2.30–25.53) those of control venues. This association provided statistical evidence to support the findings of the other epidemiological investigations undertaken for this outbreak. This is a novel approach which is labour-intensive but which addresses the challenge of investigating exposures to food across a complex distribution network.</jats:p>",

The region is characterized by high orographic monsoon precipitation resulting in dense vegetation cover. Feedback of such a dense vegetation on the southwest monsoon rainfall is not yet explored. Here we perform regional climate simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model and find that evapotranspiration from the vegetation of Western Ghats contributes 25–40% of the southwest monsoon rainfall over the water‐deficit state of Tamil Nadu. This contribution reaches 50% during deficit monsoon years or dry spells within a season. Our findings suggest that recent deforestation in this area will affect not only the biodiversity of the region but also the water availability over Peninsular India, which is already impacted by water scarcity.</jats:p>",

Evidence from animal models suggest that lowered levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) may have similar effects, although it is currently unknown whether decreased central nervous 5-HT impact NPY concentrations. Given that the production of NPY is dependent on the essential amino acid methionine (MET), it is imperative to account for the presence of MET in such investigations. Hence, this study sought to examine the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD; a dietary procedure that temporarily lowers central nervous 5-HT synthesis) on serum concentrations of NPY, whilst using the potential renal acid load indicator (PRAL) to control for levels of MET. In a double-blind repeated measures design, 24 adult humans randomly received an AA-load lacking in TRP (ATD) on one occasion, and a balanced control mixture with TRP (BAL) on a second occasion, both with a PRAL of nearly 47.3 mEq of MET. Blood samples were obtained at 90, 180, and 240 min after each of the AA challenges. ATD, and therefore, diminished substrate availability for brain 5-HT synthesis did not lead to significant changes in serum NPY concentrations over time, compared to BAL, under an acute acidotic stimulus.</jats:p>"

Until now, the detection of genetic factors (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QTL</jats:styled-content>s) implicated in clubroot resistance has been based on estimates of disease index. However, as the amount of resting spores released in soil after club disintegration influences clubroot epidemics and resistance‐breaking dynamics, its genetic control may deserve specific attention. In a previous report, it was shown that nitrogen fertilization modulated quantitative partial resistance toward clubroot symptom development in rapeseed. The present work aimed to identify genetic factors involved in the control of resting spore production and to assess their regulation by nitrogen supply. A flow cytometer method was adapted for rapidly estimating resting spore content in a large series of samples. Linkage analysis was conducted to detect <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QTL</jats:styled-content>s implicated in resting spore production in a <jats:italic>Brassica napus</jats:italic> doubled haploid progeny from the cross Darmor‐<jats:italic>bzh</jats:italic> × Yudal. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DH</jats:styled-content> lines inoculated with the <jats:italic>P. brassicae</jats:italic> isolate <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">eH</jats:styled-content> were grown under low‐ and high‐nitrogen supply.

The present study tests whether a model, calibrated solely on single-species data, can explain abiotic stress factors in a two-species microcosm, a test applied to the effects of nutritional stress (phosphorus [P] limitation) on zinc (Zn) toxicity to Daphnia magna. A population model was developed based on P- and Zn-dependent algal and daphnid growth. Two separate two-species (phytoplankton Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and consumer D. magna) microcosm experiments with P × Zn factorial combinations and a different pH (7.3 and 7.8) were set up to validate the model. The 21-d daphnid population size was considerably reduced by increased Zn and by decreased P supply, with a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001) interaction between the 2 factors. The observed median effective concentration (EC50) of Zn on D. magna population size varied 12-fold (25 to 310 μg Zn L−1), with the lowest EC50 values found at the highest pH and high P treatments. For both experiments, Zn toxicity to D. magna was correctly predicted within a factor of 2 for EC50 values, and this is explained by the model through 1) a higher phytoplankton Zn sensitivity at higher pH, affecting food supply to D. magna, and 2) an increased algal P content at higher Zn, offering a nutritional benefit to daphnids that counteracts direct Zn toxicity under P limitation. The present study illustrates that indirect effects of Zn via producer–consumer relationships can outweigh the direct toxic effects and that models calibrated solely on single-species test data can help with interpreting these results in two-species systems.

A hypothesis to explain this carbon imbalance proposes that some non‐steady‐state processes have not been considered in previous studies based on snapshot data. To test this hypothesis, we collected time‐series (2.5 yr) data on sinking POC fluxes using moored sediment traps (trap deployment depths: 200 m, 500 m, and 4810 m) and compared them with the PCD data collected seasonally at two stations in the subarctic and subtropical western North Pacific. The POC supplies (ΔPOC) in the 200–500 m and 500–4810 m layers were estimated with a correction, when appropriate, for the non‐steady‐state effect arising from the change in the POC flux during the transit of POC between the upper and deeper traps. In the 200–500 m layer, ΔPOC generally exceeded or equaled PCD. In contrast, in the 500–4810 m layer, PCD generally exceeded ΔPOC by up to sevenfold. However, on a yearly basis, this carbon imbalance in the deeper layer decreased, with PCD balancing ΔPOC within a factor of 2. Therefore, the enigma of the high PCD relative to the POC flux in deep water is partially resolved by assuming a temporal uncoupling between supply and consumption, which partly equilibrates the carbon budget over a longer (yearly) time scale.</jats:p>",

We examined the cross-shelf modification of this water mass during mid-summer 2015 to understand the supply of nutrients and carbon to the productive surface ocean, and their subsequent uptake and cycling. We show that nitrate, phosphate, silicic acid and inorganic carbon are progressively enriched in subsurface waters across the shelf, contrary to cross-shelf reductions in heat, salinity and density. We use nutrient stoichiometric and isotopic approaches to invoke remineralization of organic matter, including nitrification below the euphotic surface layer, and dissolution of biogenic silica in deeper waters and potentially shelf sediment porewaters, as the primary drivers of cross-shelf enrichments. Regenerated nitrate and phosphate account for a significant proportion of the total pools of these nutrients in the upper ocean, with implications for the seasonal carbon sink. Understanding nutrient and carbon dynamics in this region now will inform predictions of future biogeochemical changes in the context of substantial variability and ongoing changes in the physical environment.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘The marine system of the West Antarctic Peninsula: status and strategy for progress in a region of rapid change’.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The intrinsic links between water and energy have produced a new concept known as water-energy nexus (WEN), which has been increasingly studied by scholars and global institutions since the 1990s. This paper provides a review of water-energy nexus studies in an interdisciplinary manner starting from two major approaches—water for energy and energy for water—which focus principally on quantitative studies, but also on policy and institutional dimensions. Many studies mention data collection, the lack of coordination between existing frameworks and the scale/boundary of the two resources as major challenges, whereas new technologies are seen as an opportunity for the nexus perspective. After identifying research gaps, the political ecology approach is proposed for a critical reflection on WEN. Additionally, water poverty and energy poverty (or fuel poverty) are also proposed as part of WEN studies in order to broaden their spectrum to include the demand-end perspective and introduce a social dimension in WEN.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using a dynamic model from 2005 to 2015, this study assessed China’s energy supply security in the provinces along “the Belt and Road”. Energy supply security was conceptualized across four dimensions: availability, affordability, acceptability, and energy technology and efficiency. A dynamic model was used to calculate the dynamic weights for each indicator and to examine the variation laws. It was found that the acceptability dimension indicator weights had rapidly increased, indicating that energy supply security had been widely accepted. Smooth weights were found for the availability dimension indicators, indicating that the resources needed to protect basic energy supplies were available. A synthetical energy supply security evaluation index was also analyzed for each “Belt and Road” province using a “quadratic weighting” method, which showed that the index was different in the same provinces in different years and different for different provinces in the same year. For 14 “Belt and Road” provinces, the overall energy supply security was found to have a “V” shape and a general dynamic upward trend, with the trends in the northwest and southeast provinces and along the whole “Belt and Road” found to be consistent. The energy supply security differences between these provinces were analyzed deeply in this paper; it will help us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of energy supply security levels in these provinces. The result will make it easier to cooperate with other provinces or countries along the “Belt and Road” in energy supply.</jats:p>",
