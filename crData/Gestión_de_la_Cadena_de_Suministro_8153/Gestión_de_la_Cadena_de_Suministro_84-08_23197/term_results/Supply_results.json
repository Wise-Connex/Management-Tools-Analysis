Preincubation of rat liver microsomal fraction followed by assay of ACAT showed a time-dependent increase in activity. This rate was temperature-dependent. Preincubation in the presence of cholesterol/phospholipid liposomes resulted in a time-dependent transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to the microsomal vesicles and in an increase in the rate of ACAT change owing to the preincubation. Both these rates were dependent on liposomal cholesterol concentration and on temperature. The presence of cytosol in the preincubation mixture increased the rate of change of ACAT activity in the absence or in the presence of cholesterol/phospholipid liposomes. In the latter case the presence of cytosol also increased the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to the microsomal vesicles. Activation energies of the rate of this transfer and of the rate of increase of ACAT activity were similar in the presence and in the absence of cytosol. Both in the absence and in the presence of cytosol, the presence of NaF (50 mM) in the preincubation mixture considerably decreased the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to microsomal vesicles and the rate of increase of ACAT activity. The presence of Mg2+ in the preincubation mixture produced no effect on the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to the microsomal vesicles, although under most conditions it decreased the rate of increase of ACAT activity caused by the preincubation. These results are discussed in relation to the molecular mechanism involved in this intervesicular transfer of cholesterol and to the modulation of ACAT activity by substrate supply, and also in relation to the hypothesis that ACAT activity can be modulated by a mechanism involving the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the enzyme.</jats:p>",

Either anionic exchange or mixing with water with less nitrate are used to reduce the nitrate content in the distributed water. However, some wells have been abandoned because of high nitrate concentrations. In this study an attempt is made to reduce the nitrogen contamination of the ground water at the source. In well recharge areas the agricultural practices are investigated and, if necessary, alterations are proposed to the farmer in order to decrease the nitrogen leaching from the soil profile. The effect of these improvements is continuously studied in soil and ground water. An action plan is proposed for water supplies with dominating arable land in the recharge area.</jats:p>",

An experimental study shows that even in long days, if plants are pot‐bound and watered infrequently, apical abscission occurs within a few days of the buds opening. Transferring plants to a large volume of soil or watering frequently delays abscission for several weeks. On a high proportion of plants, which have been either exposed to short days, or deprived of water, defoliation in early or midsummer causes the buds to open, but by late summer buds on the majority of plants are dormant.</jats:p>",

Membrane filtration techniques were used to count colonies of Aeromonas spp., coliforms, and Escherichia coli in water sampled before entry to service reservoirs, during storage in service reservoirs, and in distribution systems. Aeromonas spp. were identified by subculture on blood agar with ampicillin, oxidase tests, and the use of Kaper medium and then were tested for production of enterotoxins and hemolysins. During the same period, two-thirds of all fecal specimens sent for microbiological examination were cultured on ampicillin-blood agar for Aeromonas spp. Recovery of Aeromonas spp. from water supplies at distribution points correlated with fecal isolations and continued during autumn and winter. Coliforms and E. coli were found most commonly in late summer to autumn. This pattern differs from the summer peak of Aeromonas isolations both from water and from patients with Aeromonas spp.-associated gastroenteritis in Perth, Western Australia, a city with a chlorinated domestic water supply. Of the Aeromonas strains from water, 61% were enterotoxigenic, and 64% produced hemolysins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The occurrence of Aeromonas spp. in the metropolitan water supply of Perth, Western Australia, Australia, was monitored at several sampling points during a period of 1 year. Water within the distribution system conformed to international standards for drinking water but contained Aeromonas spp. in numbers comparable to those in raw surface water, although this water was free of Escherichia coli. Coliforms and E. coli were found in raw surface waters, and Aeromonas spp. were found in raw water from surface and underground sources. Chemical treatment, followed by chlorination at service reservoirs, resulted in water free of E. coli and a decrease in the number of Aeromonas spp. Aeromonas spp. were found in the greatest numbers in summer. Multiple regression analysis showed that growth of Aeromonas spp. in chlorinated water was related to water temperature, residual chlorine, and interaction between these variables. The incidence of Aeromonas-associated gastroenteritis, determined from isolates referred to us for enterotoxin testing, paralleled the pattern of isolation of Aeromonas spp. in water within the distribution systems. We suggest that the presence of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water needs public health appraisal and that further work should be undertaken to permit reevaluation of standards for the quality of drinking water.</jats:p>",
