Hence, there is no alternative way to optimize the apparel supply chain to survive in the competitive market. In this study, we implemented artificial neural networks (ANN) in apparel manufacturing organizations to optimize the supply chain by convergent on the right supplier selection by analyzing their performance criteria. Moreover, data was collected from three different factories to analyze the efficiency and profit-loss status of their units. Furthermore, analyze the supplier selection criteria of three suppliers in order to select the right supplier at the right time in the apparel manufacturing industry. This study shows that it can save 18% of the total cost. Additionally, the mathematical analysis has been performed to validate the data analysis for the right supplier selection based on the performance criteria.</jats:p>",

The process through which an appropriate supply chain is executed has evolved from manual labour force up to the introduction of technology in the same field which has led to innovation in processes like, administration and logistics. This research contains a vivid description of computer vision in supply chain management. The initial introduction depicts more about the specific contents of both supply chain management as well as computer vision. While followed by the introduction, the next segment describes how computer vision in supply chain management has been of great input and the probable positive changes, which have been inculcated, since the introduction of computer vision in supply chain management. In the specific field of warehousing and accurate planning the role of computer vision has been commendable. The research also mentions the working mechanism of computer vision in the process of supply chain management. This is followed by how efficiently the management is controlled with the help of computer vision and a proper conclusion that depicts computer vision to be a blessing in disguise for organizations who want to declutter and make their supply chain management all the more effective.</jats:p>"

We report on the presence of asbestos fibres in drinking water supply in Christchurch, New Zealand from ageing asbestos cement reticulated water supply. By sampling the mains water supply via hydrants, 19 of our 20 samples showed long asbestos fibres (&amp;gt;10 μm), with an average concentration 0.9 million fibres per litre (MFL). Short asbestos fibres (&amp;gt;0.5 μm) had an average concentration of 6.2 MFL. Sampling was targeted to pipes from 1930 to the 1960s and there was abundant evidence of fibres being released from pipes of this age. Municipalities cannot continue to rely on ageing asbestos-cement piping, as it appears to be releasing asbestos fibres into drinking water with uncertain health implications, and should prioritise replacing pipes greater than 50 years in age, especially where high water pressures or land disturbance occur, to reduce the risk of water-carried asbestos being released into urban environments, and mitigate any risk of asbestos from ingested contaminated water sources.</jats:p>",

Selain teknologi diduga ada hal lain yaitu Integrasi Supply Chain dan Pertukaran Informasi. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan antara Teknologi Informasi, Integrasi Supply Chain, dan Pertukaran Informasi dengan Performa Supply Chain. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian explanatory. Data diperoleh dengan menyebarkan kuesioner kepada 200 UMKM. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini menggunakan Structural Equation Model yang menggunakan software IBM Amos 26 untuk olah data. Hasil penelitian menyebutkan Peran Teknologi Informasi terhadap Integrasi Supply Chain dan Pertukaran Informasi adalah positif signifikan, selain itu peran Integrasi Supply Chain terhadap Performa Supply Chain juga positif signifikan. Teknologi Informasi tidak signifikan secara langsung berpengaruh terhadap Performa Supply Chain begitu juga Pertukaran Informasi tidak signifikan pengaruhnya terhadap Performa Supply Chain. Dengan ini, UMKM perlu meningkatkan kesadarannya dalam pemanfaatan teknologi informasi karena dalam peningkatan integrasi supply chain akan mempengaruhi terhadap performa supply chain yang akan bersama – sama dengan mitra untuk berkordinasi dalam penyampaian barang yang lebih cepat kepada konsumen akhir dengan biaya lebih rendah. Selain itu, perlu dilakukan pengkajian mengenai peran teknologi secara tidak langsung terhadap performa supply chain.</jats:p>"

The research presents the conceptual mixed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technology to prioritize the resilience criteria based on understanding their interrelationships. Results identify three essential resilience criteria, namely “coordination and collaboration in the supply chain”, “efficiency”, and “strategic management” and the top five key sub-criteria as “velocity”, “visibility”, “continuity management”, “connectedness”, “collaborative planning and replenishment”.

In applying psychological contract theory to investigate recovery efforts related to such chain liability, the current study addresses three broad focal firm responses: Do nothing, choose a nonsubstantive response that verbally clarifies its own and the supplier's roles in the incident, or substantively rectify the supplier's wrongdoing with sustainability‐focused responses, such as termination, monitoring or development. With a vignette‐based experiment, we examine consumer perceptions and behaviors in three stages: before the unsustainable supplier incident (pre‐incident), after the incident (post‐incident) and after the focal firm has responded (post‐response). A nonsubstantive, clarification response decreases consumers' purchase intentions; substantive focal firm activities increase purchase intentions, though not fully back to pre‐incident levels. For consumers, termination, monitoring and development seem like equally adequate responses. Although combining several substantive responses offers even greater effectiveness for recovering purchase intentions, it still falls short of reaching pre‐incident levels. Thus, our findings demonstrate the focal firm's capacity to address suppliers' unsustainable practices substantively and recover, at least partially, its damaged relationship with consumers.</jats:p>",

In recent years, extreme climate events such as floods and droughts have occurred more frequently. Sydney, as the largest city in Australia, requires a reliable water supply. Many solutions have been conducted to secure its water supply. This paper is focused on future water supply for the Greater Sydney area. The analysis supports the concept that in runoff-rich regions like Greater Sydney, there is no water shortage but a lack of water storage. The novel technology, coastal reservoirs, can increase the storage capacity of freshwater in the sea. The average annual discharge at Shoalhaven River mouth is estimated as 1,334 gigalitres. By comparison, the average annual inflow to the Warragamba Dam, which supplies 80% of Sydney's drinking water, is 1,069 gigalitres. This paper discusses how to apply a Coastal Reservoir at the Shoalhaven River mouth to secure additional water supply for ever-growing Greater Sydney. The proposed reservoir with a capacity of 500 gigalitres could supply 1,000 gigalitres of water per year with a reliability of 90%. A preliminary design of the reservoir is demonstrated.</jats:p>",

The demand for bottled water is still increasing. This may result in infrastructure investments and the production of waste. This study aimed to explore factors that influence the acceptance of drinkable tap water among Bangkok residents. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected via an interview of 374 participants using a structured questionnaire. There was a significant prevalence (51.87%) of the acceptance of drinkable tap water among Bangkok residents. Among them, 82.99% selected tap water to drink and 9.79% drank water directly from the tap. Factors that affected the acceptance of drinkable tap water were occupation, monthly income, campaign perception, personal belief, unacceptable sensory appearance, risk perception, knowledge, and attitude. This study found that drinking water selection was not associated with self-reported diarrhea. While we recognize that the cross-sectional study has some limitations, our data may provide additional insight into factors which affect consumers' behavior and may offer several benefits for water suppliers and public health decision-makers. This would eventually increase public awareness for economic benefits associated with the use of tap water and finally would reduce pollution by plastic waste.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the Government seeks to involve the private sector through the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme in the West Semarang Drinking Water System project to overcome the cost of providing a significant investment. In 2012 the West Semarang Drinking Water Supply Project (WS-DWSS) was developed by the Government. But in 2015, the project was stopped due to changes in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 7 of 2004 concerning Water Resources. PPP schemes in the water sector are relatively new in Indonesia and often face many challenges in their implementation. Through the lens of a theoretical framework and by taking a qualitative and quantitative approach based on primary and secondary data, this thesis assesses the critical risk factors during project implementation in the perception of the public and private sectors. This thesis shows that the both sectors agree that there are 3 most critical risks for drinking water projects: availability of raw water (continuity/quantity), natural disasters, tariff setting &amp; demand projection error. However, the two sectors also have different perceptions of critical risk factors. This difference shows that the two sectors have distinct views and goals as part of a collaborative project. By knowing the similarities and differences, mitigation efforts can be made to minimize the risk of drinking water projects with the PPP scheme.</jats:p>",

The findings of this study will be helpful for practitioners and policymakers in the development and successful implementation of UFT management policies.Method: Using the cordon count (traffic data), retailers’ interviews (receivers’ data) and freight vehicle drivers’ interviews, UFT characteristics such as sector-specific contribution, trip characteristics, vehicular characteristics and negative impacts in terms of external cost to society are evaluated. This study also discusses the prediction of attracted trips in the study zone using freight trip attraction (models.Results: About 75% of the trips in Gothenburg and 92% of the trips in Delhi are made by light commercial and other small-sized vehicles. Gothenburg has formally organised sectors involved in freight vehicle movement; however, Delhi has informally organised sectors.Conclusion: The results revealed substantial differences in characteristics of freight trip operations in both the cities, compared with few similarities.

Being able to influence the other party during negotiations is therefore vital to improve performance outcomes. This research takes a configurational approach to investigate how buyers can use narratives in different power situations to influence suppliers and improve their relational and economic negotiation results. In our first study, we conduct narrative writing workshops to identify typical design elements of such narratives. In our second study, we employ fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis to determine how different configurations of these design elements influence narratives' effectiveness in different power situations. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we expand narrative transportation theory, showing that narratives consist of interlinked design elements and that narrative effectiveness is a causally complex phenomenon. Second, for the field of supply chain management, we develop theory by introducing narratives as an additional means of influence in buyer–supplier negotiations and by examining the interplay between narrative design elements, structural power, and negotiation outcomes that are specific to the buyer–supplier relationship. Based on the configurations of narratives that we found were effective and ineffective in different power situations, we derive propositions to advance theory on buyer–supplier negotiations.</jats:p>",

The evolution of the concept of supply chain management is considered from the standpoint of the institutional theory, as well as the influencing of various factors on its development and integration with the concept of sustainable development is determined. The conceptual and categorical apparatus for researching supply chain sustainability management from the standpoint of network theory and stakeholder theory has been developed.  On the example of a metallurgical enterprise, a system of indicators of sustainable development is proposed and strategic guidelines for three scenarios of sustainable development of an enterprise are determined. These three scenarios take into account the conditions for future development, which are defined as pessimistic, optimistic and such as to ensure balanced sustainable development. Calculations of strategic scenarios for sustainable development were based on the determination of threshold values of indicators for three components: economic (including the quality of corporate governance), environmental and social. Strategic benchmarks have been developed for each of the scenarios.  In the course of the study, it was found that it is inappropriate to calculate the integral sustainability index for the entire supply chain as a whole. Such a calculation has no informative value and is technically practically impossible due to the incomparability of indicators of different business units included in the supply chain. A conclusion is drawn from this that the sustainability of each individual business unit in the chain should be assessed separately. An organizational and economic mechanism for managing the sustainability of the supply chain in a hybrid form is proposed, which provides for a combination of decentralized development of sustainable development strategies by individual enterprises and organizations within the supply chain and centralized coordination and monitoring of the implementation of strategies by a focal company based on a digital platform. The concept of this mechanism is based on a network approach and provides for the organization of collaboration of participants in the supply chain with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders. The directions in which various digital technologies can be applied in managing the sustainability of the supply chain are considered, among which blockchain technology is recognized as the most suitable for use at the moment.</jats:p>"

We document a negative, non-linear relationship between PM 2.5 and same-day labor supply, with strong effects on days with extremely high pollution levels. On these days, the average worker experiences a reduction of around 7.5% of working hours. Workers partially compensate for lost hours by increasing their labor supply on days that follow high-pollution days. Informal workers reduce their labor supply less than formal workers on high-pollution days and also compensate less on the following days. This suggests that informal workers may experience greater exposure to high pollution and greater reductions in labor supply and income. We provide evidence that reductions in labor supply due to high pollution are consistent with avoidance behavior and that income constraints may play an important role in workers' labor supply decisions.</jats:p>"

Thus, this study proposes a dynamic model to optimize water supply system under different scenarios aimed at improving sustainability of system. In fact, due to the negative impacts of the water crisis, the sustainability of the dynamic water supply system is evaluated and optimized according to the performance indicators of the system. Also, to investigate the proposed model, a real case study of the Sistan basin in Iran over ten years period is conducted. Based on the model, different management insights along with the scenario analysis are considered in order to assess the sustainability of system in more detail. According to the final output, the highest level of sustainability is related to the domestic sector because it has higher reliability and less vulnerability than other sectors.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, the bulk of the recently deployed partition approaches overlooked the question of whether the district's fluctuation regulation of flow data is consistent. When the district is modified, it most likely leads to an increase in pressure at a node. To tackle the problem, the flow data from a city's water supply network was evaluated in this article. The random forest approach was also used to extract time-domain characteristics from flow data, and the water supply network split was optimized using the random forest-hierarchical clustering (RF-HC) strategy. Finally, the results were examined and compared. The results suggest that the RF-HC-based water supply network partition technique can better meet the aim of consistent flow changes in the district, as well as offer a theoretical foundation and technological support for the optimal dispatch of press concerning the water supply network.</jats:p>",

The information traceability of the food supply chain is made more difficult by the fact that the online shopping platform comprises not only a big number of merchants, but also a high number of users, raising the chance of misunderstanding between different parties. To ensure food safety, this article proposes and analyzes a commercial IoT-based food supply chain information traceability system. Users need just to scan the traceability source code with the APP device to acquire information about the food's origin, processing, and merchants. They can also order uniform food ingredients for dispersed small merchants to assure food safety. The developed system consists of two components: a purchase system for food and a processing system for food. A database connects the two systems, and they are then incorporated into the food traceability system. The numerical results reveal that our proposed system has a more than 90% accuracy rate for source code traceability as well as a satisfying performance robustness with a large number of concurrently logged-in users.</jats:p>"

This paper presents an experimental study to examine chlorine loss in different types of pipe materials and select the ones with low chlorine demand for the rehabilitation of the water distribution network of San Pedro Nexapa, State of Mexico. The materials investigated include: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), galvanized steel (GS), polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). A 24-h chlorine consumption study was performed in a simulated water distribution network to assess the impact of wall reaction coefficient on chlorine decay. Four sets of independent pipe loops of 50 mm in diameter and 12 m in length were used. Two different scenarios were considered based on different initial chlorine concentration (1.21 mg/L and 1.60 mg/L). Samples were collected at each loop at two-hour intervals and physicochemical analyses were conducted. Results from the experimental distribution network showed that the wall coefficient values for GS, HDPE, PP and PVC were 0.165 h−1, 0.059 h−1, 0.043 h−1 and 0.026 h−1, respectively. Experimental results showed that wall reaction coefficient values depend on initial chlorine concentration and the characteristics of pipe material. The rate of free chlorine decay was found to be faster in steel pipe and slower in the plastic pipes. Based on its having the lowest chlorine demand compared with the other pipes, PVC pipe would be selected to rehabilitate Nexapa water distribution network, State of Mexico. The wall coefficients from the experimental study were incorporated into EPANET through four simulation runs to predict chorine decay of San Pedro Nexapa water distribution network, State of Mexico. In the PVC and PP pipes higher residual chlorine concentrations were observed that ranged from 0.30 to 0.90 mg/L and 0.50 to 0.95 mg/L, respectively. This study is important for utilities to operate their system effectively and protect public health.</jats:p>",

Their usage is driven by necessity rather than as a principal objective, mostly due to technical and economic deficiencies. Major health risks and socio-economic inequities are associated with such systems. Their impacts are aggravated by climate changes and the COVID-19 crisis. These are likely to have profound implications on progress toward advancing sustainable development goals (SDGs). Motivated by providing a comprehensive overview of global knowledge on IWSSs, the present work proposed to track and analyze research works on IWSSs utilizing bibliometric techniques and visual mapping tools. This includes investigating the trends and growth trajectories of research works on IWSSs and analyzing the various approaches proposed to expand our understanding with respect to the management, modeling, optimization, and impacts of IWSSs. The national and international contributions and collaboration figures are further analyzed at country, institution, author, and source levels. This analysis indicates that research works conducted on IWSSs have certain expectations in terms of productivity (total global productivity; 197 documents). The United States was the best country in terms of productivity (58 documents; 29.4%), while the Water Switzerland journal was the most productive journal (19 documents; 9.6%). The impacts of IWSSs on health and well-being have attracted considerable attention. The outcomes showed deep and justified worries in relation to the transition from intermittent to continuous supply, equity, and mitigating the health risks associated with IWSSs in the foreseen future. The utilization of artificial intelligence techniques and expert systems will drive and shape future IWSS-related research activities. Therefore, investments in this regard are crucial.</jats:p>"

According to the special terrain in the water supply project, which forms a siphon breaking structure at the end of the pipeline, three protective schemes were proposed and compared: single vacuum breaking valve (VBV) scheme, VBV and air valve scheme, and VBV and one-way surge tower scheme. Based on the control standards of pipe pressure, the three protective schemes were assessed in terms of suppressing the negative pressure caused by a pump trip accident. The results show that the siphon breaking structure with the VBV can achieve good effect protection only in a limited range of pipelines. In the VBV and air valve scheme, the pressure oscillations were obviously caused by repeated inlet and exhaust of the air valves. To avoid supplementing too much gas in the pipe by air valves, which will result in a gas column bridging phenomenon, the VBV and one-way surge tower scheme is proposed and can better meet the requirement of the pressure control standard.</jats:p>",

Given the economic, environmental and social benefits of water diversion projects, and based on the theory of the sustainable supply chain, an order parameter index system for collaboration measurement was constructed in this study. The Dematel and Analytic Network Process methods were used to compute the local and global weights of each order parameter. A total of 161 valid questionnaires were collected from residents along the South-to-North Water Diversion Project Middle Route to measure its collaboration from 2018 to 2020. Results showed that the orderliness of the four flow subsystems of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project Middle Route increases year by year. Compared with the other three flow subsystems, the knowledge flow subsystem has a lower level of orderliness, suggesting that communication and exchanges among people along the route should be strengthened. Such findings can help identify the weak link in the collaborative management of the sustainable supply chain of water diversion projects and improve it in a targeted manner.</jats:p>"

By employing game theoretic models for different retail competition scenarios, we show that equilibrium channel structures are primarily determined by the intensity of retail competition along with the marketing effort level. Channel structure selection and marketing effort strategy are interdependent and interactive. Our results show that the supplier has an incentive to make marketing effort and sell products directly to consumers in most cases. When the retail competition becomes fiercer, the supplier can benefit from selecting a distribution strategy based on customers' sensitivity to the supplier's marketing effort. In contrast, the supplier selling products through the downstream retailer will not make marketing effort under certain market conditions (e.g., low competition and high customer sensitivity to the supplier's effort performance), while the competitor adopts the direct-sales strategy. Generally, the supplier will prefer making marketing effort relative to undertaking product distribution. Finally, we also examine the strategic effects of channel structure selection and marketing effort decisions on the competitor's profit in the retail competition market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Based on the consideration that consumers have low-carbon sensitivity and channel preference, a Stackelberg game model dominated by manufacturer was constructed to study the joint strategies of low-carbon emission reduction and blockchain input of supply chain members under three models: traditional retailer dual channel, manufacturer online direct sales dual channel and third-party e-commerce distribution dual channel. The interaction of different levels of emission reduction and blockchain inputs in different dual-channel models was verified through the calculation and simulation analysis on the optimal decision of the supply chain members. The research results showed that the optimal emission reduction of manufacturers and the blockchain input level of retailers under different dual-channel models are different, and manufacturers have the highest emission reduction under the dual-channel model of direct online sales; when manufacturers invest the same amount of emission reduction, the profit of adopting the traditional dual-channel model is the highest, and the profit of the dual-channel of third-party e-commerce distribution is the lowest; the ratio of technology gain to cost input in the supply chain determines the initiative of low-carbon input. Meanwhile, emission reduction investment is driven by the manufacturer's profit, and the more the manufacturer's channel accounts for the higher the emission reduction tends to be.</jats:p>"

However, here we show that even if electrolysis capacity grows as fast as wind and solar power have, green hydrogen supply remains scarce in the short-term and uncertain in the long-term. Using probabilistic technology diffusion modelling, we find that, despite initial exponential growth, green hydrogen likely (≥75%) supplies &lt;1 % of final energy until 2030 (2035) in the EU (globally). By 2040, a breakthrough is more likely, but large uncertainties prevail with an interquartile range of 4.4-10.5% (EU) and 1.1-4.3% (globally). Both short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty impede investment in hydrogen end-uses and infrastructure, reducing green hydrogen’s potential and jeopardising climate targets. However, historic analogues suggest that emergency-like policy measures could foster substantially higher growth rates, expediting the breakthrough and increasing the likelihood of future hydrogen availability.</jats:p>"

It also explores supply chain disruptions (trade interruptions, changes in consumption and tariffs related to imports) caused in the wake of COVID-19. Based on the analysis and key findings, it proposes policy changes and recommendations to increase the resilience of these supply chains, to protect them from such disruptions.\nThe analysis finds that the global production and trade in COVID-19-related medical goods is highly concentrated. The European Union and the United States monopolise the production of high-tech equipment such as ventilators and oxygen therapy equipment, while China is a leading supplier of personal protective equipment (PPE). Intra-Commonwealth trade in medical supplies is relatively small, with exports mainly dominated by the developed countries and imports by large developing countries. The analysis also finds that export restrictions and high tariffs in many member countries are hampering the trade in medical supplies, and hence reducing its resilience to major shocks such as COVID-19.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In the past few decades, most high-income countries have improved environmental and labor conditions on their respective territory while consumption has strongly increased. One main enabler is international trade. The latter allows for the geographic dissociation of consumption benefits from adverse production impacts. Green economy strategies are seeking to reduce such indirect international externalities by making not only domestic, but also global supply chains more sustainable. Support by consumers and citizens is a key prerequisite for successful policy interventions to this end. To estimate how strong public demand for sustainability regulation of global supply chains is, we conducted survey experiments with representative samples in the world’s 12 largest high-income importing economies with democratic political systems (N 24,000). These account for 45 percent of imports worldwide. The focus is on which policy designs for sustainability governance of international supply chains are likely to be acceptable to the public. The main finding is that, overall, citizens prefer policy instruments with strong reporting requirements and enforcement provisions applied from mid-sized to large firms. These policy preferences are surprisingly consistent across all 12 countries, something we did not expect given vast differences in economic structures and political/regulatory cultures. Within countries, variation in preferences for increased transparency regulation and enforcement is largely driven by environmental concern and political ideology. Our results point to substantial, cross-national public opinion mandates for new policies to green global supply chains.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Blockchain is a digitally managed, distributed, and decentralized ledger used to record transactions in an immutable format. Its characteristics in providing trust, transparency, and traceability make it attractive for applications where transactions are involved. Originally intended to support financial transactions, the technology has gained attention even in non-financial sectors such as health care, manufacturing, retail, and government services. Methods: For centuries, the various functions of manufacturing industries have worked based on the relationship and trust that they have with their upstream and downstream stakeholders. In addition, as the conventional factories are growing into giant gigafactories, the participation of several intermediaries further complicates the supply chain and logistics operations. Hence, the article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of blockchain technology in addressing supply chain and logistics-related challenges by analyzing, organizing, and reviewing the literature. Results: The study shows that blockchain technology can transform the supply chain and logistics into secure, agile, trusted, and transparent functions. A conceptualized application scenario demonstrates the benefits of blockchain technology in providing provenance and traceability to critical products. Conclusions: In particular, a private or permissioned blockchain is suitable for multi-organizational businesses such as supply chain and logistics. In addition, IoT-blockchain integration, smart contracts, and asset tracking has immense benefits in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years supply chains have evolved into huge ecosystems, demanding trust, provenance, and data privacy. Since blockchain technology (BCT) allows for the development of a distributed environment, it is ideal for supply chain management (SCM) applications. However, concerns regarding data privacy have impeded the development of blockchains. Despite the fact that some blockchains can restrict participants to read and write data, the blockchain&amp;rsquo;s transparency makes protecting sensitive data challenging. To solve the data privacy challenge, this paper proposes a framework, AccessChain, that is an SCM access control framework based on an attribute-based access control (ABAC) model that restricts access to competing parties while allowing for network scalability. This proposed AccessChain model has two types of ledgers in the system: local and global. Local ledgers are used to store business contracts between stakeholders and the ABAC model management, whereas the global ledger is used to record transaction data. AccessChain can enable decentralized, fine-grained and dynamic access control management in SCM when combined with the ABAC model and BCT. This paper&amp;rsquo;s experimental results illustrate that high throughput can be achieved in a large-scale request environment while maintaining data privacy and sustaining a scalable network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Tools that quantify community disaster resilience are essential for informed decision-making on community disaster resilience improvement measures. One of the major research gaps in quantifying community disaster resilience are community disaster recovery simulations. Such simulations enable an insight into factors that enable a rapid and efficient community disaster recovery and vice versa. The iRe-CoDeS framework presented in this paper, simulates community disaster recovery as a time-stepping loop, where at each time step the interplay of demand and supply of community components for various resources and services dictates components’ ability to operate and recover. Disaster resilience of a community is then quantified using a multi-dimensional metric, where each dimension represents the unmet demand of a community regarding a certain resource or a service, labelled as Lack of Resilience (LoR). This paper presents how such a demand/supply approach can be applied to account for resource and service constraints, impeding factors, that prolong component recovery and thus decrease community disaster resilience. Housing resilience of north-east San Francisco exposed to a Mw7.2 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault is quantified to illustrate the proposed approach. rWhale application framework recently developed at the NHERI SimCenter is used for this purpose, presenting how such a regional simulation on the effect of natural disasters on communities can be extended using the iRe-CoDeS framework to simulate community disaster recovery and quantify community disaster resilience. It is shown that housing resilience quantification results obtained in the Case Study focused on a part of San Francisco are in accordance with the existing estimates of housing resilience. The evolution of the post-disaster community-level supply and demand for recovery resources and services is obtained, identifying how and when the unmet demand for these resources and services impedes community recovery. Lastly, the effect of community’s ability to mobilize resources and services needed for its recovery on its disaster resilience is investigated.</p>"

Supply chain rigidity can result in huge losses for the organization if the supply chain is suspended. In this setting, the notion of supply chain resilience emerges at a critical juncture in history. With the development of environmental uncertainty, supply chain flexibility is becoming increasingly vital for the practical relevance of the organization. Big data, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have had a significant influence on supply chain management in recent years, thanks to the ongoing appearance of new technology.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nonsymmetrical modes in the external power supply network during operation can be caused by several reasons: phase failure due to strong wind or glaciation of overhead power lines, wire burnout due to persistent short circuits, open phase automatic reclosing. In case of open phase condition, the external power supply network, synchronous and asynchronous electric motors are powered along the two phases that are in operation. It leads to the negative sequence current, which poses maximum danger for electric motors, since it causes additional heating and, as a result, premature damage. Therefore, the currently important goal of the project is to study transient processes of the motor load when an open phase mode occurs in the external power supply network and to design microprocessor protection of electrical motors against phase failure in the supply network. To achieve the goal, a computer simulation method is used, based on mathematical models of the elements of electrical network presented as the systems of differential equations in a three-phase coordinate system. The regularities of the flow of transient processes in synchronous and asynchronous electric motors in case of open phase modes in both the internal and external power supply networks have been established. Thus, it is possible to develop an algorithm of the operation of microprocessor protection of electrical motors against phase failure in the external power supply network. The proposed algorithm is based on monitoring the negative sequence current level and the absence of current in one of the phases at the section input. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm to protect electrical motors against open phase modes in an external power supply network has a high selectivity. Its use as a starting element of the fast-acting automatic transfer switch device allows you to provide uninterrupted power supply for enterprises with a continuous technological process.</jats:p>",

While the broader field of AI has made rapid advances in a relatively short period of time, there are significant barriers that still need to be addressed to harness the true potential of AI. SCM’s dependency on multi-actor collaboration, disparate data sources, unwillingness of actors to embrace AI, change management issues, and lack of AI governance framework poses significant barriers for successful implementation of AI.  Drawn from extensive literature review as well as real-world experience, this paper systematically explores and compiles a robust list of barriers of AI implementation in supply chain functions by categorizing them and elaborating their impact at inter- and intra-organizational SCM. Lastly, the paper offers recommendations for practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and governments on how they can work together for AI to be successful.</p>",

Сurrently available mathematical models of heat networks are described in the scientific studies of Polovnikov V.Yu., Kuznetsov G.V., Tarasevich E.I. But they do not solve the problem of assessing changes of the thermal networks state when energy-saving measures are used. The purpose of the study is to determine the permissible heat perception of the device collector for utilization of heat losses in the heating main channel. The study is based on the development and research of mathematical models of heat exchange processes in the heat supply network. A mathematical modeling method is chosen to search for acceptable operating modes of this device. The method can help to determine properly changes in the operation of the heat network. A descriptive mathematical model with distributed parameters based on differential equations with partial derivatives is used in modeling heat transfer processes in the heat network. The model is implemented using the finite element method. The authors propose a device for the utilization of heat losses in the heating channel. The authors have developed mathematical models of heat transfer processes in heat networks of underground trench laying in nonaccessible channels in a traditional design with the use of a heat-reflecting screen and combined action of the network and the device for the utilization of heat losses in the heat channel. Based on the comparison of the calculation results, the permissible heat perception value of the device collector for the utilization of heat losses has been determined. It equals to 90 % of the initial thermal losses. Mathematical models have been verified by comparing the results obtained and the experimental data with an error of less than 6 %. The developed mathematical models allow us to study the influence of heat perception of the device collector and the heat-reflecting screen on the operating mode of the heat network. It can be used to determine the geometric parameters of the collector of the device.</jats:p>",

However, despite of the clear purpose of the task, there is still a gap between the actual and the expected status of National Fitness Public Service supply. Based on the characteristics of the perspective of space, the purpose of this study is to examine how to measure and achieve the effectiveness of National Fitness Public Service’s supply. By reviewing the literature, relevant results of the performance evaluation system of National Fitness Public Service are sorted to provide theoretical support for the value orientation, index selection and other processes of the evaluation system constructed in this study. Current regulations on National Fitness Public Service in various fields in China are classified, and representative indicators are compared, analyzed, and summarized as the reference basis for evaluation standards. The value orientation of the evaluation system is shown in three levels in the spatial dimension: \"ensuring spatial justice\", \"adapting to spatial needs\" and \"building value consensus\". The spatial evaluation system is constructed based on the three-dimensional evaluation dimensions of \"supply capacity\", \"behavioral demand\" and \"The degree of spatial coupling\", this evaluation system comprehensively reflects the subjective and objective evaluation results. The study shows that when exploring reasons for insufficient effectiveness, factors should be analyzed from both of supply and demand sides. The evaluation results of the evaluation system are characterized by being Relative and Developmental. The evaluation results should be based on the relative effectiveness results produced by comparison, and absolute judgment should be avoided. The relative evaluation results focus on finding the elements, links and mechanisms with deficiencies, avoid stopping at the judgment of pros and cons, and should promote self-perfection, stimulate self-innovation and finally achieve the goal of self-development.</p>"

The increase of the number of chargers poses new demands for the AC power grid, especially in regard to its capacity of delivering high peak power. As an alternative for the public AC power grid, urban electrified transportation systems (trams, trolleybuses, and metro) can be used for supplying electric cars chargers. The article discusses four options of integrating electric cars chargers with a traction power supply system. The option of connecting the charger to the traction overhead supply line has been selected due to the spatial availability of the power source and possibility to use regenerative braking energy for charging. A set of criteria has been developed for analysing the capability of the traction supply system to feed electric cars chargers. An exemplary feasibility analysis was carried out for trolleybus traction supply system in Gdynia, Poland. The impact of installing the charging station on specific traction supply parameters has been predicted using present-state recordings of electrical parameters and assumed charging station power. The study shows that every supply section of the considered trolleybus traction system has the capability of installing a fast-charging station, which provides opportunities of expanding the charging stations network in Gdynia.</jats:p>"

Despite the benefits of forming a water market, such markets are not yet developed in developing countries, such as Iran. Accordingly, this study examines the economic impact of water market design on farmers’ livelihood in Iran. The data of this study were collected using a multistage random sampling method from 100 users with water rights in the irrigation network of Ramjerd plain in Fars province. The data were analyzed using positive mathematical programming and scenario making. The results showed that with the formation of the water market, the gross margin of the total lands with irrigation network of Ramjerd plain increased from 2,013.080 billion Rials to 2,194.2200 billion Rials. As a result, the agricultural economic situation of the region experienced an increase of 9%. therefore an appropriate legal and regulatory structure is recommended to create a water market on the lands located within the irrigation networks.</jats:p>",

Although relocation of the raw water station is a long-term solution, it requires a large amount of time and investment. At present, knowing in advance when an intrusion occurs will support the waterworks authority in their operations. Here, we propose a method to forecast the salinity at the raw water pumping station from 24 h up to 120 h in advance. Each of the predictor variables has a physical impact on salinity. We explore a number of model candidates based on two common fitting methods: multiple linear regression and the artificial neural network. During model development, we found that the model behaved differently when the water level was high than when the water level was low (water level is measured at a point 164 km upstream of the raw water pumping station); therefore, we propose a novel multilevel model approach that combines different sub-models, each of which is suitable for a particular water level. The models have been trained and selected through cross-validation, and tested on real data. According to the test results, the salinity can be forecasted with an RMSE of 0.054 g L\\({^{-1}}\\) at a forecast period of 24 h and up to 0.107 g L\\({^{-1}}\\) at a forecast period of 120 h.</jats:p>"

The novelty of the MSC concept is to be found in its innovative and sustainable approach to production and operation processes in supply chains. Implementation of the MSC model could, however, raise trust and confidentiality concerns. The interplay of trust and confidentiality, or preservation of information privacy, between partners plays a central role in the supply chains, particularly because they are genuinely dependent on each other. Qualitative data analysis was used, in which semi-structured interviews with the experts from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in Germany were conducted to investigate the tension between trust and confidentiality, and important factors affecting it. The results of the study present four different integration scenarios, namely, the low-quality, conservative, grey-box, and innovation scenarios, which consider different levels of trust, confidentiality and information sharing. Subsequently, the tension between trust and confidentiality is analyzed within these scenarios, and three effective strategies which encourage partners to balance the tension between trust and confidentiality are proposed. The study indicates that the balance between trust and confidentiality can be maintained in some scenarios when critical factors such as transparency, trust negotiation, and a reward-sharing system are present.</jats:p>"

Most of these algorithms include tuning of algorithm-specific control parameters for higher optimization efficiency, leading to an increased computational effort. The current study is inspired by the desire to address the above problem. The goal is to formulate a multi-objective Rao algorithm (MORao) considering an existing modified resilience index (MRI) in the optimal design of WDNs. The model is demonstrated to attain Pareto-optimal solutions to complex WDN problems without exclusive parameter tuning. The algorithm is written in Python and is linked to a hydraulic model of a WDN implemented in EPANET 2.2 using pressure-driven demand (PDD) analysis. The method is demonstrated on three widely used networks: Two-loop, Goyang, and Fossolo. The Pareto-optimal solutions examine a tradeoff between two objectives to recognize competitive solutions. The network's resilience is increased 2.5 times by only 0.8 times increase in least-cost of Two-loop network. This research indicates that this method can achieve a satisfactory level of performance with a limited number of function evaluations.</jats:p>",

This article utilizes a mixed-method approach to investigate the challenges of maintaining disaster relief supply chains in the face of the emerging risks to Honolulu. We conduct eighteen in-depth interviews with key emergency management stakeholders to understand current approaches to supply chain risk management. Based on the research, three main challenges influence disaster preparedness in Hawai’i. First, the physical location of the island and the spatial distribution of risk, assets, and capabilities supporting emergency relief present large, unusual constraints not found in other jurisdictions. Second, the challenges of supply chain management, planning, communications and coordination are exacerbated during disruptions and disaster events. Unlike other states, with neighboring, contiguous jurisdictions, there are severe limitations to mutual aid and assistance from outside sources. Third, our research has also identified cultural challenges associated with social, political, and economic development and change. Stronger institutional collaboration both within the state and beyond its boundaries are key to increased supply chain resilience and effective response and recovery from disasters. We conduct social network analysis focusing on measures of density, degree, betweenness, and centrality to better understand the status and gaps in institutional collaboration. The social network analysis reveals that the current levels of collaboration are relatively low with significant gaps between government agencies and the private sector, as well as limited vertical collaborations with respect to supply chain management between federal, state and local partners. There is a need for stronger leadership with deeper engagement across stakeholders. A pathway forward includes: 1) vulnerability analyses focused on private sector supply chain management and public sector transport hubs, networks, and facilities, 2) exercises and training on emergency supply chain management, and 3) longer-term actions to support sustainability, self-sufficiency, local production, and community resilience. Our research is relevant not just to Hawai`i and other island and isolated communities but also to communities threatened by supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>"

However, the related literature rarely considers conformance quality improvement of products in green supply chain management. This paper incorporates both into a framework to analyze the optimal strategies of a manufacturer responsible for conformance quality of product and greenness improvement and a retailer responsible for product marketing in a supply chain under four contracts: full cooperation, price-only contract, two-part tariff, and marketing cost-sharing. The analysis shows that full cooperation and two-part tariffs lead to the same and highest product quality, greenness, overall profit, and social welfare, but full cooperation is difficult to achieve in the supply chain. For the profit-maximizing manufacturer and retailer, the manufacturer most prefers two-part tariff contracts while the retailer prefers marketing cost-sharing because both achieve the highest profit in the preferred contract. Under the price-only contract, conformance quality of product and greenness are lowest, and profit levels for manufacturers and retailers are lowest. In all four cases, increased environment and quality awareness contribute to improved product greenness and conformance quality, leading to higher profits for the manufacturer and retailer and higher social welfare.</jats:p>"

In addition, the relevant model is a two-objective fuzzy model, the first objective of which is to minimize costs and maximize profits and the second objective is to minimize environmental issues.

Disruptions affected all food supply chains, including those critical to national security. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the impact of the pandemic on the military food supply chain in Poland. In the analysed single case study, we used process mapping to show the diversity of the types of military food supply chains operating in military units. The attention was focused on the internal and external food supply chains in the context of the disruptions and dysfunctions that appeared in the sphere of management. The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we used a situational crisis management approach to isolate four types of internal military food supply chains. Practical guidance concerns showing actions influencing the modification of system solutions in the military sphere in peacetime in connection with the pandemic. As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Poland applies system solutions similar to those in place in other allied countries. The results of our research can be used as recommendations for solving problems in the military food supply chain in other countries within NATO.</jats:p>"

An optimistic manager weights favorable strategies more heavily than detrimental ones, whereas a pessimistic manager does the opposite. We show that the manager’s degree of optimism is critical: above a threshold, it can cause the supplier to change the timing of its contracting and increase its profits. We also find that this threshold degree of optimism depends on the degree of product substitution: it is more stringent with imperfect substitutes than with perfect substitutes or unrelated goods.</jats:p>",

A study on the decadal spatial variation of hydrological drought behaviour over the basin was also conducted. The cross-correlation study was also performed to understand the propagation of hydrological drought in the event of meteorological drought. The results reveal a slight decrease in the spatial extent of hydrological drought over time. The correlation between meteorological and hydrological drought indices was found to be more assertive at grid locations G1 and G4. According to the findings, the strongest correlation of 0.8 in the propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought was observed at a lag of 3 months over a 12 -month timescale. Run theory reveals that the river basin is subjected to hydrological drought over 54–65% of the months in the historic period.

Cephalometric parameters (PR and LCR) were correlated with the bone supply measurement in three-dimensional CBCT scans in three different intraoral donor regions (chin, mandibular retromolar region, and zygomatic alveolar crest). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Different mean bone volumes were measured for the chin (3.10 ± 1.11 cm³ SD), the mandibular retromolar region (1.66 ± 0.54 cm³ SD), and the zygomatic alveolar crest (0.17 ± 0.04 cm³ SD). Cephalometric parameters were significantly correlated with the bone dimensions in the chin and the mandibular retromolar region (all p-values &lt; 0.05). Bone volume of the zygomatic alveolar crest exhibited no correlations with cephalometric parameters but significantly correlated with the mandibular retromolar bone volume (p &lt; 0.01). No gender-specific differences were observed with respect to bone volumes in all bone harvesting regions. However, the interforaminal distance in the chin region was significantly higher in the male population (p = 0.001). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Routine 2D radiographs can be used during the initial consultation for primary intraoral bone donor site evaluation.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding which supply chain impacts influence the policies and actions undertaken when resilience is concerned is important. This study investigated the relationships between the impacts experienced at the different supply chain tiers during the pandemic, and explored which impacts could drive perceptions towards developing resilience strategies in the future. A survey instrument was developed adopting a mid-range approach, targeting manufacturers active in the Italian grocery supply chain. Data were analysed using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that source-related impacts deeply affect make- and delivery-related impacts, and make-related impacts mainly influence the perceptions about future resilience strategies. In fact, manufacturers appear to be primarily interested in those strategies ensuring the continuity of their intrinsic operations. The study could inform theory and practice about companies’ decisions towards the adoption of certain approaches. Also, it highlights promising research avenues related to deepening understanding of how perceptions could predict future intentions to engage in protective actions to adequately cope with potential future disruptions.</jats:p>"

We proposed this form to increase robustness against demand disruption and energy productivity. Finally, we located CLSC components and assigned flow in the automotive industry. The results show that the cost of VCLSCND is less than without viable and has -0.44% gap. By increasing the conservative coefficient and confidence level, decreasing the allowed maximum energy and increasing the scale of the main model, the cost function, time solution and energy consumption grow. We suggested applying the Fix-and-Optimize algorithm for producing upper bound of large-scale. As can be seen, the gap between this algorithm and the main problem for cost, energy and time solution is approximately 6.10%, -8.28%, and 75.01%.</jats:p>"

Yet, other voices have called for ‘supply chain justice’ among governments, firms, and communities affected by the social and environmental externalities of lithium extraction. To anticipate disputes and draw a baseline for further research, this article surveys the relevant rules of international law that presently regulate major operations of the lithium industry. First, the material dimensions of lithium are transformed into a workable object of international law, focusing on viable reserves (as opposed to all proven resources) and the analytical priority of territorial jurisdiction. Second, the regulatory regimes of four States with major reserves—Chile, Australia, Argentina, and China—illustrate recurring challenges, such as incentivizing investment in value-added production and the discontent of Indigenous communities. Third, the trade and investment treaties of these States help us to map an international legal framework for the lithium industry, focusing on the World Trade Organization, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. But such treaties may be interpreted in light of a State’s obligations concerning human rights, environmental protection, and Indigenous peoples, giving legal form to the pursuit of supply chain justice in the energy transition.</jats:p>",

In order to achieve such a sustainability goal, alignment of production, distribution, and field service activities is needed. In the literature, numerous studies indicate the product–service system (PSS) approach as one of the most promising business models to combine the needs of manufacturers and customers in an efficient and effective manner. However, PSS solutions aimed at practically optimizing supply chain management have scarcely been addressed. In order to reduce this gap, the current study proposes a procedure based on the PSS Functional Matrix, the Screening Life Cycle Modelling (SLCM) method, and stock management theory to optimize aftermarket services based on market demand. A case study in the medical equipment sector, where market demand can fluctuate during the contract period, is presented. The analytical results show beneficial effects in terms of both costs and environmental impact, suggesting the need for further research to augment knowledge on PSS and supply chain management. In particular, the PSS allowed the company to customize the manufacturer’s business model, adapting the supply of aftermarket services to varying customer needs.</jats:p>"

Supply chain organizations operate in a market in today's global environment that is increasingly complex and dynamic in nature. Stable supply chains are inevitable to meet drastic changes in customer needs. Research has shown that manufacturing companies need to accelerate the shift from focus to sustainability and use technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to achieve the organization's goal. In this regard, by expanding the capabilities of the blockchain under the four main areas (1) designing incentive and tokenization mechanisms to promote green consumer behavior; (2) increase visibility throughout the product life cycle; (3) increase system efficiency while reducing development and operating costs; And (4) strengthen the monitoring of sustainability and performance reporting in supply chain networks; it can be seen that the supply chain based on these transformational technologies can play a colorful role in creating stability and a green and efficient supply chain. In this study, the potential opportunities in the IoT to create a sustainable supply chain are discussed. Also, based on this study, a framework has been proposed to show the relationships and effects of the constituent elements of a stable supply chain system based on the Internet of Things and blockchain. The conceptual framework is designed with an emphasis on sustainable development, collaboration and management and can provide a good perspective for implementing a sustainable supply chain based on technology</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the potential for Assemblage Theory to supplement current approaches to studying labor migration in law and the social sciences. Based upon a study of women's migration for garment and domestic work in India, I lay out the labor supply chain assemblage (LSCA) as a framework for understanding how workers find employment across multi-site, dynamic trajectories. Migration into temporary employment requires workers to move between jobs on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, studying labor supply chains as fluid assemblages defined by labor market conditions, component elements, and various agents provides a methodology for analyzing frequent job searches, across recruitment geographies, that include a range of recruitment actors. By accommodating temporal, territorial, and relational analysis, this approach provides insight into how labor migration processes for migrant garment and domestic workers in India articulate with the development of markets, working conditions, and social hierarchies – including on the basis of gender and caste. </jats:p>",

Five input factors have been varied with the aim of testing the response of the supply chain to different starting conditions. In order to evaluate the supply chain performance, a set of key performance indicators have been identified considering both manufacturing and logistic processes.Design/methodology/approach: A discrete event simulation model has been developed in order to reproduce the behavior of the players according to their role in the supply chain. Different supply chain configurations have been modelled to assess the performance of the solution combined with different input factors. Many scenarios have been tested with the aim of identifying suitable applications of the additive technology.Findings: in general, the decentralized configuration has better logistic performance than the centralized supply chain. In fact, it is more flexible, suitable for high service levels, and less affected by the variability of the demand. However, when the distances among players are very short and the average demand is low, the benefits in adopting a decentralized configuration are very limited.Concerning the performance of the production phase, the centralized structure allows providing a better capacity utilization, exploiting the potential of a High-cost machine with higher production camera volume and speed.Practical implications: the outcomes obtained allow deriving some useful guidelines, which could help practitioners to identify a suitable application of the additive technology.Originality/value: first, the model provides a quantitative evaluation. Moreover, the study analyzes the performance of the additive technology combined with different supply chain configurations. This is a strong point since it is well known that emerging manufacturing technologies can affect the structure and the performance of the whole supply chain. </jats:p>"

Many nations, as well as the World Health Organization, have legislation and guidelines regarding tolerable water DBPs. DBPs are pollutants most people are shielded since drinking water is frequently remedied with a chemical killing agent. The process of water production has made considerable efforts to balance the elimination of pathogens and DBP monitoring owing to the health effects of chlorinated water exposure and certain DBPs. Large surveys have been conducted on increasing health and regulatory issues. While carbohydrate DBPs containing chlorine and bromine were traditionally focused in the therapy, DBPs seem to encompass species containing halogenated and non-halogenated nitrogen DBPs. This led to an investigation to better understand the cost-effective monitoring of the broad interval of controlled and developing DBPs. This involves the employment of advanced techniques to clean up and destroy germs. This article presents some of the most recent studies on these important DBP issues. The disinfection eliminates waterborne microbes but also kills humans by drinking water with poisonous DBPs. Ultimately, chemicals are a lost cause for water treatment.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a systematic literature review of the various technical implementation aspects of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems. We apply different drivers for classifying the selected literature, such as (a) the various domains of the available blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems and relevant methodologies applied; (b) the implementation maturity of these traceability systems along with technical implementation details; and (c) the sustainability perspective (economic, environmental, social) prevalent to these implementations. We provide key takeaways regarding the open issues and challenges of current blockchain traceability implementations and fruitful future research areas. Despite the significant volume and plethora of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems, academia has so far focused on unstructured experimentation of blockchain-associated SC traceability solutions, and there is a clear need for developing and testing real-life traceability solutions, especially taking into account feasibility and cost-related SC aspects.</jats:p>"

The results revealed that the protection of cultivated land resources in the main grain-producing areas with direct means, incentives, and technological progress, significantly and positively impacted the security of grain supply. Furthermore, a mismatch was found between resource conditions and their use for grain production in the Northern region, and the lack of protection of cultivated land resources in the Southern region, which leads to the insignificant positive promotion of grain supply security.

To systematize energy-consuming entities and scale photovoltaic-based renewable energy in a distribution network, the energy-consuming behavior, energy-producing schedule, and trading strategy can be coupled. Considering the interaction between the energy-consuming behavior and the uncertainty of distributed photovoltaic output, an optimal operation method for RIES is proposed on the basis of social network theory and an uncertain evolutionary game method in this paper. From the perspective of the operator, the overall profits of RIES are maximized considering the entity characteristics of both the demand and the supply side. A case study shows that the proposed method can ensure the reasonable distribution of profit among the investment entities.

The present study examines the influence of effective grain size (d10) and standard deviation (σ) on the K value of borehole soil samples using 5.08, 10.16, and 15.24 cm diameter permeameters. A statistical grain size model was developed and the feasibility of seven empirical equations was evaluated with the measured K values. The K of soil samples increases with the increase in the d10 grain size and decreases with the increase in the σ value. Evaluation of K using empirical equations establishes that the Hazen equation shows relatively good agreement with the measured K values. The study substantiates the efficacy of the developed model as the Kmodel and Kmeasured based R2 (determination coefficient), MAE (mean absolute error), and RMSE (root mean square error) values are (0.982, 0.007, and 0.008), (0.972, 0.005, and 0.007), (0.953, 0.004, and 0.005) for 5.08, 10.16, and 15.24 cm diameter permeameters respectively. The developed model was validated by assessing its efficiency in the prediction of K values for independent soil samples. The developed model-based K accedes to the precise computation of the aquifer yield and groundwater recharge.</jats:p>",

On this basis, through numerical experiments, this paper examines the supervision sensitivity with different policies on a micro level, investigates the impact incurred by the change in governmental reward and punishment degree, and further complements the research on the complexity of the strategy selection process in reality. The results show that in the short run, regardless of the reward and punishment measure the government chooses, the manufacturers and integrators will choose not to adopt and implement the resilient supply chain strategy, while, in the long run, increasing manufacturers’ initial supervision and implementing relevant reward and punishment measures can guide integrators to choose the strategy.

The buyer suffers economic damages if a violation at a supplier is exposed (whether by the media, regulator, or nongovernmental organization). To avoid damages, the buyer may audit the network to identify noncompliance. If a supplier fails an audit, the buyer must take one of two costly actions: either rectify the supplier or drop the supplier (along with any dependent suppliers). Dropping a supplier changes the network topology, reducing competition and thereby increasing the buyer’s input cost arising from an equilibrium. We show that the buyer’s optimal dynamic auditing policy has two subphases: the buyer will first audit and drop some suppliers before either auditing and rectifying all remaining suppliers or halting auditing altogether. By halting, the buyer tolerates some noncompliance in the network (“see no evil, hear no evil”). Within the audit-and-drop subphase, when auditing only in the upper tier, the buyer always audits a least valuable unaudited supplier, yielding greater balance in the network. When the buyer audits both tiers, it might choose a supplier other than the least valuable. The buyer may choose a supplier in a pivotal position to help ascertain the viability of a portion of the network (“litmus test”). In extensions, we find that when violations in tier 1 carry a higher penalty for the buyer, the buyer may audit and rectify only tier 1 suppliers; when audits may be inaccurate, the buyer more likely tolerates a greater level of noncompliance.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The subject of this article is the supply chain management system of pharmaceu-tical industry enterprises in Ukraine. Methodology. In the course of the study, the systematic and logical approaches are mainly used. At the same time, during the study the following scientific methods were used: 1) analogy – an effective supply chain management system (hereinafter – SCM system) is defined as im-portant for enterprises of any sector of the national economy of Ukraine; 2) in-duction – significant attention is paid to the individual components and para-meters of the supply chain of the pharmaceutical industry in Ukraine; 3) generali-zation – it was found that, despite the diversity of views on the definition of SCM system, the basic idea of such a definition is identical; 4) others. The purpose of this article is to study the current state of SCM-system of pharmaceutical indus-try in Ukraine, as a key tool for its development. The results of the study show that the spread of coronavirus disease COVID-19 (hereinafter COVID-19) caused changes in the transport components of the SCM system in the enterprises of the pharmaceutical industry in Ukraine. Conclusion. The Ukrainian pharmaceutical industry is the most developed among the post-Soviet countries and has a leading position in the production of generic drugs. Thanks to the distribution of COVID-19, the industry today is the guarantor of the protection of life and health of citizens, and pharmaceutical companies receive significant profits. Giv-en today's realities, such companies continue to transform internal business pro-cesses related to the SCM system, which must first and foremost be as flexible, fast and sustainable as possible. At the same time, changes associated with the possibility of \"online\" sales of medicines can have a positive impact on the effec-tiveness of SCM system parameters in the pharmaceutical industry in Ukraine, which in the long term will lead to an increase in its profitability. However, such sales cannot fully guarantee high quality and safety of pharmaceutical products. Strict domestic legislation related to pharmaceutical industry regulation contrib-utes to unpredictable situations related to the SCM system. Proper identification of key priorities and anticipation of possible obstacles in advance will greatly re-duce their occurrence.</jats:p>"

Iodinated contrast media are the most commonly used agents, with CT requiring the largest overall quantities. Data show that these iodinated contrast media are found in sewage water, surface water and drinking water in many regions in the world. Because standard drinking water purification techniques only provide poor to moderate removal of iodinated contrast media, these substances pose a problem for drinking water preparation that has not yet been solved. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the negative environmental effects of iodinated contrast media via their breakdown products. The environmental impact of iodinated contrast media can be mitigated by measures focusing on the application of contrast media or the excretion of contrast media. Measures with respect to contrast application include reducing the utilization of contrast media, reducing the waste of contrast media and collecting residues of contrast media at the point of application. The amount of contrast media excreted into the sewage water can be decreased by introducing urine bags and/or special urine collection and waste-water processing techniques in the hospital. To tackle the problem of contrast media in the water system in its entirety, it is necessary for all parties involved to cooperate, from the producer of contrast medium to the consumer of drinking water. This paper aims to make health professionals aware of the opportunity to take the lead now in more conscious decisions regarding use of contrast media and gives an overview of the different perspectives for action.</jats:p>",

We focus on the differential pricing of new products and remanufactured products after being customized by 3D printing and the profit distribution of supply chain members. Through building the Stackelberg game model led by the manufacturer, we discuss how supply chain members should make investment decisions about customized new and customized remanufactured products with the goal of maximizing the manufacturer’s profit when there are two models of remanufacturing by the OEM and remanufacturing by the retailer. Finally, through the simulation analysis of MATLAB, we explain how the manufacturer and the retailer make decisions under the influence of customization sensitivity coefficient and customization cost. We also analyze the impact of relevant factors on the level of customization effort and whether supply chain members are suitable for custom production. We found that when the level of customization effort is relatively low, both the manufacturer and the retailer should choose the manufacturer to complete the customization process. However, when the level of customization effort is relatively high the manufacturer can transfer the customization process to the retailer, but the retailer should still let the manufacturer lead the customization process for his own profit maximization.</jats:p>"

These studies were conducted in the MatLab environment on the CPPSS models with gas turbine units and with a small-scale hydroelectric power plant. The proposed method for tuning group predictive regulators makes it possible to improve the quality control indices. The research has established that with an additional load connected, the maximum voltage dip is reduced by a factor of 3.5 compared to conventional control regulators. In addition, the time of a transient process for the generator rotor speed is decreased by a factor of 3. In the case of a short-term short circuit, predictive regulators can reduce the time of the transient process by a factor of 1.5 and the overshoot by more than 2 times. The simulation results have confirmed the efficiency of group predictive regulators when used in DG plants, i.e., improvement of the quality of control processes in various operating modes.</jats:p>"

HRT at 40 min with 0.5 mg/L AP exhibited the best removal efficiency for NOM (55.9%) and AP (53.4%) removal. Except for aluminium, other elements in river water were removed completely. The EC sludge (floating and settled) XRD spectrum showed peaks from AP were reduced, and the few peaks left were from aluminium hydroxide formed by EC. Several bonds in functional groups of AP and NOM were significantly deformed. FESEM images revealed that the sludge was highly porous material as needed for adsorption. EDAX showed that floating sludge had slightly higher carbon compared with settled sludge whereas nitrogen was higher in settled sludge. Other element concentrations in both sludges were similar, proving that water treatment was due to electro-floatation, adsorption, and sweep flocs. Single-factor ANOVA showed significant variance at HRT for NOM (F4.066 = 92.67, p = &amp;lt;0.05) and AP (F4.066 = 20.59, p = &amp;lt;0.05) removal.

Classical economists including Adam Smith narrated a price discovery process based on buyer and seller reservation values and their motivation to buy low and sell high; the classical sketch of price formation offers a quite fruitful foundation for a modern theory of price discovery, supplied below. Market experiments, based on private distributed reservation values and using rules governing open-outcry double auctions, converged endogenously, in three to four periods of repeat interaction, to an efficient outcome. These observations contradicted the widely believed thought and taught necessity for perfect information, large numbers, and price-taking behavior. However, these results were consistent with the old classical conception of price formation emerging from the collective interaction of the traders. Aggregation and price discovery constitute essential functions of classical markets. We explore the divergence of neoclassical scholars from this classical tradition. Revealingly, in describing the microdynamics of market price formation, prominent neoclassical utilitarians such as Marshall, with his description of a “corn-market in a county town,” and Böhm-Bawerk with his farmers’ horse market, reverted to this classical reservation-value framework.</jats:p>",

First, database and keywords are selected, with the aim to search and collect the main papers, dealing with the integration of production, inventory, distribution activities in perishable supply chains. Then, a bibliometric analysis is carried out, to detect: the main publishing sources, the chronological distribution, the most used keywords, the featured authors, about the selected papers. A five-dimension classification framework is proposed to carry out a content analysis, where the papers of the literature review are classified and discussed, according to: supply chain structure, objective, perishability issues, solution approach, approach validation. Findings: Interest in the application of optimization models for integrated decision-making along perishable supply chains is strongly growing. Integrating multiple stages of the supply chain into a single framework is complex, especially when referring to perishable products. The vast majority of the problems addressed are then NP-Hard. Only a limited quantity of the selected papers aims to solve real-life case studies. There is a need for further research, which is capable of modeling and quantitatively improving existing supply chains. The potentials of Industry 4.0 are currently little explored.  Originality/value: Based on the analysis of the papers published, this article outlines the current state of the art on the optimization strategies for the integrated management of perishable supply chains, which are very complex to be managed. Research trends and gaps are discussed, future challenges are presented. </jats:p>"

The resiliency of supply chain in food sector was studied and accordingly related literature reviewed. Indian supply chain challenges are unique in nature due to its bio-diversity and geographic location. The methodology adopted to study this resiliency of Indian food supply chain was through available literature review, and study of data related to food supply chain. The resiliency of food supply chain was identified based on the results of price stabilization over period of time and availability of supplies during succeeding stages of Covid 19 pandemic. The synchronization of activities involved in SCM to create value for the customers through options like information reliability, Quality standard checkpoints, transportation flexibility, adoption of technology etc. were proposed.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. This paper investigates the impact of flooding on water supply and sanitation conditions together with flood-induced health problems on the Barotse floodplain in Zambia. The study also explored rural response measures and adaptation strategies. This study relied on intensive field investigation in May 2021 where 99 households from different villages in the floodplain were randomly sampled to participate in a questionnaire survey. Key informants, including government officials from the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Local Government and Housing, were also interviewed. The findings showed that water supply and sanitation conditions are severely interrupted during flood periods, and this leads to various waterborne diseases. The findings further revealed that all pit latrines in the study area become submerged and therefore unsafe to use. Adaptation measures include boiling water before use and water disinfection using chlorine. Other, adaptive measures noted in the study area include open water defecation due to inundation of toilets, which further contaminates drinking water supplies.Based on the findings, the researchers propose that the government and other stakeholders should prioritise flood-proof water and sanitation facilities in the study area in order to improve the health of the rural community during floods.</jats:p>"

This study applied the cost-effective and time-saving techniques of remote sensing and GIS to delineate the groundwater recharge potential in the Al-Sarhan Basin, located in arid and semiarid regions of Jordan, by following the weighted linear combination method. The results revealed three distinct groundwater potential recharge zones (low, moderate, and high potential zones). High to moderate groundwater recharge potential zones occupied 75% of the Al-Sarhan area with considerable artificial recharge capacity because of the suitable geology, soil texture, drainage density, and flat terrain conditions. The maps produced also depicted that 25% of the Al-Sarhan area possesses low groundwater recharging potential. The model further revealed that 93% of the wells in the study area were located in potential groundwater recharge zones.</jats:p>",

The estimation of AET is crucial for water resources management involving the allocation of water for different land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The study's novelty was mapping pixel-by-pixel spatial variations of bulk surface resistance and evaluating the derived actual evapotranspiration in a sub-humid tropical river basin where flux tower data was lacking for validation. This study aimed to map bulk surface resistance and evaluate the estimated AET by global evapotranspiration data product (MOD16A2). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products, including land surface reflectance (LSR), land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI) data, were used as input in MATLAB for mapping pixel-wise variations to analyze the seasonal variations in bulk surface resistance (rs) and AET in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons during the years 2019 and 2012. The years 2019 and 2012 were selected because 2019 experienced a relatively wet pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, whereas 2012 experienced the opposite conditions, which proved useful when interpreting variations that are influenced by wetness conditions. Overall, the results indicated significant variability in the rs and AET for different LULC classes. MOD16A2 AET was determined to be slightly higher than the LULC classes' estimated AET. This study's MODIS satellite data products provided information on surface characteristics at a reasonable resolution. This permitted the identification of differences in LULC classes and changes in surface characteristics by season and wetness conditions, which are helpful when estimating AET.</jats:p>",

Fourteen influential factors associated with topography, geology and meteorological concerns were applied for this study. Weights for factors and sub-factors within a factor were calculated based on pairwise comparisons. The groundwater potential zones were delineated through GIS-based weighted overlays of factor maps. According to the pairwise comparison, the consistency ratios for factors and sub-factors were within the allowable range (i.e., less than 0.10). General soil type (eigenvalue 0.17), geology (eigenvalue 0.16), and geomorphology (eigenvalue 0.15) were the most important factors in determining groundwater potential zoning. The groundwater potential index has maximum and minimum values of 45.99 and 10.34, respectively. According to the groundwater potential map, relatively higher groundwater potential zones were found in the southern parts of Bangladesh and along major rivers. The study's findings will be useful to government authorities in making evidence-based decisions about national water policy and planning.</jats:p>",

Then, the scheduling instruction optimization model, which considers the system intermittent production conditions and the feedback optimization mechanism, was proposed to reduce the system cooling water overflow and smooth the high cistern level fluctuations. And an adaptive operation scheme optimization model of pumping station based on scheduling instructions was proposed to minimize the total shaft power of pumping station.

Energy sustainability will require a reduction in energy consumption, including embedded energy consumption in sectoral demand and supply chains.

Furthermore, the inter-and intra-sectoral energy linkages are understudied. This study quantifies China’s FFEDS, the world’s largest energy consumer. According to the findings, the highest levels of coal, natural gas, and petroleum consumption (CNGPC) are embedded in the construction sector’s input demand. “Electricity and steam production and supply” total intermediate exports (internal plus inter-sectoral) stimulated the highest coal consumption. “Crude petroleum products and natural gas products” and “railway freight transport” aggregate supplies induced the highest volume of natural gas and petroleum consumption. Compared to intra-sectoral demand, inter-sectoral demand stimulated significantly larger CNGPCs. In contrast, CNGPC’s inter- and inter-sectoral supplies were nearly identical. Modifying current carbon taxation and credit mechanisms to include energy embedded in demand and supply can help to achieve SDG 7.</jats:p>"

Compensation of voltage drops is carried out by continuously measuring the catenary voltage and injecting the current into the catenary if the voltage decreases below a preset value. The effectiveness of such a solution was evaluated by the analysis of numerous experimental recordings, both from the buffer station itself and from trolleybuses in operation.

Service innovation was used as the independent variable to ascertain the nature and strength of the relationship of its dimensions which were selected to be technological innovation, and service process innovation, and their relationship with customer satisfaction. In a bid to give the study a bearing and focus, two research questions and hypotheses were drawn from the variables, which sought to ascertain the relationship between the two dimensions of service innovation used in the study and customer satisfaction. The study was further grounded in the theory of assimilation, which is focused on the cognitive variations and dissonance experienced by customers after the consumption of a service, as a result of their pre-service encounter expectation and their actual service experience. The study thereby launched and distributed questionnaires to a total of 170 respondents from transportation firms in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State of Nigeria, and successfully retrieved a total of 160 questionnaires, which formed the basis of the data analysis and findings of the research study. The data was analyzed using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient method as a means of ascertaining the nature and strength of the relationship between the two variables. The findings of the study pointed to a significant positive relationship between the two variables, and informed the study to recommend that: firms should strive to innovate on their service to match the dynamic needs of the customers; and firms should constantly improve on the service processes to become more efficient and effective</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>How to locate the reasonable targets for carbon emission reduction in the complex global supply chain remains a big challenge for policy makers. This paper proposed a novel framework for finding more accurate carbon emission reduction targets, combining multi-regional input-output analysis, complex network approach and an improved susceptible–infective model called the influence spreading model. The results showed that the global embodied carbon emission flow network had the characteristic of being significantly scale-free, and there were a few important industrial sectors in the network with different capabilities, including strength-out, closeness-out, betweenness and clustering coefficient. The simulation results of the influence spreading process showed that the effective infection thresholds were relatively low, which were between 0 and 0.005 due to the significant scale-free characteristic of the global embodied carbon emission flow network. With the change of the infection thresholds, the proportion of the infected sectors significantly decreased from about 0.95 to 0.10 on average, and spread time also decreased from about three rounds to about eight rounds. In the aspects of the spreading scope and spreading speed, the industrial sectors with high closeness-out and betweenness had better performance than the ones with high strength-out. This indicated that the spreading capabilities of industrial sectors which exported significant carbon emissions, such as petroleum, chemicals and non-metallic mineral products in China, were commonly weaker than industrial sectors which occupied the most important positions in the entire supply chain, such as transport equipment in Germany. Hence, the industrial sectors with high global spreading capability and media capability were important for global carbon emission reduction. Such information suggested that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be made based on a global perspective of the supply chain system. This work proved that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be based on a global perspective of supply chain system.</jats:p>"

To cope with future disruptions or epidemic outbreaks, supply chain resilience should be improved based on lessons learnt from the impacts of COVID-19 to improve supply chain resilience and facilitate the corresponding competences and skills to implement strategic changes. Method: Applying the dynamic managerial capabilities theory lens, an integrative review is conducted focused on (1) the multiple impacts of COVID-19 on the supply chain resilience, (2) multiple strategies to enhance supply chain resilience, and (3) competences needed to implement the strategic changes successfully. Result: During COVID-19, supply chains could not handle supply and demand shocks, which led to a disrupted state of supply chains. To reduce the impacts of the subsequent disruptions, companies should implement specific strategic changes and increase complementary skills and competences levels. A proposed framework indicates which skills and competences need to be developed to implement a strategic change. Conclusion: Companies must shift their focus from (cost) efficiency to creating more resilient supply chains. Additionally, purchasing professionals should develop their skills and competences accordingly to cope with future disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chains of Polish clothing companies. The aim of the article is to present the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chains of Polish clothing companies, in both the short and long-term, and in the context of sustainable development. The author has been conducting research on logistics and production processes as well as supply chains of Polish clothing companies since 2017. The research results presented in this article on the impact of the pandemic on the functioning of supply chains in this sector of the economy were carried out in 2021. The author conducted telephone interviews with the management of Polish clothing companies of all sizes, both with distributors and producers. She identified disruptions in the supply chains caused by the pandemic (on the supply, production and distribution). She outlined the short-term actions of companies in response to disruptions, as well as long-term changes related to the logistics strategy as a result of the pandemic. The author also presented the ecological and social effects of changes in logistics strategies caused by the pandemic. So far, there has been no research in this industry and this area concerning not only the short-term impact of the pandemic, but also the strategic changes and their impact on sustainable development. Thus, it is a study that fills the existing research gap. The pandemic particularly affected the distribution of clothing, which caused the dynamic development of e-commerce. Because of this, some clothing companies have changed the organization of deliveries to online customers, such as the example presented by the author of the largest Polish clothing company, LPP S.A. The pandemic in apparel companies has also disrupted production and supply. This was especially true for deliveries from countries with low production costs. Despite these disruptions, however, no mass withdrawal from the production of clothing in low-cost countries to Poland has been observed and, according to the surveyed companies, this will not be a long-term consequence of the pandemic. However, if factors that occurred during a pandemic worsen, this could favor the shifting of more production from low-cost countries to local or regional sewing plants. This would enable the application of the Quick Response strategy. Other disruptions that occurred in connection with the pandemic include a reduction in the number of orders for Polish sewing factories, an increase in the prices of materials and packaging, an increase in transport costs and a periodic increase in inventory levels as a reaction of some companies to the disruptions. The disruptions also caused, in some cases, greater volatility in the relationship between individual links in the supply chains, which perhaps will be the next strategic change.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the performance evaluation of an urban WDN using fuzzy logic-based aggregation of reliability, resilience, and vulnerability indices. To assess the individual performance indicators, this study advocates the pressure-dependent analysis (PDA) for hydraulic simulation. Furthermore, it advocates a fuzzy rule-based aggregated performance index (API) that will deliver the outcome in linguistic form and help the decision-maker to prioritize the maintenance of the WDN. The proposed method is illustrated with the help of a real-time WDN for part of Dire Dawa city in Ethiopia. It has been found that the API values for this network are 0.721 and 0.624, respectively, under normal and abnormal conditions, which are just satisfactory. It has been noticed that nodes J4, J44, J47, and J49 are critical from the overall low API. Efforts should be made to improve the hydraulic and residual chlorine conditions at these nodes to increase the API. It is felt that such a methodology will help the decision-makers to improve the performance of an existing urban WDN.</jats:p>",

In addition to the total discharge, the discharge separation between the floodplain and main channel was modeled and predicted. The parameters of relative roughness coefficient, the relative area of flow cross-section, relative hydraulic radius, bed slope, the relative width of water surface, relative depth, convergence or divergence angle, relative longitudinal distance as inputs, and discharge were considered as models output. The results demonstrated that the statistical indices of MARS, GMDH, and MLPNN models in the testing stage are R2 = 0.962(RMSE = 0.003), 0.930(RMSE = 0.004), and 0.933(RMSE = 0.004) respectively. Examination of statistical error indices shows that all the developed models have the appropriate accuracy to estimate the flow discharge in CCNPF. Examination of the structure of developed GMDH and MARS models demonstrated that the relative parameters: roughness, area, hydraulic radius, flow aspect ratio, depth, and angle of convergence or divergence of floodplain have the greatest impact on modeling and estimation of discharge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>В настоящее время картофелеводство России особенно остро испытывает отрицательное влияние неблагоприятных погодных условий, связанных с глобальными климатическими изменениями. Многолетние наблюдения погодных явлений в Московском регионе показали устойчивое повышение суммы положительных температур и усиление неравномерности выпадения осадков. Ввиду того, что влажность почвы – один из основных факторов, определяющих урожайность картофеля и его качество, то для стабильного влагообеспечения растений при отклонении погодных факторов от нормальных значений необходимо создать условия для накопления влаги, удержания ее в корнеобитаемом слое и беспрепятственного распространения корневой системы внутри почвенного горизонта. Применение тяжелых энергонасыщенных агрегатов при реализации интенсивных технологий возделывания картофеля приводит к нарушению естественного сложения почвы и существенному ухудшению режима влагообеспечения его корневой системы, а при длительном отсутствии осадков переуплотнение способствует перегреву почвы на глубину более 50 см, которое ведет к дополнительному иссушению корнеобитаемого слоя. С целью оптимизации режима влагообеспечения растений возникает необходимость совершенствования механизированных технологических приемов, применяемых при возделывании картофеля, направленных на повышение устойчивости растений к стрессам от действия климатических факторов. Для снижения отрицательного влияния последствий глобального изменения климата необходимо использовать биологизированную технологию подготовки почвы, направленную на насыщение верхнего слоя почвы растительными остатками сидеральных культур, совершенствовать технологический процесс функционирования картофелепосадочных агрегатов, устранять уплотненные зоны в междурядьях путем применения пропашных культиваторов-глубокорыхлителей непосредственно сразу после прохода посадочной машины с поделкой лунок по следу глубокорыхлительных лап. Свободное развитие корней растений на значительную глубину обеспечивает устойчивость к стрессам, обусловленным отклонениями климатических условий от нормальных значений. Применение предлагаемых усовершенствований технологии возделывания картофеля возможно реализовать в различных почвенно-климатических условиях. Это позволит минимизировать последствия глобального изменения климата и обеспечить стабильность производства в различных регионах возделывания картофеля.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>At present, potato growing in Russia is particularly acutely affected by adverse weather conditions associated with global climate change. Long-term observations of weather phenomena in the Moscow region have shown a steady increase in the sum of positive temperatures and an increase in the unevenness of precipitation. Due to the fact that soil moisture is one of the main factors determining potato yield and its quality, in order to ensure stable moisture supply to plants when weather factors deviate from normal values, it is necessary to create conditions for the accumulation of moisture, its retention in the root layer and the unhindered spread of the root system inside the soil horizon. The use of heavy energy-saturated aggregates in the implementation of intensive potato cultivation technologies leads to a violation of the natural composition of the soil and a significant deterioration of the moisture supply regime of its root system, and in the long absence of precipitation, over-compaction leads to overheating of the soil to a depth of more than 50 cm, which leads to additional drying of the root layer. In order to optimize the moisture supply regime of plants, there is a need to improve mechanized technological techniques used in potato cultivation, aimed at increasing plant resistance to stress from the action of climatic factors. To reduce the negative impact of the consequences of global climate change, it is necessary to use biologized soil preparation technology aimed at saturating the upper soil layer with plant residues of sideral crops, to improve the technological process of potato planting units, to eliminate compacted zones in the aisles by using row cultivators-deep-diggers immediately after the passage of the planting machine with diy holes in the wake of deep-diggers. The free development of plant roots to a considerable depth provides resistance to stresses caused by deviations of climatic conditions from normal values. The application of the proposed improvements in potato cultivation technology can be implemented in various soil and climatic conditions. This will minimize the effects of global climate change and ensure the stability of production in various regions of potato cultivation.</jats:p>",

To this purpose, the WEAP-QUAL2 K linked model was developed to simulate water quality and quantity, which is dynamically coupled to a fuzzy multi-objective imperialist competition algorithm (FMOICA). The approach's applicability is demonstrated through the case study of the Dez reservoir river in Iran. The simulation and optimization period used was six years (October 2019-September 2025). Stochastic models (SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)) were used to forecast inflow into the Dez dam reservoir for the simulation period. Given that in the verification stage of the QUAL2 K and WEAP model it was concluded that the model has high accuracy in simulating the parameters of water quality and quantity, two scenarios were considered: the first scenario was used for dynamic coupling of the quantity-quality model (reference scenario), and the second was the fuzzy optimization of a linked model (optimal scenario). The results show that average water supply reliability increased from 86.13% in the reference scenario to 95.76% in the optimal scenario. Also, under the optimal scenario, the river water quality improves. It was also found that environmental flow rate demands of the river are fully supplied in different months.</jats:p>",

We provide evidence that Alevi Muslims have more gender-equal views regarding the role of women in the labor market and consider themselves as more modern. Both Sunnis and Alevis consider themselves as believers in religion (Islam). However, Sunnis are more likely to abide by the rules of religion.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Karachi Electric Supply Company (K.E.S.C.) is one of the most recently privatized companies in Pakistan. Since its privatization in 2005, it has been in the phase of bringing about many changes; re-branding and revitalizing with the introduction of new concepts such as integrated business centers (IBCs), which are one window solution for customers. K.E.S.C. has come up with new business strategies and a customer-oriented outlook with greater emphasis on employee performance. \nThe objective of this research was to investigate the effects of privatization on the employee performance of Karachi Electric Supply Company (K.E.S.C) and find out the changes in the overall employee performance. For this purpose, research was conducted from the employees of K.E.S.C. The variables identified through the literature review were commitment, organizational change, communication, training and development, financial benefits, and job security. The research aimed at finding out what changes have been taken place in these factors after privatization and what were the impacts of those changes on the overall performance of the employees.\nIn order to investigate the variables, a detailed study was carried out. Both; employees and the employers’ perspectives regarding the performance changes were investigated. For this purpose, employees belonging to the middle-level management of K.E.S.C. working at IBC’s since the pre-privatization era was chosen, as the major change was implemented in these units of K.E.S.C. primarily.  \nApart from surveys, 3 interviews of management working at integrated business units of K.E.S.C. were also conducted as they have direct interaction with the employees and played important role in managing and implementing change.  \nThe results of the study revealed that change in the employees’ performance was viewed by employees as positive and significant and supplement this point with extensive training and development programs, new performance management system, organizational restructuring, amplified remuneration package, enhanced communication, and betterment of the working environment.\nKeeping in view the perspective of the management and the employees on the change after privatization, the research study concludes that though K.E.S.C’s management carried out the change program in a proper and organized manner, by considering several critical factors for its successful implementation, there were still a few gaps observed with respect to job security and communication that in the end lead to employees’ dissatisfaction and reservations with the change process. These gaps are highlighted in the recommendations and this study believes that if K.E.S.C’s management includes them in their future plans, then it can bring more productivity and efficiency in the performance of the employees.\n \n \n </jats:p>"

A comparison between the experimental and numerical results showed that the  ϑ2¯−f model had the best agreement out of the investigated turbulence models. The numerical results showed that the size of the array had a great impact both on near-field development and on the conditions in the occupied zone. A larger array with multiple rows and a lower momentum conserved the inlet temperature and the mean age of the air better than a single-row array with a higher momentum. A larger array with multiple rows had a higher IAQ and a greater heat removal effectiveness in the occupied zone because the larger array conserved the mean age of air better and the buoyancy driven flow was slightly better at removing the heat. Because of the lower inlet velocities, they also had lower velocities at ankle level, which decreased the risk of draft and thermal discomfort.</jats:p>"

The poor rainfall seasons record nearly half of the best rainfall seasons. Abstraction and water levels in Becho plain are in the region of 25,000 m3/day and 10 meters, respectively. But these are each less than ten folds of that in the adjacent Akaki basin. Steady and transient state groundwater flow modelling of a basin hosting the Becho and Akaki catchments showed that the former is nearly in steady state while the latter is under excessive mining. Time series of well water level measurements, base flow separation and transient groundwater flow modeling suggest that the Becho plain has potential for motorized irrigation and ground water development under regulated situations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The uncertainty environment brought about by COVID-19 has broken the original stable hierarchical network structure and the whole supply and demand system of the tourism supply chain (TSC), which has brought heavy losses to the tourism industry. Using the case research and consensual qualitative research (CQR) method, taking the real situation and perception of individual supply chain members as a window, supplemented by the narrative insertion of Lijiang Yulong Tourism Co., Ltd., Lijiang Old Town and Yulong Snow Mountain scenic areas, the general laws of the vulnerability and resilience of the TSC were glimpsed. The results show that there are vulnerability factors in the TSC including the supply side, demand side, government side, destination economic structure and supply chain attributes, which lead to the interruption and damage of the TSC after the outbreak of the pandemic. At the same time, China’s overall economic environment, tourism demand side, supply side, government side and market participants all have resilience elements. Behind the vulnerability, there is a power of recovery and opportunities for innovation and change. The TSC shows a trend of restorative growth. Theoretically, it helps to enrich theories of TSC and supply chain management under an emergency crisis. In practice, the response behavior of participants at different levels of the supply chain is also the basis for TSC risk management and formulation of optimization strategies in the future, which helps tourism sustainable development in the uncertain environment.</jats:p>"

In the present study, drivers as well as barriers of the agriculture sustainable supply chain are identified and ranked with the help of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. We identify six drivers and seven barriers with the help of experts’ opinions in the field and apply ranking methods including TOPSIS-AHP, AHP, and COPRAS-AHP as well as Borda rule and Copeland method to merge the ratings. The results highlight that the economic dimension of sustainability is more important than the environmental and social dimension. Distrust of consumers, lack of understanding and awareness of managers, and performance appraisal problems were found to be the most important barriers. Furthermore, informing the community by the media, entering the global market, exporting products, and producing sustainable products as a competitive advantage were identified to be the most important drivers. The study also shows that public awareness and demands can push the food supply chains toward sustainability goals with the cooperation of governments and suppliers.</jats:p>",

Additionally, a comparative study of the experimental results from manned and unmanned shelters has been missing. In this paper, we experimented in thermal environments of manned/unmanned shelter under different air supply conditions. The experiment was divided into cooled, ventilated, and heated trials analyzing three aspects: (1) The average temperature distributions of walls, air inlet points, air outlet points, and surfaces were measured over time under different conditions in an unmanned shelter. The temperature distribution curve was fitted into the function. (2) Based on different working conditions, the temperature distribution experiments were carried out in three different areas for subjects wearing short or long clothing respectively. (3) The wind speed was measured at each measuring point in the air supply pipeline under different working conditions. The wind speed distribution was detected on the setting surfaces. The experimental results show that: (1) The air does not gradually tend to steady state with the time, and under different conditions, the air temperature obviously differs. (2) The clothing selection, air supply conditions, and locations of measuring points have significant influences on human body temperature distribution and left–right difference. (3) The mixing of the thermal plume caused by the vertical temperature difference of the human body and the jet generated by the mechanical air supply will reduce the wind speed of the airflow in the cabin, the adsorption of the jet to the bulkhead, and the stability of the airflow. The experimental data can provide the initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of the shelter. The results can provide a reference for the study of fluid control methods, the setting of thermal boundary conditions, and the simulation of the influence of thermal plumes on the airflow distribution. The experimental study in this paper has filled in the blanks regarding experimental study in electronic radar shelters. It has important research value and practical significance.</jats:p>"

Due to this context, companies have sought to create environmentally sustainable alternatives for products and processes, once exposed to government, market, and regulatory pressures. Given this scenario, the question of this study is presented: Is it possible to define a conceptual model from existing models in the literature that guides companies in their Integrated Product Development Process (IPDP) and is oriented by Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM)? To answer the research problem question, a preliminary model integrating the IPDP and GSCM themes was presented. The elaboration of the preliminary model was only possible from the systematic literature review and content analysis previously carried out and presented in the general data in this article. The general aim of the study is to present a preliminary model in which IPDP is oriented to GSCM. As specific objectives, this study intends to present models previously published that have some relation to the IPDP related to green design, green purchase, green manufacturing, green distribution, and reverse logistics, which are related to GSCM; in addition, it presents guidelines to integrate the stages of product development and GSCM to reduce the environmental impact. The contribution of the preliminary model for companies is to present criteria that reduce the environmental impact of products in different GSCM activities within the IPDP. The contribution of this study is to present an analysis of the existing models, which will be the basis for the development of a conceptual model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The miniaturization and modularization of production capacity brings with it not only greater agility and efficiency, but also increased flexibility in the form of mobility. This flexibility allows production capacity to be moved when and where it is most needed, generating new business opportunities, e.g., allowing modular units to be rented, leased, or shared. This flexibility, however, requires information and control systems that ensure a correct and secure flow of information between different stakeholders of the supply chain. Based on this, the present article characterizes the concept of software-defined mobile supply chains, presenting its main requirements, opportunities, and limitations. In addition, we present two case studies in which the proposed concept is evaluated in order to demonstrate its applicability. Here, due to the new optimization problems that arise when considering mobile facilities, special interest is given to the planning and control of the required operations, as well as the difficulties associated with the exchange of physical and intellectual assets between different stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Due to its thermal insulation characteristics, this article studies the application of rotary kiln in supply chain logistics transportation. The main research focus of this paper is the thermal simulation model of rotary kiln and intelligent supply chain logistics transportation monitoring management. This paper analyzes the rotary kiln and its parameters and then designs a thermal simulation model of the rotary kiln. Then this article also combines the relationship between logistics and supply chain, studies the characteristics of supply chain, summarizes and designs a new type of smart supply chain logistics transportation method, and then applies the rotary kiln thermal simulation model to this new type of transportation method. In order to optimize its transportation efficiency and thermal insulation degree, this paper designs the supply chain optimization experiment and the rotary kiln simulation thermal numerical optimization experiment. This article also carries out the overall efficiency analysis of logistics based on DEA and analyzes the results of the experiment and applies it to the intelligent supply chain logistics transportation method of the thermal simulation model of the rotary kiln and compares this new type of transportation method with the traditional transportation method. The experimental results show that the intelligent supply chain transportation method based on the thermal simulation model of the rotary kiln improves the insulation effect by 5%–9% compared with the traditional transportation method. Compared with the traditional transportation method, the transportation efficiency of the smart supply chain transportation method based on the thermal simulation model of the rotary kiln has increased by 4%–8%.</jats:p>",

This scheme provides a fully adaptive power supply system for biofuels and their mixtures depending on the load-speed indicators and operating modes. The selection of circuit components is carried out. A linear algorithm for writing a control program for the engine power system has been developed, which ensures its energy efficiency and efficiency of the machine-tractor unit. During the operation of the machine-tractor unit there is a constant change of thermal, loading and speed modes. Internal combustion engines during operation usually operate in unstable modes – start, warm up, acceleration, braking, increase and decrease the load, stop. There is a need to develop a method of controlling the work processes of the diesel engine for its operation on a mixture of BF and PSU with electronic control of the fuel mixture depending on the operating modes. Engines are dynamically asymmetrical objects, ie the processes that take place when increasing and decreasing the load on the crankshaft, when starting and stopping the engine, differ from each other. The development of the algorithm for controlling the working processes of the diesel engine when working on a mixture of BF and PSU with electronic control of the fuel mixture depending on the operating modes of the engine will differ. Technical parameters of the diesel engine and power supply system that must be controlled during operation: torque, crankshaft speed, power, coolant temperature, PSU temperature, percentage of fuel mixture. Fuel consumption refers to economic indicators, to environmental – the composition and amount of harmful emissions. The value of these indicators directly depends on the modes of operation.</jats:p>",

In view of the long duration, strong demand urgency, and relatively limited transportation capacity after catastrophic events, this paper proposes a round-trip emergency supply distribution model based on nonfixed routes. This model includes two main features: (1) round trip: emergency vehicles can travel back and forth to distribute supplies; (2) unfixed routes: distribution routes of the same emergency vehicle could be variable in different trips. In order to ensure the timeliness and fairness of the supply distribution scheme, the model objective function is set to minimize the total supplies’ waiting time at all demand points. According to model features, 4 constraints are set, including flow balance, capacity, vehicle scheduling, and time window. On this basis, a compound algorithm combining 2-opt and tabu search is designed to obtain the optimal plan of the model. To verify the effectiveness and superiority of the model and solution method, a case study based on the Sioux Falls network is carried out. Compared with the traditional method, the objective function is optimized by 11.92%. In fact, under the control of multiple constraint conditions, the model well fits the actual application scenarios, which can provide theoretical guidance and decision support for the distribution of relevant emergency supplies.</jats:p>",

In the leading research, a model for decision-making within the supply chain has been developed for purchasing based on shared value creation, long-term relationship management, and purchasing strategies. The research consists of two strategic mathematical models, using goal programming, and then is solved by a meta-heuristic algorithm. Potential outsourcing companies are assessed and then clustered according to their geographic locations in the decision-making process. One (or several) cluster(s) was selected among clusters based on knowledge and relationship criteria. Besides, in the primary mathematical model, the orders in different periods and the selection of suppliers are determined. In this model, in addition to optimizing the cost, the dispersion of purchases from suppliers is maximized to increase relationships and strengthen all members of the cluster. Maximizing the distribution by converting a secondary objective function to goal-programming variables transforms the multi-objective model into a single-objective model. In addition to economic benefits for buyers and suppliers, this purchasing plan concentrates on strengthening the local industrial cluster, fostering employment and ease of recruitment for human resources, accessing more infrastructures and technical support facilities, developing an education system in the region, and assisting knowledge-based enterprises with development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study considers a two-stage supply chain (SC) consisting of a single supplier and a manufacturer. When the manufacturer introduces a new product to the market, both the manufacturer and supplier should install production capacity in advance. Since capacity building often takes a long time, the demand is uncertain at the time of capacity decision making. The supplier often makes a conservative decision on capacity building to avoid possible capital risks due to excess capacity, which leads to the so-called double marginalization problem. Various risk-sharing supply contracts have recently been studied in academia to overcome the double marginalization problem. However, most existing studies ignore the bargaining power of each SC member and capacity investment. This study aims to fill the research gap by including capacity investment and bargaining power in the supply contract process. A capacity cost-sharing (CCS) contract is introduced in which the manufacturer shares the supplier’s capacity investment risk. We investigate how to set the contract parameters in the CCS contract to coordinate the supply chain. It is found that the wholesale price and manufacturer’s CCS ratio are negatively proportional to each other, and the manufacturer’s expected profit increases as the CCS ratio (wholesale price) increases (decreases) in the coordinated CCS contract. We show that there exists a CCS contract leading to a coordinated supply chain for a specific range of bargaining power. We also present a new CCS contract for a supply chain with a risk-averse supplier. A numerical illustration is provided to clarify how the contract parameters are determined and to examine the effect of the contract parameters on SC performance. Managerial implications and possible future work are discussed.</jats:p>"

Both horizontal and vertical ground heat exchangers (GHE) were investigated in respect to the load profiles of the consumers, depending on dimension as well as location. The selected base case represents a LTDH network near Stuttgart (Germany). The corresponding results of an annual simulation show that a horizontal GHE is suitable for pure heat supply and can reduce costs by up to 12% compared to a vertical system. This economic advantage remains when the cooling demand is considered. Subsequently, a variation of the system location was carried out. It is shown that horizontal GHEs operate more economically in northern regions, whereas vertical ones are more advantageous in regions with increased cooling demand. For both cases, possible savings of between 3.0% and 4.2% resulted from the simulations. The heating-to-cooling demand ratio was used as a first decision criteria to weigh-up between the two systems. Vertical GHEs were more economical than horizontal systems as soon as the ratio dropped below 1.5.</jats:p>"

Using panel data, we estimate the effects of transitions between key institutional states with different degrees of activation on reservation wages (RWs). We show that RWs react to activation: the transition from gainful employment to unemployment benefit receipt leads to an average decrease of 3.1% in RWs. The transition from gainful employment to welfare benefit receipt—an institutional state with far more rigorous activation—leads to a stronger decrease of 4.9%. Mediation analyses show that the income associated with different institutional states is the predominant mechanism that drives the effect on RWs. However, subjective social status also partly mediates the effect. Implications of these findings for active labor market policies are discussed.</jats:p>",

Networks designed as constant water supply (CWS) operated as IWS hinder a safe and reliable water supply; thus, feasible alternatives to return the operation to CWS are required. This paper presents a methodology based flow/pressure control to accomplish an efficient transformation from an IWS sector to a CWS in the City of Chihuahua, Mexico. The management of pressure at sector entrance and critical supply points leads to successful improvement of service, ensuring water availability with adequate pressure at the peak of demand, as well as reducing the supply of water volume by 58% compared to the sector operated in IWS. The methodology allowed the improvement of decision-making and operating policy for the water operating agency (WOA), fixing service deficiency, avoiding the loss of water volumes, and maintaining competent management control. Nonetheless, resistance to the transition of using automation and setting the volume/pressure consumption based on reliable data persists. The change process will be successful to the extent that the WOA efficiently channels the participation of the personnel.</jats:p>",

In total, 46 sows were fed one of four treatments with increasing inclusion of SBP with dietary fiber (DF) levels of 119, 152, 185, and 217 g/kg; sows were assigned to one of three feeding strategies (FS; high, medium, and low) depending on BF thickness at mating and again at day 30 for the following month. On days 0, 30, 60, and 108, body weight (BW) and BF thickness were measured, and body pools of protein and fat were estimated using the deuterium technique. On days 30 and 60, urine, feces, and blood samples were collected to quantify metabolites, energy, and N balances. On days 15 and 45, heart rates were recorded to estimate the heat production. At farrowing, total born and weight of the litter were recorded. In early gestation, BW gain (P &amp;lt; 0.01) and body protein retention increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) with increasing fiber inclusion, while body fat retention increased numerically by 59%. Increase in BF was the greatest for sows fed the high FS, intermediate when fed the medium strategy, and negligible for sows fed the lowest FS. N intake, N loss in feces, and N balance increased linearly, whereas N loss in urine tended to decrease with increasing inclusion of fibers in early gestation. Concomitantly, fecal energy output and energy lost as methane increased linearly (P &amp;lt; 0.001), while energy output in urine declined linearly, and total metabolizable energy intake, therefore, increased from 40.5 MJ ME/d in the low-fiber group to 43.5 mega joule (MJ) metabolizable energy (ME)/d in the high-fiber group (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Changing the metabolizable energy toward more ketogenic energy was expected to favor fat retention rather than protein retention. However, due to increased intake of metabolizable energy and increased N efficiency with increasing fiber inclusion, the sows gained more weight and protein with increasing fiber inclusion. In conclusion, increased feed intake improved both fat and protein retention, whereas increased DF concentration increased protein retention.</jats:p>",

Bangladesh is an emerging economy and wood industry of Bangladesh is suffering from severe sustainability issues besides its growth. Hence, this article aims to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainability in the Bangladeshi wood industry, which is crucial to help supply chain managers engage in achieving sustainable development goals. This research investigated the CSFs and uncovered their interdependencies through the development of a methodology integrating a literature review, principal component analysis (PCA), interpretive structural modelling (ISM), and Matriced Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee aunClassement (MICMAC) techniques. PCA (n = 150) was used to identify and rank the CSFs for sustainability in the Bangladeshi wood industry while ISM (n = 9) and MICMAC were used to determine the driving and dependence power of the CSFs. The findings reveal that research and development, supplier relations, and using eco-friendly technology are the most significant CSFs of the Bangladeshi wood industry. Indispensable links revealing the driving and dependence power among the CSFs were also reported. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind that examined the CSFs for supply chain sustainability in the Bangladeshi wood industry. The proposed methodology and findings will help managers in the Bangladeshi wood industry as well as other similar industries to understand the CSFs and reduce the complexity of decision-making in managing business process towards sustainability journey.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>TODIM-based multicriteria decision-making approach for assessing inventory policy in a Pythagorean fuzzy environment is proposed in this study. In supply chain, inventory appears in several forms. For effective supply chain, management businesses must choose an effective inventory policy. It is difficult to rank inventory policies. Inventory policy selection and evaluation include a procedure that can be thought about, checked after some time, and ideally improved through certain measures. Determination of the right inventory control policy is a challenge in the dynamic business environment as it enables organizations to gain an upper hand in terms of cost, quality, and service, which in turn provides a vital step in fulfilling the requirements of the customer. The multicriteria question has qualitative and quantitative factors that are vague and contradictory. Such variables are not necessarily clear and often suffer vagueness owing to the inconsistent existence of the gathered data. In the Pythagorean fuzzy setting, they are therefore considered to eliminate this vagueness by assigning membership and nonmembership roles to these factors. Finally, in this article, we performed a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the stability of our model and to illustrate the utility of implementing such algorithms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The seismic resilience of water supply systems can be impacted by numerous factors, but what these factors are in the rural context of China is unknown. In this study, 41 potential influencing factors of seismic-resilience for rural water supply system (RWSS) were obtained through a literature review and semi-structured expert interview, comprising 26 general influencing factors (GFs) and 15 water supply safety influencing factors (SFs). This study verified and ranked these factors through a questionnaire survey delivered to RWSS stakeholders in Sichuan Province, China. Based on 123 valid, returned questionnaires, these factors are divided into 9 factor groups through factor analysis performed on GFs and SFs, respectively, of which “economic resilience” and “organizational resilience in disaster prevention stage” are shown to be the most important factor groups. Additionally, it found that the experience of earthquake events significantly affects the perceptions of stakeholders on the importance of certain factors. Specifically, stakeholders who have experienced an earthquake prioritize the post-earthquake resilience of the system, while those who have not experienced an earthquake prioritize the absorption capacity of the system in the disaster prevention stage. Thus, it is not appropriate to use fixed weights to evaluate the seismic resilience of RWSSs. Significantly, this outcome differs from existing findings on the resilience of Urban Water Supply Systems (UWSSs), where “technical resilience” is the key dimension. These findings can help decision-makers fully understand the factors affecting the seismic resilience of RWSSs in China, and in doing so, augment the strengthening of rural water supply.</jats:p>"

Pertamina (Persero) under the function of Supply  Distribution has the main task of carrying out the activities of receiving, stockpiling, and distributing fuel oil. In the distribution and operation processes carried out, 8 risks may occur. Based on the Gray FMEA method, the priority risk that occurs is the delay of the tanker which has the smallest gray relationship, which is 0.435 and the risk of the interconnection of information system support between functions which is still problematic is 0.452. Through the Root Cause Analysis method approach, the root causes of the risk of ship delays are non-routine maintenance/maintenance on ship engines, lack of training for crew members according to function, and bad weather conditions. Meanwhile, the risk of the interconnection of information systems support between functions is still problematic due to the lack of maintenance and network management. The alternative strategy for improvement that can be done by the company is to work with the BMKG to help predict the weather, improve the quality of workers according to their functions, provide adequate equipment and reliable mechanics to carry out SOPs for maintaining ship engines properly and cooperate with service management companies to assist companies in managing and maintaining networks.</jats:p>"

The methodology was applied to the Ecuadorian flower industry, and the data for the analysis was from a survey of a group of companies that represent this sector. In addition, a focus group of SC experts weighted the model constructs as part of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and then the performance level for each construct was determined. According to the results methodologies, this model allows the classification of companies by their performance, as well as the performance of the aggregate sector. The processes that Ecuadorian flower companies need to improve on are planning, procurement, and manufacturing. The study’s main contribution is developing a general framework for measuring the overall performance of SCs and how the results are obtained. This tool could help managers, consultants, industries, and governments to assess the performance of SCs, as well as improving SC management in order to increase the sector’s competitiveness in the international market.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, multiple sensors controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller are also used to measure the crucial parameters that influenced the living conditions of crops and are called input parameters. Meanwhile, the implementation of a fuzzy logic controller is to control the timing of water volume based on the inputs data obtained through the sensors' responses. Solar energy is the main supply because of the zero-cost expense and environmentally friendly energy generation. In large, this research developed the smart irrigation system (SIS) with photovoltaic (PV) panels as a supply to sustain the energy required for empowering the entire process.

Although this approach is useful, it inherently assumes that all of world production is available to the market and is thus potentially at risk. In this analysis, the HHI, as well as HHI weighted by country governance, is calculated for mined and refined zinc via the standard approach of including all world production data and comparing that to the HHI when using the best estimate of what is available to the world market. The results indicate that although the HHI of both mined and refined zinc world production has increased markedly over the past decade, the HHI for what is available to the market for mined and refined zinc has remained relatively constant and low, which is indicative of minimal supply risk. This is mainly owing to the fact that a large and increasing share of the world’s mined and refined zinc production comes from China, but that production supplies domestic consumption as well as small amounts of exports. As a result, the zinc materials that are available to the world market are produced by a relatively large and diverse set of countries. Although these analyses are specific to zinc, they are likely to be comparable for other commodities of which the largest producers are also the largest consumers and highlight the importance of examining different perspectives in criticality assessments.</jats:p>",

The multistudy approach provides representations of decision dynamics across a variety of scenarios, from one‐shot buys to long‐term supply‐chain relationships. Our combined empirical results consistently suggest that the service‐reward mechanism significantly and systematically elevates order levels and order variability in a manner that increases departure from optimal ordering.

This research sought to study the influence of public procurement practices on service delivery in Kilifi County government, Kenya. The study was guided by the following objectives: To assess the influence procurement planning practice on service delivery in Kilifi County government; to find out the Influence of tendering practice on service delivery in Kilifi County government; to determine the influence of procurement policies on service delivery in Kilifi County government and finally to establish the influence of financial management practice on service delivery in Kilifi County government. The study adopted descriptive research design. The study was guided by three theories namely agency theory, stakeholders and contingency theory. Employees who dealt with procurement were selected purposively and census technique was adopted to select respondents from procurement department. The study population comprised of 70 respondents that included the procurement staff, head of procurement as well as committee members of the budget. Primary data was collected using closed-ended questionnaires. A pilot study was done in Mombasa County to determine any possible weakness in the instruments. Data was analyzed using Statistical Software for Social Sciences (SPSS). Cronbach Alpha used to measure the coefficient of reliability that yielded 0.788 in this study. Frequency distribution table were used in the presentation of the data. Multiple regression models were used to analyze data. The findings of the study showed that the predictors variables that included Procurement planning practice, Tendering Practice, Procurement Policy and Financial Management Practice explained 81.7% in the variation of service delivery in Kilifi County with the R square value (R2=0.817). The study concluded that independent variables    significantly influenced the service delivery in Kilifi County with; Procurement planning practice X1 (β =0.433, p˂ 0.05); Tendering Practice X2 (β =0.001, p˂ 0.05); Procurement Policies X3 (β =0.326, p˂ 0.05) and Financial Management Practice X4 (β =0.098, p˂ 0.05). The study recommends that the county leadership should come up with relevant tendering policies to ensure openness, integrity and transparency in all tendering process. There should be strong financial management mechanisms to avoid wastage during procurement functions and processes. In addition, all county stakeholders should be involved in the procurement process for the purpose of ensuring timely service delivery in line with the procurement specifications.</jats:p>",

Load forecasting lowers production costs, increases spinning reserve capacity, and improves power system reliability. Financial institutions, power suppliers, and other participants in the electric energy market, such as transmission, generation, and distribution, rely heavily on load forecasts. The allocation of generation for economic reasons is a critical goal of short-term load forecasting. For short-term load forecasting, this research provides a solution paradigm based on an artificial neural network. Dry bulb temperature, Dew point temperature, humidity, and load data are the inputs used to forecast the load. To minimize the error function generated from computed and actual load, the back propagation algorithm was implemented.</jats:p>",

To fully investigate the velocity distribution and wake structure characteristics around the suspended pipeline under oblique flows, a flume model test and a numerical simulation based on the LES (Large Eddy Simulation) method were performed. The results showed that the velocity distribution near the suspended pipeline under oblique flows had obvious three-dimensional characteristics. The influence range of pipeline on velocity is 1 d before to 6 d behind the pipeline (d is pipeline diameter). The smaller the flow angle, the more disordered the velocity distribution is. The larger the flow angle, the greater the variation degree of the velocity at each section at the same section is, as well as the higher the velocity deficit value is. In addition, the larger the angle of pipe flow, the more violent the wake structure changes with the flow velocity, and the stronger the regularity of vortex street shedding. This research provides a theoretical reference for the scour prevention design and safe operation of crossing pipelines.</jats:p>",

The logistics sector plays a significant role in its management. Six Sigma helps the organization identify and define problems, test hypotheses, brainstorm ideas, and schedule improvised plan execution to avoid unintended effects. This article provides a brief ideology and framework of how Six Sigma can be successfully implemented in the transportation sector of the supply chain of an FMCG company in the UAE to mitigate the issues faced in the sector, thereby helping to achieve successful supply chain management. The concept of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control), which is the core tool in Six Sigma, is also discussed in this paper. The transportation industry is becoming more innovative and introducing Lean Six Sigma to transport goods from supplier to market. This has shown the results of process improvement with success. Trucking and transportation industries are doing less manufacturing on a per-diem using Lean Six Sigma methodology to improve their operations. Organizations' transportation departments have started using Lean tools to review preventive maintenance schedules with a team, including regional managers. As a result, they have a new preventative maintenance schedule. Logistics companies claim the principles of Lean are solid. Techniques such as \"The Five\" typically gain the job done and lead to discovering the cause of the issue with the least time, logically, and hint at appropriate solutions to fix the issues. Application of Six Sigma in the transport sector, bringing revolutionary output like increasing handling of container arrival by crane, reducing load and unloading with time spent around container arrival, helps make the handling more efficient. It could further improvements to the customs house agents' processes by using data to improve accuracy and shorten the time for preparing entry and shipping bills. The rates of use of incorrect entries made can be eliminated.</jats:p>"

Public institutions are characterized by regulations which tend to be more procedural than sustainable. Supply chain sustainability in public institutions and tertiary ones in specific, are vital for a long-term growth of education in the country since the government has invested heavily in ensuring an equitable education in Kenya. This research paper theorized the structure of a sustainable supply chain in TVET Institutions in Kenya amidst the disruptions caused by COVID 19 pandemic. The structural illustrations for supply chain sustainability in this study were supply chain agility and supply chain virtualization while policy formulation was used as the moderating variable on supply chain sustainability in the selected tertiary institutions in Kenya. The study adopted the efficient supply chain analytical structures such as the Pareto Analysis and Total Interpretive Structural Model for theoretical underpinnings. The respondents of this study were procurement managers and data were collected virtually through google forms structured in the Five Likert Scale format. The study findings revealed that supply chain agility was lacking in the selected Tertiary institutions; Supply chain virtualization were uncommon, while there was no policy on supply chain agility and policy on supply chain sustainability among the selected tertiary institutions in Kenya. The study recommended a structural policy formulation for agile supply chain and virtualization of supply activities in the tertiary institutions in Kenya.</jats:p>"

These principles and methods are still, to a large extent, the foundation of the field. Over the past decade, many tools have been developed for risk analysis of water systems. Many advances have been made, both in the theoretical platform and in practical models and procedures. Various risk analysis approaches have been used to identify potential hazards, calculate the probability of accidents and assess the severity of consequences. The objective of this paper is to review these developments, focusing on the fundamental ideas and thinking behind them, considering their application at strategic, programmatic and operational levels of decision-making, in order to improve the understanding of stakeholders (researchers, regulators, etc.). To achieve this objective, scientific papers on risk analysis associated with water treatment systems were identified and reviewed, with particular focus on risk assessment methods (qualitative, semi-qualitative or quantitative, deterministic or probabilistic, etc.), tools (ETA, FTA, FMEA/FMECA, QMRA, HRA, Markov, etc.), applicability of these tools and results of case studies. A total of 141 references were selected on the basis of title sorting from databases as ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science or SpringerLink, and a total of 68 articles were selected for full-text analysis. Main conclusions of this review and analysis efforts are as follows: (1) the scientific foundation of risk assessment and risk management is still an open issue; (2) principles, theories and base methods applicable to water supply systems are in continuous development, existing tools are suitable, and a growing number of applications are available and of great interest; and (3) risk analysis methodologies are in their journey to gain the necessary broad technical, community and political acceptance in the water treatment sector, and some gaps and opportunities have been included in the discussion.</jats:p>",

In addition, (intensity-duration) and the return period of drought indices of Standard precipitation index (SPI) and Standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in annual time series were evaluated. Results illustrated that the seasonal precipitation pattern has changed, and mean temperatures will increase by 1.4 °C compared to the base period. The results of the drought assessment showed that the intensity of drought in the future compared to the base period based on SPI and SPEI increased by 8 and 28%, respectively, indicating that the SPEI was more severe in all three scenarios than the SPI. It can mainly be explained by the contribution and effect of increasing the average temperature along with precipitation in the SPEI.

Such policies should be led by the G20, who represent more than 80% of global material, fuel, and food consumption. Multi-regional input–output analysis plays an important role for consumption-based assessment, including supply chains and their environmental impacts. However, previous accounting schemes were unable to fully assess the impacts of materials, fuels, and food. To close this gap, we provide an improved method to map key aspects of sustainability along value chains of materials, fuels, and food. The results show that the rise in global coal-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1995 and 2015 was driven by the G20’s metals and construction materials industry. In 2015, the G20 accounted for 96% of global coal-related GHG emissions, of which almost half was from the extraction and processing of metals and construction materials in China and India. Major drivers include China’s rising infrastructure and exports of metals embodied in machinery, transport, and electronics consumed by other G20 members. In 2015, the vast majority (70%–95%) of the GHG emissions of metals consumed by the EU, USA, Canada, Australia, and other G20 members were emitted abroad, mostly in China. In contrast, hotspots in the impact displacement of water stress, land-use related biodiversity loss, and low-paid workforce involve the G20’s food imports from non-G20 members. Particularly high-income members have contributed to the G20’s rising environmental footprints by their increasing demand for materials, food, and fuels extracted and processed in lower-income regions with less strict environmental policies, higher water stress, and more biodiversity loss. Our results underline the G20’s importance of switching to renewable energy, substituting high-impact materials, improving supply chains, and using site-specific competitive advantages to reduce impacts on water and ecosystems.</jats:p>",

The 2369 pieces of dated softwood timber are mainly larch and fir from the Massif Central and the Alps mountains. Larch seems to have been used mostly locally in the Alps, whereas fir was certainly exported from the two regions to the lowland towns. Very little felling has been identified in the historically troubled 13th–14th century. For the moment we have not identified any fir trees used before the 15th century in the Alps, whereas they are present in the Massif Central from the 12th century. Growth of fir timbers show little variation over time while larch timbers present an increase in growth between those felled until the 12th century and those felled from the 15th century onwards. Finally, since firs from the Massif Central show a higher age trend than those from the Alps, this can serve as a model for identifying the source forests of the timber used in the Rhône valley.</jats:p>"

Long-term results are often unsatisfactory secondary to recurrence of the original deformity, requiring secondary operations such as fat grafting or complete revision of the calvarial remodeling. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) has recently emerged as a new modality for treatment of UCS, with promising results and decreased rates of reoperation compared with open cranial vault remodeling. A theoretical benefit of DO is preservation of blood supply to the frontal bone following osteotomy, as the frontal bone can be retained in situ compared with the complete removal and reshaping of the frontal bone during traditional fronto-orbital advancement. Preservation of blood supply to the frontal bone may allow for more robust bony healing and preservation of long-term growth potential; however, the vascularity of the frontal bone flap in DO has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally that blood supply to the frontal bone is preserved after creation of a rotational bone flap in DO management of UCS.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Frontal bone flap creation via osteotomy for DO treatment of UCS was performed via previously reported technique.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for power demand and supply prediction is becoming increasingly popular in smart grid systems. Due to the fact that there exist many simple ML algorithms/models in the literature, the question arises as to whether there is any significant advantage(s) among these different ML algorithms, particularly as it pertains to power demand/supply prediction use cases. Toward answering this question, we examined six well-known ML algorithms for power prediction in smart grid systems, including the artificial neural network, Gaussian regression (GR), k-nearest neighbor, linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). First, fairness was ensured by undertaking a thorough hyperparameter tuning exercise of the models under consideration. As a second step, power demand and supply statistics from the Eskom database were selected for day-ahead forecasting purposes. These datasets were based on system hourly demand as well as renewable generation sources. Hence, when their hyperparameters were properly tuned, the results obtained within the boundaries of the datasets utilized showed that there was little/no significant difference in the quantitative and qualitative performance of the different ML algorithms. As compared to photovoltaic (PV) power generation, we observed that these algorithms performed poorly in predicting wind power output. This could be related to the unpredictable wind-generated power obtained within the time range of the datasets employed. Furthermore, while the SVM algorithm achieved the slightly quickest empirical processing time, statistical tests revealed that there was no significant difference in the timing performance of the various algorithms, except for the GR algorithm. As a result, our preliminary findings suggest that using a variety of existing ML algorithms for power demand/supply prediction may not always yield statistically significant comparative prediction results, particularly for sources with regular patterns, such as solar PV or daily consumption rates, provided that the hyperparameters of such algorithms are properly fine tuned.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to identify and characterize different profiles of operational risk (i.e., supply, manufacturing, and demand risks) between manufacturing companies along with considering contextual factors such as company size and industry type. Data are collected from the fourth round of the High Performance Manufacturing Project and subsequently analyzed by cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Three different clusters have been identified: Two clusters are moderately and highly impacted by operational risk, respectively, while the other cluster is almost not impacted by manufacturing risk but highly impacted by supply risk and demand risk. The results also indicate that companies with different profiles of operational risk have different levels of integration and operational performance. An important contribution of the current study is the development of a hypothesized framework of interactions between operational risk, integration, and operational performance to provide opportunities for further research.</jats:p>"

It is concluded that the most reliable in the conditions of a complex geological structure of deposits is the assessment of gas reserves by the pressure drop method. The idea is formulated that for the fields of the Vilyui oil and gas bearing area, which have productive horizons with low initial gas saturation of reservoirs, the final gas recovery factors can be estimated at 0.55.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low concentrations of iron, an important micronutrient for photosynthetic organisms, limit growth in large parts of the ocean. The solubility and availability of iron is to a large degree determined by organic iron-binding molecules, so-called ligands. While ligands come from a variety of sources, many of them are produced in autotrophic or heterotrophic production in the ocean, leading to the possibility of feedbacks between marine primary production and iron availability. The diversity of ligands, reaching from siderophores, small molecules involved in bacterial iron uptake, to breakdown products and long-lived macromolecules like humic substances, means that feedbacks could be both negative and positive or there may even be no feedback at all. Here we investigate first, how the cycling of this ligand pool can be described simplistically in a model such that it reproduces the observed global distribution of dissolved iron and phosphorus as closely as possible. We show that inclusion of a ligand similar to refractory dissolved organic carbon leads to an improved agreement to observations in our model. Inclusion of a second, shorter-lived siderophore-like ligand does not strongly affect this agreement. In a second step we then study how feedbacks affect how iron distribution and oceanic productivity react to changes in external supply of iron. We show that, to be consistent with present-day iron distribution, the dominant feedback is positive, increasing the sensitivity of global biological productivity and hence carbon cycling to changes in iron supply. The strength of the feedback increases with increasing ligand life-time. The negative feedback associated with siderophore-like ligands has the potential to mitigate the positive feedback, especially at the surface and for global export production, but more research on the production and decay of siderophores is needed for a better quantification. Ocean biogeochemical models that assume a constant ligand concentration and hence neglect possible feedbacks may therefore underestimate the reaction of the global carbon cycle to the strong increase in dust deposition under future or glacial climate conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper considers a dual-channel supply chain with one vendor and multiple buyers in which (1) one channel is an offline channel where standard products are produced and shipped to the buyers and (2) the second channel is an online channel with the flow of customized products between the vendor and the online buyers/consumers. The first channel follows a vendor managed inventory with consignment stock (VMI-CS) agreement between the vendor and buyers. The supply lead time between the vendor and the buyer is considered controllable, at a cost. Two models are analyzed: (1) in the first model, the standard and customized product’s demand rate is assumed to be price and lead time-sensitive, and (2) in the second model, the demands are uncertain or ambiguous and are treated as a trapezoidal fuzzy number. It is reasonably complex to obtain analytical solutions. Hence, two algorithms are proposed to obtain the numerical solution with the objective of maximizing total profit. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and managerial insights are given to test the model. Finally, conclusions and directions for future research are provided.</jats:p>",

In fact, the philosophy of aviation safety is changing from an understanding of its purely technical and technological component and extends to determining the severity of risks to property, life and health of people, the environment, financial security, and legal liability of enterprises have shocked aviation transport. At the same time, harmonization, integrity and operational interchangeability of the industry's integrated security system are achieved; the worldwide exchange of safety-related information; global systemic hazards are identified and eliminated at an early stage. The effective management of aviation safety requires a systematic approach to the development of policies, procedures and recommended practices. Safety management integrates different types of aviation activities into a single whole. The main challenges of Ukrainian air transport in the context of the globalization of the air transportation market are the annexation of Crimea, the armed conflict in the east of Ukraine, the tragedy of the Boeing-777 of Malaysian Airlines, the closure of airspace over the vast territory of Ukraine, the refusal to fly over the Russian Federation, the tragedy of the Boeing-737 of International Airlines Ukraine” in Iran and, to a greater extent, the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges are reflected in almost all macro, meso and microeconomic indicators of the activity and infrastructure of air transport. However, air transport is not only an open system, but also an adaptive system. Modern challenges of its activities indicate the need to develop strategic scenarios and develop a mechanism for institutional support for further sustainable development, taking into account the dynamic external environment, constant changes in the structure and intensity of threats and uncertainties.</jats:p>"

The traditional supply chain is based on a push system, whereas an additional supply chain is based on a pull system. In this work we have found the impact of 3D printing on supply chain management, what the risks and opportunities of 3D printing on the supply chain are and, also what the companies are doing to leverages these opportunities and risks. It has been concluded that the additive supply chain has drastically changed the traditional supply chain in four key ways i.e. time, quality, speed, and environmental impact. It will result in the effective management of resources, which is of immense importance, keeping in mind the sustainable development goals of a blue-chip organization. It will be cost-effective and will reduce the lead-time of the supply chain. It will result in increased customer satisfaction, as the product will be produced by mass customization and improved quality. Moreover, this will lead to flexibility in the manufacturing process, which will enhance industrial efficiency. Therefore, we can say that this research will give us the vision of different industries in India in the coming years. </jats:p>",

At the same time, the customers are now more focused towards the product quality. Supply chain management is the demand of the era. However, it is difficult to trace and maintain the track data throughout the process during the supply of a product. The traditional solutions were based on centralized third party solutions, where the data is inclined to various security attacks and high risk of tempering. In this paper, a solution for the management of supply of a product has been proposed which is based on IoT with an amalgamation of blockchain so as to increase the transparency of the flow during the supply of the product. The solution will help to enhance the trust as the data will be shared among all participating nodes of the network in blockchain. It also makes instant traceability of the product and this can be done by both the end of the chain. Moreover, this solution will help the consumer to check whether the product is from a reliable source or not.

The paper reviews the global LNG trade in 2020 and forecasts the future LNG supply and demand. On this basis, the costs in segments of a LNG project are analysed from the perspective of the LNG industry chain. The feasibility of export from LNG projects and the preferred target markets are determined by calculating the economic index of projects. It is concluded that the possibility of future rebound in oil prices and the demand growth in the incremental market in emerging Asian countries are most likely to determine the capacity scales of new LNG projects around the world and contribute to a dynamic balance in the LNG market in the medium- and longterm. The costs in different segments of the LNG industry chain vary greatly with the availability of resources and markets. The economics of LNG export depend on the demand for LNG imports in end markets, the cost plus in different segments of the industrial chain, and the affordability of end consumers. Through the cost and economic analysis on typical LNG Projects, Qatar is found still the most economical and highly profitable country in the global LNG export market nowadays. Unsatisfactory economic performance is a common reason for delayed investments in many large LNG projects in Australia and other countries.</jats:p>",

As the bridge between blockchains and port supply chains, smart contracts reconstruct the business process of blockchain-empowered port supply chains. In this article, we present an architecture of a consortium blockchain-empowered port supply chain system, and propose a system verification framework for the smart contracts of port supply chains with probabilistic behaviors. The smart contracts are modeled as DTMCs (Discrete-Time Markov Chains), which are automatically transformed through the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) description of the smart contracts. The requirements are specified by PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic). Moreover, we implement the customs clearance process of the Shanghai Yangshan Port based on blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, and reconstruct the clearance process with smart contracts.

In this paper, reservoir sedimentation is quantified in stages by empirical models and theoretical methods using reservoir information and sediment data to reveal the latest status of siltation in the Lancang reservoirs. Results show that the storage capacity loss of the Manwan and Jinghong reservoirs reached 51.4% and 1.54% by 2019, which illustrates that the situation of siltation is serious. The theoretical trapping efficiency of Manwan reservoir was about 69% and the estimation result of the Brune method performed best with a value of 67.5% among the empirical methods. The Brune method was then modified with a correction coefficient and the revised Brune method can be used for the estimation of trapping efficiency in other reservoirs. Overall, this paper presents relatively accurate information for managers to understand the current state of siltation in the Lancang reservoirs, and can provide scientific guidance and data support for them to take measures to reduce sedimentation and ensure the sustainability of reservoirs.</jats:p>",

But numerous barriers to ADU development persist, including opposition by neighboring households. One persistent question is whether ADU residents would overwhelm on-street parking in the predominately single-family neighborhoods where ADUs are typically built. That question is difficult to answer because there is a surprising dearth of research on the effective parking supply in single-family neighborhoods. We use a survey of homeowners in Sacramento, California, to investigate the supply and sufficiency of residential parking for single-family homes, including how households actually use their garages, and help answer the ADU parking conundrum. After estimating and accounting for actual garage use, we find that more than 75% of households have enough off-street parking available to park all their vehicles. When we combine off-street and on-street parking supplies, we find that households have an average of 1.6 more parking spaces available to them than they have vehicles. That parking surplus is more than enough to accommodate the average ADU tenant and their vehicle, belying claims that ADUs will overwhelm existing parking supplies in single-family neighborhoods.</jats:p>"

In the context of developing countries, in which the environmental, social, economic, and culture were in contrast with developed countries, these healthy island concepts cannot be simply applied. Moreover, there were still no indicators for a healthy island in Indonesia. Indonesia still conforms to the Healthy Regency/City indicator. AIM: This research aims to identify the provision of clean water as an indicator for a healthy island. METHODS: This research was descriptive research using the qualitative method. Data collection was done by in-depth interviews, participation observation, and secondary data from sub-health centers and data from urban villages in the islands. The number of informants was five persons. RESULTS: This study found that the provision of clean water is an indicator of a healthy island by looking at three aspects of clean water sources, water reservoirs, and drinking water treatment. The source of clean water in the archipelago is drilled well water. Tub, drums, and bucket are used as the water container. Treatment of drinking water by cooking using water from the Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) purchased from the city as well as drinking water from processed saltwater into freshwater using special tools stored in gallons and then selling it to people in the archipelago. CONCLUSION: There needs to be a policy that governs the necessity of a steady supply of clean water in the archipelagic area, even though in several areas there are many methods to meet the demand for clean water in archipelagic areas.</jats:p>"

The results reveal that even when a small fraction of buyers adopt regionalizing supplier-selection practices—those in which a buyer chooses geographically proximate suppliers, whether to the buyer or its current suppliers—the supply chain network becomes more robust. </jats:p>",

As a result, this study aimed at evaluating trihalomethane formation, the relation between water quality parameters and trihalomethane formation, and the estimation of the associated potential health risks in drinking water. The headspace purge and trap coupled with a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry technique was used to quantify trihalomethane. The concentrations of trihalomethane found in the water were within the National Water and Sewerage Corporation, World Health Organization guidelines, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. Total organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, bromide concentration, and the temperature had a positive and significant correlation, pH had a positive but non-significant correlation, while the residual chlorine had a negative but significant correlation with trihalomethane formation. The potential health risk using the WHO index was 0.4, indicating no noncarcinogenic risk to human health in the study area. The lifetime carcinogenic risks of trihalomethane due to oral ingestion, dermal, and inhalation were 2.5×10−5, 9.1×10−6, and 8.3×10−6 for females and 2.4×10−5, 1×10−5, and 7.9×10−6 for males, and the values were within the USEPA acceptable low-risk range of 1×10−6&amp;lt;CR&amp;lt;5.1×10−5.</jats:p>",

In this study, we use the ecosystem service (ES) score matrix, ES supply rate, and ES supply/demand ratio to analyze the supply/demand pattern of ecosystem services based on land use/cover changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1990 to 2020. The Conversion of Land Use and Its Effects-Simulation (CLUE-S) model is used to simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of land use change in three scenarios of natural development, ecological priority development, and economic priority development and to predict and simulate the evolution of the ES supply and demand patterns in these different scenarios from 2030 to 2050. It was found that the main land use types are farmland and woodland in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, accounting for more than 67% from 1990 to 2020, the proportion of farmland decreased from 51.79% to 46.11%, and the proportion of woodland increased from 20.99% to 21.34%; the land use transformation was mainly from farmland to construction land from 1990 to 2020. The supply of ES in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was at a high level, the supply rate of ES increased from 0.78 to 0.81, the supply/demand ratio of ES decreased from 0.33 to 0.16 from 1990 to 2020, and the supply and demand of ES in the northern and western parts of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were in surplus. In the natural development scenario, the ES in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region would remain in a high supply state from 2030 to 2050, but the pressure would be greater than before. The deficit, centered on urban construction, would widen, and the ecological situation would deteriorate. In the ecological priority development scenario, the pressure on the ES would be relieved, and the rate of deficit expansion would be reduced. In the economic development priority scenario, the pressure on the ES would increase sharply, and the deficit area would expand rapidly.</jats:p>"

First, the onshore current in the bottom layer of the aquaculture boundary, which transports high‐concentration nutrients from the major nutrient source of offshore bottom water, is significantly weakened by suspended aquaculture. As a result, nutrient supply from offshore sources is reduced by 50%−60%. Second, the upwelling velocities in the offshore aquaculture area are reduced by 2–6 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> cm/s, which leads to an approximately 25% reduction in nutrient supply to the euphotic layer. Third, the water exchange in the near‐coastal aquaculture area remains approximately unchanged because the weakened onshore currents within the aquaculture layers (0–4 m) are compensated by the enhanced onshore currents in the lower layers. As a result, the nutrient supply in the near‐coastal aquaculture area does not significantly change, whereas the nutrient supply in the offshore aquaculture area has been reduced by approximately 60%.</jats:p>",

So the introduction of modern technologies in the logistics company is an integral step towards scaling up and growth.  The essence of the company activity digitalization is not to digitize any channel, individual production operation or a separate business process, but in a complex approach to the transformation of the company, covering all areas of the company and all areas of economic activity. The need for the logistics industry to adapt to this new digital age in order to evolve has been proven. Enterprise business process digitalization tools are more flexible tools due to their user interface customization capabilities and integration capabilities with most advanced systems. New purpose – automation of business processes with the use of smart technologies allows company to simplify the load when performing their daily tasks to each employee. The aim of the article is to develop proposals and recommendations for improving the management of the company's logistics business processes by their digitalization. It is claimed that due to the modern policy of increasing digitalization in the company AsstrA Ukraine, there is an increase in indicators and quality of work performance, increasing the level of job satisfaction among employees, which is the key to further growth of the company. It is noted that digital technologies allow to automate supply chain management processes, which reduces operating costs, facilitates simpler and faster billing methods, improves customer service and develops an important new era for building ideal and competitive supply chains.</jats:p>"

These projects usually have multiple reservoirs and pump stations connected to each other. Most previous studies focus solely on the operation of reservoirs aiming to supply more water rather than the joint operation of the reservoir-pump station system. Project operations that ignore the pump station may not be cost effective. In addition, future water availability is of great uncertainty that will affect the system's performance. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the tradeoffs between water supply and power net revenue (considering power generation by hydropower stations and power consumption by pump stations) under different water availability scenarios, which can be used to inform policies. A resilience metric is introduced to evaluate the joint system performance. An optimization model including two objectives: social perspective (minimum of total water shortage) and economic perspective (maximum of power net revenue) is considered for the study area: the Hanjiang-to-Weihe River Valley Water Diversion Project. Results mainly show that two objectives are in a contradictory relationship. If future streamflow does not decrease, the water supply sector could at least meet 50% of the water demand in recipient area.</jats:p>",

Proponents of food tourism contend that it increases local food consumption as tourists and tourism and hospitality businesses are attracted to local food supply chains, where they can buy direct from the producer, thus reducing overheads, contributing to local economies and benefitting local communities. Yet the extent to which the food tourism rhetoric enhances the local food supply chain is questionable as evidence suggests that the food tourism ‘label’ creates a silo, which impairs connections with local food supply chains. Seven semi-structured interviews were undertaken in Southeast Wales to explore the food tourism rhetoric, particularly the connection with local food supply chains. Three themes emerged: demand versus supply; information provision; complexity and connectivity in food tourism and local food supply chains. Ultimately, this paper challenges traditional viewpoints around food tourism being a panacea for local food producers.</jats:p>"

In the Philippines, the biofuels industry is anchored onto the Biofuels Act of 2006 which mandates the use of biofuels made from indigenous sources such as coconut. Despite this, biodiesel is still less preferred by consumers over conventional fuel due to its high cost. This can be attributed to high production costs of biodiesel, wherein 18-28% is credited to transportation of products.  This work proposes a linear programming model to reduce the overall cost of biodiesel by minimizing the transportation cost in the Philippine biodiesel supply chain, using the Mindanao cluster as case study. Multiple scenarios were done to gauge the impact of varying the supply allocation and biodiesel blend on the supply chain. The optimal supply allocation, transportation cost, and carbon footprint of each scenario were determined. A new facility locator feature was also added as an extension of the program. Results also showed high reproducibility using easily accessible programming tools such as Microsoft Excel and Python.</jats:p>"

The weight of the criterion layer and the scheme layer are combined to get the final weights of each load bus. This solves the problem of consistency factor when evaluating loads from experts and Microgrid system operators. The calculation of priority weighting on the continuity of power supply for loads supports system operators to be proactive in planning load shedding or load shedding due to system failures, thereby minimizing damage to the system and electricity customers. The proposed method is calculated on the diagram of the IEEE 16 bus Microgrid system with six sources and eight loads.</jats:p>"

Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain. </jats:p>"

It is found that the work safety management behavior of the core enterprise is driven by both internal and external factors. External driving factors are the main category of institutional pressure composed of regulatory pressure, normative pressure, and cognitive pressure. Internal driving factors are divided into the main category of behavioral awareness and the behavioral capability of the core enterprises. The behavioral awareness is composed of responsibility sense, problem cognition and behavioral effect perception. The behavioral capability is composed of safety management strength and safety coordination capability. Institutional pressure, behavioral awareness, and behavioral capability all influence the work safety management behavior of core enterprise in supply chain significantly, but with different ways and paths.

A simplified theoretical consideration of the phenomenon is presented; the whole crystal is regarded as material consumer (but not merely a separate face on it). Accounted is for the fact that different amounts of building material are supplied by diffusion to the diverse types of crystal faces. Besides, critical sizes of crystal faces over which they lose the ability to grow macroscopically flat (because shallow cavities are formed on them) are calculated not only for the basal faces of Zn crystals growing from highly diluted own vapors mixed in inert (in respect to this metal) gases, such as H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Ar, but also for the pyramidal crystal faces. So, a logical explanation is given of the long‐standing problem: why the measured critical sizes of Zn single crystals grown in inert atmospheres are much smaller than the theoretically calculated critical sizes? Finally, the widths of the macroscopically flat rims surrounding the cavities on basal faces of Zn and Cd crystals (growing under conditions of uneven diffusion supply of building material) are determined in a simplified way.</jats:p>",

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the short-term wage elasticity of labor supply in real-time ridesharing markets using data from a major ridesharing platform in China. By exploiting an exogenous shock from uneven driving restrictions as an instrumental variable, we find a negative labor supply elasticity for ridesharing drivers, suggesting that drivers tend to drive less during days with a higher average hourly wage. Specifically, a percent increase in hourly wage will lead to a 0.931 percent decrease in daily working hours. This surprising finding is consistent with the behavioral income-targeting model based on the theory of reference-dependent preferences: Drivers have heuristic daily targets for total earnings and are more motivated to supply labor when they are below their income target than when they are above it. Therefore, they work less on days when earnings per hour are high and quit the market once their income target is reached. In addition, we find that taxi drivers are more rational and have positive labor supply elasticity, which implies that drivers are more rational when they have repeated opportunities for learning. Estimating labor supply elasticity is critical to understanding the economic efficiency of various surge pricing algorithms and driver subsidization programs for ridesharing platforms and policymakers. Our research suggests that a uniform price surging or driver subsidization approach for all ridesharing drivers may not incentivize the labor supply of drivers effectively.</jats:p>"

The article discusses the components of a high-tech enterprise: the production process and the supply system. The scientific principles are listed, the application of which contributes to the optimal organization of the production process. The essence of reliability of supply system management is stated. It is concluded that the production of products, being a link between suppliers of raw materials and consumers, is more dependent on the work of the supply system, which interacts with suppliers and is responsible for the uninterrupted supply of the production process with materials of the required quality and volume. Data and methods. The revealed relationship between the production process and the supply system requires their monitoring and control. For the analysis, it is proposed to use the methods of empirical assessment and rating assessment. This will allow us to assess the state of affairs at the enterprise at the time of the study. The results obtained. In the considered activity of the enterprise in the field of production and supply, there is a need for measures to ensure the reliability of the production process and the resource supply system, which guarantees the effective operation of the enterprise in the future. The causes of failures of the supply system at the enterprise, which can lead to a shortage of materials and downtime in the operation of the enterprise, have been identified. The relationship between the supply system and the production process is graphically presented. A model of the supply system operation at the enterprise has been developed, which takes into account the formation and tracking of applications, delivery deadlines, prevention of supply failures, inventory management. Conclusion. In conclusion, the main role of the production process and the supply system in the organization of ensuring the reliability of the optimal functioning of a high-tech enterprise is emphasized.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The volume of imported salt contributed roughly up to 50.29 percent in Indonesia. However, until the end of 2020, salt from domestic farmers reached 2.89 million tons. Based on these conditions, it is necessary to plan how to expand the distribution of local salt. Not only does distribute the salt to the domestic market, but also exports it, so the stock of salt does not accumulate in the warehouse. The work demonstrated in this article constituted to predict the demand of salt especially exported salt. This research utilized the historical demand data from 2014 to 2019 to predict the market of exported salt in Indonesia. The historical data were used to develop several models of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). This method was used to analysed how the forecast affected to supply chain and to prevent the bullwhip effect on it. The bullwhip effect could be known as the small fluctuations in retail demand level which could cause progressively larger fluctuation in demand at the distributor and supplier levels. The selected model corresponded to the ARIMA (1,0,1) of the tentative models with the smallest RSME value of 9.566. These results will provide to the manager of salt manufacturing to make decisions related to expand the salt market by exporting it rather than only distributing in domestic market.</jats:p>",

Despite the sheer volume of literature, limited attention has been paid to the characteristics and variance of charging behavior of EV users. In this research, we answer the question: which scientific approaches can help us to understand the dynamics of charging behavior in charging infrastructures, in order to provide recommendations regarding a more effective deployment and utilization of these infrastructures. To do so, we propose a conceptual model for charging infrastructure as a social supply–demand system and apply complex system properties. Using this conceptual model, we estimate the rate complexity, using three developed ratios that relate to the (1) necessity of sharing resources, (2) probabilities of queuing, and (3) cascading impact of transactions on others. Based on a qualitative assessment of these ratios, we propose that public charging infrastructure can be characterized as a complex system. Based on our findings, we provide four recommendations to policy makers for taking efforts to reduce complexity during deployment and measure interactions between EV users using systemic metrics. We further point researchers and policy makers to agent-based simulation models that capture interactions between EV users and the use complex network analysis to reveal weak spots in charging networks or compare the charging infrastructure layouts of across cities worldwide.</jats:p>"

Converting biomass into a readily available energy source will help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, whilst at the same time moderating greenhouse gas emmissions due to its carbon neutrality. Palm oil industry is the largest source of biomass in Indonesia and the available quantity to be utilized is growing inline with the steady growth of the generating industry. Among various wastes from palm oil processing, palm kernel shell is an oil palm biomass with high potential to be applied as a source of energy, given its high caloric value and distinctive physical properties. This source of renewable energy can be utilized by industries with thermal conversion processes. As a prerequisite, a feasibility study on technical, environmental, and economic aspects needs to be carried out. From long term perspective, supply, demand, and regulatory situational analysis will also be required. Lastly, a review on the existing palm kernel shell supply chain will help to understand its current situation. Based on literature studies and field observations, we have identified supply and demand characteristics that will be valuable in constructing an effective, efficient, and sustainable supply chain model of palm kernel shell. Understanding these characteristics is a precursor in realizing this massive potential of renewable energy source in the industrial context.</jats:p>",

However, it still lacks the radial trend comparison between the von Kármán decay rate, the energy supply rate, and the perpendicular heating rate based on direct observations of the solar wind. Here we carry out this kind of comparison for the first time using Parker Solar Probe measurements from its first three orbits. We find that the radial variation of the von Kármán decay rate is consistent with that of both the energy supply rate and the heating rate in the slow solar wind. These results support the idea that the von Kármán decay law is an active process responsible for solar wind heating. These results also suggest a new idea that both the von Kármán decay law and the low-frequency break sweeping may be controlled by the same nonlinear process.

Adopting a theoretical and molecular dynamics approach, we determine the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states of the droplets, investigate the efficiency of rugotaxis as a function of different parameters, and discuss additional effects, such as pinning. We find that shallow wrinkles characterised by small wavelength gradients, and moderate adhesion of the droplet to the substrate favour the rugotaxis motion with growing droplet size, when pinning is avoided. We also find that the driving force in rugotaxis is the gain in interfacial energy between the droplet and the substrate as the droplet enters regions of denser wrinkles (smaller wavelengths of the wrinkles).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Quality of transport infrastructure determines the quality of the provision of services for the transportation of goods and passengers. The infrastructure sector is a guarantee of efficiency, mobility and uninterrupted economic activity. However, the high quality of the transport infrastructure implies significant and long-term investments. According to a McKinsey research report, to support sustainable economic growth in the world in line with forecasts for 2030, it is necessary to cover the need for additional investment of $ 3.3 trillion annually, equivalent to 3.8% of world GDP. The purpose of this work is to analyze the existing European approach to assessing transport infrastructure expenditures and costs, their impact on transport performance at the country level, as well as trends in Ukrainian policy regarding the support and development of road infrastructure.  Transport infrastructure costs include the investment in new infrastructure, the cost of upgrading the existing infrastructure, the cost of maintaining the infrastructure, and the operating costs to enable the use of the transport infrastructure. Directive 2011/76 / EU prescribes that the weighted average infrastructure charges should be linked to construction costs, as well as the costs of operation, maintenance and development of the corresponding infrastructure network.  The official Eurostat data of investment and O&amp;M costs of transport infrastructure based on the citizenship principle was taken for this study, namely: - the number of ton-kilometers traveled per year; - the volume of investments in road infrastructure per year; - the amount of funds for the maintenance of road infrastructure per year. The indicators were taken for countries of the EU for which statistics were available for 2016 and 2019. According to the study, the effect of investments in transport infrastructure is strongly manifested both in the same year and affects subsequent years in terms of the volume of annual transport work. That is, an increase in investment in road infrastructure clearly has a positive effect on the volume of transport work performed. On the other hand, the volume of investments in the EU infrastructure brings a much greater positive effect than funds for road maintenance. Thus, the experience of developed countries shows a positive relationship between investment in the maintenance and construction of transport infrastructure and economic performance of the state. Part of the research was devoted to the study of the impact of investments in road infrastructure of Ukraine on the example of the global Ukrainian infrastructure project \"Big Construction\". It is projected that in 2024, thanks to road works under the Big Construction, Ukraine's GDP will be 4.4% higher than GDP in 2020. But, as the research shows, good transport infrastructure is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for growth. \"Big Construction\" project in Ukraine does not show any positive effect on the volume of performed internal transport work now. The reasons may lie both in more long-term effect from improving the infrastructure, and in the facts of corruption and theft of funds allocated for the project.</jats:p>"

For higher water demand of up to 250 litres per capita/day expected in an urban centre, the existing dam capacity is inadequate, and the demand should grow to 253,102 m3/day by 2037. This is the rationale for this study, which showed the feasibility of a new dam through technical reviews and analysis of topography, hydrology of the site, field and laboratory investigations, computer analyses and designs. Hydrologic simulation of rainfall-runoff processes for 57 years of rainfall data using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method gave an annual runoff volume of 59 Mm3 on a stream in Miri, which can be harnessed to assure adequate water supply in the metropolis. This will require the construction of a 25 m high embankment dam. Topographic survey and analysis indicated that the proposed site has good water retention capability. Although net flow adjustment analysis showed a high evaporation loss of up to 13.5 Mm3 annually, seepage loss is expected to be small in view of the underlying basement complex rock formation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The state of organizational supply chain performance has attracted great attention to organizations in their endeavour to create superior structures and systems to guarantee shareholder wealth maximization. An efficient and effective supply chain framework will reduce wastages and optimally grasp opportunities in the best interest of investors. Poor supply chain performance represents over 60% of the challenges facing the global and local manufacturing industry and remain a major hurdle in securing superior firm performance. The study assessed the influence of TQM on supply chain performance for manufacturing and Allied firms listed at NSE, Kenya. Specifically, the study sought to assess the effect of strategic quality planning, supplier relations management, management commitment and customer focus on Supply Chain Performance. The guiding theories included Deming’s Quality Improvement Theory, Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints and Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model. The descriptive survey research approach was used to carry out the study. A semi structured questionnaire helped in primary data collection. On the other hand, secondary data was reviewed using a document review guide. Data collection covered the period between 2013/2014 and 2017/2018 financial years. Quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques were employed. Quantitative techniques were included descriptive and inferential statistics. In particular, the multiple regression analysis aided in testing the hypotheses. From the regression analysis results, all the null hypotheses were rejected as all the TQM variables were found to influence supply chain performance. The p-value for strategic quality planning (p=0.014) is less than 0.05 level of significance which informs a conclusion that strategic quality planning has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The p- value for supplier relations management (p=0.005) is less than 0.05 level of significance which informs a conclusion that supplier relations management has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The p value for customer focus (p=0.017) is less than 0.05 level of significance which informs a conclusion that customer focus has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The p value for management commitment (p=0.004) is less than 0.05 level of significance which informs a conclusion that management commitment has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The Coefficient of Determination (R Square) stood at 0765. This meant that 76.5% of variation in supply chain performance was influenced by variation in the independent variable that is total quality management practices and its constituent variables: Strategic Quality Planning, Supplier Relations Management, Customer Focus and Management Commitment. To that effect, only 23.50% of variation in supply chain performance was explained by other factors not included in the model. Although supplier relations management was deeply entrenched, the study recommends further improvement of the framework of supplier engagement to quality initiatives which was found to be only moderately practiced. The study recommends further improvement of customer relations management function to ensure timely and effective handling of customers concerns and feedback to suppliers. The study recommends regular market research to effectively monitor and respond to new market needs as they arise.</jats:p>"

The NPI's water resources are in jeopardy. Climate change is evident in the region, and it is predicted to reduce output. The Tigris River and its tributaries, the Greater and Little Zab Rivers, as well as the Sirwan River. Extreme weather has afflicted the NPI over the last decade, ranging from droughts to torrential rainfall. For decades, water infrastructure has been neglected, environmental standards protecting water quality have been ignored, and water has been squandered due to overconsumption. In addition, the NPI's neighbours Turkey and Iran have been building a slew of dams on rivers that the NPI relies on. Some of these have the potential to have a significant impact on the Tigris flow into NPI. The water discharge of the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers is expected to drop by half in the next decade, according to the UNDP. The KRG's strategic goal is to build a significant number of dams across its territory, with the goal of storing water for irrigation and hydroelectric generation, to combat climate change, upstream dam construction, and mismanagement. Annual income for water in NPI is 28 billion meter cube but more than 20 billion meter cube was waste without benefit for water supply in general (95%) of this water was discharge without any using in for agricultural, industrial sector and domestic water supply. About the water production rate fee in NPI by Kurdistan region government (KRG) for water supply around (57400 $) every day. Water production for one day is (1.874 Million meter cubic per day) and (70 Million meters cubic per month). All of the people are responsible on their site for using water on preserving it in the rate in the region they leaving because it fact other regions.</jats:p>"

The diversity of the fruit-horticultural production in several developing countries and the excess of certain fruits or vegetables in the months of greatest production offer unique opportunities for adding value to these wastes (co-products). Within the scope of the Circular Economy, valorization of such wastes for the production of innovative bio-ingredients can open great market opportunities if efficiently exploited. In this context, this review deals with the current situation of wastes arising from fruits and vegetables (availability, characterization) as sources of valuable ingredients (fiber, polyphenols, pigments) suitable to be incorporated into food, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical products. In addition, an integral and systematic approach including the sustainable technologies generally used at both lab and industrial scale for efficient extraction of bioactive compounds from fruits and vegetables wastes are addressed. Overall, this review provides a general updated overview regarding the situation of fruits and vegetables chain supplies in the post-pandemic era, offering an integrative perspective that goes beyond the recovery of fiber and phytochemicals from the previous mentioned wastes and focuses on whole processes and in their social and economic impacts.</jats:p>"

The results of the empirical analysis reveal that while the negative supply shocks dominate at the aggregate and disaggregate levels, their magnitude varies across industries. Demand shocks to output were positive in some industries like the manufacture of food products (10), textiles (13), chemicals and chemical products (20), and electrical equipment (27), but were outweighed by the negative supply shocks. In response to the COVID-19 shock the government announced the three pronged Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (ABA), which is a blend of demand management, supply management and structural policies. It not only promises to address the short-term distress caused to the industries due to the COVID-19 shock but also attempts to make them self-reliant and resilient to such shocks in future. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: E10, C32, C40, E30 </jats:p>",

Moreover, when the demand of energy is at night, as for street lighting installations, the use of accumulative systems is necessary, which means a major drawback due to a short lifetime expectancy and high cost. The use of batteries can require more than 70% of the budget of these lighting systems and has a critical impact in the project. The problem to solve is finding different renewable energy sources that can produce energy throughout the day, especially during the night, at the same time at which it is consumed. As one of the competences of municipal authorities is water supply networks, this paper analyzes the use of energy recovery turbines within these installations as an alternative to photovoltaic generators. To study the viability and effectiveness of this alternative, the water flows available in the network of a medium-size municipality were monitored and analyzed in depth to assess the amount of recoverable energy. In addition, an energy recovery turbine (ERT) station was set up, installing a bypass around one of the pressure-reducing valves (PRV) of the installation where energy is dissipated without practical use. The results obtained imply that the system proposed has economical and technical viability, is reliable and guarantees full service in all the seasons’ conditions. Moreover, the needs of the energy storage capacity are much lower (~8%) than with solar panels.</jats:p>"

The three-phase power supply is usually used for short-circuit test of transformer. To investigate the feasibility of using a single-phase power supply in the short-circuit test of transformer, in this paper, we modeled a 200 kVA power transformer in three dimensions, using the finite element method to calculate the short-circuit current and short-circuit electromagnetic force of the windings under different excitation modes when the three-phase short-circuit occurs in the low-voltage windings. Analyze and compare the short-circuit current and short-circuit electromagnetic force distribution characteristics of windings under different working conditions. The results show that when the three-phase short-circuit condition occurred in the low-voltage windings, regardless of the three-phase excitation or single-phase excitation exerted on the high-voltage windings, the short-circuit current and the short-circuit electromagnetic force of the voltage zero-crossing closing phase is basically the same. This proves that a single-phase power supply can be used instead of a three-phase power supply for short-circuit tests. the analysis result has certain reference significance for improving the short-circuit test of transformer.</jats:p>",

Precipitation forecasting is difficult due to the randomness and uncertainty of precipitation events. CEEMD can effectively overcome modal aliasing and white noise interference. The WTD process has obvious denoising effects on the original signal. GRU can effectively solve long-term memory and reflection. Based on the advantages of problems such as gradients in propagation, a CEEMD-WTD-GRU precipitation prediction coupling model is constructed. The second decomposition of CEEMD-WTD-GRU can more effectively extract complex time series information. The time series forecasting provided a new method, which effectively improved the accuracy of the forecast and applied it to the forecast of monthly precipitation in Shanghai. The research results show that the average absolute error of the CEEMD-WTD-GRU model is 3.86, the average relative error is 3.30%, and the Nash efficiency coefficient is 0.99. The prediction accuracy is better than the CEEMD-WTD-GRU model without noise reduction, the CEEMD-LSTM model and GRU model, which shows that it has strong nonlinear and complex process learning ability in hydrological factor simulation, and can be used for regional precipitation prediction.</jats:p>",

Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out having deionized water (DW) and raw water (RW) samples fortified for atrazine (ATZ), 17β-estradiol (E2), and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Adsorption diminished due to natural organic matter, but in a smaller extension for S-PAC. Multi-solute removal efficiencies kept the same ranking for DW and RW, i.e., E2 &amp;gt; EE2 &amp;gt; ATZ, following compounds' hydrophobicity and molecular size. Hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms. For all target compounds the adsorption process was controlled by film diffusion. S-PAC presented higher adsorption as well as lower desorption as compared to powdered activated carbon, achieving similar efficiencies for half dosage and same contact time or at half contact time and same dosage. Physicochemical processes at WTP are capable to remove contaminated S-PAC particles.</jats:p>",

The neutral sections (NS) results in loss of speed, momentum and mechanical failures that are all threatening the fast and stable operation of trains and systems. In the meantime, issues with the power quality such as the negative sequence currents (NSC), the reactive power and harmonics may create problems on the three phase grid side that cannot be overlooked. To address these two issues concurrently, a new traction power supply system is designed in this paper. The proposal will also analyses the theory of operation, build the mathematical model and develop the control system for back to back converters. Small scale prototype is also made for validation of simulation results. The results shows that it can fulfil the practical requirements. The experimental results shows that the overall system is practically more appropriate for the high speed railway.</jats:p>"

It is based on the allocation of such indicators as the geological structure of the observed territory, the concentration of runoff entering the karst channels, and the precipitation regime. Due to regional climatic, hydrogeological and landscape features, a private methodology for assessing the vulnerability of karst groundwater has been developed. To assess the vulnerability of sources of non-centralized water supply, a factor is taken into account, including such indicators as lithology, soil thickness, and the presence of a karst base. The most intense karst processes occur on river terraces, valley slopes. For this purpose, a factor is taken into account, including the level of river flow by hydrogeological posts, underground flow, karst craters, tectonic faults, and vegetation. The development of karst is also promoted by high gradients of the underground flow and underground water outlets in riverbeds and coastal slopes. For this purpose, the factor is taken into account, which is formed on the basis of the criterion of the development of the karst network and the hydrographic network.</jats:p><jats:p>A relatively large amount of precipitation, especially in the form of rain, and low evaporation determine the increased values of surface and underground runoff and, accordingly, the development of dissolution and leaching processes.

As a result of the observations, spatio-temporal dependencies were identified in the controlled territory.</jats:p>",

This phenomenon has shifted to an SCM-to-SCM competition rather than corporate-to-corporate competition in the global market. Apple and Samsung Electronics are the two major global information and communications technology (ICT) companies, each choosing different SCM strategies to stabilize production while minimizing inventory and maintaining ongoing partnerships with suppliers. To analyze the relationship between strategic differences in SCM structure of the ICT companies and capital, while employing the generalized method of moments, this study analyzed partnerships with suppliers from a financial perspective for long-term growth and stable production. Results identified that the target debt ratio of Apple’s parts suppliers was 38%, which was slightly higher than that of US companies (33%). In the relationship between capital structure and SCM structures, the company’s debt ratio decreases if the strength of the strategic alliance and the strength of the horizontal integration of global parts suppliers are higher. Specifically, Apple’s parts suppliers with non-equity alliances, such as technological and R&amp;D alliances, have reduced debt ratios more than companies with equity alliances. In the case of Samsung Electronics’ parts suppliers, primary vendors had a lower debt ratio than secondary vendors. These results indicates that if the strength of the vertical integration with the international strategic alliances is greater, they are more likely to adopt a lower debt ratio policy. Identifying the relationship between SCM strategic difference and capital structure, this study provides valuable insights for corporate sustainability.</jats:p>"

However, most studies on nonlinear supply chains neither consider the fractional calculus nor take advantage of state-of-the-art emulation methods. These issues motivated the current study. A fractional-order chaotic three-echelon supply chain system is studied. At first, the system’s dynamic is studied through Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagrams. It is shown that a slight deferent in some parameters of the system can dramatically change the behavior of the system. Then, a real-time analog circuit is designed and implemented to investigate the system’s chaotic behavior. This way, the system’s chaotic attractors are empirically demonstrated. Finally, emulation and interpolation of the fractional-order chaotic system using the Gaussian process have been studied, and its luminous results have been presented.</jats:p>"

Also, a circular economy helps to reduce the waste materials and products in a supply chain. In order to include circular economy in supply chain network design, it is necessary to use the concept of closed-loop network design. Therefore, designing a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that works well even by changing some parameters seems to be necessary. This paper presents a multiproduct, sustainable closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty. First, a mathematical model is proposed to design a closed-loop network, and then a set of possible scenarios is used to deal with the uncertainty of the parameters. In order to show the validity and applicability of the proposed model, numerical examples are presented and analyzed. In this regard, numerical results show the appropriate performance of the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the role of customer demand in different aspects of sustainability. It is revealed that increasing customer demand will have a strong impact on economic and environmental objectives.</jats:p>",

In the literature, there are many research papers related to vertical collaboration in the logistics industry. However, horizontal collaboration has not received the same degree of attention. In fact, horizontal collaboration such as shared freight carrier and freight consolidation can also be considered vital for low-carbon supply chain solutions. In this paper, the problem of the design of supply chain transportation pooling strategies (SCTPS) is studied, which considers both vertical and horizontal collaboration. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of these SCTPSs to reduce CO2 emissions using discrete-event simulation (DES)-based methodology. Using a numerical case study of two manufacturing companies and three customers, five SCTPS are studied including the following: (1) non-pooling strategy; (2) multi-pick strategy; (3) multi-drop strategy; (4) central hub strategy; and (5) combined hub and multi-drop strategy. The main result of the study is that all SCTPSs significantly reduce the CO2 emissions compared to the non-pooled supply chain. In fact, the reduction in CO2 emissions can reach 13% compared to the non-pooled strategy. Moreover, the best SCTPS that gives the minimum of CO2 is the hub strategy, followed by the multi-pick strategy and the multi-drop strategy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the modern world different products and goods are available throughout the world thanks to the complex supply chain system. Often products are transported on long journeys with different transportation systems where products can be damaged or spoiled. Smart Sticker is a concept for product environmental condition monitoring that can resolve some problems in the supply chain. Smart Sticker will record product environmental data in the supply chain and enable producer/consumer product monitoring. Because of ultra-low power design, Smart Sticker component selection must satisfy ultra-low power specifications, besides standard accuracy, and real-time implementation. In this paper we give an overview of the necessary measured environmental parameters and the selection of sensors with emphasis on low power design. We provided a model for the calculation of the maximum operating time, which is applied for the two Smart Sticker instances with significantly different energy consumptions. In the worst-case scenario operation time is 198 days which can be increased with a higher capacity battery</jats:p>"

With a history of emergency preparedness, Alberta’s unique context, one that includes having an already established, centralized, and digital healthcare supply chain strategy, sets this case apart from the others in terms of pandemic responses. A key challenge navigated by Alberta was the inadequacies of traditional sourcing and procurement approaches to meet surges in product demand, which was overcome by the implementation of unique procurement strategies. Opportunities for Alberta included the integration of supply chain teams into senior leadership structures, which enabled access to data to inform public health decision-making. This case demonstrated how Alberta’s healthcare supply chain assets—its supply chain infrastructure, data, and leadership expertise, especially—contributed to resilient supply chain capacity across the province. </jats:p>",

It can be grown by utilizing minimal resources to provide unique industrial chemicals or to serve as an energy crop. However, it can be also cultivated with intensive inputs providing higher yields. Whether a high input or a low input scheme is more sustainable depends on the economic and environmental impacts of each case. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate these impacts under the Mediterranean climate and farming conditions by examining two alternative scenarios: a castor crop grown on a low-inputs field vs. a crop grown in a high-inputs one. The environmental impacts were estimated by following a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology based on GHG emissions. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed by switching the functional unit from 1 Mg of castor oil to 1 hectare. The economic feasibility of the castor crop production was assessed by calculating the gross margin, which is referred to the difference between revenues and the variable costs due to the agricultural phases. In addition, the ratio between gross margin and GWP (Global Warming Potential) emissions was applied to calculate the economic performance (gross margin) per unit of environmental burden. Findings showed that the castor oil produced by high inputs resulted in a more sustainable scenario due to its higher yield than low-inputs ones. On the other hand, sensitivity analysis showed that the field management with low inputs showed GHG emissions that were 27% lower than those emitted from the field management with high inputs. Moreover, from an economic point of view, by switching the field management from low inputs to high ones, the Gross Margin increased by about 73%. Finally, the high-inputs scenario showed the best ratio between economic performance and GHG emitted into the atmosphere.</jats:p>"

The current approaches to alteration of coal properties are reviewed. The influence of oxidation and cryogenic effects is analyzed.

Nova Scotia was able to centralize its pandemic sourcing, procurement, and management efforts to its provincial health authority.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cultivation of crops in greenhouses is well established in China. However, the greenhouse climate is complex, rendering it difficult to analyze the greenhouse load and control the energy supply system. It is important to ensure the optimal design of greenhouse operation to enable optimal crop growth and maintain low operation costs for improving the greenhouse crop production efficiency and economic benefits. To reduce the energy consumption , we propose a new integrated energy supply system. This system uses a combined cooling, heating and power system, and an air source heat pump. A two-stage integrated optimization model of the integrated energy supply system was built, with “minimum average daily economic cost” and “maximum CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission reduction rate (ERR)” as the objectives in the first stage. The characteristics of the countryside were taken into consideration for optimizing the capacity of the combined cooling, heating and power supply, energy storage and air source heat pump. In the second stage, the objectives were “maximum annual operating saving rate (OSR)”, “maximum CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission reduction rate”, and “maximum primary energy saving rate (PESR)”. The capacity of the equipment designed in the first stage is used as the constraint to optimize the operating output of the combined cooling, heating and power supply, air source heat pump. Finally, a greenhouse is used as a prototype to carry out simulation calculations for two typical days in summer and winter to verify the effectiveness of this method. The simulation results showed that after the first stage of optimization, the average daily operating cost was significantly lower and the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission rate was reduced by 49.53%. After the second stage, annual operating saving rate, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission reduction rate, and primary energy saving rate were 39.51, 48.88, and 27.57% for a typical summer day and 52.96, 50.18, and 50.13% for a typical winter day, respectively. Therefore, compared to the existing energy supply systems, the integrated energy supply system and the integrated optimization design of the system could effectively avoid energy wastage, significantly improve the degree of match between the system design and operation, reduce operating cost, and reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission.</jats:p>"

The study is based on a classification of the reviewed literature according to the following criteria: supply chain structure, environmental approach, problem type, modeling, and solution approach. As a result, 36 articles were analyzed and classified. The main findings show that studies that incorporate social sustainability into inventory management along supply chains are lacking, while environmental studies are a growing research area. Uncertainty issues also need to be incorporated into sustainable inventory management models. Another important result of this study is the definition of a roadmap with trends and future research guidelines. The identified future research guidelines include incorporating decisions that can help to improve economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Thus, future studies should focus on both following quantitative models that incorporate inventory decisions integrally with transportation and location decisions, and more complex models, and employing new algorithms and heuristics to solve them.</jats:p>"

Faced with the destabilization of its traditional supply chain, NL leveraged an existing centralized healthcare supply chain structure to organize its supply chain response to the pandemic. To overcome product shortages, health leaders collaborated with their local business community and industries to source and procure personal protective equipment and create domestic manufacturing capacity for critical supplies. The healthcare supply chain response in NL demonstrates the value of a highly integrated and centralized healthcare supply chain management strategy. It also makes clear the value of a diversified healthcare supply chain, one which draws on local manufacturing capacity to create a domestic source of critical supplies and overcome shortages from global suppliers. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we conducted a preliminary study exploring the possibility of converting flood storage in the Joe Pool Lake (JPL) as a means to improve water supply reliability and achieve better cost efficiency. This study employs a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach that considers the costs of meeting conversion demand and supply requirements over the northern portion of the Trinity River Basin. It includes trade-offs between capturing and storing natural flow versus return flow from the treatment facilities of the Trinity River Authority (TRA). A set of hypothetical prices and demand figures with the record drought of 1940-1996 considered to test the LP model. The optimal strategy yields expansion of JPL and associated storage-diversion on an annual basis. Also, the outcomes of the analyses suggest that, while the conversion would have a positive impact on water availability, storing the return flow might not produce sufficient cost savings; unless higher prices were imposed on the stored-return flow.</jats:p>"

Schlesinger's concept distinguishes dominance of the right or left coronary artery (LCA) or balanced type. LCA dominance has been reported to be associated with increased mortality. Early angiography studies have shown that the anterior interventricular artery (AIVA), a branch of the LCA, often continues on the inferior surface of the heart and may replace the inferior interventricular artery. Others considered an AIVA on the inferior surface of the heart a rare variant. A long AIVA is a strong predictor of death in acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. We determined coronary artery variance at the inferior surface of the ventricles in 134 dissected human hearts and analyzed a possible association between coronary artery variance and age at death. The AIVA extended to the inferior side in 64.9% of the hearts, but rarely reached the basal half of the inferior interventricular groove. Most frequently (53%), it extended into the apical two‐fifths of the length of the inferior ventricular walls. An AIVA extending to the apical 40% of the length of the inferior ventricular walls may therefore be considered a common variant. In 20.1% of the hearts, a right inferior diagonal artery was also found. Statistical analysis neither revealed an association between mean AIVA length at the inferior ventricular surface and type of coronary artery dominance nor an association between AIVA length at the inferior ventricular surface or coronary artery dominance type and age at death.</jats:p>",

Second, this is the first study to look at the sustainable supply chain risk management in Pakistan’s logistics industry. Four logistics companies were chosen for the study, and thirty criteria were established and divided into four categories using acquired data and literature studies. According to the findings, organizational risks are the most important to consider, whereas environmental hazards have the least influence. Supply delays, freight rate/oil price fluctuations, bankruptcy, and natural catastrophe are the four most important criteria in these categories. Limited suppliers, cargo tracking, IT system failure, and international politics are the four least significant criteria in the four risk categories. The findings are useful for the logistics industry operating in CPEC for risk mitigation and sustainable operation. The research may be used as a guideline for risk identification and management by practitioners and decision-makers in Pakistani logistics organizations.</jats:p>"

While quality function deployment (QFD) has been successfully applied to many fields of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM), there is a lack of research on constructing a house-of-quality model that can be combined with MCDM for connecting supply chain agility with sustainable supply chain risks, especially in the field of electronics manufacturing. The objective of this study was to develop an integrated framework of QFD and MCDM and to devise an effective method to mitigate sustainable supply chain risks by improving supply chain agility. Such a method can help the multinational electronics manufacturing industry to develop stable and sustainable supply chains. In a multinational electronic manufacturing enterprise as an example, the results showed that the case enterprise work should focus on improving agility ‘production and sales capability’, ‘quick decision-making/strategic flexibility’, ‘electronic shiapment of finished products to control shipment operations’, ‘supplier on-time delivery rates’ and ‘cost minimization’. Improving agility would help enhance the ‘credibility and competence of operators and leaders’ and ‘product safety and quality’ and reduce ‘goods disruption or delay due to inadequate supply mobility and poor financial performance’, ‘information system instability’, the ‘long product lead time’ and other key sustainable supply chain risks. The proposed framework can not only be effectively used by other electronics manufacturers to develop agile strategies to mitigate sustainable supply chain risks, but also provides a reference for risk management for manufacturers in other fields.</jats:p>"

In our research, we analyze supply chain disruptions in a production setting. Using a bilevel optimization framework, we minimize the total production cost for a manufacturer interested in finding optimal disruption mitigation strategies. The problem constitutes a convex network flow program under a chance constraint bounding the manufacturer’s regrets in disrupted scenarios. Thus, in contrast to standard bilevel optimization schemes with two decision-makers, a leader and a follower, our model searches for the optimal production plan of a manufacturer in view of a reduction in the sequence of his own scenario-specific regrets. Defined as the difference in costs of a <jats:italic>reactive plan</jats:italic>, which considers the disruption as unknown until it occurs, and a benchmark <jats:italic>anticipative plan</jats:italic>, which predicts the disruption in the beginning of the planning horizon, the regrets allow measurement of the impact of scenario-specific production strategies on the manufacturer’s total cost. For an efficient solution of the problem, we employ generalized Benders decomposition and develop customized feasibility cuts. In the managerial section, we discuss the implications for the risk-adjusted production and observe that the regrets of long disruptions are reduced in our mitigation strategy at the cost of shorter disruptions, whose regrets typically stay far below the risk threshold. This allows a decrease of the production cost under rare but high-impact disruption scenarios.</jats:p>",

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that the total of carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions reached 33.9 gigatons throughout 2020. A total of 13.5 gigatons of which came from electricity and heating, being the most compared to the other sources. Indonesia as the fourth most populous country in the world also contributes to carbon emissions from electricity use. The electricity consumption in Indonesia each year increases by an average of about 3.60% (from 2015-2020) and contributes to these carbon emissions. Indonesia with the largest potential sources of renewable energy (wind, solar power, geothermal and other sources), is expected to be able and develop and become a leader, especially in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Region. This paper will discuss the analysis of carbon footprint from electricity demand in Indonesia and renewable energy supply that can be used to reduce carbon emissions in dealing with climate change problems.

The nature of this process is analyzed, and the corresponding demand and supply functions with single- and multi-stage discount strategies are constructed, respectively, to create a working model. The optimal discount ratios for supermarkets and agricultural cooperatives in decentralized and centralized decision-making modes coupled with single- and multi-stage discounts are calculated, respectively. Finally, a universal optimal strategy is designed, which can be applied to various quantity decay scenarios and makes the discount strategy more generalized. The results show that discounts can coordinate supply chains more effectively; not only would fresh agricultural produce be sold out before it starts to rot, but also the benefit conflicts arising from both supermarkets vs. cooperatives and traditional vs. E-commerce channels could be equilibrated. Further, multi-stage discounts are more difficult to coordinate than single-stage ones, the corresponding optimal discount ratios rely on the initial quantity of fresh agricultural produce in the supply chain, its market share in the traditional distribution channel, the potential market size, retail price, the price sensitivity coefficient of the channel, the cross-elasticity coefficient of prices between different channels, and the properties of the quantity loss. It is concluded that, regardless of what kind of quantity and quality loss occurs, whether decentralized or centralized decision making is selected, or whether the supermarket’s or agricultural cooperative’s discount ratio is considered, a universal price discount consisting of a fixed term and a drift term could both maximize supply chain profit and coordinate this dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

A particularly difficult situation is when it is necessary to manage the process of the entire production chain with a continuous supply of raw materials. It is necessary to keep under control the actual production data, current production requirements, and adhere to the international strategy of energy saving.\nThis paper reports a devised optimal dynamic system with a continuous supply of raw materials, which automatically changes the control trajectory in order to reduce the amount of resources used. The theoretical scientific component is represented in the form of an interface model of the system, and the research results are represented in the form of time diagrams that show the verification of the proposed model.\nThe model provides for the interconnection of the chain of such developed dynamical systems, in which the continuity of the process is ensured by buffering systems, and the optimality of operation is enabled by adaptation mechanisms.\nThe time diagrams can demonstrate the interaction of systems and mechanisms that generate information signals through the port sections. At each subsequent control action, the process parameter changes were made within a set range. As a result of a targeted search for permissible controls, the system, driven by the adaptation mechanism, enabled a gradual reduction in the consumption of the energy product and stabilized the intensity of the target product being processed, which made it possible to subsequently avoid shutdowns and restarts of the production line and reduce overall production costs.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the cooperation modes between competing manufacturers in the EV (electric vehicle) supply chain, under which the common supplier launches the innovation of the key component of EV to meet the demand of two manufacturers. Three cooperation modes between manufacturers, full cooperation, partial cooperation, and noncooperation, are established to depict the pricing decisions by the Stackelberg game. We find out that, when competition degree is small, it is more profitable to choose partial cooperation, while it is more advantageous to choose full cooperation when competition degree is high, and the manufacturer’s basic market demand is relatively small. Therefore, it is always preferred for the common supplier to expect noncooperation between manufacturers. Under the background that basic market demand ratio changes with competition degree between markets, it could be better for the whole supply chain when without cooperation or partial cooperation depended on the supplier power while it could be better for customers when full cooperation or partial cooperation depended on the competition degree between manufacturers.</jats:p>",

We find that housing demolition reduces overall labor force participation by ~3.3 percentage points and farm work participation by ~4.4 percentage points. We also find that the negative impact on labor force participation is mainly driven by older people, women, less‐educated people, and people living in rural regions. The negative impact of housing demolition on labor force participation persists over time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainably managing multifunctional landscapes for production of multiple ecosystem services (ES) requires thorough understanding of the interactions between ES and the ecological processes that drive them. We build upon landscape connectivity theory to present a spatial approach for assessing functional connections between multiple ES at the landscape scale, and take a closer look at the concept of ES interactions by explicitly representing the mechanisms behind the relationships between ES. We demonstrate application of the approach using existing ES supply mapping data for plant agriculture, waterflow regulation, and landscape aesthetics and map the functional connectivity between them. We find that, when weights of all linkages were amalgamated, areas of high-value connectivity are revealed that are not present on any individual ES supply area or pairwise link maps, which suggests that the spatial focus of planning for optimal service provisioning may shift when functional relationships between several ES are considered. From water flow supply areas, our modeling maps several functional connections that operate over both short and long distances, which highlights the importance of managing ES flows both locally and across jurisdictions. We also found that different land use and land cover types than those associated with ES supply areas may be serving as critical corridors connecting interdependent ES. By providing spatial information on ES connectivity, our approach enables local and regional environmental planning and management to take full consideration of the complex, multi-scale interactions between ecological processes, land use and land cover, and ecosystem service supply on a landscape.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health systems are recognised as playing a potentially important role in many risk management strategies; however, there is strong evidence that health systems themselves have been the victims of unanticipated risks and have lost their functionality in providing reliable services. Existing risk identification and assessment tools in the health sector, particularly in the blood supply chain, address and evaluate risks without taking into account their interdependence and a holistic perspective. As a result, the aim of this paper is to develop a new systemic framework based on a semi-quantitative risk assessment approach to measure supply chain risks, which will be implemented through a case study on the Iranian BSC. This paper identifies and assesses supply chain risks (SCRs) by employing a novel systemic process known as SSM-SNA-ISM (SSI). First, the supply chain and its risks are identified using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). Then, given the large number of risks, the second stage uses Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify the relationships between the risks and select the most important ones. In the third stage, risk levelling is performed with a more in-depth analysis of the selected risks and the application of Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), and further analysis is performed using the Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). The study found that by using the new proposed approach, taking into account risk relationships, and taking a holistic view, various supply chain risks could be assessed more effectively, especially when the number of risks is large. The findings also revealed that resolving the root risks of the blood supply chain frequently necessitates management skills. This paper contributes to the literature on supply chain risk management in two ways: First, a novel systemic approach to identifying and evaluating risks is proposed. This process offers a fresh perspective on supply chain risk modelling by utilising systems thinking tools. Second, by identifying Iranian BSC risks and identifying special risks.</jats:p>"

In this article, we analyse the complexities of patient investors’ entry into residential markets in London and their response to the first major, and unexpected, crisis of demand: the COVID-19 pandemic and immediate falls in market demand. We focus on how patient capital and the firms invested in the professionalised rental market, build to rent (BTR), have responded. We highlight three main responses: (1) advancing their lobbying efforts to secure a more supportive political environment; (2) protecting their income streams by offering new payment plans and adaptability to prevent void rates; (3) turning to a ‘reserve army’ of renters backed by the state – so-called Key Workers (KWs). We argue these demonstrate a continual and co-evolutionary dimension to policy promoting patient capital and the need for patient planning to govern patient investment in housing systems. Our findings are in ‘real-time’ and highlight the importance of structural uncertainties and the breakdown of long-term assumptions in shaping investment decisions. </jats:p>",

The cluster is a group of localized interdependent companies, equipment suppliers, components, specialized services, infrastructure, research institutes, universities and other organizations that complement and enhance each other's competitive advantages. Current common problems that hinder the normal functioning of local communities are: utilities and energy efficiency, investment climate and investment, public safety, problems of access to administrative services, communication problems between the leadership of the local community and local population, environmental issues. Based on the results of the study of the internal environment of the united territorial community, the benefits of cluster approach and the benefits that can provide a multisourcing model, it is determined that the main problems that hinder the normal functioning of modern communities can be solved by forming a logistics cluster. The logistics cluster will allow to fully implement the multisourcing model of ensuring the livelihood of the local community. Such model of decision-making on the rational choice of source of supply from several alternatives will: improve the quality of supply management of goods / services; reduce the logistics cycle; reduce supply costs; increase the reliability of supplies, etc. Thus, the formation of a logistics cluster at the level of ensuring the livelihood of the territorial community helps to strengthen the competitiveness of each of the participants. The main participants of the cluster are: production and logistics companies located in the most important centers of intersection and origin of goods and goods, directly involved in the process of providing services.</jats:p>"

Regional cooperation among urban water utilities is a powerful mechanism for improving supply reliability and financial stability in urban water supply systems. Through coordinated drought mitigation and joint infrastructure investment, water utilities can efficiently exploit existing water supplies and reduce or delay the need for new supply infrastructure. However, cooperative water management brings new challenges for planning and implementation. The benefits of cooperation may not be uniformly distributed across cooperating partners, resulting in the “instability” of cooperative compromises. Further, cooperation may add new vulnerabilities for each partner by imbuing their cooperating partners with the power to impact their performance through policy actions. Power imbalances stemming from these vulnerabilities can lead to conflict between cooperating partners that destabilize otherwise robust planning alternatives. This work contributes a new exploratory modeling centered framework for assessing cooperative stability and mapping power relationships in cooperative infrastructure investment and water supply management policies. Our framework uses multi‐objective optimization as an exploratory tool to discover how cooperating partners may be incentivized to defect from robust regional water supply partnerships and identifies how the actions of each regional partner shape the vulnerability of its cooperating partners. Our methodology is demonstrated on the Sedento Valley, a highly challenging hypothetical regional urban water supply benchmarking problem. Our results reveal complex regional power relationships between the region's cooperating partners and suggest ways to improve cooperative stability.</jats:p>",

The root/shoot ratio, root vitality, number of nodules, nodule weight, and nitrogenase activity were affected remarkably by soil moisture or the level of added P across the whole stage. Differences were found in the interaction effect between soil moisture and added P on the characteristic indices of the root and nodule at the different growth stages. There were obvious differences in root activity and nitrogenase activity at seedling stage, but no evident differences were found in other indices. Certain differences were also found in the indicators mentioned above at the branching stage. W1P0 and W2P0 showed the highest root/shoot ratio, W2P2 and W3P2 resulted in the highest root activity; W3P3 and W3P2 had the highest number and weight of nodules; and W3P2, W2P2, and W3P1 had higher nitrogenase activity than the other treatments at the full-flowering stage. The application of P at 60 kg hm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>and the relative soil moisture of 75% was the best P-water combination suitable for the root development, nodule formation, and nitrogen fixation of Chinese milk vetch.

Fluent was used to conduct a 3‐D numerical simulation of heat and mass transfer between air and water in the tower. Taking the Shenyang area as an example, the influence of different air parameters was analyzed. When air velocity was 2.0 m/s and water flow velocity was 1.0 m/s, the heat supply performance was the best. When outdoor dry bulb temperature was 34°C, the contact heat transfer increased underground water temperature by 1.4°C. When wet bulb temperature of air was 23.7°C and the dew point temperature of water vapor was 20.0°C, the condensation heat transfer increased underground water temperature by 2.0  4.0°C. The total temperature rise of water in HST was 3.0 ~ 5.0°C when it was in contact with air, which can effectively alleviate the problem of groundwater temperature decrease. In this study, the static analysis method was used to analyze the economy of the tower and solar energy heat supplement. The conclusion was that the heating cost of the heating tower is lower.</jats:p>",

To overcome this problem, a variety of techniques have been developed and implemented, one of the most recent being the condensation of water from humid air. Aqueous vapour in the Earth's atmosphere includes a significant amount of water that could be used to supply potable water. One of the methods for condensing water vapour in humid air is to use thermoelectric coolers. In this study, production of potable water by thermoelectric coolers, which is one of the optimal methods for trapping moisture in order to produce fresh water by condensation, has been studied. Fundamental concepts in the design of thermoelectric coolers for the production of potable water have been discussed by the thermoelectric element. According to the specification of temperature, pressure, relative humidity and desired geographical location variables, the maximum amount of water production can be achieved. Modelling results demonstrate higher water production with the thermoelectric method for Ramsar (318 L) in comparison to Bandar‐Abbas. Similarly, for this geographical point, the proposed hybrid solar panels efficiency results in 62.67% by mid‐December with 49.33% on thermal efficiency and 13.33% on electrical efficiency.</jats:p>",

Water contamination by sewage waste is one of the most important causes of water pollution world-wide.\nObjectives: To detect the causative infectious agents from all hospitalized patients hailing from an area of simultaneous outbreak of jaundice and fever and also to highlight the importance of regular bacteriological tests of drinking water.\nMaterials and Methods: This observational study was carried out among 1298 patients reported to CMH Chattogram between April 2018 to May 2018. For diagnosis, all relevant investigations were done following standard laboratory proceducers in CMH Chattogram, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Dhaka and in ICDDR,B.\nResults: Out of 1298 admitted patients, 933(71.9%) patients had symptoms of acute viral hepatitis (AVH). IgM anti-HEV were found positive (100%) in 550 randomly selected hepatitis patients. From seropositive cases, 7 of the 10 random samples (70%) were found HEV-RNA positive by real time PCR. Co-infection of AVH with enteric fever was detected in 73(5.6%) patients. Only enteric fever was diagnosed in 150 (35.7%) high febrile cases. Water for bacteriological tests revealed thermos-tolerant E. coli immediately before and during the outbreak.\nConclusion: Providing safe drinking water in a developing country is always a big issue. Contaminated drinking water can transmit deadly enteric pathogen that often causes a catastrophe of mass population. Only ensuring safe water distribution systems following WHO guidelines can minimize these sufferings.\nJAFMC Bangladesh. Vol 17, No 1 (June) 2021: 7-9</jats:p>"

The angular protection was integrated into the exclusion and restricted zones proposed by the distance protection scheme for simulation analysis to develop a transmit power control scheme based on the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. Its performances were extensively analyzed through simulations. The proposed scheme was evaluated in practical scenarios: rural macrocells, urban macrocells, and urban microcells, as defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The influence of antenna type was also researched, and BSs with 4 × 4, 8 × 8 and 16 × 16 antenna arrays, as specified by 3GPP, were considered for 5G networks. Finally, the results prove that the angular protection solution can solve the coexistence of the 5G system and the FSS. In addition, when angular protection and distance protection are used simultaneously, the coexistence effect of the two systems can be strengthened. Moreover, this work provides a quantitative perception for selecting system parameters, including an interference margin for the different scenarios and antenna types, the exclusion size, and the reduction area.</jats:p>"

The total N fertilizer dose [(0 (N0), 100 (N1), 200 (N2), and 300 (N3) kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>] was split into two (T1, one-third at sowing and two-thirds at the six-leaf stage) or three (T2, one-third each at sowing, six-leaf, and eleven-leaf stage) times application. The results showed that the highest yield was obtained under N3T2, N2T1, and N3T2 in 2018, 2019, and 2020, which was 222.49, 185.31, and 194.00% than that of N0 in each year, respectively. N2 and N3 significantly increased the yield through enhancing ears ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, grains per plant, and 100-grain weight; however, N2 and N3 did not show a significant difference in yield and above-yield components. In addition, N application time did not significantly change yield under the same N rate. N0 limited the activities of starch metabolizing enzymes, resulting in insufficient accumulation of sucrose and starch. The contents of indole-3-acetic acid, cytokinin, abscisic acid, and gibberellin were decreased under N0 during grain filling. The average grain-filling rate and maximum grain-filling rate (<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) and grain weight increment achieving <jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub> increased under N2 and N3, and the grain-filling parameters were positively correlated with 100-grain weight. In conclusion, 200 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> with one-third application at sowing and two-thirds application at the six-leaf stage is a suitable N supply way to improve starch metabolizing enzymes, regulate hormone content, and enhance grain-filling rates, and thus increasing the maize yield in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China.</jats:p>"

This paper develops a dynamic pricing game model of multichannel supply chain, and focuses on the impacts of channel competition on the complex characteristics of the evolutionary dynamic game, using analyses based on stability domain, bifurcation diagram, the largest Lyapunov exponent, attractor domain and time series. The results indicate that the system will gradually enter chaotic state through flip bifurcation from stable state with the increase of price adjustment speed, and the two-dimensional stability domain will shrink as the competition coefficient increases. Interestingly, although an increase in commission rate will lead to a decrease in profits, it will widen the stability range of the whole system. In the end, for further analysis, the chaotic behavior of the multichannel supply chain is controlled by using the feedback control method. The manufacturer is suggested to adopt a cautious pricing strategy in the stability region, and minimize the direct competition between channels in the sales process and diversify the productions in different channels. </jats:p>",

Lack of quality assurance in centralized data storage makes us move towards a new approach based on a decentralized system in which transparency and quality assurance is guaranteed throughout the supply chain from producer to consumer. The current supply chain model has some disadvantages like a communication gap between the entities of the supply chain and no information about the travel history and origin of the product. The use of technology improves the communication and relation between various farmers and stakeholders. Blockchain technology acquires transparency and traceability in the supply chain, provides transaction records traceability, and enhances security for the whole supply chain. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based, fully decentralized traceability model that ensures the integrity and transparency of the system. This new model eliminated most of the disadvantages of the traditional supply chain. For the coordination of all transactions in the supply chain, we proposed a decentralized supply chain model along with a smart contract.</jats:p>",

The role of energy supply is focused on monitoring and compliance with standards. However, in recent years, the importance of energy supply to the housing stock has increased significantly, which has led to an expansion of the role of management within the framework of the risk management function. Kazakhstan has a Unified electric power system, which is represented by a set of power stations, transmission lines, and substations that provide reliable and high-quality energy supply to consumers. Currently, the main task within the framework of the priority of the development of Kazakhstan’s energy sector is to build up the energy base and provide the growing needs of the population and the economy with the necessary energy resources based on the development of modern energy complexes and alternative energy sources in conjunction with the implemented and planned macroprojects. Since the current economic development of Kazakhstan is closely interrelated with the realization of energy resources and their effective use, it acts as one of the fundamental levers for the development of the national economy. According to our research goal, it is necessary to consider sustainable energy supply in the country based on the analysis and assessment of energy consumption volumes and the impact of the country’s regional and sectoral policies on their use. The author’s approach to the distribution of countries by MNC has been developed and estimates of regression parameters, correlation coefficients, and elasticity coefficients. When constructing the author’s approach, the countries of Europe and Central Asia were studied and a sample of estimates was carried out, which has statistically significant effects on the formation of energy consumption volumes in the Republic of Kazakhstan.</jats:p>"

Here the groundwater is the main source for domestic, agricultural and industrial activities similarly to any other region of the world. The suitability for drinking and for irrigation was evaluated on the basis of water quality index, salinity risk, hardness risk, sodium risk, magnesium risk, permeability index, water infiltration rate, Kelly index and Wilcox and Richards diagrams. The aquifer system is mainly composed of alluvium (gravel, sand, silt, clay, …) from the Mio-Plio-Quaternary. The results of this study highlighted that the majority of the chemical elements analyzed exceed the WHO's drinking water standards and FAO's irrigation water standards. Based on the GroundWater Quality Index (GWQI) results, the Upper and Middle Cheliff groundwater plains shows Doubtful class in most of the plains. In addition, the GroundWater Quality Index for Irrigation (GWQII) shows the predominance of the Good/Permissible groundwater quality class in most of the plains. According to these results, drinking water can cause health problems (a danger) for the human consumption making necessary a proper treatment be able to use it. As for irrigation water, it does not present a danger for irrigating for the vast fields of the region, with the exception of sensitive crops such as: garlic, onion, beans and strawberry. The proposed approach demonstrated to be appropriate in assessing the groundwater quality for irrigation and drinking water supply since it can be easy applicable and suitable in humid, arid or semi-arid regions around the world.</jats:p>",

Supply chain enterprises strengthen corporate social responsibility (CSR) management for their own development. To improve CSR throughout the supply chain, it requires coordination and cooperation among the members of the supply chain. In this paper, we consider a three-tier supply chain system consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer and use stochastic differential game to study the CSR coordination of the supply chain. The following indicators are investigated under four decision situations, such as the optimal level of CSR effort for the supply chain members, the optimal value of profit for the supply chain members and the supply chain system, and the expectation and variance of CSR goodwill. Some important results are obtained. (i) Compared with decentralized decision-making, the optimal level of CSR effort increases for the supplier and the manufacturer under local alliance decision-making without cost sharing, whereas the optimal level of CSR effort remains unchanged for the retailer. (ii) Compared with local alliance decision-making without cost sharing, the optimal level of CSR effort remains unchanged for the supplier and the manufacturer under local alliance decision-making with cost sharing. When the sum of the marginal profit for the supplier and the manufacturer is greater than half of the marginal profit for the retailer, the optimal level of CSR effort increases for the retailer. (iii) Compared with local alliance decision-making with cost sharing, the optimal level of CSR effort increases for the supply chain members under overall alliance decision-making. (iv) From decentralized decision-making to local alliance decision-making without cost sharing, to local alliance decision-making with cost sharing, and then to overall alliance decision-making, the optimal value of profit increases for the supply chain members and the supply chain system.

The imposition of tariffs seriously disturbs the global trade and supply chain operations. This paper studies a supply chain composed of an overseas manufacturer, a domestic supplier and a third-party integrated international logistics service provider. A three-level decentralized leader-follower decision-making model and its variant--leader-follower alliance decision-making models are established, and the influences of revenue sharing and cost sharing on the three-level decentralized decision-making are analyzed. The results show that it is difficult for the supply chain to achieve coordination when the transportation and insurance costs are considered in the tariff cost. The increase of tariff rates will reduce the profits of all parties and the overall profit of the supply chain, and weaken the dominant position of the supplier in the supply chain. Revenue sharing can improve the supply chain performance; the performance of the whole supply chain cannot be improved or may even deteriorate by sharing the transportation cost alone. The study can provide practitioners with implications for how to carry effective cooperation and coordination in the supply chain and how to effectively reduce the influence of tariffs in the global trade system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a developing country, construction industry provides considerable contribution to the Socioeconomic growth of Sri Lanka. However, successful completion of a construction project is yet a challenging task. It requires coordination, collaboration and management of different stakeholders with different objectives. While achieving the objectives of a construction project, a proper management of supply chain is vital as improper management of the supply chain impacts negatively on the construction project delivery process. Prior studies have identified several interfaces which impact on the successful project delivery. The mechanism related to contractor-subcontractor interface highly impacts the ultimate project outcome as it is directly linked with the delivery of the project. This study set out to identify the critical supply chain problems in contractor-subcontractor interface in Sri Lankan building construction projects. The study was derived through a mix method approach. Semi structured interviews were carried out among the industry expertise to identify the supply chain related problems. Thereafter, to identify the critical problems of supply chain, a questionnaire survey was carried out among the industry practitioners in the building construction projects. The data was analyzed using Relative Important Index in order to rank and identify the severity of each identified problem in the contractor – subcontractor interface. The study indicates that, using verbal information, lack of reference to the main contract and nonresponsible responses as the critical problems in the Information flow. In terms of the Material flow: deliveries are not according to the plan, poor labour management and noncompliance with material and components are ranked as the critical problems. Delay in payments, back-to-back payments and payment interest charging as the critical problems under the Capital flow. These findings may assist the industry practitioners to identify the criticality and monitor supply chain problems in contractor- subcontractor interface and to minimize them in building construction projects.

Additionally, a 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was utilized to evaluate the flow pattern and dimensions of the separation zone. Results showed that enhancing the roughness coefficient can reduce the separation zone dimensions up to 38% while the drop implementation effect can scale down this area differently based on the roughness coefficient used. Combining both methods can reduce the separation zone dimensions up to 63%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Family farmers’ participation in marketing channels has prompted debates on the types of market best suited to this type of farmer. Commodity production by rural communities and the role of agribusiness long marketing channels for family-based farmers are the subjects of numerous qualitative studies. However, quantitative studies capable of assessing the relevance of long channels to family-based farmers are scarce. Therefore, this study intends to assess the relevance of long marketing channels for family farmers. Methods: We compiled the data from the survey responses of family farmers from 155 municipalities in a state in the central region of Brazil. Results: (1) There was an economic concentration of some marketing channels, namely, the sale of commodities occurred in 35% of the municipalities and included 4.15% of the sampled family farmers. The income derived through these channels represented 2.13% of the farmers’ total income included in the study. (2) There is a low diversity of market types. On average, we found 2.95 long marketing channels per municipality. (3) Family farmers’ participation is low in most commodity long channels. Between 0.11% and 4.15% of the family farmers in the sampled municipalities participate in these channels. Long channels linked to the cattle production chain showed more relevant capacity for inclusion. Conclusions: Contrary to the expectations of those behind initiatives to promote the marketing and sale of locally-sourced commodities within rural communities, agribusiness long marketing channels provide limited opportunities for family farmers to market their goods.</jats:p>"

This goal was achieved as part of extensive research on the impact of relational capital on the innovativeness of high-tech companies in Poland. The results of the research were analysed using fuzzy conversion scales and descriptive statistics based on triangular fuzzy numbers. The application of the achievements of the fuzzy sets theory made it possible to test the hypotheses presented in the article with the use of fuzzy analysis of variance (fuzzy ANOVA). The findings confirm that the subjective scope of collaboration in the supply chain is important for greening innovation. Companies that cooperate with both suppliers and customers (Upstream–downstream External Collaboration) declared a greater tendency to green their innovations than those that cooperate with only one group of partners. The research findings contribute to the literature on the role of collaboration in the ecological responsibility and environmental performance of supply chain partners. The conclusions may have practical implications for the design and implementation of strategies in sustainable supply chain management. The study provides important lessons for SC managers facing the challenge of sustainable management during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.</jats:p>"

In this study, a new non-local thermoelastic model is presented in which the size-dependent effect has been included in the equations of motion and constitutive relations. To establish the proposed generalized model of heat conduction, the Moore-Gibson-Thompson concept was used. As an application to the presented model, a problem of thermally induced behavior in an infinite nonlocal solid with a cylindrical hole whose surrounding surface is free of traction and affected by a time-dependent moving heat supply is studied. In the transformed field of the Laplace transform, analytical formulas for thermophysical fields have been derived. To obtain the numerical results of the physical field, an approximate approach was applied to find the numerical inversion. The effect of non-localization and heat source velocity on the responses of the investigated fields is graphically illustrated and discussed in detail. The results show that Eringen’s non-local elasticity model is a promising criterion for analyzing nanostructures, taking into account the effect of small size.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Competing and coexisting policies (CACPs) may arise from the incompatibility of incentives, standards, and regulatory models between a local state and a federal government, or between two government jurisdictions across which supply networks operate. Traditional studies of supply chain dynamics typically explore the impact of policy regimens as standalone instruments. This study explores how the interplay between CACP regimens can affect the supply dynamics between producers, customers, and their intermediaries. We use a supply network configuration lens to assess implications for supply chain actors and system‐level outcomes. Our work is motivated by the federal‐state dissonance in the current dispute between India's farmers and the federal government regarding new laws that impact agricultural supply chains in India. In this case, alternative and coexisting policy interventions, ostensibly aimed at modernizing and transforming production and distribution, can lead to significant supply chain netting and inventory pooling reconfigurations in terms of material, information, and financial flows among Indian agricultural stakeholders, along with inventory repositioning and market creation options. In addition, of significance is the consequent shift in the balance between state/nation and federal/supranational equity and bargaining power, an increasingly relevant context where supply chains operate across a common but multi‐jurisdictional territory, and implications for system‐level outcomes, in this particular case equity, welfare economics, and food security. We conclude by pointing to the implications of CACP regimens, and their interplay, for the broader field of operations management and supply chain research. </jats:p>",

A complex leadership structure, led by political leaders, with limited healthcare supply chain expertise at decision-making tables and a prioritization of “hospitals first” early in the first wave were described as challenges Ontario faced in managing the pandemic. A lack of supply chain digital infrastructure—and consequently, lack of available data—meant informed decision-making regarding supply utilization and demand forecasting was not possible. The Ontario case presents key lessons learned regarding the unintended consequences of lack of supply chain coordination across organizations, and the prioritization of hospitals and allocation strategies on Canada’s most vulnerable population segments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Our work delves into supply chain coordination involving a single supplier selling a single product to multiple downstream buyers. We consider the case when the supplier proposes implementing vendor-managed inventory (VMI) for each buyer. The VMI contract involves the buyers charging a penalty to the supplier on the excess inventory whenever the supplier exceeds some pre-decided inventory threshold. Unlike the works covered predominantly in the VMI literature involving penalty, where both the penalty and the threshold are exogenous, we develop a model to determine both endogenously. In our study, the supplier deciding on the penalty and the inventory threshold needs to ensure that each of the buyers’ interests is protected, that is, none of the buyers becomes worse off from the optimal position, thereby ensuring the willing participation of all the buyers. We further compared our model with the centralized Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS) model and other existing models. We show that our model has a cost equivalence with the JELS model with unequal order intervals. We also show the superiority of our proposed model over the existing VMI models in terms of the overall costs. Finally, we examine the impact of size and ordering cost on each buyers’ costs through numerical analysis. </jats:p>",

The temperature gradient on the sides of these cells is created by a vortex tube. A special boost DC/DC converter provides an increase in the output voltage of thermoelectrochemical cells up to the voltage that is necessary to power electronic devices. A supercapacitor is used to store energy in the time intervals between sensor activation. A study of an experimental sample of the power supply system for wireless sensors was conducted.

Although ECC exercise has a more beneficial effect on these factors than CON exercise, its benefits on vital organs are still unclear. This study investigated the mode‐of‐action‐dependent effects on myocardial perfusion index. Seventeen healthy men (age: 26 ± 5 years) were randomly enrolled in CON (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 9) and ECC (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 8) groups. Transient exercise and regular training (three‐day a week for 4‐week) included bicep curl comprising 5‐set of 10‐repetition, each using 75% one‐repetition maximum concentric loading. The ECC group performed one‐repetition of ECC for 3‐s and CON for 1‐s, while the CON group performed one‐repetition of CON for 3‐s and ECC for 1‐s. All participants were assessed for subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR, myocardial perfusion index) and aortic diastolic pressure decay. Before study, these were found to be same for both groups.

Besides, it helps to ensure the availability of the pharmaceutical in an adequate quantity and improving the quality of services provided. This study aimed to assess the status of the pharmaceutical supply chain practices and associated factors from the healthcare professional’s perspective in public health facilities. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design, complemented with a qualitative study, was conducted in public health facilities between April 30 and June 30, 2018. The data were collected with self-administering questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. Epidata and SPSS version 20 was utilized for quantitative data entry and analysis, respectively. Simple and multiple linear regressions were done. A variable with a P-value less than .05 was considered as significantly associated. Twenty-seven key informants were interviewed for qualitative study and the data were analyzed using the thematic analysis method. Result: A total of 425 questionnaires were distributed to respondents and 413 questionnaires were filled and returned successfully. Supplier relationship management and information sharing and technology were underperformed supply chain practices with a mean value of 2.64 and 2.39, respectively. On the contrary, inventory management was a better-performed supply chain practice with a mean of 3.22. The linear regression analysis revealed that the Integrated Pharmaceutical Logistics System [IPLS] skill of the staff and management support were the factors significantly associated with the performance of most supply chain practices. Additional, in-depth interviews exposed that the shortage of budget, poor management support, and lack of staff commitment were the major challenges for most supply chain practices. Conclusion: Generally, the study revealed that most of the supply chain practices were poorly executed in public health facilities. Besides, the pharmaceutical supply chain practices were compromised by budget constraints, staff ignorance, and lack of administrative support. </jats:p>",

Underground waters of karst origin are a vulnerable component of the geological environment to the influence of modern anthropogenic factors that violate natural hydrogeological and geoecological conditions. One of the indicators of the development of karst processes is the level of river runoff and mineralization of underground water. The results of the analysis of these data make it possible to increase the efficiency of geoecological monitoring systems and to increase the accuracy of forecast estimates of negative changes in groundwater in the territory of non-centralized water supply. When processing heterogeneous spatial data, it is proposed to identify anomalous deviations of parameters. An algorithm has been developed that determines the critical states of karst water vulnerability indicators. A system of equations has been compiled to find the necessary value of the indicators of vulnerability of karst waters, at which the state of underground water passes into a critical state. The paper analyzes data on the salt content and electrical conductivity of groundwater at key points and the number of karst dips. Preliminary hydrogeological work was carried out to determine the conditions of movement of karst waters associated with the lithological heterogeneity of the massif and the degree of karst formation. The results obtained can be used to improve the regional model for assessing the resources of vulnerability and protection of groundwater and forecast the activation of destructive karst processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 456 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Recent advances in treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes novel immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinases. However, there is no treatment option for the heavily treated HCC patients, and the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, such as oxaliplatin based doublets, are unknown. We aimed to investigate the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in advanced HCC patients who failed sorafenib treatment. Methods: This prospective single-arm, single-center phase II trial was conducted in Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea. Gemcitabine 1000mg/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> IV D1 and oxaliplatin 100mg/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> IV D1 were given every 2 weeks to Child Pugh Class A or B7 HCC patients who progressed after or cannot tolerate sorafenib treatment. Patients with HCC of &gt;60% liver occupation or portal vein invasion at the main portal branch (Vp4) were excluded. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6months and the secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety profile, and exploratory molecular biomarker analysis. Results: Total of 32 patients were treated between May 2015 and July 2019 with median follow up of 10.2 months. Most of the patients were ECOG PS 1 (93.8%), B-viral (90.6%), and BCLC-C (96.9%). Patients had multiple distant metastatic sites including lung (81.2%) and lymph node (34.3%). Patients were heavily treated with 25% of patients treated as fourth-line and 18.7% of patients treated as fifth-line or later. The PFS rate at 6 months was 15.6%. Median PFS was 3.87 months and median OS was 10.5 months. 9.4% of the patients achieved partial response, and DCR was 65.6%. Median number of treatment cycles were 6 (range, 3 to 25). Treatment-related AE (≥G3) occurred in 15 patients (46.9%) including 5 patients (15.6%) with asthenia, 5 patients (15.6%) with sensory neuropathy, and 4 patients (12.5%) with thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin for sorafenib failed, heavily treated advanced HCC were tolerable and showed modest efficacy. Although novel agents are currently adopted in clinics to treat advanced HCC, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin could be considered as later-line treatment option for heavily treated HCC patients. Exploratory molecular biomarker analysis results will be presented. </jats:p>",

However, the exact minerals that are released by PSF and the nutrients that are made available to plants remain unclear. This study quantitatively investigated the behaviour of nutrients released from PSF by the batch‐release test and their supply to plants by the plant growth tests, respectively, to determine the quantitative relationship between nutrients released from PSF and taken up by the plant. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that kalsilite, åkermanite, and potassium–magnesium silicate were the most abundant crystalline minerals in PSF. The XRD peaks of åkermanite and potassium–magnesium silicate were absent after citric acid extraction at a liquid/solid ratio of 20 to 100 (CA20 and CA100). Magnesium‐use efficiencies in PSF (11%) and residue treatments after ammonium acetate extraction (AC, 10%) were higher than those in residue treatments after CA20 (1.8%) and CA100 (6.0%). Potassium (%) released by AC in the batch‐release test (4.5%) was compatible with the difference of potassium‐use efficiencies between the treatments of PSF (21%) and the AC‐residue (16%). Likewise, potassium (%) released by CA20 (8.8%) was lower than the difference of potassium‐use efficiencies between the treatments of PSF (21%) and CA20‐residue (7.9%). This study suggests that potassium is rapidly released from potassium–magnesium silicate in PSF and is readily available to plants.</jats:p>",

Fertilizer adjustment equations and ready reckoners were developed with and without FYM for different targeted yield and soil test values of N, P and K. It was observed that response of hybrid maize to N, P and K fertilizers was higher when integrated with FYM application as compared to N,P and K alone.

Based on bounded rationality, the complexity of pricing, service level, and emission reduction effort decisions in an ECSC is investigated in two scenarios: horizontal Nash (HN) game and long-term platform Stackelberg (LPS) game. Finally, the effects of different adjustment speeds and critical parameters on decision variables, profits, and system stability are analyzed through various numerical simulations. The study revealed that the price adjustment parameters have a more noticeable impact on the stability and profit of ECSC in both scenarios. It is interesting that the chaos caused by the adjustment speed of the platform’s decisions leads to a decrease in the platform’s profits. However, it causes continuous fluctuations in low-carbon manufacturers’ profits. In the HN game, when the increase of critical parameters is beneficial to low-carbon manufacturers, the system’s stability will decrease. In addition, the system’s stability in the LPS game is only affected by the adjustment speed of the platform’s decisions. By comparison, we find that the adjustment of the platform’s price plays a vital role in the ECSC under different power structures. Finally, the adaptive adjustment mechanism is used to control the chaos caused by the price of the platform in the ECSC system.</jats:p>",

A scheme for using this gas in the process of the working agent pumping to maintain reservoir pressure is proposed. A method of oil production by treating the formation is considered, including oil withdrawal from the producing well, separation of water and associated gas from it in the separator, gas combustion in the heat engine, the use of the energy obtained in the engine to drive pumps and an electric generator, heating water and pumping it into the formation, pumping combustion products into the formation, characterized in that the gas supplied to the heat engine is taken from the producing well annulus and due to this, the pressure in the annulus is regulated, regardless of the pressure in the linear oil pipeline, ensuring maximum gas withdrawal while maintaining the optimal dynamic level in the well for a given operation mode, the gas from the separator is pumped into the reservoir, and the water is heated to a temperature higher than the melting point of paraffin for this field. The article offers a solution to this problem by generating electricity directly in the oil field using a heat engine. At the same time, hot water is pumped into the reservoir. The water is heated by the combustion products of the heat engine, which employs annular gas as fuel. The proposed method allows water to be heated to a temperature exceeding the melting point of paraffin and characterized in that the water is heated in a mixing heat exchanger. The proposed solution is characterized in that the combustion products together with the gas coming from the separator are pumped into the reservoir using water-gas technologies. It is important that nitrogen is separated from the combustion products, and the remaining gases are pumped into the formation, and gas is additionally supplied to the input of the heat engine from an external source.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mango (<jats:italic>Mangifera indica</jats:italic>L.) is a widely consumed fruit in tropical/subtropical regions around the world due to its excellent flavor and taste, and valuable source of nutrients and phytochemical compounds. As a climacteric fruit, mango is easily perishable after harvesting due to the ripening process, environmental conditions, and improper postharvest handling, leading to significant quality losses as well as economic loss throughout a supply chain. Postharvest losses are attributed to harvesting at an improper maturity stage, poor postharvest pretreatment, improper packing and packaging, inappropriate storage temperature and distribution conditions. These caused mechanical damage, sap burn, spongy tissue, weight loss, fruit softening, decay, chilling injury, and postharvest diseases. Currently, each step in the supply chain has been applied many postharvest technologies to reduce the quality losses of mango fruits as well as improving their marketability with the highest retention of quality. This review documented available possible causes for the quality losses and observed the physicochemical changes of mango fruit when applying postharvest technologies at each critical step in the mango supply chain from harvesting, pre-treatment, packaging, storage, to distribution. The summarized information is expected to provide comprehensive quality changes of mango fruits and point out the proper technology at each step of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The pricing decision under the cases of manufacturer is with sufficient fund, with limited fund, via debt financing and via equity financing are solved on the CLSC game model. Moreover, the equilibrium solution in different cases is solved using backward induction, analyzing the impact of risk-averse parameters on the equilibrium solution in different cases and obtaining the critical conditions for the manufacturer to execute the optimal financing approach. The conclusion shows that the wholesale price and the retailing price of the new product in debt financing are both greater, while the retailing prices of the remanufacturing product are equal in the two financing approaches. Only when the manufacturer's self-owned fund is constrained and the executable dividend proportion is lower than a critical value, the manufacturer will execute equity financing. However, if the self-owned fund is exceedingly deficient and the executable profit-sharing proportion is adequately large, the manufacturer will prefer debt financing. When executing financing, the consumer surplus declines, while the risk-averse parameter goes up. Debt financing is far eco-friendlier, while equity financing enables both parties and the total revenues of CLSC to attain a multibenefit status in specific circumstances.</jats:p>",

In the China campaign, as in all armed conflicts, the availability of matériel and subsistence determined what military options were available to commanders. In 1900, because of a strong industrial base and a burgeoning logistical network, the US Army, Marine Corps, and Navy demonstrated an increased capacity and capability to project power on hemispheric scales. Throughout the entirety of their intervention in China, Americans moved animals, artillery, medical supplies, men, ordnance, and subsistence across great distances – over sea and land, to and within the theatre of operations – with remarkable efficiency under difficult conditions. Thus, the China Relief Expedition was instructive for the US profession of arms, and pointed to a future in which large-scale combat operations on land and at sea would require careful integration and more extensive logistical support than military operations of nineteenth-century conflicts.</jats:p>",

Five treatments of 96 h median lethal concentration LC50 were used, namely, T0 (0.00 g·l−1), T1 (0.40 g·l−1), T2 (0.60 g·l−1), T3 (0.80 g·l−1) and T4 (1.00 g·l−1), and each of these treatment concentrations was replicated three times for both toxicity exposures. The results clearly revealed that 96 h median lethal concentration (LC50) at treatments T4 (4.00), T3 (3.00), T2 (2.00) and T0 (0.00) g·l−1 gave an average mean value of 3.02 ± 0.02 g·l−1 with upper and lower limits of 6.28 and 1.42 g·l−1, respectively. The overall percentage mortality showed more than 71% of fish mortality at T4. Values for the 14-day sub-acute exposures to ammonia concentrations of T4 (1.00), T3 (0.80), T2 (0.60) and control (0.00) g·l−1 were also obtained.

Therefore, we examined the performances of GRU for one, two, and three-day-ahead streamflow forecasting in seven basins in various geographic regions in China from the aspect of robustness, overall accuracy, and accuracy of streamflow peaks’ forecasting. The robustness and accuracy of it are closely related to correlations between the input and forecasting target series. Also, it outperforms the benchmark machine learning models in more cases, especially for one-day-ahead forecasting (NSE of 0.88–0.96 except for the unsatisfactory result in the Luanhe River basin). The deterioration of its accuracy along the increasing lead time depends on the dominant time lags between the rainfall and streamflow peaks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Professionalized maintenance arrangements are emerging and growing to improve rural water service sustainability across sub-Saharan Africa, where local governments often act as rural service authorities. Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment released a novel policy in 2019 to promote professionalization, outlining requirements of local governments to support professionalized maintenance under a new framework for rural water service delivery. We identify how responsibilities of local government actors shifted under this policy and then use Organizational Institutional Theory to explore how the institutional environment—composed of regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive pillars—influences these actors’ fulfillment of assigned functions under the new policy and support of professionalized maintenance arrangements. To do this, we collected, transcribed, and qualitatively coded data from semi-structured interviews with 93 Ugandan local government actors at all hierarchical levels across 22 sub-counties in three Ugandan districts. Due to infrequent references by interviewees to regulative influences on action such as formal rules and policies, we propose that the new policy alone is unlikely to motivate essential local government support. Allocated responsibilities must align with widely-cited normative and cultural-cognitive influences, including relationship expectations, typical processes and routines, political dynamics, notions of identity, perceived self-efficacy, and cultural beliefs. We recommend leveraging existing institutional influences where possible to motivate actions aligned with the policy. For example, local government actors can fulfill community expectations of them to solve prolonged nonfunctionality by connecting communities to professionalized maintenance service providers instead of performing individual out-of-pocket repairs. Improving understanding of local service authority perspectives is essential as professionalized maintenance arrangements emerge and grow and as new policies expand and shift essential support functions.</jats:p>"

Our objective was to use a biophysical larval transport model to create a time series (2000–2019) of larval retention, dispersal distance and connectivity estimates for the commercially important Norway lobster (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>Nephrops norvegicus</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>) on mud grounds off Ireland. Where time series of population estimates were sufficiently long to conduct analysis, we also investigated if larval dispersal indices could be used to predict variations in adult density, after a lag period, hypothesising that this would only apply to grounds with consistently low larval supply. Grounds off Ireland had varying characteristics related to their ability to retain and exchange larvae which was influenced by the local hydrodynamic regime and spatial isolation from other grounds. Larval supply was consistently low on the Aran grounds to the west of Ireland, which have experienced abundance declines in the past. The time series of modelled larval dispersal indices at the Aran grounds was linked to empirical adult burrow densities with a 3‐year lag. Whereas the western Irish Sea, which has consistently high larval supply, showed no such relationship. Models can provide important larval recruitment information early in the life cycle for species of commercial or conservation importance.</jats:p>",

Then, the dynamic model of product recovery in enterprise joint scheduling is established. Finally, based on the differential game theory (based on the continuity of nonlinear differential equation function) and Hamilton function, the optimal scheduling strategies with manufacturer and retailer as the main recycling body in the complete supply chain are calculated respectively. The results show that the product recovery rate with manufacturer as the main recycling body is higher than that with retailer as the main recycling body. There is no transfer price in the recovery based on the manufacturer. However, in the recovery based on the retailer, if the transfer price increases, the product recovery rate of the system will also increase; if the transfer price increases, the manufacturer’s instant profit will appropriately increase; if the transfer price value is high [Formula: see text], the manufacturer’s instant profit is higher. If the transfer payment is low [Formula: see text], the instant profit of manufacturer with manufacturer as the main recycling body will be first lower and then higher than that with retailer as the main recycling body. When the system is stable, the instant profit with the manufacturer as the main recycling body is higher than that with retailer as the main recycling body; the total profit of the manufacturer with the retailer as the recycling body is first lower and then higher than that with the manufacturer as the main recycling body. Whether the transfer payment is high or low, the retailer’s profit level is higher when the manufacturer is the main recycling body. When the retailer is the main recycling body, the retailer’s profit level is inversely proportional to the transfer payment. Finally, in the centralized supply chain environment, enterprises can maximize their total profits and promote the good development. </jats:p>",

Using Agribalyse database and case product of beef pie, we identified critical hotspots in upstream food supply chains through life cycle assessment (LCA). A weighting method was used to prioritise the critical hotspots. For empirical evidence, a few hotspots were addressed using Walmart's best practices and modified LCA was piloted that showed up to 10% decreased environmental burden, irrespective of the change in region, data mix and supply chain complexity. For industrial implication, a hotspot resolution model was designed for the root cause analysis of pain points concerning global food supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A distinctive feature of legumes is the ability to combine two most important processes: photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. However, the course of those processes, and therefore seed potential of those crops depend on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, the commonest being drought. Therefore, interest in physical-biochemical resistance of the plant organism to abiotic stress factors is increasing, as well as search for optimum ways to increase its adaptability. Success of adaptation of a plant’s organism to unfavourable environmental factors is known to largely depend on optimal functioning of assimilative apparatus. Some indicators of the condition of the apparatus are the content and ratio of photosynthesis pigments. Therefore, we aimed at determining the reaction of the pigment complex of Glycine max (L.) Merr. plants, grown against the background of optimal and insufficient watering, to inoculation of seeds with rhizobia bacteria Bradyrhizobium japonicum, cultivated using nanocarboxylates of chromium, cobalt, iron, copper and germanium. Research has shown that utilization of germanium nanocarboxylate as a component of inoculative suspension led to the highest content of chlorophylls in leaves of soybean of the studied variants in the blossoming phase during optimal watering, as well as significant increase in the content of carotenoids compared with the control plants regardless of the level of watering. At the same time, this element caused no significant effect on the chlorophyll content in plants grown in drought. It was confirmed that among soybean plants that were in stress conditions (blossoming phase) for two weeks, the highest content of chlorophylls was in leaves of plants grown from seeds inoculated with rhizobial suspension with addition of chromium and copper nanocarboxylates, which caused 25.3% and 22.8% increase in chlorophyll а, 29.4% and 32.3% in chlorophyll b and 26.4%% and 23.8% in them respectively, compared with the control. Furthermore, chromium and copper nanocarboxylates stimulated the content of carotenoids in the same plants, though it was less expressed than after adding germanium nanocarboxylate. The highest content of photosynthetic pigments in plants after the watering was resumed (phase of bean formation) was in cases of applying chromium and germanium nanocarboxylates. It was confirmed that the most efficient way to protect the pigment complex of soybean plants during drought was using chromium and germanium nanocarboxylates as components of inoculation suspension. The results we obtained indicate the possibility of applying chromium nanocarboxylate in the technology of cultivating soybean in the conditions of water deficiency as an effective way to improve biosynthesis of chlorophylls, as well as using germanium nanocarboxyllate as a component that provides a high level of activity of protective mechanisms of the pigment system of soybean, associated with resisting stress caused by water deficiency.</jats:p>"

Nutrient supply through the slope water intrusion has been viewed as critical in regulating the GoM spring blooms, with an assumption that nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient. In recent years, this paradigm has been challenged, with silicate being recognized as another potential limiting nutrient, but the source of silicate and its associated water mass remain difficult to be determined. In this study, a time series of spring bloom magnitude was constructed using a self‐organizing map algorithm, and then correlated with the fluctuation of water composition in the deep Northeast Channel. The results reveal the importance of silicate supply from previously less‐recognized deep Scotian Shelf Water inflow. This study offers a new hypothesis for spring bloom regulation, providing a better understanding of mechanisms controlling the spring bloom magnitude in the GoM.</jats:p>",

Subsurface mapping in the northern Gulf of Mexico basin, where there is a robust database of wells and seismic data, allows estimation of sand‐size grain volumes within 12 chronostratigraphically defined Late Mesozoic supersequences. Five subsurface depocentres with thicknesses of &gt;400 m are identified, revealing a history of sediment routing via major fluvial axes (paleo rivers) southward from a mid‐continent drainage divide. The interpreted paleo‐rivers are further confirmed by compilation and synthesis of published and novel detrital zircon provenance data showing combinations of age peak subsets that vary considerably between depocentres. This study quantifies sediment volumes within each depocentre by inverting porosity over defined gross rock volumes derived from subsurface well logs and 2D seismic mapping. Two temporal trends of progressively increasing grain volume can be related to climatic effects on fluvial discharge and sediment delivery to the depocentres: (1) Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Oxfordian to early Aptian) and (2) Late Cretaceous (Late Aptian to Coniacian). The first temporal trend probably reflects the local climate becoming less arid with northward drift of the North American Plate into higher latitudes. The second trend mirrors increasing Cretaceous paleotemperatures and rising global sea levels. This second trend is also marked by increased shelf margin bypass of sand indicated by deep basin drilling. Partitioning of Late Mesozoic grain volume by fluvial axes shows that the Paleo‐Apalachicola and Paleo‐Mississippi rivers, sourced from Appalachian basement terranes, generated the largest and longest terrigenous sediment flux into the Gulf of Mexico basin in the Late Mesozoic. Overall, Late Mesozoic siliciclastic grain volumes are estimated to be an order of magnitude less than those previously documented for the Cenozoic Era.</jats:p>",

In a case study, we explore the current conditions of pork and beef farmers in Austrian meat markets by combining a quantitative approach with qualitative inquiries. The quantitative analysis shows that the concentration of meat markets has been increasing in recent years. The rates of change differ in various segments of the value chain and across the types of markets. These results are the starting point for a qualitative analysis of the competitive situation in the observed markets. One finding is that in each market prices are set in idiosyncratic ways. Another one is that producer organizations are an appropriate means for small-scale and family-run farms to strengthen their position in the value chain. We conclude that policy initiatives to improve market access and value addition for farmers need to be complemented by targeted dissemination activities and that competition analyses should apply multi-method approaches similar to the one used in this analysis.</jats:p>"

Due to the constraints in terms of mass, volume, and power, it is often not possible to increase reliability by adding redundant subsystems to the spacecraft. Therefore, it is necessary to implement important error-proofing mechanisms to still be able to derive a high scientific benefit from these missions. Once the satellite has been launched, physical access to the satellite’s hardware is no longer possible. For this reason, systems are often implemented that allow automatic failure detection, isolation of the failure from other systems, as well as automatic recovery (FDIR). This paper describes the advantages and areas of application of software-defined radio platforms (SDRs) on board of small satellites and CubeSats. In addition, important aspects of the hardware FDIR concept of the PRETTY SDR payload system are presented. In order to prevent the hardware from being damaged with a fault-free power supply, different levels of fault monitoring are described as well.</jats:p>",

Wall City and Gulberg are the study areas of this research. Gulberg area is far much better in various terms as compared to the wall city. Under this study, four parameters were selected for water quality pH, Total dissolved solids, E.coli and Arsenic. There were 13 water samples collected from each study area by random sampling. Samples were tested on the latest footing in this field. All results validate the problematic statement and highlight severe health effects. The results of these four parameters were far above the water quality standards declared by World Health Organization. Causes of these severe results include the outdated water pipes that are being laid down for the past several decades, for example Wall City area, etc. Results also depict low values in the Gulberg area which is recently developed as compared to the wall city.

Therefore, enterprise credit risk in the supply chain context is not only a concern for banking financial institutions, credit rating agencies and enterprise managers but also the focus of governments. This article develops a DTE‐DSA (decision tree [DT] ensemble model using the differential sampling rate, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique [SMOTE] and AdaBoost) prediction framework integrating supply chain information to predict enterprise credit risk. The empirical test shows that using supply chain information can significantly improve the prediction score. The DTE‐DSA model has the best prediction effect in dealing with class imbalance problems. Compared with single classifier models—such as logistic regression, k‐nearest neighbours, support vector machine, DT and DT using the SMOTE—as well as ensemble models—such as extremely randomized trees, random forest, rotation forest, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting DT and DT ensemble model using AdaBoost—the DTE‐DSA model not only has the best prediction score but also has a more stable performance. The comprehensive use of supply chain information and the DTE‐DSA model can result in the highest prediction score, with an area under the curve of 0.9016 and a Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic of 0.7369. Further analysis of the variables of importance enhances the interpretability of the model and obtains relevant management insights.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to evaluate the behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes under fluctuating temperature comparing the efficacy of deterministic and stochastic methods for its prediction. In the first part of the study, a strain of L. monocytogenes was maintained at two different fluctuating temperature regimes both from 2 to 8 C and regularly sampled for the quantitative determination. The first temperature regime lasted 204 hours with a fluctuation length of 12 hours whereas the second lasted 167 hours with a fluctuation length of 24 hours. A dynamic predictive model was implemented for the reproduction of the observed data. Model resolution has been carried out by using values of the recorded temperature as well as the value of the mean temperature, the kinetic mean temperature, the 75th and 95th percentile of the temperature. A stochastic resolution was also performed considering the mean temperature and Standard Deviation as stochastic variable. In the second part of the study, a temperature mean curve was constructed by monitoring temperature of 8 refrigerated conveyances, 10 display cabinet and 15 domestic refrigerators. This curve was used to obtain predictive scenarios for L. monocytogenes based on the above and also considering temperature regime suggested by the EURL Lm TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT on challenge tests and durability studies for assessing shelf-life of ready-to-eat foods related to Listeria monocytogenes (Version 4 of 1 July 2021). All predicted behaviours were compared to the observed ones through the Root Mean Squared Error. Firstly, dynamic predictive model as well as the stochastic one, provided the best level of reproducibility of the observed data. The kinetic mean temperature reproduced the observed data better than the mean temperature for the 12 hoursregime while for the 24 hours-regime was the opposite. The 75th and 95th percentile overestimated the observed growths. Secondary, predictions obtained with the mean temperature, kinetic temperature and stochastic approach well fitted the observed data. The 75th and 95th percentile of Temperature and the “Eurl LM” temperature regimes overestimated the observed prediction. Dynamic approach as well as the stochastic one allowed to obtain the lowest values of Root Mean Squared Error. The mean temperature and kinetic mean temperature appeared the most representative values in a deterministic “single-point” approach.</jats:p>"

We performed a cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) of six recently approved IO-TKI drug combinations and sunitinib. Methods: We used a Markov simulation model from the healthcare sector perspective with a lifetime time horizon. The 7 treatment drug strategies considered in this model included: (1) atezolizumab + bevacizumab (AB), (2) avelumab + axitinib (AA), (3) pembrolizumab + axitinib (PA), (4) nibolumab + ipilimumab(NI), (5) nibolumab + cabozantinib (NC), (6) lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (LP), and (7) sunitinib (S). Input parameters of drug effectiveness and toxicities to construct the model were based on published randomized studies that led to drug approvals. Direct costs for treatment were derived using the VA Federal Supply Schedule (VAFSS). Markov model simulates patient transition between 3 health states at monthly intervals: progression free, progressive disease, and death. The cost-effectiveness outcome in our model were and life-years (LYs), progression-free life-years (PFLYs) gained, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with utility values based on published literature. Results: The table highlights results of the CEA. The least expensive drug combination was NI ($442,218) while the most expensive was LP ($963,610). AA yielded the most LYs (5.51) and QALYs (5.62) and LP yielded the most PFLYs (1.64) while NL yielded the least LYs (4.35) and PFLYs (1.47) and LP yielded the least QALYs (4.19). AB and S were absolutely dominated strategies yielding less effectiveness and cost more in terms of effectiveness measures. Depending on acceptable willingness-to-pay (WTP) and effectiveness measures, PA or AA were the most cost-effective strategies. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that based on direct cost acquisition using VA FSS, PA or AA were cost-effective strategies for mRCC with WTP of $20,000 to $200,000 per QALY.[Table: see text] </jats:p>",

These faults can be a consequence of a wide range of causes, and in some cases, the information about them can be insufficient or unclear. Considering that sampling has a major influence on the quality of the analytical results provided by water laboratories, this work presents a system for reporting and learning adverse events. Its aim is to record nonconformities, errors, and adverse events, making possible automatic data analysis aiming to ensure continuous improvement in operational sampling. The system is based on the Eindhoven Classification Model and enables automatic data analysis and reporting to identify the main causes of failure. Logic programming is used to represent knowledge and support the reasoning mechanisms to model the universe of discourse in scenarios of incomplete, contradicting, or even unknown information. In addition to suggesting solutions to the problem, the system provides formal evidence of the solutions presented, which will help to continuously improve drinking water quality and promote public health.</jats:p>",

We quantified and modeled disruption risk as a function of the geographic diversification of facilities called supply density (evaluated based on the interstage distance between nodes) to mitigate the risk caused by disruptions. Furthermore, we developed a bi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming model for designing the supply chain in order to maximize profit and supply density. We propose an interactive fuzzy optimization algorithm that generates efficient frontiers by systematically taking decision-maker inputs and solves the bi-criteria model problem in the context of a realistic example. We also conducted disruption analysis using a discrete set of disruption scenarios to determine the advantages of the network design from the bi-criteria model over the traditional profit maximization model. Our study demonstrates that the network design from the bi-criteria model has a 2% higher expected profit and a 2.2% lower profit variance under disruption than the traditional profit maximization solution. We envisage that this model will help firms evaluate the trade-offs between mitigation benefits and mitigation costs.</jats:p>",

However, very few have evaluated the demand-side challenges from the objective of universalisation of healthcare. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the factors that have impeded access to affordable generic and essential drugs in non-metropolitan urban and rural India. The study was conducted in six states and responses were elicited from a sample of doctors, pharmacists, nurses, accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers, state officials, warehouse managers and patients across the study states. The study reveals that while the acceptance of prescribing generic drugs has improved over the last decade, the use of branded drugs has been restricted only to complex cases or where generic drug efficacy has not been established. The centralised procurement efficiencies seem to have hit a plateau in terms of assuring drug availability to the last mile, thereby impacting local purchase, especially pandemic procurement. Most states have also established dedicated corporations for drug procurement, albeit at different levels of organisational maturity as far as adherence to the processes and systems are concerned. However, supply chain phenomena like the bullwhip effect gets accentuated given the levels of our public health system. Learnings from other consumer-facing sectors with similar challenges of increased variability and uncertainty are yet to be explored for the health sector to leapfrog towards achieving improved ‘drug availability’ or ‘zero stock-out’. Standardising drug categories, regular updating of the essential drug list (EDL) reflecting the demographic and disease profile, various practices like complete digitisation, rolling forecasts, stock-keeping unit rationalisation, flexible public procurement contracts, etc., have been explored as potential solutions in this paper. Creating a dedicated team of forecasters within the procurement organisations, well adept at using analytics, could be key to real-time demand estimation, paving the way for a quarterly rolling forecast to facilitate procurement using well-designed rate contracts with suppliers that captures variability in such rolling forecasts. </jats:p>",

The model identified the key factors affecting DO changes to be electrical conductivity, cumulative precipitation, total nitrogen, and water temperature. Random forest (sensitivity, 0.9962; accuracy, 0.9981) and XGBoost (sensitivity, 1.0000; accuracy, 0.9822) showed excellent classification performance. The real-time prediction model for short-term DO that we developed adopted artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms. LSTM (R2 = 0.93 − 0.97, first half; R2 = 0.95 − 0.96, second half) and GRU (R2 = 0.94 − 0.98, first half; R2 = 0.96 − 0.98, second half) significantly outperformed ANN (R2 = 0.64 − 0.86).

As a result, it was pro-posed to express the dependence of the mechanical power in terms of the allowable mechanical load factor, which, in turn, depends on the armature current pulsations factor. The method is as follows: 1) on a computer model determine the armature current pulsations factor; 2) determine the allowable mechanical load factor and the allowable mechanical power. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that the expression for determining the allowable mechanical load of DC motors with polyharmonic power has been further developed, which, unlike the known ones, contains the square of the armature current pulsations factor. An example of the practical use of the proposed method for calculating the allowable mechanical power of DC motor when pow-ered by single-phase thyristor rectifier.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigated the effects of the informational asymmetry phenomenon that occurs in the direct sale of fresh agricultural products (FAP) in an e-commerce environment. A three-level FAP supply chain was proposed, which was composed of a FAP supplier, a logistics service provider, and a large e-commerce platform. Considering the perishable nature of FAP, this paper analyzed the effects of logistics spatio-temporal costs and the freshness of FAP on the profit of each stakeholder in the supply chain. Three scenarios were considered: (1) complete information, (2) partial information, and (3) considering logistics spatio-temporal cost. Analytical models were developed based on the principal-agent theory and the supply chain coordination contract theory to depict the effects of a profit-sharing contract on the operations of the FAP supply chain. Modeling results indicated that under a complete information condition, an increase in the loss rate of FAP correlated to a decrease in the profit of the FAP supply chain. Under a partial information condition, considering the loss rate of FAP and the potential compensation costs to suppliers, when the loss rate of FAP was fixed, the profit of each stakeholder in the FAP supply chain displayed a decreasing trend in relation to compensation ratio. In comparison, when the compensation ratio was fixed, the total profit decreased as the freshness of the FAP degraded. To improve customer satisfaction, this paper recommends adding a front warehouse to improve the freshness of FAP. Although this option increases the logistics costs, it has the potential of increasing the overall profit of the FAP supply chain. Findings from this research have the potential to help the e-commerce platform with coordinating the various stakeholders on the supply chain to determine the optimal quality and quantity of FAPs, eventually improving the operational efficiency of the FAP direct sales supply chain by reducing the logistics costs of FAP.</jats:p>"

A preferred strategy has been supply augmentation through\nhydraulic infrastructure development. However, despite considerable\ninvestments, many systems seem to be trapped in lacklustre development\npathways making some problems seem like an enduring, almost stubborn,\ncharacteristic of the systems: overexploitation and pollution of water\nsources, distribution networks overwhelmed by leakages and non-revenue\nwater, and unequal water insecurity. Because of these strategies and\npersistent problems, water conflicts have emerged, whereby social actors\noppose these strategies and propose alternative technologies and strategies.\nThis can create development pathway crossroads of the urban water system,\ndefined as a critical point whereby actors in conflict will either reinforce\nthe current business-as-usual pathway based on large supply augmentation or\nimplement alternative solutions for the urban water system. To study this\ndevelopment pathway crossroads, we selected the Zapotillo conflict in Mexico\nwhere a large supply augmentation project for two cities experiencing water\nshortages is at stake. The paper concludes that urban water systems that are\nengaged in a trajectory characterized by supply-side strategies may\nexperience a temporal relief but neglect equally pressing issues that stymie\nthe human right to water in the medium and long run. However, there is not a\nstraightforward, self-evident development pathway to choose from, only a\nrange of multiple alternatives with multiple trade-offs that need to be\nthoroughly discussed and negotiated between the stakeholders. We argue that\nthis development pathway crossroads can cross-fertilize contrasting\ndisciplines such as socio-hydrology and critical studies on water because both can complement technical and socio-political analyses to make their knowledge actionable\nand relevant.\n                    </jats:p>"

The melting sea ice has caused renewed interest in expanding maritime shipping for potentially more accessible ocean routes. Canada emerges as a natural land bridge for trade between Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Plausibly, it is not a choice but an imperative to properly integrate the stakeholders (the environment, countries, remote communities, industrial partners) in opening the Arctic Circle to the global economy while considering the challenges. Keeping sustainability front and center and drawing on the extant literature and government policies, this interdisciplinary study offers a Canadian perspective on Arctic transportation routes over tribal lands and their quadruple bottom line (QBL) impacts on the environment, economy, society, and Indigenous cultures. Unlike the arguable premise that new transport corridors will increase trade traffic and enhance the economy in Northern Canada, the QBL approach enables a more holistic and realistic strategy for the Arctic region’s sustainable development regarding regional economies, rural logistics, supply chain efficiency, and social licensing. Drawing on an integrative literature review as methodology, we highlight the QBL framework and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as crucial policy tools. Such a holistic perspective helps stakeholders and decision makers frame better policies in identifying, assessing, adapting, and mitigating risks for transportation infrastructure exposed to climate change. We recap the impacts of Arctic Shipping (ArSh) on QBL pillars in an interaction matrix and emphasize that while ArSh may be complementary to economic development, it poses threats to the viability of the Indigenous cultures.</jats:p>"

Moreover, different types of SFSC have been supported by urban food policies (UFP) over the few last years and actors from the food chain became part of new institutional settings for urban food policies. However, evidence from the sustainability impact assessment (SIA) of these SFSC in urban contexts is limited. Our paper presents an approach for the development of an SIA framework for different SFSC types. In addition, a practical application of the tool in four metropolitan regions (Berlin, London, Ljubljana and Nairobi) is tested. The conceptual development of the SIA framework is based on an in-depth analysis of existing SIA frameworks and methods for assessing the sustainability of agriculture, food chains and food systems and adapted to the specific needs of analysing SFSC in metropolitan regions. The operational value and utility of the framework and the tool were tested with social and natural scientists and local stakeholders. The assessment results demonstrate that SFSC seems to be more sustainable than the baseline (long global food chains) in the social dimension, but also feature specific strengths and weaknesses concerning their economic and environmental sustainability. This might give an indication for regional adjusted strategies and food chain innovations that improve the sustainability performance may be required. We found the tool useful for framing the dialogue between food chain actors, consumers and policy, because it makes benefits and trade-offs of the chain types operating in an urban–rural context more visible and communicable.</jats:p>",

Fossil-based tarps are still widely used as cover for wood chip storage piles, causing additional waste or requiring further waste treatment in the supply chain. This study aimed to investigate the performance of an innovative bio-based wood chip pile cover compared to conventional treatments (plastic-covered and uncovered) in eastern Finnish conditions. The experiment evaluated the drying process during the storage of stemwood chips during 5.9 months of storage. It included the developments of temperature, moisture content, heating value, energy content, basic density, particle size distribution, and the dry matter losses of a total of six piles. As a result, the forest stemwood chips dried by 11%, with dry-matter losses of 4.3%, when covered with the bio-pile cover. Using the plastic covering, the forest stemwood chips dried by 22%, with dry matter losses of 2.9%. At the end of the experiment, the energy content in plastic-covered piles was 6.1% higher than uncovered piles and 3.1% higher than bio-pile-covered piles. While differences in the key drying performance parameters can be observed, the differences between uncovered piles and those covered with plastic tarps, as well as between the bio-based and the uncovered piles, were not statistically significant. We conclude that the bio-based cover, under the studied conditions, do not render better storage conditions than in current practices. However, our study indicates possible fossil-substitutional benefits by using a bio-based cover, which calls for further R&amp;D work in this matter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We examine buyback contracts in a dyadic supply chain where a retailer orders from a supplier before observing the random demand and sets a retail price after observing it (a.k.a. price postponement). We focus on the case with linear additive demand, which is well known to be less tractable than the case with linear multiplicative demand. With mild conditions on the distribution of demand uncertainty, we derive the supplier's optimal buyback contract and show the following results. The supplier strictly prefers buyback contracts to wholesale price‐only contracts if and only if the unit production cost is lower than a threshold that depends on the dispersion of demand uncertainty; the optimal buyback rate is decreasing in the unit production cost; the profit allocation within the supply chain and channel efficiency depend on the dispersion of demand uncertainty. These results are in stark contrast to those in the case with linear multiplicative demand. Nevertheless, the relation between the operational decisions under the optimal buyback contract and those under the optimal wholesale price‐only contract is consistent with the case of multiplicative demand. We further extend the analysis to two related scenarios. On one hand, our results continue to hold in a supply chain where one supplier sells to two competing retailers. On the other hand, when the retailer does not postpone retail pricing decisions, we establish three distinctive properties of the optimal buyback contract: the supplier strictly prefers buyback contracts to wholesale price‐only contracts if and only if the unit production cost is intermediate; the optimal buyback rate is increasing in the unit production cost in the region where the supplier strictly prefers buyback contracts to wholesale price‐only contracts; price postponement benefits both the retailer and the supply chain but does not always benefit the supplier. The above analysis shows that the supplier's preference between buyback and wholesale price‐only contracts can swing either way when the retailer starts to practice price postponement.</jats:p>",

In this work, a nanosecond pulse power supply, with adjustable pulse frequency, duty cycle, and voltage, was designed with an STM32F103VET6 single-chip microcomputer as the control core and a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor as the chopper switch component. The performance test has shown that the power supply can produce a continuous pulse with the highest frequency of 8 MHz, the shortest pulse width of 50 ns, the maximum peak current of 12 A, and the maximum voltage of 10 V. As compared with the power supply reported in the literature, the present power supply demonstrated the enhanced output current and improved waveform of the nanosecond pulse output, which could result in better machining accuracy and efficiency for micro-ECM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global focus in emulsion fuels is due to the advantages over conventional diesel fuels. It has the capabilities to simultaneously reduce the emissions of NOx and smoke. It also said to reduce the fuel consumption of diesel engine by significant percentages. However, due to the interdependency on surfactant, emulsion fuel does not seem to be possible as alternative fuel in an economic perspective. This is because of the high market price of the commercial surfactant. Therefore, this research focused on non-surfactant W/D that produced by a system known as Real-Time Non-Surfactant Emulsion Fuel Supply System (RTES). RTES has been applied with the goal of investigating the impact on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of a mechanical pump fuel injection system diesel vehicle (MP) and a common rail fuel injection system diesel vehicle (CR). A one-ton truck represents as MP (Mechanical Pump) and an SUV represent as CR (Common rail) are the test vehicles for the said research. The non-surfactant W/D with 6.5 wt.% of water produced by the RTES used as the test fuel and named as E6.5. It has been emulsified in the RTES right before being injected into the diesel vehicles. The testing was performed on a chassis dynamometer following the West Virginia University 5-peak cycles. The findings show that the utilization of non-surfactant W/D has increased the fuel consumption by 7.39% for MP and 3.2% for CR respectively as compared with base diesel fuel. NOx, smoke emissions and exhaust temperature have significantly reduced by the MP relative to CR vehicles. Overall, the concept of non-surfactant W/D seems to have implementation potential for reducing harmful emissions from both diesel-powered vehicles.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve the coordination and complementarity of multiple energy sources, balancing the interests of different participants in a multi-energy system is of great importance. However, traditional centralized optimization can hardly reflect the game relationship between supply side and demand sides. A trading model based on the Stackelberg game model is proposed in this paper to balance the interests of the supply side and demand side and reduce the carbon emissions. First of all, the process of trading between the supply side and demand side based on smart contracts is described. A contractual consensus is obtained through an internal game, and the transaction is completed automatically. Secondly, a bilevel optimization model is established to coordinate the benefits of both parties based on the Stackelberg game model. The energy operator acts as a leader, and considers the two objectives, i.e., maximizing net income and minimizing carbon emissions, and uses the linear weighting method to convert the dual objectives into single objective. Users act as followers and aim to increase the comprehensive benefits, including energy cost and comfort. Then, Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality condition is used to transform the bilevel optimization model into an equivalent single-level model. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method can coordinate the economic interests of both sides of supply and demand and effectively reduce the carbon emissions of the energy operator.</jats:p>"

Ewes (5 pens/treatment; 3 ewes/pen) blocked by body weight (BW) were assigned to one of four treatments from day 100 of gestation until lambing. The treatments were: basal diet (NS) without FAs or Met supplementation; FA supplementation (FS; 1.01 % of Ca salts, containing n-3 FA); Met supplementation (MS; 0.1 % of rumen-protected methionine); and FS and MS (FS-MS). At birth (day 0), ewes and lambs were placed in a common pen. On day 60, lambs were weaned, sorted by sex, blocked by BW, and placed on a common finishing diet for 54 d (FP). A lamb per pen was used for a glucose tolerance test (GTT) after the FP. Carcass characteristics were recorded on day 56. Lamb data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, with repeated measurements when needed (SAS 9.4). At weaning, lambs born to MS- or FS-fed ewes were heavier than lambs born from FS-MS ewes (FS × MS × Time; P = 0.02). A marginal significant FS × MS interaction (P = 0.09) was also observed on RvD1; lambs born to ewes in the NS and FS-MS treatments showed a lower RvD1 plasma concentration when compared with lambs born to FS- or MS-fed ewes. Lambs born to dams fed FA showed an increase (P = 0.05) in liver COX-2 mRNA relative expression. Lambs born to ewes supplemented with Met showed an increase (P = 0.03) in liver FABP4 mRNA expression. An FS × MS × Time interaction (P = 0.07) was observed in plasma glucose during the GTT; lambs born from FS-fed ewes showed lower plasma glucose concentration than lambs born to Met-supplemented ewes at 2 min after bolus administration. During the GTT, a marginal significant effect (P = 0.06) was observed for the lamb average insulin concentration due to maternal Met supplementation during late gestation, where these lambs had the lowest plasma concentration. Contrary to our hypothesis, the interaction of FA and Met supplementation during late gestation did not show a greater positive effect on offspring postnatal growth and metabolism. However, the individual supplementation of each nutrient has an effect on offspring development with a concomitant change in markers involved in the inflammatory response and energy metabolism.</jats:p>",

The symmetrical Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier method is suitable for stable acceleration of the proton beam in the tandem electrostatic accelerator in this system. Before the second step-up with the Cockcroft–Walton circuit, the design of the inverter is prioritized by preponderantly considering the first voltage and resonance frequency. Moreover, the optimized stacking number is determined with consideration of the ripple voltage, voltage drop, average output voltage, and fundamental harmonics, and a design is performed to set related parameter values to be stable in the flat-top region of the voltage. A high-voltage DC power supply system of 1.2 MV/45 mA is needed for a stable terminal energy of 2.4 MeV/20 mA. Such a design can be optimized by securing reliable data using a simulation tool on the basis of theoretical calculations.

The two-step floating catchment area method was employed to quantify the carrying capacity and coupling coordination degree method and spatial autocorrelation analysis were applied to analyze spatial distribution between supply and demand. The results were as follows. (1) The carrying capacity index in more than 50% of the districts was classified as low-grade. The percentage of regions with good grades was 8.27%. The regions with a high carrying capacity were distributed in the central and southeastern areas. (2) The coupling coordination continued to rise, increasing from 0.03397 in 1986 to 0.33627 in 2019. (3) The level of supply and demand for medical resources in Shenzhen increased from 1986 to 2019, and the highest degree of compatibility between the supply and the population size was largely concentrated in the western and eastern regions.

In addition, the critical threshold for the water-level variation at the lower lock head of the ship lift is explored using maximum entropy method. Results demonstrate that flow variation and regulation time are the most prominent factors affecting water-level fluctuation at the lower lock head of the ship lift, and the existing standard (0.5 m within 1 h and 0.3 m within 30 min) for controlling the maximum variation in water level at the lower lock head of the ship lift is reasonable and more safety oriented. This study provides a novel perspective to understand the response of water-level fluctuation to the stochasticity of operating conditions for the cascade hydropower stations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. In daily inspection, the nonstandard management of sterile articles in clinical departments of hospitals often leads to the destruction of the sterilization effectiveness of sterile articles. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen governance and improve this phenomenon. This study intends to investigate the mode in which the disinfection supply center participates in the supervision and management of the management of sterile items in clinical departments. It played a role in improving the standardization of the management of sterile articles in clinical departments and ensured the closed-loop management of the sterilization effectiveness of sterile articles. Methods. Every quarter, the disinfection supply center of our hospital will inspect the standardized management of sterile articles in all clinical departments of the hospital, mainly including the storage environment and facilities of sterile articles, the cleanliness of storage cabinets, placement principles, whether they are stored by category, and the quality and validity management of sterile articles. The quarterly inspection results were summarized and analyzed to find the existing problems and the causes. The disinfection supply center shall supervise the improvement. After the disinfection supply center inspected the standardized management of sterile articles in all clinical departments of the hospital for the first time according to the inspection contents, under the guidance and assistance of the nursing department and the hospital infection department, it improved the sterile article management system, conducted knowledge training for the whole hospital, and incorporated the standardized management of clinical sterile articles into the quality control inspection of the nursing department. In the later stage, the disinfection supply center is responsible for conducting routine inspection and supervision on the standardized management of sterile articles in all clinical departments of the hospital every quarter according to the inspection contents, including summarizing, analyzing, and urging the clinical departments to achieve the improvement of the management of sterile articles in clinical departments. Results. The standardization of aseptic articles after improvement was significantly higher than before and during improvement, and the qualified rate was significantly different (99.4% vs 97.9% vs 89.5%, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>P</mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;</mo>\n                        <mn>0.05</mn>\n                     </math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>). The average number of lost packages caused by nonstandard management in the department was significantly reduced. The average rate of lost sterile packages during and after the improvement was significantly lower than that before the improvement (10.5% vs 97.9% vs 89.5%, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <mi>P</mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;</mo>\n                        <mn>0.05</mn>\n                     </math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>). It also effectively reduced the cost caused by the loss of sterile packages. Conclusion. The disinfection supply center participates in the quality control and management of sterile articles in the nursing department and regularly inspects and supervises the management of sterile articles in clinical departments. It can effectively improve the standardized management of sterile articles in clinical departments, ensure the safety of sterile articles, and form a closed loop of sterilization effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Severe accidents occasionally occur resulting in fatalities and disruption. We build an oil &amp; gas accident graph based on more than a thousand severe accidents for the period 1970–2016 recorded for refineries, tankers, and gas networks in the authoritative ENergy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD). We explore the distribution of potential chains-of-events leading to severe accidents by combining graph theory, Markov analysis and catastrophe dynamics. Using centrality measures, we first verify that human error is consistently the main source of accidents and that explosion, fire, toxic release, and element rupture are the principal sinks, but also the main catalysts for accident amplification. Second, we quantify the space of possible chains-of-events using the concept of fundamental matrix and rank them by defining a likelihood-based importance measure <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>. We find that chains of up to five events can play a significant role in severe accidents, consisting of feedback loops of the aforementioned events but also of secondary events not directly identifiable from graph topology and yet participating in the most likely chains-of-events.</jats:p>"

A good quality, high-pressure continuous water supply (CWS) is always the target of any urban settlement. However, tap water in some areas are reported with deteriorated water quality even though treated well before supplying. Such deterioration of tap water quality is reported widely from areas with low water availability and in economically poor countries where water are supplied intermittently (IWS). This study focuses in identifying tap water quality in IWS and causes of water quality degradation using nitrate-nitrogen (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N) as an indicator and stable isotopes of hydrogen (δD) as tracer. Nine water reservoirs and ninety municipal tap water (ten per reservoir) samples were collected during the wet (June–September) and dry (November–February) seasons in the Kathmandu Valley (KV), Nepal. Ten percent of the tap water samples exhibited higher NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N than those of their respective reservoirs during the wet season, while 16% exhibited higher concentrations during the dry season. Similarly, the isotopic signatures of tap water exhibited 3% and 23% higher concentrations than those of their respective reservoirs during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Coupling analysis between NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N and δD demonstrates close connection of groundwater and tap water. The results indicate groundwater intrusion as the primary component in controlling tap water quality variations within the same distribution networks during IWS. Meanwhile, the obtained results also indicate probable areas of intrusion in the KV as well as usefulness of δD as a tool in the assessment of tap water systems.</jats:p>",

Groundwater is characterized by high OH−, Na+, total dissolved solids, and low Ca2+ because of seawater intrusion, and such conditions favor sediment fluoride-leaching and fluorosis. But the geological process of seawater intrusion has not been noticed when high-fluoride groundwater along coastal areas is discussed. The groundwater and sediments in a typical seawater intrusion and fluorosis area are gained, and fluoride-leaching simulation experiments are performed. Sediment fluoride levels are equal to or lower than average sediment fluoride levels in China and Shandong province, but strong fluoride-leaching in aquifers is observed. Compared with the supplied water from the non-intruded neighboring area, the local groundwater has higher fluoride levels, together with higher pH, total dissolved solids, HCO3−, Cl−, Br−, SO42−, Na+, K+, and low Ca2+ because of seawater intrusion. Aquifer sediment fluoride-leaching ability increases with an increase in seawater (brine water) mixing ratios, and NaCl or NaHCO3 levels, but with a decrease in CaCl2 levels. This directly confirms that seawater (brine water) intrusion promotes sediment fluoride-leaching, and the high pH, Na+, HCO3−, and low Ca2+ levels caused by seawater intrusion are responsible for the high-fluoride groundwater along coastal plains.</jats:p>",

First, based on the “main manufacturer–supplier” model adopted by the synergistic development supply chain of large passenger aircraft, a resilience analysis framework is established from the perspective of the main manufacturer and supplier, based on which a bilateral grey quality function deployment resilience measurement model is proposed. Second, a single-perspective resilience optimization model of the main manufacturer and supplier under cost constraints is constructed. Then, an overall resilience optimization model of the supply chain considering the synergistic effect and cooperation uncertainty is presented. Finally, the development of a large airliner’s fuselage is taken as an example to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model. The results show that (1) the synergy between the main manufacturers and suppliers can not only improve resilience of the whole supply chain, but also reduce their own competitiveness and resilience, respectively; (2) a benign cooperative relationship can effectively improve the overall resilience; on the contrary, it can reduce the overall elasticity; (3) the cost of supply chain has a great impact on the resilience of the main manufacturers and suppliers, respectively.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, a combination of the interpretative structural modelling (ISM) and (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) MICMAC approach was used to establish the interrelationships between these topics. The developed analysis reveals that there are 19 constructs capable of elucidating this relationship and that there is a hierarchy between these constructs, which are presented in a structural model. Further, the different levels of dependency and driving power are compared in a cluster diagram. As the main result, it was found that there is a strong mutual relationship between the basic technologies. The use of Internet of Things and cloud computing technologies influences the collection of large amounts of data, leading to big data, which in turn influence the use of data analytics tools to obtain competitive advantages. These outcomes may contribute to managers’ more assertive decision-making regarding the selection, implementation, and evaluation of projects adopting Industry 4.0 technologies and circular economy approaches in supply chains. Moreover, our study could be the basis for future empirical research to investigate how companies incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies into their processes and how this influences the quest for sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

In addition, we calculated the gas-gap and dielectric capacitances of the APPJ and added a power supply equivalent circuit. Compared with other circuit models that use switches or a time-controlled current source to simulate the discharges, our present circuit model uses a breakdown-voltage-controlled breaker for the homogeneous discharge and resistors with high-frequency switches for the filamentary discharge. We employed potential simulation to obtain the equivalent dielectric capacitance in the APPJ and then derived the gas-gap capacitance. We also replaced the ideal sine wave power supply with the equivalent circuit of the common double-peak waveform power supply. MATLAB Simulink was used to construct an equivalent circuit model and the discharge area ratio, breakdown voltage and filamentary equivalent resistance were obtained via <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> waveform fitting. We measured the plasma <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> waveform with a 20 kHz frequency, various voltages (6, 12 and 15 kV), a gas flow rate of 30 standard liter per minute (SLM) and two types of gas (Ar and He). The simulated and experimental <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> waveforms were very close under the different conditions. In summary, the proposed equivalent circuit model more meaningfully describes the plasma physics to simulate homogeneous and filamentary discharges, achieving results that are compatible with our experimental observations. The findings can help with investigating plasma discharge mechanisms and full-model simulations of plasma.</jats:p>",

Despite their importance, investigation into the supplementation of EM in ruminants has been limited to one or two epigenetic modifiers. Like all biochemical pathways, one-carbon metabolism needs to be stoichiometrically balanced. Thus, we investigated the effects of supplementing four EM encompassing the methionine–folate cycle on bovine embryonic fibroblast growth, mitochondrial function, and DNA methylation. We hypothesized that EM supplemented to embryonic fibroblasts cultured in divergent glucose media would increase mitochondrial respiration and cell growth rate and alter DNA methylation as reflected by changes in the gene expression of enzymes involved in methylation reactions, thereby improving the growth parameters beyond Control treated cells. Bovine embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium with 1 g/L glucose (Low) or 4.5 g/L glucose (High). The control medium contained no additional OCM, whereas the treated media contained supplemented EM at 2.5, 5, and 10 times (×2.5, ×5, and ×10, respectively) the control media, except for methionine (limited to ×2). Therefore, the experimental design was a 2 (levels of glucose) × 4 (levels of EM) factorial arrangement of treatments. Cells were passaged three times in their respective treatment media before analysis for growth rate, cell proliferation, mitochondrial respiration, transcript abundance of methionine–folate cycle enzymes, and DNA methylation by reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Total cell growth was greatest in High ×10 and mitochondrial maximal respiration, and reserve capacity was greatest (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.01) for High ×2.5 and ×10 compared with all other treatments. In Low cells, the total growth rate, mitochondrial maximal respiration, and reserve capacity increased quadratically to 2.5 and ×5 and decreased to control levels at ×10. The biological processes identified due to differential methylation included the positive regulation of GTPase activity, molecular function, protein modification processes, phosphorylation, and metabolic processes. These data are interpreted to imply that EM increased the growth rate and mitochondrial function beyond Control treated cells in both Low and High cells, which may be due to changes in the methylation of genes involved with growth and energy metabolism.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The liquified natural gas (LNG) is currently considered an attractive marine fuel in the short- to medium-terms that can lead to the reduction of the shipping industry carbon emissions. LNG fuelled ocean-going ships have been designed by employing either low-pressure or high-pressure fuel systems. This study aims at enhancing the safety of a high-pressure fuel gas supply system (FGSS) designed for ocean-going LNG fuelled vessels. A model-based safety analysis is performed by employing the MADe™ software. The functional model of the baseline design of the investigated system is developed and subsequently employed to carry out the Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), as well as the quantitative Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). FMECA provided the risk priority number (RPN) for the identified system failure scenarios, the analysis of which leads to the identification of the FGSS critical components. The FTA results, which include the probabilities of the selected top events and appropriate importance metrics, are used for the FMECA results verification. This study results demonstrate that the FGSS critical components include the process valves responsible for supplying either LNG or natural gas to the gas treatment system and consumers respectively, as well as the pressure feedback controllers. Recommendations for design alterations pertain to the addition of pressure sensors and redundancy of the identified critical system components. The derived results demonstrate that impact of these design alterations on the calculated safety metrics are quite considerable, thus enhancing the safety of the baseline design. This study contributes to the safety analysis of FGGS and supports decisions for the designer and operator of LNG fuelled ships. </jats:p>",

Restriction of leaf growth by low availability of carbon or water is among the earliest visible effects of potassium (K) deficiency. It is not known how K is involved in regulating the rhythmic supply of these two substrates, which differ remarkably across the day–night cycle, affecting leaf expansion. We investigated the effects of different K regimes on the time courses of leaf expansion, carbon assimilation, carbohydrates, and hydraulic properties of Brassica napus. Potassium supply increased leaf area, predominantly by promoting night-time leaf expansion (&amp;gt;60%), which was mainly associated with increased availability of carbohydrates from photosynthetic carbon fixation and import from old leaves rather than improvement of leaf hydraulics. However, sufficient K improved leaf hydraulic conductance to balance diurnal evaporative water loss and increase the osmotic contribution of water-soluble carbohydrates, thereby maintaining leaf turgor and increasing the daytime expansion rate. The results also indicated an ontogenetic role of K in modifying the amplitude of circadian expansion; almost 80% of the increase in leaf area occurred before the area reached 66.9% of the mature size. Our data provide mechanistic insight into K-mediated diel coordination of rhythmic carbon supply and water balance in leaf expansion.</jats:p>",

Front-of-package nutrition labels (FOPL) equip consumers to make healthier choices, but further evaluation and regulation regarding FOPL format, scope, and display have been recommended by the World Health Organization. As a leader in consumer FOPL guidance, the American Heart Association's (AHA) Heart Check programme certifies food companies seeking to add an AHA Heart Check logo as a FOPL for qualifying heart healthy products. A cross-sectional assessment of the AHA Heart Check Standard Certification was conducted within the US packaged food and beverage supply to assess the eligibility and prevalence of the programme as a FOPL. Methods: Data were derived from Label Insight's Open Data initiative, which is the largest publicly-available US branded food composition database. The proportions of products that were certified and eligible to be certified for the Standard Certification were reported by nutrient attributes, grocery aisles and food brands. Results: Among 153,453 products examined, fewer than 1% exhibited the Heart Check certification on their label. Among products that were not Heart Check certified,13.8% were eligible for Standard Certification. The most common reason for ineligibility was the saturated fat content (52%), followed by total fat content (47%) and sodium content (47%). Heart Check certification and eligibility differed substantially across grocery aisle categories. Conclusions: The abundance of unhealthy products in the US packaged food and beverage supply and absence of harmonized FOPL policies suggest the need for FOPL like the Heart Check label to promote adherence to healthy diets. There are opportunities for food manufacturers and the AHA to certify more heart healthy foods and beverages. However, more consistent criteria and transparent labelling could enhance Heart Check certification to facilitate consumers’ ability to make more informed and healthful purchases. </jats:p>",

It is necessary to find more alternative materials to improve the performance of FETs. 2D semiconductors attract great attention for channel material due to their atomic‐scale smoothness and dangling‐bond‐free surface, and the gate electrostatic properties and charge carrier mobility are better than traditional 3D Si‐based semiconductor. In this paper, using density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, the electronic properties and device performance of sub‐5 nm monolayer SiMe‐graphene n‐type field‐effect transistors are evaluated. Remarkably, the on‐state current value of the FET can reach 3070 µA µm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which greatly surpasses most of reported FETs based on other 2D semiconductors. In addition, the on‐state current, power dissipation, and delay time of the SiMe‐graphene FETs satisfy the high‐performance requirements of the 2020 International Roadmap for Device and Systems under different supply voltages, which indicates that the FETs can work at different operating frequencies and power consumption. Moreover, via controlling electrode doping concentration, the channel length can be reduced to 4 nm. In total, the SiMe‐graphene is a favorable channel material for future FETs devices.</jats:p>",

This study uses data‐driven analysis to clarify circular supply chain trends and opportunities in practice. A valid hierarchical circular supply chain structure is composed of a big dataset. However, the attributes of the hierarchical circular supply chain structure must be explored to identify the opportunities and challenges of the circular supply chain. A combination of data‐driven content and cluster analysis, including the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy decision‐making trials, evaluation laboratories, and the entropy weight method, is utilized to address this gap. The study analyzes a set of five attributes from the literature, and 23 criteria are validated. The results show that resource recovery implementation, Industry 4.0 and digitalization, and reverse supply chain practice pertain to the causal group, while circular business strategy and life cycle sustainability assessment are included in the effect group. The conclusive criteria comprise material efficiency, waste‐to‐energy, machine learning, e‐waste, plastic recycling, and artificial intelligence.</jats:p>",

Based on the relationship between the development height of the ‘two belts’ of shallow coal seams and the relative occurrence of location of aquifers, the aquifers are generalized and classified according to occurrences location. Taking Bulianta coal mine as the research background, a discrete element fluid–solid coupling numerical simulation model is constructed to analyze the development characteristics of mining-induced fractures after coal seam mining, and the water replenishment channel of the CMUR is determined. On this basis, analysis is made on the change law of water pressure in the aquifer, aquifuge and coal seam roof under mining action. Taking hydraulic head pressure and water velocity as the judgment basis, prediction and evaluation are made on the water replenishment capacity of CMUR.

It has a specific negative impact on the raw material supply, procurement management, production resumption, logistics, and market of the supply chain, which can trigger cascading failures in supply chain networks. Aiming at the failure of upstream/downstream firms in supply chain networks due to the decreased product demand/material supply under the COVID-19, the present study adopted an underload cascading failure model for the supply chain networks. In this model, the hierarchical supply chain networks were constructed based on the Erdos Renyi (ER) model and Barabasi Albert (BA) model. The validity of the model was verified under random attack and target attack. In the random attack mode, the influences of model parameters were studied, and in the target attack mode, the influence of target protection and random protection measures on enhancing network invulnerability was also studied. Simulation results showed that the initial load and capacity lower bound of nodes impact cascading failure size. The former has a positive correlation with cascading failure size, while the latter negatively correlates with cascading failure size. Furthermore, random protection measures are more practical to prevent cascading failures.</jats:p>",

The simulation accuracy of such models hinges upon the understanding of key parameters of the models, which remains elusive so far. To address such an open issue, this paper employs the discrete vapor cavity model (DVCM) and the discrete gas cavity model (DGCM), combined with the quasi-2D friction model, with a particular focus on revealing the sensitivity of these models to the key parameters such as grid number and weighting parameters. Based on the quantitative analysis and pressure fluctuation history, a method is developed to evaluate the accuracy of numerical results. Results show that the inclusion of the quasi-2D friction model improves the accuracy of predicting time of cavity formation and collapse; however, it does not affect the selection of grid number. Meanwhile, numerical results are sensitive to the weighting parameter of the viscous term in the quasi-2D friction model except for the case of low-intensity cavitation and its value of 1 is suggested for all cases. From the practical point of view, our finding is helpful to understand the feature of discrete multiple-cavity models and improve the simulating accuracy of transient cavitation pipe flows.</jats:p>",

Climate projections and an exponential forest fire response to climate-induced drying suggest the next 3 decades will see repeated years when WUS forest fire area exceeds that of 2020, which set a modern record for forest area burned.

This model is nonconvex because the decision variables are truncated by the random variable in the objective function. It is a common technical challenge encountered in many operations management models. To address this challenge, we adopt a novel transformation technique to transform the nonconvex problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Then, we provide a smoothing sample average approximation (SAA) method to solve the transformed problem. The SAA model is a good approximation for the expected value function in the objective function when the number of samples is large enough. The smoothing technique can transfer the nonsmooth plus function into a smoothing function in the model, and thus, we can use the numerical methods for the common nonlinear integer programming to solve the transformed model. Numerical tests verify the effectiveness of the new model and the smoothing SAA method.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, consumers’ awareness of the necessity of environmental protection is gradually improving, and more consumers pay attention to the environmental attributes of products, which all encourages enterprises to have great power to implement low carbon technology. As rational decision makers, members tend to show the characteristics of risk aversion. How to meet the needs of consumers and reduce their own risks has become a key point of low-carbon supply chain management. Considering carbon quota policy, in this paper, the optimal pricing decision-making process of a supply chain system is discussed under risk-neutral and risk-avoidance decision-making scenarios by game theory, and a cost-sharing contract is used to coordinate the decision-making process of a supply chain system. By analyzing the influence of the risk aversion coefficient on the optimal strategies of participants, we find that when the manufacturer has the risk aversion characteristic, the risk aversion coefficient will further reduce the carbon emission rate, the wholesale price of the product and the manufacturer’s profit but increase the product order quantity and the retailer’s profit. In addition, if consumers have a high preference for low-carbon products, the manufacturer’s risk-aversion coefficient will lead to a lower selling price than in the centralized decision-making situation, and the profit of the supply chain system will also be further reduced. When the cost-sharing contract is adopted for coordination, the Pareto improvement of supply chain members’ profits can be achieved when the parameters of the cost-sharing contract are appropriate, regardless of the manufacturer’s risk-neutral decision or risk-aversion decision.</jats:p>"

Several weirs, installed previously to secure sufficient water resources from these rivers, were opened in 2017 for restoring the riverine environment. Weir-controlled river level fluctuations have altered stream–aquifer interactions, leading to groundwater drawdown. In this study, changes in stream–aquifer interaction caused by seasonal pumping and weir opening were investigated, using Visual MODFLOW. Two indexes that considered the pump type and aquifer characteristics—the pumping available thickness (PAT) and aquifer productivity index (API)—were used to analyze the effects of weir opening on seasonal groundwater use. Our simulations indicated that weir opening had a large impact on seasonal groundwater use due to groundwater drawdown, especially with respect to centrifugal pumps located in low transmissivity areas where the API decreased after the weir was opened. The resulting decrease in groundwater pumping rates would lower the thermal effect of the water-curtain greenhouse process. This indicates that water supply alternatives are needed so that the weirs can be operated efficiently and field requirements can be met, while the deleterious effects on groundwater are avoided.</jats:p>"

This situation calls for more effective water management alternatives including rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. Due to the lack of biophysical data and infrastructure, the identification of suitable sites for various RWH systems is a challenging issue. However, integrating geospatial analysis and modeling approaches has become a promising tool to identify suitable sites for RWH. Thus, this study aimed at identifying suitable sites for RWH in the Nyabugogo catchment located in Rwanda by integrating a geo-information-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Moreover, the sediment yield was compared to the soil erosion evaluated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) owing to the lack of sediment concentration measured data. The results revealed that about 4.8 and 16.35% of the study area are classified as highly suitable and suitable areas for RWH, respectively. Around 6% of the study area (98.5 km2) was found to be suitable for farm ponds, whereas 1.6% (26.1 km2) suitable for check dams, and 25.9% (423 km2) suitable for bench terraces. Among 50 proposed sites for the RWH structures, 29 are located in the most suitable area for RWH. The results implicated that the surface runoff, sediment yield, and topography are essential factors in identifying the suitability of RWH areas. It is concluded that the integrated geospatial and MCDM techniques provide a useful and efficient method for planning RWH at a basin scale in the study area.</jats:p>",

While only the unilateral altruistic preference of the manufacturer or retailer can improve product greenness, the profit of the other member, and the overall profit of the green supply chain, doing so will reduce its own profit. When the two members have the same degree of altruistic preference, the retailer’s altruistic preference is more conducive to improving product greenness. Increasing government subsidies can strengthen, to a certain extent, the effect of altruistic preference on product greenness, the profit of the other member, and the profit of the green supply chain. However, when the manufacturer implements altruistic preference, if the government subsidy exceeds a certain range, then the increase in the government subsidy will accelerate the decline of the manufacturer’s own profit.</jats:p>",
