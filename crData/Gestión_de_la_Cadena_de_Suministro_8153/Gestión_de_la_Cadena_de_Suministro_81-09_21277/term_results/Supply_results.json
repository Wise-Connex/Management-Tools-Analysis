Physical testing was carried out using 1/100th scale models of supply vessels and specialised moorings in regular waves of varying frequency and height. Irregular waves will be used in future tests and the effect of wind examined in greater detail.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper presents typical results from model tests which include vessel motions in yaw, surge and sway as well as mooring loads in the stern lines and the bow chain. Bow moorings examined are tethered buoys to which the vessel's anchor chain is attached. Two different configurations, as presently being employed in the North Sea, are investigated and compared with results obtained using a catenary bow mooring, provided by the supply vessel's own anchor chain. It is shown that these bow moorings, in conjunction with conventional stern lines alone, are not sufficient to prevent adverse vessel motions at wave frequencies which could be encountered close to natural frequencies of the system. Results are also presented to illustrate the effect of pretensioning the bow mooring. Finally, an investigation was carried out to assess the performance of a position-controlled winch system used in conjunction with the stern moorings. The tests showed that significantly lower line-tensions were obtained in comparison with the conventional stern moorings and snatching was eliminated. Furthermore the motions of the vessel were dramatically reduced.</jats:p>",

La séquence d'alimentation du gnou Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell) en 1973 dans le bassin, fut suivie sur base saisonnière pour déterminer les réactions du gnou aux conditions fluctuantes de ses ressources alimentaires. Les résultats suggérent que, bien que le broutage fu&amp;#x030c;t aisé dans le bassin, à cause du fait que les brouteurs et herbe grossière, comme l'éléphant, étaient entrés dans le bassin avant les brouteurs et herbe fine, il y eut une concentration bien nette de gnous sur le gazon à Cynodon dactylon et sur la végétation des marais en saison sèche. Ceci indique la limitation de la surface disponible pour les herbivores au long de la saison sèche bien quéils soient probablement la pa&amp;#x030c;ture préférée à ce moment précis. Les données sur la productivité primaire montrent que Cynodon dactylon est productif tout au long du calendrier de broutage, par rapport aux autres types principaux de savané dans le bassin, sauf la végétation des marais. Le rendement du broutage (G.E.) par exemple, était de 89.90%, sur Cynodon dactylon et de 96.3% sur Sporobolus marginatus. La réponse physiologique du gnou aux conditions variables des ressources alimentaires, indique quéil y a une déterioration progressive de la situation A la fin de la saison sèche.

Subepicardial (epi) and subendocardial (endo) O2 saturations were determined with a microspectrophotometric technique. Regional flow was determined with radioactive microspheres and regional O2 consumption by the Fick principle. In the control group, endo venous O2 saturation [31 +/- 3% (SE)] was lower than epi (42 +/- 2%). There were no significant regional differences in blood flow (avg 128 +/- 2 ml . min-1 . 100 g-1). With methoxamine when heart rate fell, there were no differences in regional flow or consumption when compared to control. During methoxamine infusion, when heart rate was maintained, there was higher coronary blood flow (361 +/- 52 ml . min-1 . 100 g-1) and O2 consumption (27 +/- 4 ml O2 . min-1 . 100 g-1). No regional differences, epi vs. endo, were found in this group. After a 50-mmHg pressure rise, the endo region of the left ventricle had an increased O2 consumption mediated by an increased coronary blood flow without a significant rise in O2 extraction, similarly to epi. </jats:p>",
