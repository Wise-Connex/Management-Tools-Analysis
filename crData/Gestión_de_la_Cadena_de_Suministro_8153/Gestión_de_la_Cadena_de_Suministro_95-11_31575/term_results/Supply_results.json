      "abstract": "<jats:p>We all know about the great revolution in customer care and customer\nservice. Organizations nowadays have to use their service to compete\n– customers themselves are more sophisticated than they once were\nand are unlikely to buy on brand name alone; they expect reliability,\ncompetitive pricing, availability, long‐life, etc. – and they\nexpect good service. One of the reasons for this is the increase in\nglobalization. Organizations are no longer just competing with others in\nthe same town, the same region or even the same country; their\ncompetitors can reach their markets from anywhere in the world. This\nmeans that we are always competing against the best. It is no longer\nenough to get our product to market – we have to <jats:italic>know</jats:italic> that\na customer is waiting for what we are supplying, and wants it in the\nform that we are supplying. No longer can we rely on engineers to make\nthe products and salesmen to sell them. They now have to work together\nto understand customer needs and set about meeting them. Customers need\nto be won with our first meeting, our first order, our first service. If\nnot won then, we may never get another chance.</jats:p>",

The productivity improvement of the 1980s was genuine and was largely due to the reduction in union power brought about by the trade union legislation of the 1980s. The 1980s and 1990s have also seen large falls in the proportion of the labour force which is unqualified and rises in enrolment rates in further and higher education, changes which tend to increase long-run growth. But two factors have obscured the extent o f the improvement. First, the whole climate for economic growth is less favourable than it was in the so-called Golden Age prior to the first oil shock in 1973. Second, UK macroeconomic policy compares poorly with other OECD countries: booms have been shorter and recessions longer, so that microeconomic success has been masked by macroeconomic failure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Financing investments in water supply and sanitation has been a perennial problem in all countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The contribution to capital funding derived from the income of operating companies has been very small, a direct consequence of unrealistically low tariffs. The situation has worsened with the increasing need to provide sewage treatment to reduce the gross pollution of most water bodies in the vicinity of large cities. This paper, on the basis of recent studies conducted in EC LAC, explores the practicability of the self‐financing of water supply and sanitation services, including sewage treatment, through the income derived from tariffs. If this is to be achieved then it is important that the entire population pays for services, an issue of some importance given the unequal distribution of income in most cities of the region. The conclusion reached is that on the basis of the available information on costs, together with the experience of some countries, financing through tariffs is feasible, particularly if subsidies are provided to the poorest households. Tariff based financing is probably the only means of achieving universal coverage by the year 2000 as well as sewage treatment, the rehabilitation of existing systems, maintenance and the necessary institutional development</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Estimates of a dynamic dual model of Alberta dairy, using panel data from 1975–91, show that strong complementarity between cattle and quota licenses results in short‐run cattle adjustments that are opposite in direction from the long‐run adjustments. A model of total factor productivity growth under dynamic input adjustment shows that the distortions to cattle investment caused by investing in quota licenses adversely affects productivity growth. As a result, there is likely to be a significant understatement of single‐period estimates of the cost of supply management in the dairy sector.</jats:p>",

Significant differences were found between specialties for the activities of prescription and clinical monitoring, stock control and the transcription of prescriptions, travel, annotation, intervention with a doctor or nurse, information to a patient and unproductive time (P&amp;lt;0.05).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>On the psycho-geriatric and long-stay geriatric wards, a substantial proportion of pharmacist activity was found to be devoted to stock control and transcription. Two new systems of drug supply were then introduced to these wards and the activity sampling procedure was used to evaluate the effect of the change. It was found that a system employing a technician top-up service significantly reduced the proportion of time the pharmacist spent on stock control and transcription (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and increased the time spent on clinical monitoring (P&amp;lt;0.05). An estimate based on “total contact time” per occupied bed showed that this new method of supply was achieved at little or no increase in cost, and was arguably a more effective use of pharmacist and technician skills.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objectives of this study were to determine in horses 1) the ages at which viable cartilage canal vessels are present in the articular–epiphyseal cartilage complex of three predilection sites and one nonpredilection site of osteochondrosis (OC), 2) the prevalence of lesions of OC in these sites, and 3) whether there was an association of lesions of OC with necrotic cartilage canal blood vessels. The medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral trochlear ridge, and distal ends of the tibia and proximal phalanx were examined grossly, microradiographically, and histologically in 35 horses 18 months old or younger. Cartilage canals containing patent blood vessels were present in all sites examined in foals less than 3 weeks old and were absent from all sites by 7 months of age. The overall prevalence of lesions of OC at one or more of the sites examined was 12/35 (34%). Prevalence increased to 11/22 (50%) in horses 2 months old and older. These lesions occurred primarily in the medial condyle of the femur ( n = 5) and the intermediate ridge of the distal tibia ( n = 5). All lesions seen in horses between 3 weeks and 5 months of age were associated with necrotic cartilage canal blood vessels. In horses 7 months of age and older, lesions of OC were considered chronic because of extensive involvement of the subchondral bone and bone marrow. These results suggest that OC lesions develop prior to 7 months of age and that ischemic necrosis of cartilage secondary to a defect in vascular supply is an important factor in the pathogenesis of this disease in horses.</jats:p>",
