      "abstract": "<p>The increasing rate of technology growth has resulted in decrease in cost of information. These technologies are helpful in coordinating the activities resulting in effective management of the supply chain. Literature shows that the use of Information Technology (IT) plays an important role in managing the processes of SCM. This has resulted in increasing use of IT in SCM. The computerization of SCM processes, if implemented in one go may result in failure. IT implementation prioritization in supply chain is a major issue before the planner as there is no clear cut formula to solve this problem. This paper considers components of SCM like material management, purchase management, production management, logistics and distribution and customer interface for IT implementation prioritization. Two multi-criteria decision making methods (MCDM) viz. analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used in this paper. The novelty of the paper lies in integration of AHP and TOPSIS methods for IT implementation prioritization. The weights of the criterions and the alternatives are calculated using AHP method which is used as an input for TOPSIS analysis for prioritization of IT implementation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Historically, the growth of the beef industry has been hampered by various entities, i.e., breeders, cow-calf producers, stockers, backgrounders, processors, etc..., within the beef industry’s supply chain. The primary obstacles to growth are the large numbers of participants in the upstream side of the supply chain and the lack of coordination between them. Over the last decade significant advances have been made in information and communication technologies, and many new companies have been founded to promote these technical advances. This research looks at both the upstream and downstream participants to determine the degree to which information technologies are currently being utilized and the degree that these new technologies have driven performance improvements in the beef industry’s supply chain. Through surveys, the authors find that the beef industry does not use information technologies to their benefit and that the US beef supply chain is not yet strategically poised to enable the use of these technologies.</p>",

An evolution teamwork system based on multi-agents that can organize most team members in supply chain network was proposed. The proposed model performs adaptive development relying on differential evolution process.

Analogies from thermodynamics are used to describe the phenomenon in supply chain knowledge sharing. The study finds that distance and sender capacity are important to reduce knowledge sharing uncertainty. Furthermore, higher contact frequency between the sender and the receiver without considering sender capacity is proven to be insignificant to reduce uncertainty. This mechanism provides a new approach to explicate knowledge sharing in supply networks. It also serves as a deep-rooted opening point for supplementary empirical assessment. The mechanism facilitates managers to expand their understanding of composite circumstances embedded into global supply networks to share their knowledge. With enhanced understanding, managers can spotlight their actions, increasing their firms’ competitiveness. This study provides a deeper theoretical understanding of knowledge sharing in supply networks with a practical approach.</p>",

In addition, system dynamic is applied to show the long term effect of both strategic decisions (price and production quantity) on profit and against demand uncertainty.

The increase in wage premiums has been driven mostly by younger age groups while older age groups have not experienced any significant increase. Using a demand and supply model with imperfect substitution across age groups (developed in Card and Lemieux, 2001), this paper demonstrates that workers are not perfect substitutes across age groups. The paper finds that the increase in the wage premium has come mostly from demand shifts in favor of workers with a tertiary education. More importantly, the growth rate of demand for tertiary educated workers relative to secondary educated workers was fairly stable in the 1980s and the 1990s. However, the relative supply played an important role not only in determining the extent of increase in wage premium, but also its timing. The increase in relative supply of tertiary workers during 1983-1993 negated the demand shift; as a result, the wage premium did not increase much. But during 1993-1999, the growth rate of the relative supply of tertiary workers decelerated, while relative supply became virtually stagnant during 1999-2004. Both these periods saw an increase in the wage premium as the countervailing supply shift was weak.</jats:p>"

The theoretical results agree in general with the experimental. The experimental result demonstrates its high load, however its big gas cavity.

The analysis based on structural modeling on key factors that affect the flow of knowledge shows that organizational structure and knowledge gap, as the basic factors, could affect the efficiency of knowledge flow.</jats:p>"

The analysis reported here found that many economically distressed communities face immediate human capital and labor market concerns that may prevent the implementation of competitive economic development approaches. Unless these regions address these human capital constraints, they are at continued risk of falling further behind. They must begin with the development of programs and policies that build regional partnerships among local school districts, career centers, local businesses, and community colleges, and universities.</jats:p>"

Although the policy of upscaling service provision has been continued over this period, the driving forces behind the upscaling process have changed from government-steered upscaling to mergers which are initiated and executed by the water utilities. The shift in drivFing forces reflects two interlinked changes in the Dutch water supply sector. First, it highlights a shift in objectives that public water utilities are expected to achieve. The government-driven mergers in the first part of the 20th century focused on expanding service coverage to the unserved population. The mergers of the past decade highlight the increasing emphasis on efficiency and “market position”. Secondly, the change in driving forces behind the mergers in the Dutch water supply sector, as illustrated by the case of Friesland, reflect the shift to a “new model of public management” in the water services sector in which public water utilities are expected to operate as autonomous agencies and on the basis of commercial principles (meaning that economic considerations for mergers predominate).</jats:p>",

So far, the industrialized nations have completely presumed for granted an uninterruptable supply of cheap crude oil. Petroleum liquids are exhaustible resources; thus, a good forecasting scheme of oil supply will be crucial to all parties involved in the petroleum business such as oil companies, financial institutions, public policy planners and makers, and oil exporting and importing countries. Such a model will also help bring stability and security to the crude oil market. Over the years, accurate prediction of oil production was confronted by fluctuating ecological, economical, and political factors, which imposed many restrictions on its exploration, transportation, and supply and demand.</jats:p><jats:p>The objective of this paper is to illustrate the advantages of the multi-cyclic Hubbert model. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for the cases where the production rate fluctuates with time. We will also illustrate the effects of new discoveries or additional reserves due to innovative technology on peak oil rate and time and show how the multi-cyclic model accommodates these changes. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model to history match any future fluctuation in the production data. Historical production data of 47 countries around the world are used to predict the peak oil. The production rates of the last four years (2006-2009) are used to validate the accuracy of the model.</jats:p>",

We find that hydrate distribution and fracture behavior are largely determined by the phase of the methane supply. We allow free gas to enter the RHSZ when porewater salinity increases to the value required for three‐phase equilibrium. Fractures nucleate when the excess pore pressure exceeds the vertical hydrostatic effective stress. At Hydrate Ridge, where methane supply is dominantly free gas, hydrate saturation increases upwards and fractures nucleate high within the RHSZ, eventually allowing gas to vent to the seafloor. At Blake Ridge, where methane supply is dominantly in the dissolved phase, hydrate saturation is greatest at the base of the RHSZ; fractures nucleate here and in some cases could propagate through the RHSZ, allowing methane‐charged water to vent to the seafloor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase of aeroengine performance through the improvement of aerodynamic efficiency of core flow is becoming more and more difficult to achieve. However, there are still some devices that could be improved to enhance global engine efficiency. Particularly, investigations on the internal air cooling systems may lead to a reduction of cooling air with a direct benefit to the overall performance. At the same time, further investigations on heat transfer mechanisms within turbine cavities may help to optimize cooling air flows, saving engine life duration. This paper presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study aimed at the characterization of the effects of different geometries for cooling air supply within turbine cavities on wall thermal effectiveness and sealing mass flow rate. Several sealing air supply geometries were considered in order to point out the role of cooling air injection position, swirl number, and jet penetration on the cavities’ sealing performance. Steady state calculations were performed using two different computational domains: the first consists of a sector model of the whole turbine including the second stator well, while the second is a cut-down model of the stator well. Thanks to the simplified geometry of the test rig with respect to actual engines, the study has pointed out clear design suggestions regarding the effects of geometry modification of cooling air supply systems.</jats:p>",

The assessment indicators of the emergency management system in the supply chain are provided in this thesis based on both theoretical and empirical studies. By considering fuzzy uncertainty of the source of the data, FOWA operator is introduced, and the effectiveness and practicality of the indicator system and model are verified through empirical studies. This method is visual, concise and easy to calculate, which yet needs gradual improvement in practical applications.</jats:p>"

Service innovation based on currently available advanced technologies has become critical in improving enterprises’ competitive strengths. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, which can provide a mobile, scalable, and reliable monitoring solution, is emerging as a tool for service innovation in supply chain management. This paper provides an overview of wireless sensor network technology and discusses how it can benefit modern industries. The fundamental theories of WSN are introduced as well as an overview of the development. The impact of information technologies on supply chain management and service innovation is then briefly discussed. Much emphasis is placed on the feasibility, procedures, and critical challenges of implementing WSN in supply chain management innovation. Current and future applications of WSN are also provided, followed by a case study demonstrating the application potentials of WSN for service innovation in the healthcare industry.</p>",

In this changing business environment, the most successful companies are those that leverage their investment in Web-based technologies by implementing e-business solutions supported by sound existing infrastructures based on well-functioning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Companies must also forge tighter links in the supply chain, from raw materials to customers and have increasingly turned to the Internet and Web-based technologies to do so. This paper presents a framework for understanding e-business opportunities within the context of a traditional enterprise and its infrastructure and examines the evolving relationship between e-business and ERP. These developments are moving businesses toward the concept of e-Supply Chain to achieve true supply chain integration. The issues and challenges faced by organizations in moving to such a complete e-business environment are discussed and suggestions are offered for businesses to navigate this challenging transformation.</p>",

Balancing the conflicts between the improvement of visibility and the decrease of sensitive information shared is paramount. In this paper, the authors propose a leader-follower game model called LFM to model the strategic game between buyer and supplier. A Stackelberg equilibrium state is then computed as the solution to this game model. The proposed approach exhibits better performance when compared with conventional optimization approaches via derivation in terms of the total information sharing level and the total gain acquired verified by the experiments. In the future, the authors will extend this approach to a more complex situation with more participants in a dynamic environment.</p>",

Supply‐chain managers and finance or treasury managers, however, live in different worlds, and integration does not come easily. The article argues that decentralized finance functions lead to financial inefficiencies. The authors identify five subarchitectures to competitive supply chains and argue that visualizing the supply chain financially is the first step to controlling and improving it. Finance is embedded in every step of the supply chain — and business model. Management guidelines of what to change, what to eliminate, and what to adapt are presented along with the new starting points of strategy and customers' ever‐changing needs. Consequently, the end game is profit maximization rather than only cost minimization, and both within acceptable risk parameters. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The recent development of dramatically expanded global supply chains has resulted in social and environmental problems upstream that are attributable at least in part to downstream marketers and consumers. Marketers have responded mainly by using corporate social responsibility (CSR)<jats:italic>communication</jats:italic>to counter the critique of CSR<jats:italic>practice</jats:italic>, but these claims of ethical corporate behavior often lack credibility and can result in a backlash against brands. The article argues that more adequate attention to the harmful upstream effects of downstream marketing and consumption decisions requires greater attention to stakeholder marketing and marketer efforts to help create responsible consumers. It concludes by identifying implications for further research in this important emergent area of marketing ethics.</jats:p>",

Current approaches to addressing the problem have been “utility centric,” overlooking the significance of decentralized activities by consumers, groundwater extraction via private wells, and aquifer recharge by rainwater harvesting. We propose a framework that makes it possible to evaluate a wider range of centralized and decentralized policies than previously considered. The framework was used to simulate water supply and demand in a simulation model of Chennai, India. Three very different policies, supply augmentation, efficiency improvement, and rainwater harvesting, were evaluated using the model. The model results showed that none of the three policies perfectly satisfied our criteria of efficiency, reliability, equity, financial viability, and revenue generation. Instead, a combination of rainwater harvesting and efficiency improvement best meets these criteria.</jats:p>",

Such effort to manage the supply chain paves the way for effective and positive impact on various practices of supplier selection and that enhances the organizational performance. The foremost initiative of this research paper is to empirically probe the various aspects and variables that have been already addressed in the previous literatures related to supplier selection, supply effort management and organizational performance. Further, this research delves to develop a measurement framework and pragmatically prove the framework through the measurement model. Preliminarily a factor structure for various constructs is made and the initial validity is determined from practicing managers and academicians. This research employs survey method and the data is collected from 358 supply chain professionals in India from manufacturing organisation. A measurement model is developed and proved with various tests of reliability and validity. The paper provides various constructs related to supplier selection, supply effort management and business performance. Finally the scale or instrument was developed. </jats:p>",

Preoperative angiograms from the next three patients demonstrated bilateral vascular supply. Embolization and endoscopic resection was successful in these cases. Review of the literature demonstrates that bilateral vascular supply is not commonly documented; however, it may be more frequent than previously thought. Other series demonstrate bilateral vascularity from 0% to 100%. Combining patients from nine studies, including our own, we found that 57 of 157 (36%) patients had tumors with bilateral vascular supply.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p>Bilateral vascular supply may be an underappreciated factor in JNA, and thorough radiographic investigation via angiography of bilateral carotid systems should be routinely done preoperatively.

In the proposed system, each agent will be communicated with other “agents” who will be the only responsible for making forecasts based on information provided to it by all components of the chain.

Increasing efficiency, limiting energy consumption, and reducing waste internally as well as along the supply chain has been one way that managers have addressed “going green.” Some examples include front-to-back printing and stringent recycling efforts. For the lumber industry, going green is not as easy as changing how employees print or recycle plastic bottles, especially since one of the main resources in the lumber industry is wood. In this regard, the authors discuss a proposed supply chain model to reduce intra-process shipments, improve raw material acquisition and usage, and improve production yields through repurposing of the wood by-product created during the manufacture of reclaimed, wood-based products. The proposed model also suggests that entrepreneurial efforts could lead the way in innovating how wood by-products can be used to create disruptive methods that could lead to new wood based businesses.</p>",

This simulation allows determination of supply gas flow properties such as flow rate and pressure as a function of time. The concentration is on transient processes of heavy duty gas turbine such as startup, shutdown, emergency stop and load following. In the past, it was common to use a quasi steady assumption allowed the simulation of the gas turbine system. In this work, a one dimensional dynamic model of the gas flow in a fixed area pipe with friction is developed. This development is based on McCormack finite difference method in straight pipes combined with the method of characteristic at branches. The McCormack technique is based on prediction-correction of steps. Such a procedure will allow one to take into account the time delays and response time of various devices associated with the transient processes of the gas turbine system. The most important device in the pipeline system of a gas turbine is the control valve that adjusts the fuel gas flow by precise control of its traveling piston. This particular element is modeled and simulated similar to a standard nozzle entrance section. Such a modeling scheme considers a chocked flow through the control valve. The considered hydraulic circuit is comprised of a combination of simple gas pipes, valves, and pressure loss components (e.g., junctions, bends, fittings, and injection nozzles). By specifying the boundary conditions and the control valve piston position, a method is developed that allows simulation of such hydraulic circuits. In continuation, the above mentioned hydraulic circuit is considered as a fuel gas supply system for a heavy duty gas turbine operating in a power plant. The circuit is simulated, and such disturbances during start, shutdown, piston travel of the control valve, and break in power generation are taken into account. Finally, fuel flow properties during mentioned processes would be obtained as a function of time and an analysis of the simulation results is performed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reliable predictions of sediment transport and river morphology in response to variations in natural and human‐induced drivers are necessary for river engineering and management. Because engineering and management applications may span a wide range of space and time scales, a broad spectrum of modeling approaches has been developed, ranging from suspended‐sediment “rating curves” to complex three‐dimensional morphodynamic models. Suspended sediment rating curves are an attractive approach for evaluating changes in multi‐year sediment budgets resulting from changes in flow regimes because they are simple to implement, computationally efficient, and the empirical parameters can be estimated from quantities that are commonly measured in the field (i.e., suspended sediment concentration and water discharge). However, the standard rating curve approach assumes a unique suspended sediment concentration for a given water discharge. This assumption is not valid in rivers where sediment supply varies enough to cause changes in particle size or changes in areal coverage of sediment on the bed; both of these changes cause variations in suspended sediment concentration for a given water discharge. More complex numerical models of hydraulics and morphodynamics have been developed to address such physical changes of the bed. This additional complexity comes at a cost in terms of computations as well as the type and amount of data required for model setup, calibration, and testing. Moreover, application of the resulting sediment‐transport models may require observations of bed‐sediment boundary conditions that require extensive (and expensive) observations or, alternatively, require the use of an additional model (subject to its own errors) merely to predict the bed‐sediment boundary conditions for use by the transport model. In this paper we present a hybrid approach that combines aspects of the rating curve method and the more complex morphodynamic models. Our primary objective was to develop an approach complex enough to capture the processes related to sediment supply limitation but simple enough to allow for rapid calculations of multi‐year sediment budgets. The approach relies on empirical relations between suspended sediment concentration and discharge but on a particle size specific basis and also tracks and incorporates the particle size distribution of the bed sediment. We have applied this approach to the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam (GCD), a reach that is particularly suited to such an approach because it is substantially sediment supply limited such that transport rates are strongly dependent on both water discharge and sediment supply. The results confirm the ability of the approach to simulate the effects of supply limitation, including periods of accumulation and bed fining as well as erosion and bed coarsening, using a very simple formulation. Although more empirical in nature than standard one‐dimensional morphodynamic models, this alternative approach is attractive because its simplicity allows for rapid evaluation of multi‐year sediment budgets under a range of flow regimes and sediment supply conditions, and also because it requires substantially less data for model setup and use.</jats:p>",

During the interval (2003–2009) sparse vegetation cover (<jats:italic>Psoralea lanceolata</jats:italic>) increased despite drier than normal moisture conditions and steady wind power during the growing season. Whereas these climatic conditions are typically ascribed to sustaining or increasing dune activity, here they coincide with stabilization. Through the use of geographic information system (GIS) analysis of volumetric changes it is shown that the increase of <jats:italic>P. lanceolata</jats:italic> can be attributed to the reduction of local sand supply from two blowouts along the arms of the parabolic dune during the six‐year period.

The retail price is either exogenous or endogenous. The market demand is described by the market share attraction model based on all retailers'shelf‐spaces and retail prices. We obtain optimal solutions for the centralized supply chain, where the optimal retail pricing is a modified version of the well‐known cost plus pricing strategy. We further get feasible contracts for the manufacturer to coordinate the hybrid and decentralized supply chains. The manufacturer can allocate the total profit free to himself and the retail market via the wholesale price when the retail price is exogenous, but otherwise he cannot. Finally, we point out that different characteristics of the retail market are due to different powers of the manufacturer, and the more power the manufacturer has, the simpler the contract to coordinate the chain will be. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, our investigations of the blood supply of thoracodorsal flap from the system of thoracodorsal angiosom indicate that the inferior angle of scapula is supplied directly from the system of thoracodorsal artery. Based on the results obtained, we concluded that the inferior angle of scapula is supplied by the branch of the thoracodorsal artery, which has a length of (54.0 ± 11.8) mm and a diameter of (1.3 ± 0.3) mm and can be included in the combined thoracodorsal flap.</jats:p>"

Several systems have been worked out on the qualification of the winter wheat in Hungary and other countries as well. Evaluating thequality is being made more difficult because the different quality features take part in the development of the quality in different degrees andthe values of the several quality features are in different intervals and these data are different dimension values. On the evidence of theresults, in the case of considering several features,it can be difficult to rank into one concrete quality cathegory. Researchers are trying todevelop complex quality index numbers in order to be able to define the quality more precisely. One of these complex quality index numbersis Gyıri’s, so called, Z-index.In three years from 2006 and 2008, we examined the change of the quality features of nine varieties of winter wheat with the help of theZ-index under the influence of the effects of the different cropyears and the fertilizer treatment. The results show that the Z-index of theexamined varieties of winter wheat were influenced by several factors. Examining the data of the three different breeding years together wecan observe the corrective effect of the different cropyears on the Z-index, and if we examine the three years separately and together, thedifferences of the quality features of the different varieties differentiate very well, and with the help of the Z-index the comparison of thetypes is easier and perspicuous, and the Z-index represents the different nutrient reactions of the different types as well. On the average ofthe three years, the types gave the best results at N120-150+PK nutrient level. Among the nine varieties the best results were given by Mv Suba,GK Békés and Mv Mazurka in the case of both low and higher nutrient levels.</jats:p>"

Modeling can be applied to assess trends in blood demand and supply and predict how these will develop over time.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:</jats:bold> We developed mathematical models to describe and predict the national demand of red blood cell (RBC) products. The first demand model assumes that the mean numbers of transfusions per inhabitant per age and sex are constant. A second demand model incorporates observed changes in clinical blood use over time. Further, a donation model is developed to predict future RBC supply. To estimate the supply of whole blood donations, we used annual donor retention rates, donor recruitment rates, and mean numbers of donations per donor year.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> The model based on demography only predicts an increase of 23% in RBC demand over 2008 to 2015. The second model, incorporating both demographic changes and trends in clinical RBC use, predicts a decrease of RBC demand by 8% over the same period. The predicted RBC supply closely follows the demand as predicted by the second model.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> Despite an aging population, RBC demand may not increase as much as predicted in other studies. This depends on the extent to which other effects, like that of optimal blood use, will neutralize the effects of aging of the transfusion recipient population. Still, the observed downward trend in donor recruitment in the Netherlands must be stopped to maintain a sufficient RBC supply.</jats:p>",

The tests were executed to characterize the friction-factor behavior of annular seals that use a roughened-surface stator and a smooth rotor. Friction factors were obtained from measurements of the mass flow rate and static pressure measurements along the smooth and roughened surfaces. In addition, dynamic pressure measurements were made at four axial locations at the bottom of individual holes and at facing locations in the smooth plate. The test facility is described, and a procedure for determining the friction factor is reviewed. Three clearances were investigated: 0.635, 0.381, and 0.254 mm. Tests were conducted with air at three different inlet pressures (84, 70, and 55 bars), producing a Reynolds numbers range from 50,000 to 700,000. Three surface configurations were tested including smooth-on-smooth, smooth-on-hole, and hole-on-hole. The hole-pattern plates are identical with the exception of the hole depth. For the smooth-on-smooth and smooth-on-hole configurations, the friction factor remains largely constant or increases slightly with increasing Reynolds numbers. The friction factor increases as the clearance between the plates increases. The test program was initiated to investigate a “friction-factor jump” phenomenon cited by Ha et al. in 1992 in test results from a flat-plate tester where, at elevated values of Reynolds numbers, the friction-factor began to increase steadily with increasing Reynolds numbers. They tested apposed honeycomb surfaces. For the present tests, the phenomenon was also observed for tests of apposed roughened surfaces but was not observed for smooth-on-smooth or smooth-on-rough configurations. When the phenomenon was observed, dynamic pressure measurements showed a peak-pressure oscillation at the calculated Helmholtz frequency of the holes.</jats:p>",

In a typical tourism supply chain (TSC) for package holidays, multiple tour operators reserve rooms from a hotel chain in advance according to their demand predictions. Discrepancies between demand\n predictions and actual demand lead to shortages or unused room reservations, which inevitably leads to reduced profits for the tour operators concerned. This article examines different TSC coordination strategies to determine how they can be used to help alleviate such negative effects. A\n game-theoretic approach is used to analyze the different coordination relationships between TSC players. Two coordination programs are discussed. The first is a horizontal coordination program in which tour operators exchange shortages or unused reservations with each other. The second is\n a vertical coordination program in which tour operators trade shortages or unused reservations with hotel chains. Game models are established and analyzed for the two coordination strategies and uncoordinated conditions, respectively. The analytical results suggest that both coordination strategies\n can be used to reduce the negative impacts of the demand uncertainty. The results also show that the horizontal coordination is preferred to the vertical coordination when the competition among tour operators is fierce.</jats:p>",

In the modeling process, three important managerial problems are discussed, i.e., the effect of coordination between a manufacturer and its supplier in dealing with uncertainties on product demand and supplier’s wholesale price, strategies for mitigating both errors in demand forecasting and supply risk, and modeling frameworks to determine the optimal solution for price and order quantity based on the varying levels of coordination.

The livelihood of many rural and urban people also depends on the proceeds obtained from the sell of charcoal. Thus this, study was conducted with the objective to quantify the amount of charcoal supplied to Addis Ababa city, the capital of Ethiopia and its means of transportation. It is a result of a one week follow up study on the inlet of charcoal into the city. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and SAS software. The result indicated that about 7,549 different sizes and weights of bags of charcoal were supplied to the city in a day, suggesting an equivalent of about 68,886 tones of charcoal per year and about 899, 818 trees to being cut to this supply, releasing about 125,717 – 167,623 tones of carbon to the atmosphere. About 35% of the total charcoal flowing into the city enters in the morning between 6:00 a.m. and 11:59 a.m. While, about 34%, 21% and 10% enters the city in the afternoon, during the night and evening, respectively. Of the 9,822 vehicles encountered, entering in to the city in a day, about 2,148 of them were coming with loads of charcoal, Isuzus and heavy Trucks such as tank Truck, daf Tractor, Mercedes-Benz Truck etc. being the major ones. The finding of the study also indicated, the high dependency of the city on charcoal as an energy source, negatively affecting the environment. </jats:p>",

Although suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory to meet total needs across all production sites, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit, and also transfer on-hand inventory in order to balance supply across sites. This paper describes the development, implementation, and impact of the process and optimization-based control system now used by Dell to address this supply-routing challenge for its U.S.-bound monitors. In a first phase, Dell created a new job definition focused solely on supply routing and implemented a supporting visualization tool. In a second phase, a decision support system relying on a mixed-integer programming formulation was implemented, overcoming two main challenges: (i) the estimation of shortages as a function of expected inventory, accounting for actual forecast quality; and (ii) the estimation of a meaningful shortage cost. This new methodology is estimated to have reduced Dell's inventory-repositioning costs for monitors by about 60%. </jats:p>",

The technical part of the assessment includes the Design Point (DP) and Off-Design (OD) analysis of the GT. The third part includes the simulation of the absorption cooling system alone and/or in cooperation with the prime mover. Finally, an evaluation methodology of tri-generation plants is introduced taking into account, both technical facts and economic data helping the potential users to decide whether it is profitable to use such technology or not. The economic scene will include the basic economic facts such as initial cost, handling and operational cost (fuel prices, maintenance etc), using methodology based on Net Present Value (NPV). The results are valuated using suitable sensitivity analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. From November 2008 through May 2009, the North Italy experienced the highest precipitation period recorded over the last century. As a result, a long series of flood events occurred in the Po river (North Italy). This series of events ended with a large flood in early May 2009. An event-response sampling was carried out in the Po prodelta in April–May 2009 to characterize this latter event and to investigate the strata preservation in the stratigraphy record as a result of this series of floods. The water sampling was carried out during two periods of the flood, including early in the event under conditions of moderate river flow (~5000 m3 s−1) and 24 h later during the peak discharge (~8000 m3 s−1). At each station, profiles of conductivity, transmittance, and fluorescence were acquired whereas surface and bottom waters were sampled to collect sediments in suspension. In addition, sediment cores were collected in the Po prodelta before and after the peak flood. Biogeochemical compositions and sedimentological characteristics of suspended and sediment samples were investigated using a multi-proxy approach that included bulk and biomarkers analyses. Furthermore, 7Be down-core profiles and radiographs were used to analyze the internal stratigraphy of sediment cores.  During moderate discharge, the water column did not show evidence of plume penetration. In surface waters, suspended sediment concentrations were found to be similar to low river discharge periods whereas the main OC was autochthonous. After 24 h, during the peak flood, water column properties and biogeochemical parameters exhibited marked changes indicating significant penetration of the turbid plume. However, suspended sediment concentrations and terrigenous OC content in surface waters were still less then expected based on the discharge. These results suggested that, since material enters the Adriatic as buoyancy-driven flow with a reduced transport capacity, settling and flocculation processes result in trapping a significant fraction of land-derived material prior to reaching the subaqueous prodelta.  In spite numerous floods occurred from November 2008 through April 2009, sediment cores collected in late April 2009 did not exhibited significant evidence of event-strata preservation. Since these floods were ordinary (2–3 y return period), the lack of preservation indicates that most of the sediment supply during these oridinary events does not reach the subaqueous prodelta. However, it is likely that modest sediment deposition occurs during these oridinary floods but thicknesses of these event-strata are not sufficient to compete with post-depositional processes.  Stations in the north and central prodelta were re-occupied after the peak of the May 2009 flood. Based on 7Be and radiographs, we estimated that 17 and 6 cm event-layers, respectively. Selective trapping of coarse material occurred in the central prodelta likely because of the geomorphologic setting of the central outlet characterized by an estuary-like mouth. Despite these settling processes, lignin-based parameters indicated that sources of the terrigenous OC were fairly homogenous throughout the channel network and between size-fractions.\n                        </jats:p>"

An important input into planning for such expansion are estimates of how both the supply of incremental oil and the derived CO2 demand from EOR are likely to vary with the prices of oil and CO2. We demonstrate how the “analog” method of predicting oil and CO2 flows can be used to readily generate such estimates, and apply the method to Wyoming's Powder River Basin. </jats:p>",

The present study assessed dairy farmers' responsiveness to both market price factors and non‐price factors within a liberalized market environment. Econometric analysis used in the study is based on a profit function using farm household survey data collected for a year. Results showed that dairy farmers are more responsive to non‐price factors than to price factors. Hence the need for a consistent and a sustained liberalization program in the sub‐sector, as well as reinforcing liberalization policies in place by increasing public expenditure on rural infrastructure and other agricultural support services.

We used the integrated model project to evaluate scenarios that included introduction of a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine topping cycle (SOFC/GT) as a supply‐side technology and reduction of electricity demand by energy conservation and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) cells in residential and commercial buildings as a demand‐side measure in Tokyo, Japan. Modeling results indicate that integrating multiple supply‐side and demand‐side countermeasures can result in more effective mitigation of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. In particular, although separately a moderate CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> tax and the SOFC/GT technology do not produce large CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mitigation, the combination of the two with PV installation could result in a 50% reduction in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions in 2050. Cancellation effects of combinations of supply‐side and demand‐side measures were also seen between supply‐side SOFC/GT systems and demand‐side rooftop PV cells, effects that might not be apparent without the integrated environmental assessment approach that we have adopted. An integrated environmental assessment approach using tools such as those described in this article could help researchers to assess these kinds of dynamic, nonlinear effects, which would not be predicted by conventional linear, “additive” approaches.</jats:p>",

The Second Circuit found that, because the arbitrator had the power to interpret the institutional rules governing the proceedings, he could not exceed his power in interpreting those rules to allow him to amend his award as he did. The Second Circuit’s decision permits arbitrators to give themselves the power to reconsider decisions they make in final awards, thereby effectively allowing parties to appeal awards to the arbitral tribunal. Such a power is not found in any well-established arbitral rules, runs counter to the functus officio doctrine and undermines the finality of awards.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Whereas the ERWT was based on a single interbasin transfer, the AGUA Programme excludes new transfers and focuses instead on different types of resources, including seawater and brackish water desalination and wastewater reuse, among others. The study includes not only water supply but the whole anthropic cycle of water, from water abstraction to wastewater treatment. In addition to standard LCA impact categories, a specific impact category focusing on freshwater resources is included, which takes into account freshwater scarcity in the affected water catchments. In most impact categories the AGUA Programme obtains similar or even lower impact scores than ERWT. Concerning impacts on freshwater resources, the AGUA Programme obtains an impact score 49% lower than the ERWT. Although the current water planning appears to perform better in many impact categories than its predecessor, this study shows that water supply in Spanish Mediterranean regions is substantially increasing its energy intensity and that Mediterranean basins suffer a very high level of water stress due to increasing demand and limited resources.</jats:p>",
