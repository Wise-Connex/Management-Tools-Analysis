The current study adopts the resource dependence theory to explain the direct effect of supply chain uncertainties on strategic supply management, operationalized as a second‐order construct comprising strategic purchasing, long‐term relationship orientation, interfirm communication, cross‐organizational teams and supplier integration. Using structural equation modeling, the 200‐firm sample provided evidence that strategic supply management is driven by supply and technology uncertainty. Demand uncertainty, on the other hand, was not found to have a significant impact on strategic supply management. Findings further support the link between strategic supply management and the performance of both buying and supplying firms.</jats:p>",

However, due to rising costs, there is an increasing trend in Ireland to outsource lower function manufacturing processes to lower‐cost locations but to retain high‐skill functions (such as R&amp;D). This trend, together with other factors such as its peripheral location, suggests that supply chain management is critical from an Irish perspective.

Only 25 per cent adopt SCM programmes and only 9 per cent of Irish companies have a specialised SCM or logistics manager. The gaps in their understanding of SCM are matched by the gaps in their awareness of key costs (e.g. 59 per cent of companies do not know their total supply chain costs).

The results suggest that different weights (i.e., the highest weight to New orders and the lowest weight to Supply deliveries) be assigned if all diffusion indexes in the initial set of six are retained. It also turns out that a simpler index based on two (New orders and Supply deliveries) of the six diffusion indexes, with equal weights, can be computed with little information loss. The new indexes are shown to correlate highly with many key business/economic indicators.</jats:p>",

The earth's population is projected to rise to around 9 billion by 2050, with a concomitant increase in demand for forest products. Inevitably, forests in general, and managed forest in particular, will be called on to provide an ever-increasing proportion of local supplies and the international wood trade. Five countries - China, USA, Russian Federation, India and Japan - have each established more than 10 million ha of plantation forests, collectively accounting for 65% of the global plantation resource. Forest managers have made huge strides over the past 200 years or so in improving crops through the application of silviculture and genetics. Yields and quality have been greatly increased in managed forests and exotic plantations by spacing and pruning regimes that allow shorter rotations and improved quality. A common issue is now the higher proportion of juvenile wood produced in these situations, but technologies such as material segregation and recombination are reducing the impact on customers. A major emerging factor is the growing awareness of the significant contribution of forests to global warming by decision-makers, and pressure of commitments to international agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol. This could lead to governments around the world creating and introducing a more favourable business climate for forestry activities, and a very significant increase in the proportion of global wood products derived from managed forests. However, the wood products industries cannot be complacent, as each generation brings new breeds of end users with less sentimental attachment with wood.</jats:p>"

Its economic institutions were historically similar to telecommunications and securities trading but internationalisation has differed: transnational technological and economic developments were limited over the period mid-1980s-2005, exposing the independent effects of reforms in the US and EU regulation. Moreover, regulatory competition in electricity is weak so that the main route for overseas reforms to influence domestic decisions about institutional change is ideational, through cross-national learning or examples. The chapter argues that policy forms of internationalisation are important even in the absence of powerful transnational technological and economic developments. EU regulation provided significant political impetus for change in France, Germany, and Italy from the 1990s onwards by offering occasions for reform, EU-level policy learning, and arguments to legitimate change. However, without potential regulatory competition, overseas examples played little role in domestic debates, and hence even Britain failed to pay serious attention to US reforms or seek to copy them.</jats:p>",

In the next century the usage of renewables must be at least tripled regarding the heating of buildings, which can be achieved mainly by using thermal water. By this method a large amount of natural gas can be replaced, and the increasing rate of district-heating costs can be slowed. The basic heat will be provided by geothermal energy and the gas boilers will be peak heat suppliers. Our Department has taken part in the construction of the largest geothermal district-heating system in Szentes, Hungary, where already four districts are supplied with thermal water. In this project 32000 GJ/a heat usage is accomplished.\n</jats:p>"

Providers of 3PL services complemented the effectiveness of logistics supply chain management extending the performance of hauliers and forwarders to what might be called outsourced logistics services providers. The main driver for this was large transportation companies that have striven to render their limited services to the whole transport chain. Firstly, this extended to what now is called forwarding services, i.e. responsibility and transport service was extended from only physical transportation to additional services. Then some transport and forwarding companies continued enlarging their responsibility so that it included an increased part of the transport chain up to a total responsibility for the entire transportation, from production to consumption. A nature of transportation services became more and more the nature of logistics. Companies started offering complete logistics solutions, instead of only isolated physical transportation services. This allowed a customer to concentrate on the core business instead of paying much attention to material flows.</jats:p>",

Urquhart, who established the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) that later was merged into the British Library Lending Division (BLLD), now called the British Library Document Supply Centre (BLDSC).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper presents a short history of the probabilistic revolution, particularly as it developed in the UK in the form of biometric statistics due to Darwin's theory of evolution. It focuses on the overthrow of the normal paradigm, according to which frequency distributions in nature and society conform to the normal law of error. The paper discusses the importance of the Poisson distribution and its utilization in the construction of stochastic models that better describe reality. Here the focus is on the compound Poisson distribution in the form of the negative binomial distribution (NBD). The paper then shows how Urquhart extended the probabilistic revolution to librarianship by using the Poisson as the probabilistic model in his analyses of the 1956 external loans made by the Science Museum Library (SML) as well as in his management of the scientific and technical (sci/tech) journal collection of the NLL. Thanks to this, Urquhart can be considered as playing a pivotal role in the creation of bibliometrics or the statistical bases of modern library and information science. The paper relates how Urquhart's son and daughter‐in‐law, John A. and Norma C. Urquhart, completed Urquhart's probabilistic breakthrough by advancing for the first time the NBD as the model for library use in a study executed at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, connecting bibliometrics with biometrics. It concludes with a discussion of Urquhart's Law and its probabilistic implications for the use of sci/tech journals in a library system.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>By being the first librarian to apply probability to the analysis of sci/tech journal use, Urquhart was instrumental in the creation of modern library and information science.

Supply chain flexibility has emerged from the manufacturing flexibility literature and hence to date is largely confined to a manufacturing context (neglecting the role of services). Empirical research often takes the form of a cross‐sectional postal questionnaire conducted at the firm‐level that fails to explore the inter‐organisational components of supply chain flexibility.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper presents a timely review of the available literature and provides a more complete definition of flexibility in the context of supply chains. It is argued that future empirical research should approach research design from a network perspective, treating the supply chain as the unit of analysis, in order to develop a more complete understanding of the effects of flexibility across the whole supply chain. The paper also explores combining a flexible supply chain strategy with proactive means of reducing unwanted supply chain uncertainty, focusing on the roles of supply chain design, supply chain collaboration and inter‐organisational information systems.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Supply management, the cornerstone of the integration of industrial supply chains, has evolved as a key research area. Based on quantitative and qualitative investigations of 225 electronics manufacturing firms, we examine the organizational impacts of strategic supply management (SSM) and the contexts of company size, process type, ISO 9000 certification, and quality management (QM) implementation that facilitate such an endeavor. We reveal that SSM is essentially a quality management initiative that requires bilateral efforts for continuous improvement and thus is not associated with the basic requirements of ISO 9000. We find that SSM improves on‐time shipments, reduces operational costs, and leads to customer satisfaction and improved business performance. Developed based on contemporary premises in supply chain and QM, this research refines our understanding of the relationships among quality initiatives, SSM, and organizational performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The effectiveness of specific design parameters depends strongly on the expected loading of the power distribution grid. Therefore, the commonly used approach to only use an even current distribution can lead to non-optimal power grid designs. For power grid optimization, a problem reduction from quadratic to linear order is presented. Simulations in a System-on-Chip (SoC) environment show, that power supply integrity mainly depends on the placing of the cores within the SoC die.</jats:p>"

I use the Current Population Survey to compare estimates when group sizes are extremely large to those that arise from randomly drawing subsamples of observations from the large groups. I augment this approach with Monte Carlo analysis so as to precisely quantify biases and coverage rates. In this particular application, thousands of observations per group are required before small‐sample issues can be ignored in estimation and sampling error leads to large downward biases in the estimated income elasticity.

Further, containers without electronic seals may be prohibited or restricted for import based on this planned regulation. An electronic seal is a tamper-free seal with radio frequency identification (RFID) chips embedded in it. It could provide additional security information such as the tamper evidence and the history of tampering status. In this paper, a brief review of the types of container seals, the characteristics of electronic seals, and their system components are presented. International efforts for securing cargo security are also reviewed including Container Security Initiative (CSI), Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and International Standards Organization (ISO) requirements. Finally, the current issues and the status of technology development are discussed with future directions as a final word</jats:p>",

More specifically, as they are now under the permanent threat of terrorism, and because offering sufficient security levels is bound to become a necessary condition for global supply-chain membership, seaports need to adjust their risk management strategy and processes accordingly.

The standard aims to evaluate a firm's ability to effectively design, produce, and deliver quality products and services. This version of the standard tries to enhance customer satisfaction by including more top‐management involvement and continual improvement. Despite widespread international acceptance, the new standard is surrounded by controversy similar to that surrounding its predecessor, the 1994 version. The literature is clearly divided in its assessment of ISO 9000:2000, which is viewed as either a quality management (QM)‐based system or as another paper‐driven process that increases risk, uncertainty, and costs. This study utilizes case‐based research to address the competing views of the ISO 9000:2000 standard in an attempt to see if a sample of firms in the automotive industry can be positioned within the Miles and Snow [Miles, R.E., Snow, C.C., 1978. Organizational Strategy, Structure and Process. McGraw‐Hill, New York] strategic typology. We compare different amounts of quality standard integration and quality assurance in the supply chain of firms with ISO 9000:2000 registration while positing several research propositions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the last 30 years, tremendous progress in identifying transfusion‐transmitted viruses such as HBV, HCV, and HIV in industrialized countries has been achieved. Currently, the residual risk of transmitting these viruses through transfusion is very low especially after the introduction of “minipool” nucleic acid‐amplification tests. Despite these major technical advances, there remains a legitimate concern as to the transmission of other blood‐borne infectious agents through blood transfusion. Among these agents are HBV mutants, occult HBV, and HCV infections, malaria, Chagas, West Nile, dengue, and vesiviruses, bacterial infections such as<jats:italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</jats:italic>, and tick borne diseases such as human monocytic ehrlichiosis, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme and prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt and variant Creutzfeldt. Most of these agents are very rarely transmitted by transfusion in industrialized countries. However, an awareness of their possible transmission is essential for the control of spread of these diseases among the public by human‐to‐human transmission via blood transfusion. This review summarizes the current status of prevalence and diagnosis of these emerging diseases and also updates our knowledge on recently discovered non‐pathogenic blood‐borne viruses such as GB virus C and Torque Tenoviruses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction industry has globally been identified by investors and portfolio managers as under-performing in terms of return on investment (ROI), while simultaneously exposing the capital investment of investors to the highest levels of risk compared to any significant industry. In some cases, construction firms have received rates of return of as low as 1.5 to 2%. This is typically an unsustainable level of return for investors as they can gain a considerably higher ROI through much less risky financial vehicles such as gilts and bonds. Given such a low rate of return, the construction industry has for a number of years attempted to increase efficiency and reduce costs as a means of winning further business and increasing profitability. One of the methods that have been espoused as offering significant potential benefits for construction has been the industry-wide adoption of the principles of supply chain management (SCM). However, at present the bulk of SCM practice is focussed on high level strategic issues, whilst largely ignoring more operational issues related to logistics. This is a major omission, given the fact that a recent study by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in the UK indicates that as much as 30% of the cost of construction is attributed to transportation of materials. This article examines, through a review of literature, the role of SCM in construction and the contribution an effective logistics system can make to increasing efficiency and reducing construction costs. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> Sen's (1981b) entitlement approach conceptualises famine as the characteristics of some people not having enough food to eat but not of there being not enough food to eat. Famine from this perspective is one that occurs without a decline in the macro level supply of food and, hence, it is all about demand failure/shift in the demand structure. The grand contribution of this approach can be summed up in two: it throws light on the possible misleading suggestions encompassed in the popular belief that famine is caused by just shortage of food, and has also generated a huge debate since. In this paper it is argued that it is highly unlikely to assume that all famines have the same genesis. There are mainly two types of famine: famine without decline in the aggregate food supply and famine with food availability decline at macro level. The former is considered as discrete event caused by demand failure as a result of exogenous factors which are termed as precipitating factors while the latter can be taken as a process caused by supply failures resulting from structural, institutional, and policy related issues which are termed as underlying vulnerability factors. The study categorises the understanding of famine in two nexuses: demand failure-famine as a discrete event and supply failure-famine as a process; it also shows that Sen's entitlement approach can best fit to a famine caused by demand failure. Understanding all famines as an event has a serious danger not only for its explanation but also for designing policies to deny famine a future. The overall argument of this paper is that an event is just a historical reality and an analysis of an event with a weak grasp of history disregarding matters such as what constitutes the onset of famine certainly lacks a penetrating insight into the understanding famine. </jats:p>",

Shareholder value effects are estimated by measuring the stock market reaction (abnormal returns) associated with announcements to form or join industry exchanges. We find that abnormal returns from participation in industry exchanges are positive but only marginally significant in the whole sample of 144 firms in 18 exchanges formed during 2000–2001. In the sub‐sample of 88 exchange founders who were part of the original announcements to form the exchange, the abnormal market reaction is about 1% and significant. We also find that firms with greater bargaining power and higher process efficiency benefit more from participation in industry exchanges.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The literature suggests that supply chain management (SCM) consists of internal practices, which are contained within a firm, and external practices, which cross organizational boundaries integrating a firm with its customers and suppliers. Supplier quality management and customer focus are two QM practices that are also clearly in the domain of SCM. In this study we investigate how these two supply chain management‐related quality practices lead to improved performance and examine the practices that precede and mediate those relationships. In doing so, we replicate and extend the relationships among the QM practices and their effects on firm performance suggested in Kaynak [Kaynak, H., 2003. The relationship between total quality management practices and their effects on firm performance. Journal of Operations Management 21, 405–435] using survey data gathered from firms operating in the U.S. The inclusion of customer focus and supplier quality management in the QM model supports the importance of internal and external integration for quality performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Faced with liberalisation proposals and an increasing internationalisation of water resource management, the question arises as to how a change of the regulatory framework in Germany would affect the market structure and the supply conditions in this area. The water supply companies in Germany have invested ca. €2.5 billion annually to achieve a high technical standard, which has resulted in high cost increases and price hikes. It is thus presumed that there is a high rationalisation potential for the municipal water suppliers. The questions of economic efficiency and the participation of private providers in the water supply have increasingly gained importance. A liberalisation of the water supply can take place in different ways; the concrete basic features depend on what regulations the market for drinking water is or should be subject to and in what way and to what extent the private sector is involved into the organisation of water supply. In the EU-15, the only country where the provision of operational services in the water supply has been totally passed to the private sector is the United Kingdom, but this is only true for England and Wales. Another singular case is France, where there is a mix of mainly private operating companies and municipalities which have divided the regional supply areas among themselves. In six other EU-15 countries where some privatisation took place, either the municipalities or (majority) publicly owned companies are controlling water supply. In the remaining seven countries, the water supply is organised by municipality companies only. In this paper the two unique forms of privatisation in France and England/Wales as well as the German method of privatisation as an example for the interaction of municipalities and majority publicly owned water companies are discussed, especially with regard to the corresponding effects on competition and market structures. </jats:p>",

In Accipitridae the larger left gland was usually situated significantly more cranially than the right one. In common kestrel, the size of bilateral thyroids was similar while their mutual relationships were individually variable. The location of the parathyroid glands in common kestrel was relatively constant. Seven topographical patterns of the location of the parathyroid gland were noted in Accipitridae. In birds of both the suborders, the thyroid might be supplied by three (groups of) arteries: the cranial thyroid, the caudal thyroid and the middle thyroid arteries. The aforementioned vessels were derived from the common carotid and the oesophagotracheobronchial artery. In common kestrel, the thyroid vessels might also branch from the ascending oesophageal artery, which passes along the thyroid, while in common buzzard and other Accipitridae – from the common trunk of the comes nervi vagi and the ascending oesophageal artery. The parathyroid glands were supplied by one to three parathyroid arteries. The vessels for the cranial parathyroid gland mostly originated from the caudal thyroid artery, while for the caudal one – from the oesophagotracheobronchial artery. The average number of thyroid and parathyroid arteries in common buzzard was significantly higher than those in common kestrel.</jats:p>",

In this study, we consider a two‐stage supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, where a single seasonal product faces uncertain and price‐sensitive demand. We characterize the impact of a manufacturer rebate on the expected profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer. We show that unless all of the customers claim the rebate, the rebate always benefits the manufacturer. Our results thus imply that “mail‐in rebates,” where some customers end up not claiming the rebate, particularly when the size of the rebate is relatively small, always benefit the manufacturer. On the other hand, an “instant rebate,” such as the one offered in the automotive industry where every customer redeems the rebate on the spot when he/she purchases a car, does not necessarily benefit the manufacturer. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In contrast, a spot market in Japan, where a general electric utility would be the main supplier, plans to employ a uniform price auction. In this paper we model an electricity spot market in which one large generator competes with many fringe generators to supply electricity, analyze how this large generator bids to maximize its profits, and report some implications for the design of this market. Three types of auction are analyzed: a highest‐winning‐bid pricing (HWB) uniform price auction, a lowest‐losing‐bid pricing (LLB) uniform price auction, and a pay‐as‐bid auction. It is shown that the slope of the bid curve, which is obtained by plotting the large generator's bidding prices against its generation costs, are steeper in an LLB uniform price auction and flatter in a pay‐as‐bid auction than those in an HWB uniform price auction. This implies that an LLB uniform price auction or a pay‐as‐bid auction would make room for the fringe generators to win an auction. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Responses of leaf senescence to P supply could constitute adaptive mechanisms for plant growth under P-limiting conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil P supply on leaf senescence of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Eight P levels, ranging from 5 to 640 mg kg-1 P, were applied to pots containing four bean plants of cultivar Carioca in 10 kg of an Oxic Haplustult soil. Attached leaves were counted weekly, abscised leaves were collected every other day, and seeds were harvested at maturity. The number of live leaves increased until 48 days after emergence (DAE) and decreased afterwards, irrespective of applied P levels. At lower applied P levels, the initial increase and the final decrease of leaf number was weak, whereas at higher applied P levels the leaf number increased intensively at the beginning of the growth cycle and decreased strongly after 48 DAE. Dry matter and P accumulated in senesced leaves increased as soil P levels increased until 61 DAE, but differences between P treatments narrowed thereafter. The greatest amounts of dry mass and P deposited by senesced leaves were observed at 48-54 DAE for high P levels, at 62-68 DAE for intermediate P levels and at 69-76 DAE for low P levels. These results indicate that soil P supply did not affect the stage of maximal leaf number and the beginning of leaf senescence of common bean plants, but the stage of greatest deposition of senesced leaves occurred earlier in the growth cycle as the soil P supply was raised.</jats:p>",

Data analyzed includes Kansas' dental licensure records and the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. <jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> Bivariate results confirm that dental supply, access to care, and oral health are lower for populations living in rural areas. Multivariate models indicate that dentist supply has a positive and independent association with utilization, but that rurality is not associated with utilization and oral health after controlling for demographics and dentist supply. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Findings are consistent with a conceptual framework linking the geography of rural residence, individual preferences for services such as dental care, and the financial disincentives for dentists to locate in rural areas.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In transient landscapes, adjustments in river channel width, roughness, and alluvial cover, in addition to slope, provide potentially important but poorly understood mechanisms by which bedrock channels accommodate changes in external forcing. We used a laboratory flume to investigate experimentally how bedrock channel slope, width, roughness, alluvial cover, and incision rate collectively adjusted during the transient incision of an initially smooth channel with a varying bed load supply rate. When the channel was free of alluvial cover, incision was focused over a fraction of the bed width that varied strongly with both bed load supply and bed load transport capacity. Nondimensionalization yields a relationship for the width of active incision that explicitly incorporates bed load supply rate, sediment grain size, and bed shear stress, which suggests that in natural channels, width may respond dynamically to accommodate changes in bed load sediment supply. Because increases in sediment supply widened the band of active bed load sediment transport and thus the width over which incision took place, mass removal from the bed scaled with sediment supply when the bed was free of cover, consistent with incision being limited by the availability of erosive tools. However, bed roughness growth due to the spatial variation of incision during the experiment eventually inhibited bed load transport efficiency. This, in turn, led to deposition of alluvial cover and the suppression of incision on the bed at high sediment supply rates, consistent with incision being limited by the extent of alluvial cover deposited on the bed. The dynamics of roughness creation and alluvial cover deposition can therefore drive both negative and positive feedbacks on incision rate change following sediment supply perturbations. These experimental results offer several potentially field‐testable hypotheses that together may help explain variability in the width, slope, and bed roughness of bedrock river channels in transient landscapes.</jats:p>",

In experiment 2, a dose–response approach was used to determine the effects of supplementing an iron‐deficient basal diet with 30, 60, or 90 ppm of Fe either in form of crystalline Fe‐glycinate or Fe‐sulphate on digestibility of Fe, growth and blood parameters. In experiment 1, comparison of iron sources revealed a tendency (0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.1) for a higher Fe digestibility from Fe‐glycinate (40.9%) compared with Fe‐chelate (30.8%) or Fe‐sulphate (30.7%). Fe‐balance was higher (p &lt; 0.05) for Fe‐glycinate compared with Fe‐sulphate but iron balance was similar for iron sulphate and iron chelate. Those results, however, were not reflected in data of blood parameters. In experiment 2, iron digestibility, blood parameters and performance were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced by iron supply. Effects of iron source on digestibility of iron were lower than observed in the first experiment.</jats:p>",

This implies that the Web may be seen as an information market: authors supply information and searchers may find it. In this article we present a formal reference model for the syntactic aspects of the information market. We explore the information landscape using a modeling approach. An important part of this model is a (syntactic) framework for transformations, which allows us to deal with the heterogeneity of the data resources found on the Web. Last but not least, we attempt to give an outline how our model may lead to a better understanding of how information is supplied via the Web.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an adaptive optimisation system for dynamic operational control of water supply and distribution networks. Based on the combined use of an artificial neural network for predicting the consequences of different pumps and valve settings and a genetic algorithm for optimisation, the energy cost minimisation system (ENCOMS) is designed to assist water distribution system operators to select optimal operating control settings that will best meet not only the current demands but also the projected ones. ENCOMS identifies maximum cost savings by taking into account the electricity tariff and other system operational constraints that prescribe lower and upper limits on nodal pressures and service reservoirs storages, alternative supply sources and so on. The real-time control process operates continually and is updated at short intervals by data transmitted from the SCADA system and the updated demand forecast. The control system is generic in the sense that it can be applied to any distribution network. It is customised for each application to ensure optimal performance. It is extremely powerful and flexible so that the peculiarities of the specific network and/or tariff structure can be accommodated, as well as the preferences of the operator with regard to the time interval between updates, the operating horizon and so on. Multiple sources of treated water with different production costs can also be incorporated, as can various pressure zones and demand districts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The principal objections to the proposition that organic agriculture can contribute significantly to the global food supply are low yields and insufficient quantities of organically acceptable fertilizers. We evaluated the universality of both claims. For the first claim, we compared yields of organic versus conventional or low-intensive food production for a global dataset of 293 examples and estimated the average yield ratio (organic:non-organic) of different food categories for the developed and the developing world. For most food categories, the average yield ratio was slightly &lt;1.0 for studies in the developed world and &gt;1.0 for studies in the developing world. With the average yield ratios, we modeled the global food supply that could be grown organically on the current agricultural land base. Model estimates indicate that organic methods could produce enough food on a global<jats:italic>per capita</jats:italic>basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base. We also evaluated the amount of nitrogen potentially available from fixation by leguminous cover crops used as fertilizer. Data from temperate and tropical agroecosystems suggest that leguminous cover crops could fix enough nitrogen to replace the amount of synthetic fertilizer currently in use. These results indicate that organic agriculture has the potential to contribute quite substantially to the global food supply, while reducing the detrimental environmental impacts of conventional agriculture. Evaluation and review of this paper have raised important issues about crop rotations under organic versus conventional agriculture and the reliability of grey-literature sources. An ongoing dialogue on these subjects can be found in the Forum editorial of this issue.</jats:p>",

The impact is even greater if the works are carried out in an urban area resulting in serious traffic congestion as well as pollution, dust and noise. This paper proposes a model for the management of such works and is applied to a case study based on the new port at Laredo (Spain). The model optimises the distribution of loads between lorries and barges with the aim of minimising the total economic, social and environmental costs. The total cost of the system was calculated from the costs used in operating the lorries and barges as well as from a social cost represented by the costs to private transport users caused by the increased congestion due to the activity of lorries on the road network. All of this is limited by environmental restrictions aimed at keeping the emissions of both private and works vehicles within the established pollution and noise standards. Finally, a series of interesting conclusions are presented for the correct planning of the transport system that was analysed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The macroscopic features of the arterial supply to the reproductive system of the male ostrich was studied in 16 pre‐pubertal and eight sexually mature and active birds. The left and right cranial renal arteries arise from the aorta, between the cranial divisions of the kidneys. These vessels supply the cranial divisions of the kidneys, the testes, the epididymides and the cranial segments of the ducti deferentia. Accessory testicular arteries which arise directly from the aorta are present in 45.8% of the specimens. They supply the testes and cranial parts of the ducti deferentia. They are variable in number and origin, and four variants are identified. A cranial ureterodeferential branch originates from the cranial renal artery, supplies the cranial portion of the ductus deferens and ureter, and runs caudally to anastomose with the middle renal artery. The sciatic artery arises laterally from the aorta, just caudal to the acetabulum, and gives rise, ventrally, to a common trunk, the common renal artery, which divides into the middle and caudal renal arteries. The middle renal artery gives rise to the middle ureterodeferential branch which supplies the middle part of the ductus deferens and ureter. A few centimetres caudal to the kidney, the aorta terminates in three branches, namely, the left and right internal iliac arteries and the median caudal artery. The internal iliac artery divides into the lateral caudal artery and the pudendal artery; the latter gives off caudal ureterodeferential branches that supply the caudal segments of the ductus deferens and ureter. In addition, the pudendal artery gives off vessels that supply the cloaca, some of which continue to the base of the phallus, where they form an arterial network. In conclusion, the pattern of the blood supply to the reproductive organs of the male ostrich is, in general, similar to that of the domestic fowl and pigeon, although there are a few highlighted distinctive features.</jats:p>",

It is found that the supply of SiH4 source gas near the substrate holder significantly enhances the deposition rate and mass density of deposited film and reduces film defect density while maintaining high crystallinity. On the other hand, a negative dc substrate bias induces film crystallization from the initial growth stage. An appropriate negative dc bias also leads to higher film cystallinity and density. Kinetics of the controlling gas phase and surface reactions through the optimizing source gas supply method and dc substrate bias is demonstrated. We claim that the high flux film precursor SiH3 and H along with less contribution of short-lifetime radicals on the film growing surface and ion-assist structural relaxation benefit the high-rate synthesis of high quality μc-Si films.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Numerical modelling of water supply and distribution systems has become a standard and essential practice in any serious attempt to evaluate hydraulic, water quality and economic aspects of these complex systems. Well-suited models, including advanced technologies such as geographical information system and telemetry systems, accurate fire flow calculations, water quality analysis and leakage reduction have become indispensable tools for water network managers. Application of these advanced techniques in hydraulic and water quality modelling and optimum operation is considered to be a part of master planning for the south-west Moravian water supply system in the Czech Republic. The regional water supply system of south-west Moravia supplies water to two counties (Zdar and Trebic). Two regional control centres manage the whole water supply system. A hydraulic and water quality on-line computational module is installed on the central control system server. The mathematical model of the water supply system was calibrated and verified for both steady state and extended period simulations. Numerous hydraulic and water quality model scenarios were conducted for both existing and future operations of the system under normal and emergency conditions. Water quality analyses consisted of residual chlorine concentration simulation including detailed water age and source tracing simulations. The main objective in developing the on-line model was to decrease the operational cost of the system by optimising the operation of pumping stations by improving the rules used to control the inflow into the storage tanks, and by decreasing the time necessary to model required alternatives. The experience from developing the hydraulic and water quality models and optimum scheduling of pumps and valves for the master plan of south-west Moravia as well as the state of the art of the available solutions are discussed in this paper. </jats:p>",

The supermarket revolution thus occupies a focal point in this paper which tracks its phenomenal growth in Asia, and its continuing in roads into CLMV – Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Given the significant transformation that this major development is expected to bring into these countries' agricultural sector as well as food distribution systems, the paper examines the growing role of supply chain management. The value-adding potential at each level of the chain will allow agriculture to drive overall development by leveraging on the nations' advantage at the input, processing, wholesale and retail trade as well as international trade levels. The initial successes in Myanmar and Vietnam are highlighted.  In the wake of these developments, the paper emphasizes the glaring need to address the issue of how to balance the interests of the key players along the supply chain with that of the national interest, and how to gear up for globalization while also strengthening internal structures and institutions. The challenge is to ensure the orderly and balanced development of supply chains. Specifically, the respective governments would need to launch focused and holistic interventions that would not only manage the supply chains and international networks, but also minimize the marginalization of small farmers and other stakeholders.</jats:p>",

The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous Eulerian-Eulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oil-gas flow inside the oil supply system is characterized by the field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling oil supply rate are defined. The oil supply rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the oil supply system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors. </jats:p>",

All patients had received red cells, but before universal LD, only 1 of 31 (3%) cases had also received PLTs, compared to 8 of 14 (57%) afterward (p  &lt; 0.001). Thirty‐four cases (76%) had human platelet antigen (HPA)‐1a antibodies, whereas 11 had antibodies to other HPA specificities, only 1 of which occurred after LD. Two cases reported before LD also had heparin‐dependent PLT antibodies. There were 13 reports of TA‐GVHD, all fatal, of which only 2 cases of undiagnosed immunodeficiency met current UK criteria for irradiated components. Eight others had one or more risk factors: B‐cell malignancy (6), steroids (1), fresh blood (1), and donor‐recipient HLA haplotype share (4). Eleven cases were due to non‐LD and 2 to LD components (p  &lt; 0.001). No cases have been reported since 2001. In an additional 405 cases, nonirradiated components were transfused in error to high‐risk recipients, mainly on fludarabine, but none developed TA‐GVHD.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> These findings suggest that universal LD has further reduced the already low risk of TA‐GVHD in immunocompetent recipients and has altered the profile of PTP cases.</jats:p>",
