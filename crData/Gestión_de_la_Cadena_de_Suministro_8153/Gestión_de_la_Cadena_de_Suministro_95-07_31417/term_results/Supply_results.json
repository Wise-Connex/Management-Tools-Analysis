Using a panel VAR methodology applied to data for 13 OECD countries, we find support for a multi-shock view of inflation: supply-side shocks are statistically significant determinants of inflation, even after taking into account aggregate demand factors. While oil prices are the dominant supply-side influence, other measures such as the skewness of relative price changes are important as well. At short horizons, an innovation to skewness leads to an increase in inflation of 0.5 percentage points. As suggested by the classical view, money growth plays an increasingly important role as the time horizon lengthens.</jats:p>"

The ear‐leaf test has been evaluated for its ability to detect P deficiencies, but little attention has been given to its ability to quantify excess P supplies. The quantification of high P supplies is important for both economic and environmental reasons and because fertilization has increased P supplies of many soils to levels where additional yield responses are not likely. Grain yields and tissue samples were collected from 41 site‐years corresponding to 2 long‐term and 24 short‐term P‐response trials from 1980 to 1990. The sites included a wide variety of soil types, soil‐test P values, and management practices. Phosphorus fertilization increased corn yields at 13 site‐years and leaf P concentrations at 24 site‐years. Fertilization increased leaf P concentrations at 85% of the soils where fertilization increased yields but at only 46% of the soils where fertilization did not increase yields. The determined critical concentration range for the leaf test, based on various models fit to relationships between yields and leaf P concentrations, was 2.3 to 2.5 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. This range is below or within the lower range of previously published critical concentrations for this test. Leaf P concentrations increased curvilinearly with increasing soil‐test values, and there were small or no increases at high soil‐test values. This trend, together with the failure of fertilization treatments to increase leaf P concentrations at many high‐testing soils, indicates limited luxury uptake of P in the leaves. The results of this study show that the ear‐leaf test does not evaluate excess soil P supplies appropriately and is not a reliable diagnostic tool for regions having abundant high‐testing soils. The inappropriate evaluation of excess P and the high variability in leaf P concentrations due to growth factors other than P availability limit the value of this test to the diagnosis of severe P deficiency.</jats:p>",

Although many studies have documented yield responses to increased N levels in the soil, a mechanistic description of the physiological responses that influence crop growth under various levels of N has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this work was to develop a relatively simple, mechanistic model of maize growth and development to account for the influence of soil and crop N budgets. The soil N budget was simulated for two soil layers that incorporated fertilization, mineralization, denitrification, and leaching. Crop uptake rate of N was simulated by a supply function that depends on cumulative and daily thermal units, soil water content, and soil N availability. Comparison of simulated and experimental crop N uptake through the season showed especially good agreement for 0 to 12 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> fertilizer treatments. At 24 and 42 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, the simulated crop N uptake was greater than observed. Nevertheless, comparable seasonal patterns between simulations and observations at all fertility levels were obtained for accumulated total biomass and grain. Final grain yields for all fertility treatments were simulated to be within 8% of the observed. A sensitivity test was performed with the model to investigate the importance of various physiological parameters on biomass accumulation and yield. Yield estimates under low soil N levels tended to be most sensitive to minimum grain N concentration.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to examine the results of a series of N fertility experiments with the aid of a mechanistically based crop model. The experiments resulted in grain yields ranging from 99 to 1102 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, and these yields were well simulated by the model (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.97). Under high fertility conditions, temperature and solar radiation interception explained the variation in yield among environments. Under low fertility conditions, mineralization of soil organic N was especially important in explaining yield variations among environments. Management practices preceding the experimental crops were hypothesized to have large effects on the N availability in the soil, and consequently influence observed and simulated yields. Sensitivity tests confirmed the importance of defining the initial soil organic N levels in simulating crop growth and yield when there is little or no applied N fertilizer.</jats:p>",

Increasing photosynthesis at R5 increased seed dry matter accumulation and the response was larger when N was available. Seed N accumulation also increased if N was available. Increasing photosynthesis had no effect on seed N accumulation when N was not available to the plant. Temporal changes in chlorophyll and N of an upper leaf were measured to characterize leaf senescence. Increasing photosynthesis did not accelerate leaf senescence in any of the treatments. If N was available, N uptake increased when photosynthesis increased. If N was not available, seed N concentration decreased. The data suggest that leaf senescence does not occur because of seed N demand, but may be regulated by processes in the leaf.</jats:p>",

THR is one of the most costly single procedures contributing to health care expenses. Also, the use of THR exhibits a particularly high degree of geographic variation. Recent research pointed to shifts in demand as one plausible economic explanation for increasing use of THR. This paper questions whether shifts in supply may have been large enough to explain changes in patient mix and the relationship of patient mix to the number of procedures performed at a particular hospital. In addition, the relationship between total use of THR and the local availability of orthopaedic surgeons as well as the average allowable Medicare fee for standardized physician services is analyzed. These relationships might yield evidence to support a scenario of induced demand beyond the optimum for patients' welfare, or evidence of supply increase within a disequilibrium scenario.</jats:p><jats:p>This study, using data for all THR patients in a large sample of hospitals, tends to reject the formulation of a market with independent supply and demand shifts where the supply shifts were the dominant forces. Hospitals with a larger number of THRs performed did not see a higher percentage of older, sicker, and lower income patients. It was more likely that demand shifts generated increases in capacity for surgical services. Moreover, there was little evidence for a persistent disequilibrium and only weak evidence for inducement Also, we found little evidence that hospitals responded to financial incentives inherent in the Medicare payment system after 1983 to select among THR candidates in favour of those with below average expected cost We did observe increased concentration over time of THR procedures in facilities with high volume—suggesting plausible demand shifts towards hospitals with <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> quality and cost advantages or who obtained those advantages with a high volume of patients.</jats:p>",

By day 7, many rod- and spiral-shaped bacteria had colonized the ridged surface of the luminal wall of the tubing, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. By day 30, individual microcolonies were embedded in extracellular polymeric material. By day 120, these microcolonies had begun to coalesce, and by day 180 the biofilm had developed into a multilayered, heterogenous mixture of microcolonies.
