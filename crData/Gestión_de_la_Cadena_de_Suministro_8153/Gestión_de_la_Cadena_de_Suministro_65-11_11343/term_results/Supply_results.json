On the basis of demand for transport of passengers and freight, airlines must determine routes, allocate frequencies to these routes, and prepare time-tables.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper concludes the discussion of Operational Research applied to airlines by summarising the models used in the series in the light of the aims specified in the first paper (August .1965 JOURNAL).</jats:p>",
