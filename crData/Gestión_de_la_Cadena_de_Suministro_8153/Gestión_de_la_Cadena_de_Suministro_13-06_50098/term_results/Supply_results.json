Due to such reasons as lack of high-tech and lack of price competitiveness in contrast to traditional products, the manufacturers will not have incentive to produce and supply green products, so the Government should grant financial subsidies to producers which will compensate the profits entitled to them. Through the analysis based on game theory, the article concludes that there is disadvantage in constant subsidy and the variable subsidies will have more positive effects on the supply of environment-friendly products since the subsidy amount varies with the production scale.</jats:p>"

Surprisingly, one kind of risk is often overlooked: reputational risk. It is critical to recognise the risk potential that impacts on the reputation of the organisation. Furthermore, managers require an appropriate tool set to control it. The present paper aims to have a twin focus: first, it will lay out the basic premises behind corporate reputation, reputational risk, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Second, the practical implications will be addressed that lead to a substantial teaching component.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The present paper is based on two research stages. Initially, the authors adopted the “reflective practitioner” philosophy that aimed at discovering the common beliefs in practice that explain working processes and management thought. In particular, they explored the foundation of CSR, reputation and risk management with specialists in dedicated workshops (electronics, energy, life sciences, telecommunications and defence industries, located at different stages of the supply chain). To gain more insight, the authors subsequently conducted in‐depth interviews in these topic areas with key informants. The combination allowed them methodological triangulation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Reputation can be created and controlled as soon as its nature is fully understood (Reputational Owner). Interestingly, it is a transceiving business phenomenon that crosses organizational boundaries. Spillover effects can thus be observed at all stages of the supply chain by mere business association (Reputational Borrower). Reputation can range from positive to negative extremes and needs to be managed. The results of the authors' exploratory work are presented as quotations to provide the substance of the current and relevant subject.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The present work is exploratory in nature.

Consumers adopt supply chain reputation as a yardstick when making purchase decisions. It is therefore critical to manage reputational risk in the supply chain and this paper outlines the cause and effect relationships that this topic entails in modern society.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper discusses the importance of reputational risk in the supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is growing social pressure for organizations to reduce their rates of consumption ofnonrenewable natural resources and in parallel, to also reduce the release of post-production and postconsumptionwaste to landfills, water bodies and air, thereby causing damage to the environment. Torespond to the pressure it is necessary that organizations' operations prioritize the \"3R\" goals: Reduce,Reuse and Recycle.In this context, the so called reverse logistics flows have grown in importance in the study of supplychains. Examples are the components and materials that are collected after they are consumed or used.Instead of being sent to the landfill companies use reverse logistics to transport them back in supplychains to be reused or, recycled and reincorporated as secondary input material for new production.This article aims, through the review of related legislation in Brazil, relevant literature and a numberof Brazilian and international case studies to develop a basic framework to be used in the developmentand implementation of reverse logistics systems (RLS).DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n1p1-25URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n1p1-25</jats:p>"

The governance efficiency of relational risks in supply chain can be improved by control mechanisms associated with trust development mechanisms, and both of which are dynamic complementary. Initial trust among partners impacts the inter-organizational relational performance and the choice of control mechanisms, at the same time, the outcomes of relationship and the development or destruction of trust mechanisms are affected by control modes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A növénytermesztési tér, ezen belül a csernozjom talaj vízháztartási folyamatainak sokoldalú vizsgálata, elemzése, a folyamatok parametrizálása különösen fontos. A vizsgálatokat — az 1983-ban Ruzsányi László által beállított, 2004-től Pepó Péter által vezetett — polifaktoriális tartamkísérletben kukoricával végeztük, melyet nemcsak jelentős vetésterülete, hanem a vízellátás, a növénytermesztési tér vízháztartása szempontjából kifejezett szenzibilitása, érzékenysége is indokol. A kísérletet különböző vetésváltási rendszerekben (mono-, bi- és trikultúra), három eltérő csapadékellátottságú [egy aszályos (2007), egy csapadékos (2008) és egy száraz (2009)] évjáratban végeztük. A kísérletben N<jats:sub>120</jats:sub>+PK tápanyagszinttel, két öntözési kezeléssel (Ö<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-kezelés: nem öntözött, Ö<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-kezelés: öntözött), valamint 60 000 tő·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> állománysűrűséggel dolgoztunk.A mértékadó talajréteget három szintre osztottuk, (0–60; 61–120 és 121–200 cm), melyekben vizsgáltuk a talajnedvesség tenyészidőbeli alakulását. Az eredmények alapján a felső (0–60 cm) talajszint nedvességkészlet-változása volt a legintenzívebb, mind a csapadék, mind az öntözés közvetlen hatása itt mutatható ki a legegyértelműbben.Vizsgálataink alapján megállapítottuk, hogy a csernozjom talaj vízkészletét a vetésváltás nagymértékben befolyásolja. A három vetésváltás közül a monokultúrás vetésváltásban számítottuk a legkisebb talajnedvesség térfogatszázalékos értékeket, bi- és trikultúrában már az induló vízkészlet is 3–4 tf%-kal nagyobb értékeket mutatott, és ez a tendencia a teljes tenyészidőszakban megmaradt, mind a nem öntözött, mind az öntözött kezelésekben. A vizsgálati eredmények alapján megállapítható, hogy a csernozjom talaj vízháztartása, a kukoricaállomány vízellátása szempontjából a monokultúrás termesztés függ a legnagyobb mértékben a vízellátottsági viszonyoktól.A kísérleti adatokból megállapítható, hogy az öntözés főként a 0–60 cm-es gyökérzónában fejtette ki hatását, megközelítőleg vízkapacitásig feltöltötte a talaj felső rétegét, ezáltal kedvező víz- és tápanyagellátási körülményeket teremtve a növényállomány számára.</jats:p>",

In most companies, the analysis of its supply chains can identify them as \"green supply chains\", which primarily involves not harming the natural environment. However, the further development of this concept is \"sustainable supply chain\", the chain that means not only protection of the environment but also means caring for the closest social environment together with economic development of the company. As opposed to green supply chains, it is still difficult to identify a sustainable supply chain in Polish enterprises. For the research purpose, the interview sheet has been created, based on the answers provided by the companies it is possible to further identify and determine the elements that make up a sustainable supply chain. This article presents an interview sheet with the answers given by one of the companies investigated</jats:p>",

The profit allocation of agricultural supply chain based on Shapley value method of considering the risk factor is studied. The composition of agricultural supply chain is firstly described and the four common risks in the agricultural supply chain are discussed. Then, a new method considering the four risks to allocate the profit in agricultural supply chain is presented. Finally, the presented method of profit allocation is used to solve a profit allocation problem in practice. The results showed the Shapley value of profit allocation after considering the risks is smaller than classic Shapley value and the difference value is caused by the risks. The risks should be eliminated by concerted effort to enhance the stability of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Often this is attributed to competition arising from an imbalance of demand and supply, typically excess demand for workers.

We present a model and experiment in which workers’ quality becomes known only in the late part of the market. However, in equilibrium, matching can occur (inefficiently) early only when there is comparable demand and supply: a surplus of applicants, but a shortage of high quality applicants.</jats:p>"

Based on numerical investigation, the two analytical scenarios are compared and the implication for the design analysis is elucidated.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The traditional adversarial relationship in the construction industry has been criticized by a larger number of researchers and practitioners. Following the success of the supply chain collaboration in other industry sectors, such as manufacturing, supply chain relationships in UK construction have been increasingly changing from the traditional adversarial to the collaborative, which is supported by a series of government reports for the industry reform. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the current status of supply chain relationships in a systematic way. Therefore, there is no clear understanding of how change has taken place in today's practice and whether or not the change is balanced. To bridge the gap, a questionnaire survey is carried out in the UK construction industry. Based on the analysis of more than 100 responses, it is found that the UK construction industry as a whole has experienced an important change and moved toward supply chain collaboration. On the other hand, an unbalance is found for the change movement. In addition to the questionnaire survey, a series of industrial experts are interviewed, which help to explore the specific characteristics of supply chain collaboration in construction and provide practical implications for collaboration strategy implementation.</jats:p>",

The information provided by accurate quality cost calculation is also a significant tool that can assist our assessment of the effectiveness of quality management system, as well as identification of quality issues within the organization and creation of opportunities for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to show the development of a quality cost model that includes all possible quality cost components such as Prevention, Appraisal and Failure (P.A. F) costs. Based on reviewing and analyzing various quality cost models, a generic quality cost model is developed. The proposed model can be used as a tool to calculate various quality costs. In addition, it can be used to determine the most serious failure cost. A case study has used to validate the proposed model. In this case, the implementation showed that the model is able to identify and quantify the hidden cost related to the quality in electronic assembly plant. Also, it is used to identify the potential improvement opportunities within the plant.</jats:p>"

Banks responded by increasing excess reserves rather than increasing bank loans, and the public responded with a substantial flight to liquidity in the form of currency and demand deposits. As a result, the money-supply multipliers substantially decreased, so that the actual money supply measures grew more moderately than the base. The sustained multiplier-collapse spawned reexamination of monetary versus fiscal theories of price-level determination. This paper, however, presents decompositions of the money-multiplier collapse into changes in the currency-to-deposit ratios, and changes in the reserve-to-deposit ratio. By doing so, possible near-term increases in the multipliers are simulated so that the possibility of either full or partial restoration to their pre-crisis levels is assessed. Policy possibilities for controlling the money supply over various horizons follow. This analysis illustrates the Federal Reserve’s exit dilemma that results from its financial-crisis policy.</jats:p>"

Die vollumfängliche Wirksamkeit der Lean-Philosophie kann jedoch nur durch eine ganzheitliche Berücksichtigung aller Partner eines Logistiknetzwerkes gelingen. Hierzu muss der derzeitige Betrachtungsumfang des Lean Managements, bekannt unter dem Begriff „Lean Logistics“, um eine weitere Stufe ergänzt werden. Das sogenannte, bisher in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur nicht vollständig beschriebene „Lean Supply Chain Management“ soll dazu beitragen, noch schlagkräftiger, leistungsfähiger und flexibler definierte Kundenanforderungen zu erfüllen und gleichzeitig vorhandene Verschwendung im Logistiknetzwerk zu vermeiden.</jats:p>",

Construction of toilets only ensures greater use of water, which eventually pollutes the surface as well as ground water sources. Health services are concentrated in the core of the city. The social determinants of health in urban areas are clearly rooted in the investment policies that are driving processes of ‘urban renewal’ and ‘economic growth’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impinging jets are often employed within the leading edge of turbine blades and vanes to combat the tremendous heat loads incurred as the hot exhaust gases stagnate along the exterior of the airfoil. Relative to traditional cylindrical jets, racetrack shaped impinging jets have been shown to produce favorable cooling characteristics within the turbine airfoil. This investigation experimentally and numerically quantifies the cooling characteristics associated with a row of racetrack shaped jets impinging on a concave, cylindrical surface. Detailed Nusselt number distributions are obtained using both a transient liquid crystal technique and commercially available CFD software (Star CCM+ from CD-Adapco). Three geometrical jet inlet and exit conditions are experimentally investigated: a square edge, a partially filleted edge (r/dH,Jet = 0.25), and a fully filleted edge (r/dH,Jet = 0.667). Additionally, to investigate the effect of high crossflow velocities at the inlet of the jet, a portion of the flow supplied to the test apparatus radially bypasses the impingement section. Thus, the mass flow rate into the test section is varied to achieve the desired inlet crossflow conditions and jet Reynolds numbers. As a result, jet Reynolds numbers (ReJet) of 11500 and 23000 are investigated at supply duct Reynolds numbers (ReDuct) of 20000 and 30000. The results are compared to baseline cases where no mass bypasses the test section. Additionally, the relative jet – to – jet spacing (s/dH,Jet) is maintained at 8, the relative jet – to – target surface spacing (z/dH,Jet) is 4, the target surface curvature – to – jet hydraulic diameter (D/dH,Jet) is 5.33, and the relative thickness of the jet plate (t/dH,Jet) is 1.33. Measurements indicate that the addition of fillets at the edges of the jet orifice and the introduction of significant crossflow velocity at the inlet of the jet can significantly degrade the cooling characteristics on the leading edge of the turbine blade. The magnitude of such degradation generally increases with increasing fillet size and inlet crossflow velocity. The V2F model is adequate for predicting the flow field and target surface heat transfer in the absence of inlet crossflow; however, it is believed the turbulence within the jet is overpredicted by the CFD leading to elevated heat transfer coefficients (compared to the experimental results).</jats:p>",

We contribute to the literature by analysing the role of intermarriage in intergenerational transmission of culture and its effect on labour market outcomes. Using female labour force participation and total fertility rates in the country of ancestry as cultural proxies, we find that culture affects the female labour supply. Cultural proxies are significant in explaining number of hours worked by second‐generation women with immigrant parents. The impact of culture is significantly larger for women with immigrant parents who share the same ethnic background than for those with intermarried parents. The weaker effect of culture for women raised in intermarried families stresses the importance of intermarriage in assimilation process.

Despite extensiveliterature regarding international operations management (OM), few studies verify how importantvariables in OM vary across different institutional contexts. This scarcity of comparative crosscountryresearch reveals an important gap both for research and practice. In this paper we addressthis gap by providing a data analysis of a recent survey collected in Canada and Brazil. We replicateand extend previous research by comparing important variables of manufacturing strategy in thesetwo institutional contexts such as knowledge exchange, green process management, environmentalsupplier management and the traditional manufacturing performance dimensions.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n1p106-121URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n1p106-121</jats:p>"

Structural oil price shocks add to our understanding of the 2008 stock market crash. I find that unexpected reductions in world oil supply do not affect stock returns in any of six OECD countries. Although an increase in global aggregate demand consistently raises oil prices and cumulative real stock returns, the effect is more persistent for oil exporters. Other, e.g., precautionary oil demand shocks have a detrimental impact on stock markets in oil-importing countries, a statistically insignificant effect for Canada, and a significantly positive effect for Norway. Oil price shocks account for a larger share of the variation in aggregate international stock returns than in national stock returns.</jats:p>",

A Buck Chopper and full bridge inverter were applied to the main circuit. The PWM controller TL494 was used in the Buck voltage-regulation control circuit to realize closed loop control. The drive signal of the IGBT in full bridge inverter was based on precise digital pulse width modulator (DPWM) signal produced by the MCU M30290. The DPWM can be set by potentiometer so the power supply can output the square wave with adjustable frequency and duty cycle. The power supply was operated in constant current mode. For micro or strong arcing of the target, different safeguards were adopted by the control circuit. At last, the system test and experimental results show that the stability, reliability and tuning range of the MFMS power supply can meet the requirements of the magnetron sputtering coating.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We study a buyer's sourcing strategy along two dimensions: the supply base design and the pricing mechanism, considering supplier competition and cost-reduction effort. The supply base design concerns the number of suppliers (one or two) included in the supply base and the capacity to be invested in each supplier. The pricing mechanism determines the timing of the price decisions, with the buyer making price commitments before suppliers exert cost-reduction efforts that may be renegotiated afterward. We find that symmetric capacity investment in suppliers and low price commitments (more likely to be renegotiated) are effective at fostering supplier competition, whereas asymmetric investment and high price commitments (less likely to be renegotiated) are better at motivating supplier effort. A complementary relationship exists between the supply base design and pricing mechanism: A more symmetric supply base should be combined with lower price commitments, leading to more renegotiation opportunities. This results in three possible sourcing structures: sole sourcing (investing capacity in a single supplier and forming price with ex ante commitments), symmetric dual sourcing (investing equal capacity in both suppliers and forming price with ex post negotiations), and asymmetric dual sourcing (investing positive but unequal capacities in two (ex ante identical) suppliers and forming price using both ex ante commitments and ex post (re)negotiations). We characterize the conditions for each structure and identify a strategic role of capacity investment.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.</jats:p>",

Many contradictions between parts and different levels of a SC have been identified in order to achieve overall objectives. Such shortfalls may result in decreased strength and competitiveness of the SC. This paper considers the main conflicts related to inventory, pricing and marketing costs in an unlimited three-echelon supply chain. Aimed at avoiding a profit decrease, the research focuses on finding an equilibrium between inventory, pricing and marketing cost of an unlimited three-echelon SC. On each level, the best leadership option with the greatest payoff is sought for between K retailer, M manufacturer and S supplier. According to Stackelberg non-cooperative game theory, each SC level can become a decision-making leader depending on the available negotiating power. Consequently, three leadership types are modelled on each level and the total SC profit is calculated and compared to ascertain the best option. The authors of the article found that transfer of leadership from a retailer to supplier results in reduction of the total profit. In addition, the research focused on the main effects of parameters used in leadership models. Finally, validation of the proposed model was examined by simulation and Arena software, which indicated that models based on a game theory were performed accurately.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent year, bearing designers have focused on reduced-temperature designs; whereby better results have been achieved by applying the cool inlet oil more effectively and reducing the hot oil carryover. The key factor in this improvement is the hot-cool oil mixing process in the oil supply pockets. However, relatively little is know about the details of the underlying flow and mixing phenomena, and the classical one dimensional lubrication theory fails to provide an explanation. A detail experimental investigation of the flow and mixing phenomena in a typical oil supply pocket of a heavy duty gas turbine was performed by employing a large-scale model of the geometry. This model has a similarity in respect to Reynolds number, and, by using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), it permitted optical flow visualization and measurements. In addition to a thin shear layer close to the moving boundary, flow patterns including recirculation zones were detected in the larger part of the flow domain. Fully three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed, too. With regard to the observed flow and mixing phenomena, large eddy simulation (LES) methods offer great potential because this approach can directly resolve the large eddies, and it is the interaction between the shear layer and these large eddies that mainly govern the mixing phenomena. The comparison between experimental data and LES results showed a reasonable agreement. Furthermore, the potential of more conventional turbulence models such as the classical k-ε-model were also assessed.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have shown water stored in the home to be more contaminated than water at the source; however, the mechanisms of post-supply contamination remain unclear. Using water quality measurements and structured observations of households in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, this study elucidates the causal mechanisms of the microbial contamination of drinking water after collection from a communal water source. The study identifies statistically significant loadings of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) occurring immediately after filling the storage container at the source and after extraction of the water from the container in the home. Statistically significant loadings of FIB also occur with various water extraction methods, including decanting from the container and use of a cup or ladle. Additionally, pathogenic genes of Escherichia coli were detected in stored drinking water but not in the source from which it was collected, highlighting the potential health risks of post-supply contamination. The results of the study confirm that storage containers and extraction utensils introduce microbial contamination into stored drinking water, and suggest that further research is needed to identify methods of water extraction that prevent microbial contamination of drinking water.</jats:p>",

Today, it is a prevailing theme in scholarly and popular research, and numerous disciplines claim its ownership. However, current and emerging SCM research challenges are becoming increasingly more complex. Fragmented and \"siloed\" research efforts across a range of disciplines may not be adequate to address the full complexities associated with these phenomena. We interviewed 50 SCM academic thought leaders, across a range of disciplines, and 20 SCM executives with the goal of helping researchers develop a consistent stream of work that builds on existing research, identifies relevant research directions, and provides guidance for the future. Although there were some differences in opinions, there was consensus on the boundary characteristics of SCM, as well as the identification of interdisciplinary research (IDR) as necessary for the enablement of SCM to address the numerous current and emerging intractable SCM challenges. In this article, we present these findings and provide a path forward based on the collective wisdom of these academics and executives.</jats:p>",

Using the merged 2003 Philippine labor and income survey data sets, the findings reveal that a spouse's overseas migration leads to an overall reduction in hours worked of the remaining spouse. For the stayer wives of migrant husbands, the reduced labor supply is driven significantly by the presence of school-aged children which is associated with a shift from full-time paid employment to a withdrawal from the labor force. For the husband sample, higher education is associated significantly with lower labor supply in the presence of young children but with more market time in migrant households with no young children. The findings provide some evidence that the stayer spouses in migrant households reallocate time from market work towards more time in home production rather than to increased consumption of leisure. </jats:p>",

This paper argues that the increasing availability of prescription opioids may threaten heroin sellers' profit margin and force them to find alternative methods to compensate buyers in the event of a supply shock. We investigate the 2006 fentanyl overdose episode in New Jersey and argue that the introduction of non‐pharmaceutical fentanyl, its spatial distribution, and the timing of overdose deaths may have been related to trends in heroin purity. Using medical examiner data, as well as data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control on retail sales of prescription opioids in a negative binomial specification, we show that month‐to‐month fluctuations in heroin purity have a significant effect on fentanyl‐related overdoses, particularly in those areas where prescription opioids are highly available.

This exploratory study utilized survey research methods to obtain perceptions of intrinsicand extrinsic career choice factors and career satisfaction held by individuals working and educatedin SCM. Means tests and hierarchical regression were used to identify career choice factors and toexamine the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic criteria on career satisfaction. Leadership opportunitiesemerged as most important to predicting career satisfaction. Other important predictors were also ofan intrinsic nature, which is consistent with classic needs theory. This paper expands the applicationof needs theory and career theory in SCM. Individuals who place more value on careers that provideleadership opportunities, responsibility, and earnings potential are more likely to be satisfied with theircareers. Managers seeking to design career paths that satisfy talent should develop a plan that alignswith what individual's value.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n1p122-138URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n1p122-138</jats:p>"

Controversy continues over which system can most effectively improve livelihoods. Responding to this discussion, an extended model of sustainable livelihoods analysis is proposed that takes on a holistic approach: it includes issues of economic viability as well as the consequences for the vulnerability of poor people and the sustainability of water-related ecosystems. This model can be used to analyse the impact of water provision on livelihoods and to leverage policies to create a more sustainable water provision. It is applied to the city of Semarang in Indonesia that, as many coastal cities in low income countries, suffers from vicious cycles of poverty and problematic water supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the focus in the literature on participatory development has been on the demand side and on the extent to which citizens succeed in pressuring the state to deliver basic services. Less attention has been focused on the supply side of participatory development, namely on how state institutions give effect to development policies. Post-Apartheid South Africa is replete with policies and legislation supporting participatory processes and yet in practice this has seldom lived up to the ideals espoused. This article examines the delivery of public housing in poor communities in three municipalities in South Africa and argues that there is a mismatch between how the formulators of policy understand participation and how it is interpreted by beneficiary communities and local officials. It concludes that considerably more attention needs to be focused on why officials fail to translate national policies into action if participatory democracy is to attain any legitimacy in the population at large. </jats:p><jats:p> Points for practitioners </jats:p><jats:p> Effective citizen engagement in decision-making processes is the key factor in participatory development programmes. Enabling legislation and policy is essential to the process but it is not sufficient to ensure participation. The design of participatory programmes will thus need to take into account the capacity of communities to organize themselves and will need to factor in the means and time to develop their ability to engage effectively. Officials managing participatory development projects need to undergo formal training so that they understand that the manner in which beneficiaries participate is as important the actual activities in which they are involved. </jats:p>",

On one hand, it shows the operations vision in relationship to the client contact, the processstandardization and the production capacity. On the other hand, it shows the economic vision and ittakes into consideration three perspectives: i) the main process involved, if concentrated on people,physical goods, or information; ii) the relationship with the client and the grade of standardization andprofessional capacity; iii) the degree of capital intensity and scale. As a result, it proposes an integrationmatrix based on three variables: capital intensity, scale and client's contact.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n1p55-73URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n1p55-73</jats:p>"

Final products are stored at international depots, from where they are ready to be shipped to the markets. Even if one company controls the entire chain, when production and sales organizations are decoupled, a relevant problem is to determine the internal prices of products at depots for achieving coordination. We propose an optimization model involving pricing and production decisions, and several constraints commonly used in divergent chains. In our approach, the producer incorporates the sellers’ behavior by expressing demand as a function of the internal price. As a result, our model serves as a coordination mechanism in trying to get an overall coordinated integrated solution in a decoupled reality. Numerical examples in single and multiple periods problems show the advantages of our approach over cost‐based methods.</jats:p>",

In particular, the study focuses on developing a better understanding of: “how do companies involve other members of their supply chain into their sustainability efforts?” Building upon themes that emerged from the data, a typology for the supply chain implementation of sustainability initiatives is proposed. A lack of supply chain integration was identified and companies reported a tendency toward a “mandated” implementation when extending efforts across companies. These efforts are generally initiated by the dominant companies and then forced onto the weaker upstream members. The data suggests that the merits of these initiatives are viewed as being disproportionately awarded to the dominant firm and thus did not receive full buy‐in from the other party. A common vision by both sides of this relationship is to develop a more collaborative implementation that can be supported by all the involved parties. In theoretical implications, empirical findings are viewed through the lens of several prominent management theories in order to augment and elaborate current theory. Managerial implications, limitations, and opportunities for further research are detailed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although agility has been identified as one of the most important issues of contemporary supply chain management, the theoretical basis for understanding supply chain agility is fragmented. This research addresses the gap related to the ambiguity surrounding the dimensions and definitions of firm supply chain agility by employing a multidisciplinary literature review to gain an in‐depth understanding of agility. In addition, a comprehensive measurement instrument that draws on the foundations of social and life science theory is developed and empirically validated. The results of the research indicate that firm supply chain agility is composed of five distinct dimensions including alertness, accessibility, decisiveness, swiftness, and flexibility. Based on these elements, a comprehensive definition of firm supply chain agility is developed for further theoretical testing of the concept.</jats:p>",

The datacollection was carried out through interviews (in loco) in both automakers and suppliers. Modularconsortium and industrial condominium not only involve collaborative agreements in manufacturingwith suppliers but also embrace managerial aspects such as: trust, long-term contracts, reciprocity,reputation, channels of interdependence and formal and informal mechanisms of control. Thesecontemporary forms of governance have generated new ways of organizing production and coordinationin operations, based on cooperation, integration and inter-firm process control. For such, governancebased on company inter-relationship usually operates seeking cooperative agreements so that it wouldpermit quick access to information and technological innovations. These governance approachescontain structures to support exchange, resource interdependence, mutual lines of communication,economies of scale for research and joint production.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n1p74-90URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n1p74-90</jats:p>"

To investigate these issues, this paper disaggregates processed exports into their two main categories, processing with imported materials (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PWIM</jats:styled-content>) exports and processing and assembly (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PAA</jats:styled-content>) exports.

Opposed to common innovations focusing on the improvement of product or information flow, supply chain finance (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCF</jats:styled-content>) targets the financial flow and allows buying firms and their suppliers to improve working capital and reduce costs. However, the adoption process of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCF</jats:styled-content> is complex and rather unexplored in academia. This article provides an early step in building knowledge about <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCF</jats:styled-content> and in particular how firms adopt <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCF</jats:styled-content>, why they adopt differently, and what role suppliers play in the adoption process.

For this explorative research, we opted for an inductive multiple case study approach with six European firms.

While traction network short-circuit fault happens, the system model is a weakly nonlinear first-order differential equation, which feeder current is increasing exponentially and eventually stabilized. While the load current becomes low-frequency oscillation current, the system model is a nonlinear second-order differential equation. After linear processing in unique equilibrium point neighborhood, the state space equation of linear system is built, and the structural reason of low-frequency oscillation is revealed by eigenvalue analysis method. The simulation result shows that the simulation current waveforms are consistent with the recorded current waveforms and the division of transient process is reasonable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Low-income settlements in Karachi have faced acute water shortages during the past two decades. Different approaches were devised to address this situation by concerned stakeholders comprising area residents, water utility, local government officials, community groups, and formal and informal water vendors. Development of awami community-managed tanks was one such option. Evolved through cooperative action, philanthropic contributions and partial government subsidy, the awami tanks served as an interim water supply arrangement for several years. Earlier documentation and analysis of this format of supply adequately established this factor. A recent survey of the status of some low-income localities has shown that while awami tanks are largely abandoned, the existing service is far below the desired level. This paper examines the relevance of awami tanks in the present context of water supply arrangements. Various localities in Orangi in Karachi have been studied for water supply problems. On-site observations, focused group meetings with area residents and interviews with key respondents were the main components of fact-finding work. </jats:p>",

This paper seeks to explore one specific aspect of this divergence, that of social supply and how the Criminal Justice System currently deals with this in practice and principle. It is argued that social supply is qualitatively distinct from drug dealing ‘proper’ and although this distinction is increasingly acknowledged within the Criminal Justice System, current approaches neither conform to principles of proportionality nor sufficiently understand the nature of social supply to deal with it effectively under existing legislation. Following consideration of these issues, it is argued that social supply should become a distinct offence in law, analogous to how manslaughter is distinguished from the more serious offence of murder. </jats:p>",

While simple in concept, the application of moderation analysis can yield profound implications to research conducted in logistics and supply chain management. Moderation analysis illuminates boundary conditions to purported relationships, providing a deeper perspective on what may, to date, represent generalizable findings and commonly held beliefs in the field. Such findings prove interesting and enrich our theories. Further, moderation relies on precise measurement of theoretical constructs in order to avoid attenuation of statistical tests and detect interaction effects. This thought leadership piece seeks to: (1) assert the value of moderation analysis and encourage a more prominent place in our survey‐based research projects, (2) provide best practice approaches for using this type of analysis in pursuit of greater depth and clarity in our research, and (3) provide seeds for potential research projects that could benefit from the use of this type of analysis. Guidance is also provided for reviewers who assess manuscripts featuring moderation.</jats:p>",

We used piston cores recovered in the western Bering Sea to reconstruct millennial-scale changes in marine productivity and terrigenous matter supply over the past ~180 kyr. Based on a geochemical multi-proxy approach, our results indicate closely interacting processes controlling marine productivity and terrigenous matter supply comparable to the situation in the Okhotsk Sea. Overall, terrigenous inputs were high, whereas export production was low. Minor increases in marine productivity occurred during intervals of Marine Isotope Stage 5 and interstadials, but pronounced maxima were recorded during interglacials and Termination I. The terrigenous material is suggested to be derived from continental sources on the eastern Bering Sea shelf and to be subsequently transported via sea ice, which is likely to drive changes in surface productivity, terrigenous inputs, and upper-ocean stratification. From our results we propose glacial, deglacial, and interglacial scenarios for environmental change in the Bering Sea. These changes seem to be primarily controlled by insolation and sea-level forcing which affect the strength of atmospheric pressure systems and sea-ice growth. The opening history of the Bering Strait is considered to have had an additional impact. High-resolution core logging data (color b*, XRF scans) strongly correspond to the Dansgaard–Oeschger climate variability registered in the NGRIP ice core and support an atmospheric coupling mechanism of Northern Hemisphere climates.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Increased reactive nitrogen (Nr, NO3− + NH4+ + dissolved organic nitrogen) emission from Asian continent poses profound threats on ecosystem safety from terrestrial throughout the ocean proper. To diagnose the sources of atmospheric Nr input and quantify its influence on marine nitrogen cycle of the South China Sea (SCS), an oligotrophic marginal sea adjacent to the emission hotspot China, we conducted measurements of dual isotopes of water-soluble nitrate (δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3) and concentrations of major ions for bulk atmospheric deposition collected from Dongsha Island off south China. The δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 for bulk deposition ranged from −7.5‰ to +3.9‰ and ∼ +17‰ to +88‰, respectively. A relatively uniform low δ15NNO3 and high δ18ONO3 endmember were observed in winter. Non-sea-salt sulfate/calcium (nssSO42− and nssCa2+) peaked as the increasing nitrate depositional flux (one exception caused by typhoon), implying a pollution source of nitrate during high deposition. Meanwhile, the flux-weighted average of δ15NNO3 was −2.7± 2.3‰, resembling the isotopic signature of fossil fuel combustion in inland China. More variable dual isotopic values observed in July and September suggest relatively dynamics sources and conversion chemistry. During the period affected by the peripheral circumfluence of Typhoon Fanapi, a high nitrate deposition with uniform isotopic composition (δ15NNO3 of ~ −0.5‰ and δ18ONO3 of ∼ +19‰) was observed accompanying with low terrestrial constituents such as dust and pollutants (e.g. nssSO42− and nssCa2+). This high nitrate deposition was likely a natural endmember sourced from lightning. The summarized total atmospheric Nr deposition (AND) is ∼ 50 mmol N m−2 yr−1. If without this additional AND fertilization, CO2 release (currently 460 &amp;amp;pm; 430 mmol C m−2 yr−1) from the SCS would be doubled. Our study demonstrates that AND may serve as an important external Nr supply to the SCS yet difficult to separate from N-fixation (−2‰ to 0‰) due to isotopic similarity and high N : P ratio. More studies related to isotopic composition of nitrogen speciation and their relative contributions as well as the role of typhoon-induced input to AND are required.\n                        </jats:p>"

To increase ATP demand, single isolated rabbit SANCs were superfused by physiological saline at 35 ± 0.5°C with isoproterenol, or by phosphodiesterase or protein phosphatase inhibition. We measured cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>and flavoprotein fluorescence in single SANC, and we measured cAMP, ATP, and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption in SANC suspensions. Although the increase in spontaneous AP firing rate was accompanied by an increase in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption, the ATP level and flavoprotein fluorescence remained constant, indicating that ATP production had increased.

When Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup><jats:sub>m</jats:sub>was reduced by Ru360, the increase in spontaneous AP firing rate in response to isoproterenol was reduced by 25%. Thus, both an increase in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup><jats:sub>m</jats:sub>and an increase in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>activated cAMP-PKA-CaMKII signaling regulate the increase in ATP supply to meet ATP demand above the basal level.</jats:p>",

However, less is known about the interactive effects of soil water, nitrogen and phosphorus on native species growth and relative competitive ability. A replacement series design method was used with 12 mixed plants of <jats:italic>Bothriochloa ischaemum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Lespedeza davurica</jats:italic> grown in a pot experiment under three water regimes and four fertility treatments. Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of indices such as biomass production and allocation, relative competitive ability, aggressivity, relative yield total and water use efficiency (WUE). Water stress decreased significantly the total biomass production for each species, either in monoculture or in mixtures. N, P, or NP application can significantly improve biomass production of the two species in their mixtures. There was no obvious change trend in root/shoot ratio of <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> in different mixture proportions. Relative yield total (RYT) values ranged from 0.98 to 1.39. Aggressivity values of <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> to <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> were positive in all water regimes and fertilizations, implying that <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> was the dominant species. Relative competition intensity values of <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> (i.e., RCI<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>) were less than zero, while greater than zero for <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> (i.e., RCI<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>), indicating that the effects of intraspecific competition with <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> were stronger for <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic>, and the opposite for <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic>. WUE increased gradually as the proportion of <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> increased in mixtures, and a 10:2 <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic>:<jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> mixture proportion had significantly higher WUE. Results suggest that it is advantageous to grow the two species together to maximize biomass production and the recommended mixture ratio was 10:2 of <jats:italic>B. ischaemum</jats:italic> to <jats:italic>L. davurica</jats:italic> because it gave higher RYT and significantly higher WUE under conditions of water deficit.</jats:p>",

The freshening signal persisted under the seasonal pycnocline during the 2009 warm season. This resulted in the freshening of STMW in 2010.</jats:p>",

These changes could have profound effects on aquatic ecosystems, and the implications of such changes are less understood. The objective of this study was to examine how future changes in precipitation and temperature translate into changes in streamflow using a physically based semidistributed model, and subsequently how changes in streamflow could potentially impact stream ecology. Streamflow parameters were examined in a New York City water supply watershed for changes from model‐simulated baseline conditions to future climate scenarios (2081‐2100) for ecologically relevant factors of streamflow using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations tool. Results indicate that earlier snowmelt and reduced snowpack advance the timing and increase the magnitude of discharge in the winter and early spring (November‐March) and greatly decrease monthly streamflow later in the spring in April. Both the rise and fall rates of the hydrograph will increase resulting in increased flashiness and flow reversals primarily due to increased pulses during winter seasons. These shifts in timing of peak flows, changes in seasonal flow regimes, and changes in the magnitudes of low flow can all influence aquatic organisms and have the potential to impact stream ecology.</jats:p>",
