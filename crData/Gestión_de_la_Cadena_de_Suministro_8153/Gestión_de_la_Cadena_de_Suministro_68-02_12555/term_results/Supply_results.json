Dosing of all water supplied from the Ormesby plant was undertaken with pyrethrins at 0.002 ppm for a period of 21 days, beginning on Nov. 17, 1958. Prior dechlorination with SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was necessary because chlorine inactivates pyrethrins. Other live organisms were detected in the system, and it was observed that a chlorine residual in excess of 0.05 ppm significantly reduced the number of all the organisms present. The 63 hydrants and washouts mentioned in the article were sampled from September 1960 to May 1965. The origin of infestation is discussed, along with filter experiments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Oats were grown in the greenhouse under four soil moisture regimes at each of several combinations of aerial and soil temperatures. In one series of experiments, both air and soil temperature was controlled at 13, 18.5 and 24 °C. A second series involved the same soil temperatures but a single air temperature (18.5 °C) was common to all soil temperatures. Air and soil temperatures higher than 13 °C reduced yield more drastically than soil temperatures above 13 °C. It is suggested that high air temperature placed a restriction on root growth that was not offset by the most favorable soil temperature employed. High temperatures and high levels of soil moisture increased the rate of stem elongation and the height at heading but reduced the time between emergence and heading. Increased height which resulted from high levels of moisture increased yield, but increased height resulting from high temperature was associated with reduced yield. </jats:p>",

The rates and regional distributions of the blood supply of the nutrient as well as other arteries of the femur were studied after ligation of the nutrient artery. The average rates of reduction in blood flow per minute for the first five minutes through the entire femur as well as the shaft, and the epiphysis and metaphysis on each end, were measured and analysed.

The normal average rate of blood flow through the femurs of average weight of 9·38 grammes was 0·90±0·05 millilitres per minute, or 9·60±0·47 millilitres per minute per 100 grammes of bone. </jats:p><jats:p> 4. The nutrient artery contributed at least 46 per cent of the normal total blood supply of the entire femur and at least 71 per cent of the normal total blood flow of the shaft including its marrow, and 37 per cent and 33 per cent of the normal total blood flow of the upper and the lower epiphysial and metaphysial areas respectively. </jats:p><jats:p> 5. About 63 per cent, 30 per cent and 67 per cent of the total normal blood flow through the upper epiphysis and metaphysis, the shaft and the lower epiphysis and metaphysis respectively are still intact in the first five minutes after ligation of the nutrient artery, which represent the approximate proportions of the blood supply by the other regional arteries. </jats:p><jats:p> 6.
