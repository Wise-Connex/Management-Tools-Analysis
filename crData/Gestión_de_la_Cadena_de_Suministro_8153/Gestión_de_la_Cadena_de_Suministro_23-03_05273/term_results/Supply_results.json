The number of suppliers participating in the system, the replenishment level of suppliers and the impact of demand uncertainty on the operational cost of supply logistics are analysed. The results show that: the participation of multiple suppliers can reduce the increase of supply logistics operating costs to a certain extent; as the service level increases, the supply logistics operating costs increase and then decrease; the impact of demand uncertainty on the supply logistics operating costs can be mitigated to a certain extent by the coordination function of Supply-hub.</jats:p>"

Poor management contributes more to water crises than resource constraints. Multiple Indian metropolitan cities face severe water crises. These cities usually have high non-revenue water (NRW) levels. The present study estimates the efficiency of the extent of NRW management to improve per capita water supply (PCS) and cost recovery (CR) in 55 Indian metropolises with more than one million population. The study considered variable-returns-to-scale data envelopment analysis (DEA) using input orientation (I/P DEA). NRW has been used as the input variable, while the PCS and CR are studied as the output variables. The DEA model recommends that reduced NRW levels can address the water crisis in Indian cities. According to the DEA findings, about 38 Indian cities (68.09%) could reduce NRW levels by more than 50% while improving PCS and CR levels substantially. Around 47 cities (85.45%) can fulfil the water supply benchmark value of 135 litres per capita per day (lpcd). Three cities can improve the cost recovery by more than 100%. The findings suggest that water supply utilities in Indian cities should focus on reducing NRW levels substantially to improve the PCS and CR.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Strains on global supply chains have exposed more than ever the need for global businesses to have greater visibility, control and a chameleon-like ability to adapt to any new situation rapidly. Organisations need an in-built ability to reconfigure to unforeseen disruptions arising from anything from geo-political events to a sudden change in consumer taste. Over the years, companies have tried different approaches to this challenge, hoping to gain that elusive level of consistency in a unified view of their supply chain data that will support all their needs. Each has run into problems, with the current shortage of data science expertise a difficulty all must overcome. This paper explains how the ultimate control tower has emerged as a highly effective approach, providing the connective tissue that global organisations need. It enables them to exploit data from their dynamic supply chain to better-inform decisions with immediate positive impact. Based on the four pillars of see, understand, optimise and act, this approach is already delivering for major companies with extended global supply chains. Using real-world examples, the paper explains how organisations deploying the ultimate control tower are achieving resilience and shape-shifting agility that enable them to excel in highly dynamic markets amid many challenges. Organisations are able to move from linear to much more supple digital and collaborative models. They can embed on-demand analytics capabilities and machine learning (ML), making it faster and easier to gain new insights and intelligent predictive and prescriptive capabilities.</jats:p>"

The study traces the origins and evolution of these theories, highlighting their unique foundations and the contexts in which they emerged. The review also discusses the fundamental principles and underlying assumptions of each theory, emphasizing their relevance to SCM and the implications for its practice. The review shows how these theories have helped us understand and improve SCM and how they can improve supply chain performance, promote sustainability, and drive innovation. This thorough analysis is a helpful tool for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who want to learn more about the different theories that continue to shape and inform the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

The hierarchical scheduling and production planning of a dynamic supply chain can enable enterprises in the supply chain to obtain, and maintain, stable and lasting competitive advantages; thus, improving the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. Simultaneously, research on supply chains is also a hotspot in system engineering. At present, research on complex supply chain systems with dual channels is insufficient, and analysis of dynamic supply chains with supply failure of goods is rare. In the epidemic era, dynamic supply chain management was affected by the epidemic and became a very challenging topic. The control of the supply chain system under the impact of an epidemic situation is particularly important. This paper focused on H∞ the fault-tolerant control of a complex supply chain system with dual channels. First, from the perspective of engineering practice and green production, we established a new green supply chain model. This supply chain model includes the dual-channel supply of goods and also considers the supply failure of goods. At the same time, production delay and supply delay are also considered in this model. Second, a supply scheduling scheme was designed through cybernetics to ensure the stability of a supply chain with dual channels under supply failure of goods, and we completed supply chain management. Finally, the effectiveness of our results was verified by specific Chinese enterprise data.</jats:p>"

Aiming to increase shareholder value through establishing “customer centricity” is the focus of this research, which also delves into DDM adoption techniques. The decision-making process has grown in significance with the advent of analytics and the raging digital era. Also essential to the process are intuition and judgment. Choosing the right thing to do isn’t something that can be done purely rationally. This study provides the answers to the research questions about how data analytics in one department affects that department and the company as a whole. To be more specific, it uses an information value chain technique to hypothesize the link between the marketing unit’s and the firm’s performance in terms of quality data and the sensing capabilities of IT- based analytics. Supporting the predictions, a survey of 346 companies found evidence of both direct and partially mediated effects on sensing capabilities, as well as partially mediated effects on quality data.</jats:p>"

The ongoing challenges, including resource scarcity, climate change, waste generation, etc., need immediate actions from stakeholders to develop resilient food supply chains. Previous studies explored food supply chains and their challenges, barriers, enablers, etc. Still, there needs to be more literature on the innovations in supply chains that can build resilient food chains to last long and compete in the post-pandemic scenario. Thus, studies are also required to explore supply chain innovations for the food sector. The current research employed a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) to assess the supply chain innovations that can develop resilient food supply chains. This study is a pioneer in using the SWARA application to evaluate supply chain innovation and identify the most preferred alternatives. The results from the SWARA show that ‘Business strategy innovations’ are the most significant innovations that can bring resiliency to the food supply chains, followed by ‘Technological innovations.’ The study provides insights for decision makers to understand the significant supply chain innovations to attain resilience in food chains and help the industry to survive and sustain in the long run.</jats:p>"

This study targeted warehouse operators, farmers, retailers, distributors, consumers and key informative personnel involved in onions produces within the study area of Singida Urban District. The study used a sample size of 100 respondents less than the targeted sample size of 138 obtained from the estimated population large than 1000. Based on studies in Ethiopia, the onion supply chain took about 0.44% of the entire agriculture participant’s dominant crop for commercial purposes. The results suggest that the distribution channels used by majority of onion farmers were whole sellers. onion  SC  influence  by the  distribution  process  of onions, such as number of market locations and distribution channels used to use a two-way ANOVA study revealed that different distribution channels have different variability in the onion supply chain the types of distribution channel used were statistically significant [F (1, 86) =1.25, p=0.01].</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Target Substantiation of the content and semantic meaning (semantics) of the complex concept (concept) «drug supply» based on the choice of the most appropriate term from a number of existing options and clarification of its definition as a priority interdisciplinary area of pharmacy. Methods The initial materials of the study were publications on the organizational problems of pharmacy for the period 1971-2020, selected by the method of non-repetitive random selection from specialized journals, materials of conferences, congresses, dissertations and collections of papers. The information array included 2634 works, including 596 (22.63%) publications on the problems of drug supply. The scientific and methodological apparatus of the study included the scientometric method used to count the number of publications, content analysis and terminology meth- ods: logical-semantic, lexical, classification, comparison, and others. Results The array of terms used by specialists to designate drug supply was formed on the basis of content analysis of publication titles. Terms were selected that contained the words «drug», «pharmaceutical», etc. in combination with the words «pro- viding», «supply», «help», etc. The terms «drug care» and «drug provision» were most actively used, their total frequencies amounted to 127 and 289 positions, respectively. A logical-semantic analysis of the concept of «drug supply» has been carried out. To distinguish between the terms under discussion, a comparison of the definitions of «drug care» and «pharmaceutical care» is given. The modern se- mantic content of the concept «drug supply» is substantiated, taking into account the signs of the genus and type of the structural model of the formed definition. The relationship between the concept of «drug supply» and the concepts of «phar- maceutical activity», «circulation of medicines» and «logistics» is analyzed. The author’s classification of the types of «drug supply» by type of consumer is present- ed. As a result, a modern version of the definition was formulated: drug supply is a logistics process in the drug circulation system aimed at bringing drugs from the manufacturer (supplier) to the end user. Conclusion Evidence-based choice of the content and semantic meaning of the term «drug supply», the most adequate to its subject area, the proposed classification of types of drug supply and scientifically based formulation of the definition streamline sci- entific and practical knowledge in the field of pharmaceutical science and practice, optimize the educational process, due to the unambiguous interpretation of sub- jects, processes and phenomena, increase its effectiveness and optimize the subse- quent communication of pharmaceutical specialists in the profession and society.</jats:p>",

This paper examines in detail its important impact on supply chain information disclosure through the lens of the presence or absence of political affiliation as an important characteristic of a firm. Based on a panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies, the empirical analysis finds that corporate political affiliation significantly increases the level of corporate supply chain disclosure, and this effect persists after a series of robustness tests. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect is more pronounced in the eastern and central regions than in the western region, and the effect is greater for firms in the central region, which are mainly present in capital-intensive industries compared to labor-intensive firms. Based on an upstream and downstream perspective, the impact is more pronounced upstream. Further mechanistic analysis reveals that the productivity-enabling effect of political linkages and the weakening of management power are important mechanistic pathways. This paper enriches the research on the influencing factors of corporate supply chain information disclosure and gives corresponding suggestions for enhancing corporate supply chain transparency.</jats:p>"

In this context, supply chain resource orchestration (SCRO) could be a game changer; however, not enough is known about SCRO at the BOP. We examine SCRO theory and practice and identify strategies to enable more BOP players to achieve sustainable social and economic benefits. Our methodology involves: (1) a critical review of extant supply chain BOP literature to develop a SCRO model, (2) a content analysis with interview data triangulation that examines 21 case studies of business ventures at the BOP, (3) abstraction of a typology of common SCRO strategies, (4) development of a classification pyramid and SCRO process model that illustrate SCRO tactics across pyramid levels and (5) creation of a classification matrix, which encapsulates our observed connections among motivations, strategies, tactics and outcomes across the case studies. The research sheds light on opportunities for future scholars to examine supply chains and SCRO at the BOP level. It also provides practical guidance on how to orchestrate a successful BOP supply chain and suggests the SCRO strategies propagating from the grass roots level tend to benefit the most people. </jats:p>",

The emergence of new 4.0 IR technologies promoted more investment in their adoption but at the same time raised more challenges to managers in identifying the actual implications of these technologies on organization performance.  At the same time, empirical work on the relationship between 4.0 IR implementation and performance has reported mixed findings, and some recent studies suggest that researchers need to focus on exploring specific conditions that enable organizations to effectively translate their investment in developing 4.0 IR tools into positive performance.  This paper argues that these inconclusive findings are partially caused by the lack of considering the contingency effects of other factors while examining these relations by previous empirical research and it explores the extent to which existing research has considered these contingency effects.  Using the contingency theory of the firm, the above theoretical belief is theoretically discussed and established using outcomes reported by several empirical studies.  The findings of this study provide several theoretical and practical implications and additional insights into the theory and practice of 4.0 IR in the logistics and supply chain management domain in particular.</jats:p>",

The present study was conducted to develop the strategies for enhancing the land and water productivity in tank command areas in the rain-fed regions of Telangana. Three strategies were identified, these strategies include change in the cropping pattern, water saving technologies and conjunctive use of tank with open well/bore well water. Due to change in cropping pattern from paddy to irrigated, dry crops like maize, chillies and cotton increased the cultural command area of the tanks by 79% and net reruns by 43%. The conjunctive use of tank water and well water is the better strategy for optimal resource use and higher returns in tank command areas. Results also showed that the alternate wetting and drying strategy in tank command areas increased the command area by 35%. These strategies can be implemented to increase the water use efficiency, cultural command area and net returns in the tank command areas of Southern India.</jats:p>",

The precise goals were to evaluate how Nigerian manufacturing companies performed in terms of innovation in relation to economic, environmental, and social dimension of sustainability. The Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) Theory and the Stakeholder Theory were both used in the study. The study employed a descriptive survey approach, with three Nigerian manufacturing companies as the target population. The study used a purposeful sampling strategy, and the researcher decided that a sample size of 120 was manageable. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the validity and reliability of the research instrument prior to the collection of data. A 91% response rate was obtained, and the results were displayed in tables using percentages. The analysis showed that sustainable supply chain management practices had a positive and significant impact on the innovative performance of manufacturing companies in Nigeria, demonstrating that economic, environmental, and social dimension of sustainability all had a significant positive impact on this performance. The research consequently advises manufacturing companies to engage in more sustainable operations so as boost their competitive edge.</jats:p>",

Applying a cost-minimizing electricity system model including options to invest in eleven different flexibility measures, cost-efficient combinations of strategies to manage varia-tions are identified. The results of the model are post-processed using a novel method to map the net load before and after flexibility measures are applied to reveal the contribution of each flexi-bility measure.\r\nThe net load is mapped in the space spanned by the amplitude, duration, and number of occur-rences. The mapping shows that, depending on cost structure, flexibility measures contribute to reduce the net load in three different ways; 1) by reducing variations of long duration but low amplitude, 2) by reducing variations of high amplitude but short duration and low occurrence or 3) by reducing variations of high amplitude, short duration and high occurrence. It is found that cost-efficient variation management is achieved by combining wind and solar power and by combining strategies (1-3) to manage variations. The cost-efficient combination of strategies de-pends on electricity system context where electricity trade, flexible hydrogen and heat production (1) manage the majority of variations in regions with good conditions for wind power while sta-tionary batteries (3) are the main contributors in regions with good conditions for solar power.</jats:p>"

This study finds that factors replace with the rapid expansion of residential areas, increasing population, steeper slopes, changing lifestyles, natural hazards, technical and management leakage are major contributors to the growing water shortages in the area, leading to a situation of water instability. However, the study also identifies that factor such as precipitation, geology, soil types, potential water sources in the area offer opportunities for stabilizing the water supply in Dharan Sub-metropolitan. This study highlights the combined effect of these various active factors that led to an increase in per capita demand of water from 71 to 100 lpcd. This increasing water demand and shrinking of surface water led to Interrupted Water pumping and overexploitation. Additionally, the study indicates that due to high level of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) up-to 40%, certain parts of the city’s residents are facing major difficulties in accessing clean drinking water. The study also finds that positive changes in precipitation, supportive soil types and geology in the city of Dharan increases the potential for water recharge and harvesting. In order to achieve a sustainable and climate-resilient water supply, the study recommends implementing Water management tools likewise protective measures for critical water zones, stabilizing stream banks and gullies for surface water source improvement, artificial recharge of the city through Climate Adaptive Recharge Pits (CARP) and slope interception methods, as well as community-based water harvesting for groundwater source improvement. Furthermore, the study suggests establishing R&amp;D unit involving national and local level experts and stakeholders for better planning and management.</jats:p>"

This study shifts the current research direction on deceptive negotiation behavior by adopting a <jats:italic>target's perspective</jats:italic> on deception and by using a <jats:italic>configurational</jats:italic> theorizing approach. Prior studies in supply chain management (SCM) and in other disciplines have studied deceptive negotiation behavior—as one specific form of opportunism—based on correlational approaches. In doing so, they have focused almost exclusively on the actor's (i.e., deceiver's) perspective—for example, investigating actors' motivations for using deception. As a result, a profound understanding of deceptive negotiation behavior from a target's perspective is lacking. In three studies, this research investigates what factors, on both the firm and individual levels, combine to lead purchasing managers (i.e., targets) to perceive supplier deception. The configurational analysis uncovers considerably more combinations of firm‐level and individual‐level factors that lead to perceptions of high supplier deception than combinations that lead to perceptions of low supplier deception. Thus, the contribution is twofold: First, the studies shift the perspective from the deception source to the deception target. Second, they uncover the causally complex nature of perceived deception in negotiations. Managerial implications include that purchasing managers, in their efforts to detect supplier deception, should move beyond paying attention to isolated factors, such as body language, and instead should focus on different combinations of power balances, negotiation stakes, and negotiator proficiencies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Today's supply chain is more complex in composition and structure. Information loss and late transmission aggravated the bullwhip effect. Lack of reliable information storage, traceability, and accountability have also slowed supply chain management. Blockchain supports distributed networking, information synchronization among nodes, digital encryption, traceable information, and unchangeable block content, making it suitable for the supply chain. This paper presents the public blockchain as a solution to the \"bullwhip effect problem in supply chain (SC). The framework is implemented to address the disruption of semiconductors' SC. The framework consists of a checklist to determine the SC's readiness for blockchain adoption. The checklist determines the motivation, timing, and the appropriate platform for adopting blockchain. The framework was validated in the Semiconductors SC by polling four executives: each represents a large company that has many branches in Egypt and the Middle East; each represents a different stage, and they are retail, distribution, manufacturing, and supply. The results showed that the executives agreed that there are perceived benefits to adopting blockchain. At the same time, they are neutral about whether it is the right time for blockchain adoption and disagree that the BC technology is ready for their SC. Finally, some of the public blockchain platforms that can be used and implemented in supply chains were introduced to help enterprises choose the most suitable platform to adopt.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, there have been some empirical evidence showing emerging economies’ and long-run experiences of advanced economies’ decreasing labor in spite of restrictions on labor statistics. To replicate these phenomena, we develop the model with endogenous technogical chnage and endogenous labor supply, and we find that adding increasing returns of R&amp;D (reasech and development) efficiency, at least for the small input, yields the economic path accompany the decreasing labor supply. Furthermore, the path is stable (not saddle stable), so the steady state has multiple paths under rational expectations, which yields local indeterminacy. This would reflect the modern intermittently-coming economic shocks in both advanced and emerging countries. Furthermore, the model also contains a steady state with no growth trap, and selection among steady states is possible. The model has global indeterminacy, which would be one of the mechanisms for the start of economic growth.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>International trade has created more economic growth opportunities in the agriculture sector. The agricultural sector remains key to the South African economy, with a vibrant international market becoming available as the country’s agriculture exports grow. However, the impacts of human-caused global warming have intensified as a result of increased greenhouse gas emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2), which negatively affects agricultural productivity and the economy. Considering the future energy resource demands for agricultural productivity due to the expected population growth and the emphasis on environmental remedial actions, the following question presents itself: what impact will a clean energy supply have on the agricultural economy and the environment, notwithstanding that agriculture, as a sector, also has a huge potential to contribute to renewable energy production? This study examines the effect of the nexus of South Africa’s renewable energy supply, CO2 emissions and trade openness on agricultural economic growth from 1990 to 2021. The nexus provides crucial insights into policies targeted at promoting renewable energy in the agricultural sector by isolating key areas of priority. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test, fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) test, a dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) test and a canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) econometric analysis were used to estimate the nexus. The results showed that growth in the agricultural sector leads to deterioration in the environment, while international trade benefits the sector. The scale of renewable energy supply slowed down the agricultural economy. The study makes a new contribution in providing empirical evidence for the links between renewable energy supply and agricultural GDP, which can drive policy on renewable energy use in the agricultural sector in South Africa. The paper recommends intentional renewable energy production research and development (R&amp;D) finance focusing on renewable energy human development planning and investments in vocational programmes in higher learning institutes, agricultural renewable energy policy and the creation of green incentive schemes for feedstock producers, especially in rural areas in the agricultural sector.</jats:p>"

However in the real world, there are many errors between these two flows due to the variety of goods the number and variety of products. In this regard, the transaction errors are the common phenomena in supply chain processes such as receiving, selling, warehousing, etc. On the other hand, using RFID to reduce inventory errors via managers has doubts due to its costs. In present study, a novel methodology is provided for analyzing the effect of errors on information system inventory by applying the simulation approach. In addition, quantitative analyzing of RFID role in errors reduction is presented by determination of the optimal amount of inventory. To this, at first, the meaningful difference between profit in the absence and the presence of transaction errors was examined by statistical hypothesis testing and then optimal order quantity in the both of cases with and without the using RFID was calculated based on mathematical modeling. At last, the two-way sensitivity analysis approach is applied to examine the cost-effective using RFID. The results show that only at the point of optimal economic order quantity is always a meaningful difference between profit in the absence and the presence of transaction errors. Also the error rate is the most important factor and sale unit price and shortage cost are others factors, respectively for the cost-effective using RFID technology,</jats:p>"

In the existing literature on the financing supply chain, enterprises and consumers are becoming more and more aware of environmental protection. A growing number of manufacturers produce low-carbon products like environment-friendly bags through a green supply chain system. We use the Stackelberg game to study the equilibrium financing choice and optimal decisions. We also perform numerical analysis to verify the impact of certain parameters on financing decisions. The results show that no direct relationship between the degree of carbon reduction and the total amount of carbon emissions as defined by the government. Besides, when the trade credit interest rate is higher than the bank interest rate, the manufacturer will choose bank financing. When the credit interest rate is lower than a certain threshold, the retailer provides trade credit financing. Our study also provides useful insights for managers to understand and make financing decisions in the low-carbon supply chain with the capital-constrained manufacturer.</jats:p>"

Currently Pamsimas Tabanan Regency is divided into 9 service coverage areas for people in rural areas. In general, the condition of drinking water services presents the main problem, namely that not all areas are accessed by adequate water services.

China, being one of the most critical roles in the global supply chain, has faced stress from product supply, inefficient logistics and transportation, and financial crises on firms. Thus, this paper suggests three solutions to resolve China's supply chain disruption: unclog the foreign logistics system, strengthen foreign cooperation, and ensure financial security.

It is very important to extract the characteristic signal in the frequency domain to accurately locate the leakage point. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) has been proven to be effective in extracting leakage characteristic frequency domain signals, but it needs to set parameters in advance to adjust the signal processing effect. Therefore, it is proposed to initialize the center frequency required for the VMD with the frequency corresponding to the peak of the power spectrum of the original signal and then solve the preset problem of VMD decomposition layers by the recursive method. In addition, mutual information is used as a screening criterion for composite pattern functions to select appropriate pattern components to reconstruct signals. The actual leak location results show that the location errors of the proposed algorithm are only 0.20 and 1.66% for 23.3 and 38.9 m pipeline lengths, respectively. This shows that the proposed method can achieve the accurate location of the water leakage point under long measurement distances and complex interference.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Retail supply chains are key on any market. Their significance has long been recognized in the literature and in practice. Various factors such as pandemics, economic crises, wars, and natural disasters have further increased interest in this area. However, the most recent research has focused more on resilience, sustainability, energy consumption, and a circular economy, while the efficiency of logistics processes has been almost completely overlooked. Logistics process efficiency in retail supply chain is a fundamental principle without which all mentioned performances cannot have desired values. This gap is precisely the main motivation of this research. In this paper, research models in literature are presented which can be used, with some modifications, to measure the efficiency of the retail supply chain. The models were based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. Four main groups were identified: standard DEA models, efficiency decomposition models, network models, and game-theory-based models. In the second part of the paper, various approaches were tested on a real example of a trading company operating in Serbia. Seven supply chains were observed, each consisting of a distribution center (DC) and retail store (RS). Variables used were the number of pallet places, logistics costs, number of deliveries, accuracy of deliveries, and turnover. The results showed the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches in real examples. The main contributions of this paper lie in unique approaches to measuring the efficiency of the retail supply chain. The paper creates an excellent foundation for future research and measurements on real systems, which is equally useful for researchers and industry experts.</jats:p>"

Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions produced along a firm’s supply chain. They represent the majority of most firms’ carbon footprint. Current estimations of Scope 3 emissions are largely based on industry averages and other approximations, which leads to several disadvantages. By contrast, primary data sharing along the supply chain would provide firms with precise measures of Scope 3 emissions (that are eventually necessary for decarbonizing supply chain emissions beyond industry averages). For that, firms need access to data and information from their suppliers that are not under their control. We review the benefits of and three main obstacles to such data sharing: legal and regulatory challenges, missing interoperability, and data privacy concerns. Finally, we discuss initiatives and approaches for overcoming these obstacles.</jats:p>"

Most supply and distribution networks face problems with managing all these components together. Many problems of current supply chains can be solved through blockchain technology; Because blockchain offers us very good and pristine ways to record, transfer and share information. The literature in this field is more focused on the technological sector and pays less attention to other sectors. In this research, it is emphasized the need to pay attention to the relationships between supply chain partners and change management when adopting this technology. Also, the current research identifies some of the challenges of adopting blockchain technology with a comprehensive view for the first time and places these challenges in a new classification.

Specifically, four different scenarios are investigated: centralized supply chain with/without certification and decentralized supply chain with/without certification. The results indicate that the ecolabel policy only functions below a threshold of the consumer’s environmental awareness which is higher in the decentralized situation. Only when choosing the certification standard as its green degree, can the manufacturer get the optimal profit. Aiming to maximize the environmental benefit, the optimal ecolabel standard in the centralized decision-making situation is higher than that in the decentralized ones. Furthermore, a wholesale price contract with the manufacturer's reputation is established to make both the product’s green degree and the whole environmental benefit reach the optimal level in a decentralized supply chain.</p>"

Indeed, the SC is currently under enormous pressure and the decision-making process is frequently confronted with varied settings while making decisions due to the degree of uncertainty. The purpose of this study is to investigate the main major sources of uncertainty in SC. The study also examines the practices adopted to reduce uncertainty and enhance forecasting accuracy. A survey was carried out. Questionnaires were distributed amongst the managerial staff located in Morocco and other countries. We collected work e-mail addresses of managerial staff managerial working in SCs that operate in mass production and also in large-scale distribution and invited them to participate in an anonymous online survey. The questionnaire was designed to assess respondents' views about the main sources of uncertainty in SC and how they do to reduce it. Findings indicate that uncertainty occurs in any SC process, but the main uncertain prosses are procurement, supply planning, and demand forecasting. In addition, uncertainty comes from external and internal factors. Moreover, the decision-making mode, SC partnership, and risk contract have an important impact on the occurrence of uncertainty in the SC.</jats:p>"

Our objective is to better understand supply chain disruptions and to propose solutions to the sustainability problems currently being experienced within supply chains. The authors use models to better comprehend how to avoid supply chain structures that are easily disrupted. Included among the findings are that disruptions cause the loss of production capacity; thus, the ability to rapidly increase production capacity in the same or other parts of the supply chain becomes paramount. Furthermore, structural redundancy can help alleviate the loss of capacity coming from a disruption. One purpose of the models is to foster a basic appreciation for the different lead times and fixed costs associated with capacity expansion of the various supply chain components. There are implications for where within the supply chain additional robustness and capacity are needed.</jats:p>"

The\ninvasion of Ukraine was followed by a cutoff of gas supplies from Russia to\nmany EU countries, and the EU is planning to ban or drastically reduce its\ndependence on Russia. We provide a dataset of daily gas consumption in five\nsectors (household and public building heating, power, industry, and other\nsectors) with supply source shares in the EU27 (27 EU member countries) and UK from 2016 to 2022. The datasets are available at Zenodo platform: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7549233 (Zhou et al., 2022).\nThe dataset separates the contributions of Russian imports, liquefied\nnatural gas (LNG) imports, and other supply sources to both direct supply\nand storage supply for gas consumption estimations. The dataset was\ndeveloped with a gas network flow simulation model based on mass flow\nbalance by combining data from multiple datasets including daily ENTSOG (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas)\npipeline gas transport and storage, ENTSOE (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) daily power production from\ngas, and Eurostat monthly gas consumption statistics per sector. The annual\nconsumption data were validated against the BP Statistical Review of World\nEnergy and Eurostat datasets. We secondly analyzed the share of gas supplied\nby Russia in each country to quantify the “gap” that would result from a\ncessation of all Russian exports to Europe. Thirdly, we collected multiple\ndata sources to assess how national gaps could be alleviated by (1) reducing\nthe demand for heating in a plausible way using the lower envelope of gas\nempirical consumption – temperature functions, (2) increasing power\ngeneration from sources other than gas, (3) transferring gas savings from\ncountries with surplus to those with deficits, and (4) increasing imports\nfrom other countries like Norway, the USA, Australia, and northern African\ncountries from either pipelines or LNG imports, accounting for existing\ncapacities. Our results indicate that it should be theoretically possible\nfor the EU to collectively make up for a sudden shortfall of Russian gas by\ncombining the four solutions together, provided a perfect collaboration\nbetween EU countries and the UK to redistribute gas from countries with\nsurplus to those with deficits. Further analyses are required to investigate\nthe implications with respect to the costs, including social, economic, and institutional\ndimensions; political barriers; and negative impacts on climate policies,\nwith inevitable increases in CO2 emissions if the use of coal is ramped up\nin the power sector.\n                    </jats:p>"

В отличие от западных государств с присущим им рыночным механизмом саморегулирования, Россия имеет много десятилетний положительный опыт государственного регулирования как отдельных отраслей хозяйства страны, так и всей экономики в целом. Обращение к истории развития нашего государства (от образования в 1922 году СССР, а в 1993 году Российской Федерации) убедительно свидетельствует, что прогрессивное развитие экономики происходило благодаря государственному подходу. В этой связи данная статья направлена на выработку стратегических решений в рамках осуществления государственного управления одной из отраслей народного хозяйства страны — электроэнергетикой. Проведенный анализ 85 субъектов РФ по показателю «энергообеспеченность регионов» позволит сформировать типологические группы регионов, в отношении которых предлагается осуществлять с учетом особенностей развития регионов и сложившейся структуры экономики целенаправленную государственную энергетическую политику. Материалы статьи не только вносят определенный вклад в создание модели устойчивого развития регионов России в теоретическом плане, но и представляют практический интерес для органов государственной и муниципальной власти, осуществляющих разработку энергетической политики и реализацию принимаемых мер в этой отрасли хозяйства.

Unlike Western states with their inherent market mechanism of self-regulation, Russia has many decades of positive experience in state regulation of both individual sectors of the country's economy and the entire economy as a whole. An appeal to the history of the development of our state (from the formation of the USSR in 1922, and the Russian Federation in 1993) convincingly testifies that the progressive development of the economy was due to the state approach. In this regard, this article is aimed at developing strategic decisions within the framework of state management of one of the branches of the national economy of the country – the electric power industry. The analysis of 85 subjects of the Russian Federation according to the indicator \"energy availability of regions\" will allow us to form typological groups of regions in respect of which it is proposed to implement a targeted state energy policy, taking into account the peculiarities of regional development and the current structure of the economy. The materials of the article not only make a certain contribution to the creation of a model of sustainable development of Russian regions in theoretical terms, but also are of practical interest to state and municipal authorities engaged in the development of energy policy and the implementation of measures taken in this sector of the economy.</jats:p>",

The current “supply cut-off” crisis in the auto industry has begun to receive widespread attention, and the impact on the global auto industry chain has already started to emerge. In the face of the increasingly unstable environment, it is worth exploring what impact the epidemic has had on the automotive supply chain, what risks are there for vehicle manufacturers and component manufacturers, and what insights this epidemic has for the upgrading and long-term development of corporate supply chain systems. Based on this, this paper will share some preliminary thoughts on the short-term supply chain response suggestions and long-term supply chain system construction in light of the epidemic from the supply chain perspective.</jats:p>"

Agricultural traceability systems in food production provide farmers with food safety and smart contracts. Smart contracts establish cryptocurrency evidence of delivery with automated bitcoin payments to all parties. In this paper, we propose circular blockchain-based traceability and bitcoin prediction in agricultural food crop system to accomplish transparency and traceability. Bitcoin prediction using LSTM benefits farmers and stakeholders to buy and sell their food crops when the profit is high. Moreover, the proposed system provides safety, consensus, shared ledger, speedy payment, and decentralization. All activities are processed in a distributed shared ledger with connections to a decentralized file system, which makes the supply chain visible and traceable. All the activities that are tied up in the supply chain are transparent to consumers and stakeholders. Traceability of the agricultural product is done efficiently with QR code, which results in a trustable relationship between the farmer and the consumer. Finally, our research shows that the accuracy of LSTM outperforms by 88.67% compared to traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM and Naive Bayes with accuracy of 62.025% and 75.32% in forecasting the bitcoin price.</jats:p>"

It used linear programming to minimize land area required for cropping while producing enough food to achieve dietary and protein requirements for the whole population. The potential agricultural impacts of three nuclear winter scenarios on NZ, were sourced from the literature. The optimized combinations of frost resistant crops that were found to feed the entire population were, in descending order: wheat and carrots; sugar beet; oats; onions and carrots; cabbage and barley; canola and cabbage; linseed and parsnip; rye and lupins; swede and field beans; and cauliflower. But in terms of current production levels of these frost resistant crops in NZ, there would be a 26% shortfall for the “war without a nuclear winter” scenario and a 71% shortfall for the severe nuclear winter scenario (150 Tg of soot in the stratosphere with a 61% decline in crop yields). In conclusion, at current production levels, frost resistant food crops could not feed all NZ citizens following a nuclear war. There is a need for the NZ Government to conduct a detailed pre-war analysis on how these shortfalls are best addressed e.g., by: increased pre-war production of these crops and/or post-war scalability; growing enough <jats:italic>frost sensitive</jats:italic> crops (i.e., in greenhouses or the warmest parts of the country); and/or ensuring continuing production of food derived from livestock fed on frost resistant grasses.</jats:p>"

Second, using firm-level data, I show that firm-level capital stock responses to an adverse credit supply shock produce an insignificant and negligible capital-misallocation–induced TFP response. Third, using employment data by fine firm-size category classification, I also find a negligible labor-misallocation–induced TFP response.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, concerns about environmental issues are increasing. Therefore, companies and producers are under pressure from government rules and regulations on one hand, and on the other hand, maintaining customer satisfaction concerning cares about the environment. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is a procedure to increase efficiency and decrease environmental effects for companies that collaborate with customers and suppliers. According to GSCM, there is some research about applying green aspects of purchasing, design, manufacture, distribution, packaging, marketing, and reverse logistics of supply chains to improve their company’s performance regarding environmental issues. Moreover, recently, DEA as a nonparametric model is used to evaluate the efficiency and performance of supply chains as decision-making units (DMUs). However, previous studies on efficiency improvement in GSCM did not investigate the effect of some economic and environmental factors together such as service level, emissions (CO2), and size of the supply chains (arcs) on the efficiency of the whole supply system. These factors are essential as they can affect the manager’s ability to distinguish the true performance of a green supply chain. Thus, evaluating the efficiency of GSCM by DEA models and imposing the green principles to find out the efficient ones for increasing management performance is vital. Fulfilling the mentioned research gap, this paper developed a benchmark approach to verifying efficient DMUs and potential efficient DMUs which may improve costs and efforts to become efficient. In the case study, the benchmarks and potentially efficient DMUs are found by DEA standard models and slight adjustment is conducted for potentially efficient DMUs to change their status to efficient DMUs. Moreover, the effect of some green principles on the efficiency value of DMUs is verified using Tobit regression before and after the mentioned modification. A set of realistic results provided for the priority of potential DMUs modification confirmed the applicability of the proposed procedure.</jats:p>"

Агроклиматический риск имеет две составляющие – климатическую и биологическую; в статье рассматривается только климатическая. Последствиями агроклиматических рисков являются возможные потери, связанные с дефицитом агроклиматических ресурсов интегрально за период вегетации, обусловленные физиологически критичными для роста и развития растений метеорологическими параметрами среды, в том числе при возникновении в ходе вегетации опасных агрометеорологических явлений. Изменение пространственного и временного распределений экстремальных атмосферных и почвенных засух учитывается при оценках агроклиматических рисков и их последствий в условиях прогнозируемого изменения климата. Процедура прогноза при оценивании рисков является обязательной, но труднореализуемой в наблюдаемых условиях нестабильности климата и недостаточной адекватности современных математических климатических моделей процессам глобальной циркуляции атмосферы и океана. Целью статьи являются раскрытие сущности понятия «агроклиматический риск» и изложение методики формирования вероятностных прогнозов изменения количества атмосферных осадков посредством обобщения множества детерминированных прогнозов, публикуемых МГЭИК (Международная группа экспертов по изменению климата). При подготовке материалов статьи использована оригинальная авторская модификация ансамблевого метода обобщения детерминированных модельных прогнозов осадков. Приводятся результаты применения методики для прогнозной модельной оценки изменения количества осадков на земледельческой территории России на временном интервале 2011–2030 гг. Результаты картирования данных обобщения свидетельствуют о локальных снижениях количества осадков в регионах, подверженных процессам опустынивания, и, как следствие, увеличении вероятности агроклиматических рисков по фактору водообеспеченности посевов сельскохозяйственных культур. Новизна работы заключается в формулировании понятий и специфичности характеристик агроклиматического риска в ряду климатических и агрономических рисков, а также в использовании авторской модификации ансамблевого метода обобщения для приведения детерминированных данных нечеткого множества прогнозов к вероятностному представлению. Актуальность работы обусловлена наблюдаемыми глобальными изменениями климата, сопутствующим увеличением неопределенности климатической критичности земледелия в аридных и полуаридных зонах и необходимостью управления агроклиматическими рисками для предотвращения или смягчения их последствий.</jats:p>",

The Internet of Things includes anything from intelligent kitchen appliances to smart buildings, smart lighting on streets to automated manufacturing processes, and adaptive home heaters to autonomous vehicles. This research concerns studying and applying Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the supply chain and achieve more sustainable operations by ensuring accurate and real-time data monitoring. In this context, an experimental device is developed to read the values of selected physical quantities from the wine supply chain environment through appropriate sensors. The values are then sent to an IoT platform to facilitate the remote monitoring of the above physical quantities and extract valuable insights from the large volume of data generated.

The proposed model strives to leverage knowledge-based distinctive core competencies (DCCs) to improve customer satisfaction and achieve SCA. An exploratory research design has been adopted. The study undertook a systematic literature review approach with 36 articles or books published between 1970 and 2020 to construct the strategic planning model. The paper presents an integrated multi-dimensional model for SCM, including value chain activities, competitiveness strategies, business process re-engineering (BPR), and SCA. The practical result of the article is to develop a theoretical strategic planning model for SCM as a holistic framework for using the company’s DCCs and creating an SCA in a highly competitive and dynamic business environment. The proposed model comprehensively covers the supply chain (SC)’s competitive advantage strategy. For businesses that tend to adapt and triumph, the proposed model helps reduce order cycle times, reduce inventory levels, increase accuracy and efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer service and satisfaction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Like most companies, Bayer Crop Science is facing increasing volatility on both the supply and demand sides. Materials shortages, increasing costs, transportation roadblocks and demand fluctuations create constant challenges. And the seasonal nature of the company’s business, which is based largely on regional growing seasons, leaves little room for error. Bayer Crop Science’s global logistics team bears the brunt of continuing to deliver on customer promises, profitably, despite these constant exceptions to plan. To maximise service, resiliency, sustainability and financial results, Bayer Crop Science needed to optimise its global transportation and logistics processes. The company was seeking to increase visibility and responsiveness to disruptions, as well as establish standardised worldwide practices and shared value that would lead to more fact-based, profit- and service-driven decisions. This was impossible while 350 facilities, in more than 70 countries, were using disparate tools, outdated legacy systems and manual processes to manage a logistics network that had become incredibly complex. Several years ago, Bayer Crop Science embarked on a digital transformation that establishes a common platform — Blue Yonder’s transportation management and warehouse management solutions — as well as standardised processes and workflows, across the company’s sprawling logistics footprint. While the transformation at Bayer Crop Science is still under way, transportation and warehousing operations in 64 countries have been digitalised. This paper describes some early results, including a 3–5 per cent reduction in overall transportation spend, a 7 per cent increase in asset utilisation, decreased environmental impacts and a cultural change that is making Bayer Crop Science employees both happier and more productive.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid popularization of online shopping, more and more enterprises adopt dual-channel supply chain structures, and information sharing plays an important role in the implementation of dual-channel supply chain management. Most of the existing literature has investigated one-way information sharing from the retailer to the manufacturer, whereas few studies on two-way information sharing between the manufacturer and retailer in a dual-channel supply chain have been explored. A dual-channel supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, both of whom have private information about consumer preference and service cost was considered in this study. Game-theoretic models were developed to investigate the decision-making problem of dual-channel members in two information-sharing scenarios including non-information sharing and information sharing respectively. Furthermore, the impact of the manufacturer's information forecast capability on the sale price, service level, and profits were analyzed through numerical example. Results show that information sharing can increase the wholesale price, sale price, and online service level; furthermore, information sharing not always be beneficial for dual-channel supply chain members. When the information forecast capability of the manufacturer is relatively weak, information sharing can increase supply chain members' profits. On the contrary, information sharing may not always increase his profits. Additionally, the retailer cannot benefit from information sharing in any cases, which accounts for his weak willingness to share information with the manufacturer. This study provides a significant reference for decision-making.\nKeywords: dual-channel supply chain; information sharing; price decisions; service decisions\n</jats:p>",

Assuming that each intermediary incurs some costs for performing their function in the supply chain, it must charge a price or fee for the work they do.  These additional charges, when added to the manufacturer's sale price, can increase the price to the patient significantly.  These additional elements in the channel of distribution represent market evolution.  As the number of drug manufacturers has increased significantly and as the role of intermediaries has increased concerning the number of pharmaceutical insurance plans, the supply chain has become more complex and more expensive.  Given concerns over pharmaceutical pricing for individuals and chain pharmacies, hospitals and insurance plans, it would seem timely for concerted efforts to streamline the channels of distribution to reduce costs to patients.  Some entrepreneurial endeavours would seem to hold promise in this regard.  There will most likely be several developments shortly that strive to reduce supply chain costs and may be certain combinations of these efforts.</jats:p>",

Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing as the prevalence of pathologies associated with cerebrovascular disease rise, including chronic hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic stroke. The hippocampus is a bilateral deep brain structure that is central to learning, memory, and cognitive function and highly susceptible to hypoxic/ischemic injury. Compared with cortical brain regions such as the somatosensory cortex, less is known about the function of the hippocampal vasculature that is critical in maintaining neurocognitive health. This review focuses on the hippocampal vascular supply, presenting what is known about hippocampal hemodynamics and blood-brain barrier function during health and disease, and discusses evidence that supports its contribution to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Understanding vascular-mediated hippocampal injury that contributes to memory dysfunction during healthy aging and cerebrovascular disease is essential to develop effective treatments to slow cognitive decline. The hippocampus and its vasculature may represent one such therapeutic target to mitigate the dementia epidemic.</jats:p>",

The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 also makes us more deeply aware that all sectors of the world must strengthen their attention to the environment, society, and governance (ESG) to promote global sustainable development, The renewal of the green supply chain finance system assisted by science and technology will be a hot topic for new research or breakthrough for future. The author studied the application of green supply chain finance based on the method of combining blockchain and AI technology and proposed the idea of a green supply chain finance platform driven by blockchain technology and the Wide&amp;Deep algorithm. It is found that the combination of blockchain technology and the WIDE&amp;DEEP algorithm can better solve the lack of unified green standards and effective information disclosure and information sharing mechanisms in green supply chain finance. Small and medium-sized institutions financing difficulties, financing expensive, high cost, low turnover, ecological supply chain information flow, business flow, logistics, capital, etc in the \"four circulations\" a series of problems such as poor communication problems, blockchain algorithm combined with technology and AI can provide a decent future for supply chain finance development direction, how to practice is the direction of future research to its success.</jats:p>"

In an experiment in one of the needles, the air volume flow rate was constant and in the neighbouring needle, it was changed. Despite setting the constant air flow rate supply to the needle, the frequency of bubble departures fluctuated, with a change in the flow rate in the neighbouring needle. In order to identify the occurrence of hydrodynamic interaction the methods of nonlinear data analysis - wavelet analysis and FFT were used. It can be concluded that the synchronised or alternative bubble departures from twin neighbouring needles, (occurring due to hydrodynamic interaction) are possible by modifying the bubble waiting time. Moreover modification of hydrodynamic interaction between bubble – bubble actually bubble – gas supply system can be used to control the bubble departure process.</jats:p>"

It has a much more complex arterial supply than previously reported, moreover, this arterial pattern has been hypothesized to lead to avascular necrosis after fracturesScaphoid blood supply has long been documented as scarce; it arises from the radial artery giving palmar and dorsal branches. There is high-grade evidence reporting two main arteries entering from the distal half of the scaphoid and middle to lower-grade evidence reporting several arteries scattered over the entire scaphoid and anastomosis of the radial artery with intercarpal arteries. Dorsal arteries are slightly larger in diameter and many more than volar ones. The scaphoid shape is associated with variations in arterial supply patterns. Scaphoid surgery preserving vascular supply is the gold standard. Scaphoid blood supply is not as poor as previously documented, as current evidence supports even proximal pole vascularization. We recommend surgery to preserve the blood supply and foster research in this area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global natural gas trade volume amounted to 1300 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 and it is expected to increase regarding the growing concern for low-carbon emission fuel. However, natural gas requires special infrastructure in the transportation stage such as natural gas pipelines or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants and tankers. We use a Network Game theory where natural gas supply networks are treated as edges and adopt the Link-based Flexible Network Allocation Rule (LBFN) as a solution concept that can replace the Shapley Value. Our study reveals that Russia’s efforts to build diversionary routes effectively decrease the relative bargaining power of its traditional transit countries and increase its relative bargaining power. If there had been no Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Nord Stream-2 would have come online as planned and Russia would have enjoyed high relative bargaining power as a dominant gas supplier. This is one of the underlying reasons why several European countries and the U.S. expressed strong opposition to the Nord Stream-2 project. However, if Russia cuts the gas supply to European countries as a result of recent events and the U.S. LNG penetrates into the European gas market, Russia will inevitably suffer from a huge decrease in its relative bargaining power.</jats:p>"

Market volatility has become a major pain point, with unforeseen costs and capacity constraints creating transportation network disruption. This challenge provides the opportunity to re-evaluate existing procurement processes and carrier partnerships. While the typical time to negotiate contracts is during the request for proposal (RFP), the annual event remains costly and inefficient, often administered via e-mail and Excel spreadsheets. With no sign of a slowdown in the demand for goods, there is increased pressure on shippers and carriers to transform their transportation practices to become more efficient. Breakthrough analysed their ecosystem of over 21 million annual shipments and over US$22bn in annual transportation spend to quantify the value of selecting carriers that match network priorities and growing volume with the optimal carriers. Breakthrough found that selecting carriers that match network priorities can result in 14 per cent cost savings. Growing volume with carriers throughout rate cycles can also add additional cost savings of 2.75 per cent or US$0.08 per mile lower than other carriers. Data-driven logistics sourcing strategies that allow transportation professionals to broaden their carrier networks and secure reliable capacity are discussed in this paper.</jats:p>"

The study found that the adoption of blockchain can be effective in increasing the benefits to supply chain members and systems. The adoption of blockchain increases the blockchain costs but decreases the financing costs for the supplier. The Shapley value of the cooperative game is used to distribute the benefits, allowing for Pareto improvements in the benefits to supply chain members.

In this scenario, optimal deficit irrigation (DI) is a potential option to sustain citrus production. To optimize the DI schedule in relation to yield, water productivity, fruit quality and production economics, water was applied at 30% of full irrigation (FI, 100% crop evapotranspiration), 50% of FI and 70% of FI and compared with FI in drip-irrigated citrus at Nagpur, India during 2008–2010. Fruit yield under 50% FI (11.48 t ha−1) was statistically at par with FI (13.14 t ha−1). However, a 50% reduction in water supply (1,343 m3 ha−1) resulted in a 75% improvement in water productivity in DI at 50% FI than FI (water productivity, 4.89 kg m−3). The fruit quality in DI at 50% FI (acidity, 0.83%; total soluble solids, 10.3 °Brix) was superior to FI (acidity, 0.85%; total soluble solids, 9.80 °Brix). The highest net profit (INR 94,300 ha−1) and net economic water productivity (70.19 INR m−3) were generated under DI at 50% FI.

First, this paper describes the concept and characteristics of BT and the motivation of FM of construction enterprises to use BT. Second, it analyses BT's three main application advantages in construction enterprise financing: reducing financial risks, improving the credit penetration of core enterprises, and reducing financing costs. Meanwhile, this paper summarizes the problems that should be paid attention to in implementing the current financial supply chain management strategy in enterprises. It provides a solid theoretical foundation for the research of FM transformation in construction enterprises. Finally, the overall design and functional analysis of the BT FM platform are carried out. The functions of the BT FM platform are divided into four modules: system management, credit management, contract management, and information management. Besides, their specific business processes are analysed. The research results show that BT is applicable in enterprises, and the value of each participant's financing platform can be clearly defined from the construction of BT‐based financing platform. The income quota of the owner's individual operation is 33%, and the income quota of the tripartite cooperation is also 33%, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the financial financing model of construction enterprises based on BT and the feasibility of its actual implementation in the future. In this paper, the related issues of financial supply chain management are systematically and comprehensively summarized, which has theoretical guiding significance for the research of FM transformation of construction enterprises based on BT.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present age is moving through Industry 4.0 with massive technological developments. Supply chains have become digital, keeping sync with consumer demands and preferences. The recent pandemic has reinforced the need of embracing digital technologies in managing supply chains effectively. Therefore, it is necessary that supply chains adopt 5G mobile technologies. In this regard, the present study aims to discern the critical issues for the successful adaptation of 5G technologies for supply chain management (SCM) in developing countries such as India. The success factors for the adaptation of 5G in Indian supply chains are derived from the discussions made in the related past work regarding the challenges of implementing 5G technology. Then, the listed factors are finalised through initial rounds of face-to-face discussions with a focus group of five experts. Then, a q-rung-orthopair-fuzzy (qROFS)-based rating scale is used to rate the success factors. A new qROF-weighted-neutrality-average (q-ROFWNA)-based full-consistency method (FUCOM) approach for multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems involving group decision making is utilised to find out the critical success factors. Based on the comparative analysis of 17 success factors (grouped into four main factors), the spectrum availability, awareness of technology and usage, the development of supporting technologies and smart cities, and skill development are found to be the top five critical factors for the successful adaptation and implementation of 5G technologies in SCM. We further carry out a sensitivity analysis and validation test and observe that our model provides a reliable and stable solution.</jats:p>"

It is an important number for sellers to have in mind when planning the sale of a property investment and buyer can based on it to make their decision in making purchases. Across the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable confirmed cases every month which might influence people’s decisions in changing locations and buying new houses, thus affected the variation of the monthly supply. This paper judges the negative impact of COVID-19 on the real estate industry in the United States by establishing the difference in DF value obtained by ARMA model, discusses the possible reasons for the fluctuation of new house supply in the United States, and puts forward some suggestions on how to deal with the crisis of the real estate industry in similar situations in the future, so as to avoid the economic downturn of real estate enterprises in similar situations and achieve the stability of the housing economy.

Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.&#x0D;\nFindings: The results show that food safety is important for the wellbeing and safety of hotel guests. Application of standard food safety systems, compliance to food safety system and implementation of food safety system impact the provision of safe food in hotels. From the study findings, it was concluded that application of standard Food safety systems, compliance to food safety system and implementation of food safety system impact the provision of safe food in hotels. Empirical findings revealed that mid- and low-tier hotels found the increases in commodity prices challenging and thus employed innovative methods to combat rising food costs. High-tier hotels were more concerned about satisfying customers' needs by maintaining high-quality food products and services.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The theory of change and Maslow hierarchy of hotel expectations theory may be used to anchor future studies in the tourism sector. The study results will also benefit other stakeholders such as the policy makers as well as researchers and scholars from different parts of the world. The top management hospitality in the country will also use the study findings to improve tourism performance in all their activities and programs. The study recommends that the adoption of effective social protection development policies in tourism will help to improve efficiency in their major operations and activities.</jats:p>"

This requires businessmen to quickly identify and solve related problems by carrying out structural reorganisation of their companies. As such, the main goal of the article is to research the problematic of the overproduction crisis, which is concluded by such objectives as crisis consequences for government and manufacturing organizations evaluation, and development of recommendations regarding the structural reorganization of organizations in the current conditions. The main research methods are graphical and tabular methods, as well as synthesis and analysis in combination in a complex approach, which allows to study crisis processes in order to optimise the company's activity through effective structural reorganisation. The main results of the research are the study of the concept of overproduction crisis and its problematic consequences for the country and the industry. The analysis of the influence of overproduction on the production and trade organisation and the development of proposals for the structural reorganisation of the company in crisis conditions. Organisational reconstruction in the modern environment was studied through the use of careful management, careful problem solving, visual management, quick configuration tool, autonomy, process balancing, careful quality assurance, careful human resource usage, careful supply chain management and production flexibility. Organisational restructuring can also be aimed at the implementation of digital technology, which can be categorised by the scenarios of forecasting, waste analysis and redistribution. Organisational restructuring in the modern environment has been studied through the use of careful management, careful problem solving, visual management, quick configuration tool, autonomy, process balancing, careful quality assurance, careful human resource usage, careful supply chain management, and production flexibility. In order to prevent the influence of crisis occurrence through changes in organisational structure, these procedures were proposed: assembly line load stabilisation, manufacturing analysis and 5S system. The results of this article and the conclusions based on them may be of practical value for students studying the peculiarities of effective financial management in the conditions of crisis, as well as for businessmen interested in maintaining their financial results, maximising profits, preventing crisis problems and optimising business activity through changes in the company structure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Smuggling of cocoa between Ghana and its neighbouring producing countries such as Cote d&amp;rsquo;Ivoire and Togo is a frequent occurrence often to the advantage of the country posting higher producer price. Ghana is a net loser with regards to the smuggling of cocoa given relatively lower real producer price compared to its counterparts in production. Additionally, the close geographical location of key producing regions to the border lends support to such activities. This study investigates the supply response of cocoa in producing region such as Western North, Western South and Brong-Ahafo with proximity to Cote d&amp;rsquo;Ivoire and Volta which shares borders with Togo using data from 1981 to 2017. The study further estimates the volume of cocoa crop lost from these regions to the country&amp;rsquo;s neighbours from 2000 to 2017. In the findings, relative price differences significantly impact the volumes of reported crop for the country with 1% higher price abroad driving down production volumes in Western North, South and Brong-Ahafo by 0.53%, 0.48%, and 0.11% respectively. In 2013/14 crop year the country lost averagely 25,494 MT and 21,883 MT due to smuggling out of Western North and South, moderating to 1,559 and 1,358 in 2016/17. The Volta region consistently records outflow in each crop year except for 1999/2000, with peak losses in 2010/11 of 2,160 MT moderating to 1,197 in 2016/17. Net gains into the country from cocoa smuggling spanning from 1999/2000 to 2016/17 is averagely 23,534 MT and 15,336MT into Western North and South. However cocoa smuggling for both Ghana and its neighbours is on the descent in recent years as price disparities reduce. Intensifying the collaboration between Ghana and its close counterparts to minimize real crop price differences will effectively curtail the menace and the negative fallout of this to each country.</jats:p>"

Through the analysis of seven wastes and fishbone diagrams, it is known that the biggest causes of waste are waiting for the arrival of workers, waiting for pilot/tug boats, waiting for trucks to arrive, and working on sacks that have fallen and torn. Meanwhile, the recommendations given are to coordinate and evaluate the performance of workers, increase the number of pilot/tug boats and trucks, and supervise the unloading process to minimize mistakes made by workers.

The interrelation between the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event and its impact on supply chains is examined. The principal research method is the use of risk maps on the basis of matrix modeling. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to reveal modern approaches towards the methodology of supply chain risk analysis at an enterprise. Results. It has been stated that key risk factors can be controlled through risk monitoring. External and internal risks that may cause shocks and disruptions to the supply chain have been analyzed. It has been determined that the presented approach to risk assessment complements the methodology for risk assessment and monitoring. It has been established that supply chains are exposed to elevated risk, which can be controlled through the use of the risk matrix procedures. It has been proven that the critical risk areas within supply chains are external crises, environmental uncertainty, supply chains relations and production, while the most hazardous risks within supply chains are associated with external conditions beyond the control of supply chain participants. Conclusions. The growing impact of risk on the activity of the enterprise emphasizes the importance of processes that are intended to reduce the probability of supply chain risk. The presented study attracts attention to the process of risk monitoring, which, if neglected, contributes to the catastrophic consequences of the supply chain collapse. Summing up, it is possible to draw the following conclusions. 1. Supply chains are being exposed to high risk, which can be controlled through risk matrix procedures. 2. The conducted analysis has demonstrated that the critical risk areas in supply chains are external crises, environmental uncertainty, supply chain relations and production. 3. The most hazardous risks in supply chains are associated with external conditions that are beyond the control of supply chain participants. 4. Awareness of a risk and the possibility of classifying it on a risk matrix is a considerable aid to a simpler threat assessment, which may prove useful in practice.</jats:p>"

Using a comprehensive end‐to‐end (i.e., waste generation to waste disposal) decision framework, this article analyzes key decisions of a waste management firm (WMF) focused on the proportions of dry (and wet) waste to recycle (and compost). This framework is applied to assess the impact of: (i) the preprocessing of generated waste at source (i.e., the “upstream factors”) and (ii) the market prices of recycled dry and composted wet wastes (i.e., the “downstream factors”) on WMF's decisions. One key insight is that the WMF will choose to process more waste when the market prices for processed wastes are high, and/or when more waste is preprocessed at source. Improvements in presorting can be more economical and offer a long‐term sustainable solution to efficient waste management. From a policy perspective, we observe that taxing a WMF for waste disposal could dissuade the WMF from participating in waste processing especially when its marginal processing costs are high. The decision framework and the corresponding model are calibrated to different world regions using secondary data on these regions, classified by their income levels. It is observed from our data analysis that uniform “one‐size‐fits‐all” policies are dominated by region‐specific tailored policies for efficient waste management. Hence, prescriptions should be carefully formulated based on the type of waste generated and the processing/disposal options available in a region. For example, composting more wet waste at source is a better choice in low‐, low‐middle‐, and middle‐high‐income regions, whereas this is not the case in high‐income regions. The proposed decision framework also provides an explanation of the negative impact on recycling initiatives at a local level stemming from decreasing recycled material prices. Given that this is the first study to characterize and analyze the waste management supply chain, the article also highlights some areas for future research.</jats:p>",

This study systematically reviews 102 high-quality peer-reviewed studies published before 2023 to assess the impact of ML and Blockchain in optimizing various aspects of supply chain networks. The findings indicate that ML-driven predictive analytics significantly improve demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and route planning, reducing operational costs and enhancing decision-making accuracy. Simultaneously, Blockchain technology ensures immutable record-keeping, automates contract execution through smart contracts, and mitigates fraud risks by enhancing supply chain transparency. The review highlights that the integration of ML and Blockchain provides greater advantages than their independent applications, with 71 studies confirming that AI-enhanced Blockchain frameworks improve supply chain resilience and logistics efficiency. Additionally, 48 studies demonstrate that ML-driven anomaly detection, when paired with Blockchain validation, reduces fraudulent transactions by 50%, enhancing trust and data integrity in freight operations. Furthermore, the findings suggest that 56 studies support the role of ML-Blockchain integration in sustainable logistics, with fuel consumption reductions of up to 25% and enhanced environmental compliance through Blockchain-enabled carbon footprint tracking. Despite these advantages, 31 studies report scalability challenges related to ML’s high computational demands, while 29 studies identify Blockchain’s transaction processing limitations as a barrier to large-scale implementation. These challenges necessitate further research into hybrid solutions and infrastructure optimization to fully realize the potential of ML and Blockchain in modern supply chain systems. This review provides comprehensive insights into how these technologies are transforming logistics and freight forwarding, offering valuable perspectives for researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners aiming to enhance global supply chain efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s era, humanity has been overwhelmed by technological revolutions that have changed and will continue to change how business operations are performed, directly or indirectly. At the same time, the processes within the supply chain are quite complex, and as technology and processes evolve, they become more and more challenging. Traceability has become a critical issue in the food industry to ensure safety, quality, and compliance with regulations. The adoption of blockchain technology in the food supply chain has gained significant attention as a potential solution to improve traceability. This paper presents the development of a distributed application for table olives’ traceability on the Ethereum network. The paper also presents a methodological framework, which can help anyone aiming to implement an Ethereum decentralized application and demonstrates the practical use of the developed application by a Greek table olives producer. The application significantly improved the producer’s product traceability by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for tracking and tracing the products in the supply chain. The app reduced the time, increased the accuracy and reliability of data, improved supply chain efficiency, and helped the producer comply with international regulations and standards.</jats:p>"

There is an interest in understanding the design, structure and performance of semi-autonomous teams in different markets and economic sectors. Thus, this work seeks to propose a theoretical model that correlates the main factors considered in semi-autonomous teams in the agricultural supply chain. In addition, we seek to know the indirect effect of these factors and their relevance. To this end, exploratory research in the field of sociotechnics is applied to identify the variables of the model and previous studies. Data collection is done by a survey in 4 countries of the agricultural market in Latin America and the model is validated from the modeling of structural equations with Smart PLS SEM. The results of the study indicate that the adoption of work autonomy does not have a direct effect caused by the management of human resources (HR) . Furthermore, the adoption of work autonomy is moderated by work remuneration. Finally, the indirect effect that HR management has on the adoption of semi-autonomous teams may be related to its own functioning in the organization. HR has an important influence on enterprise communication and conflict work.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology, as one of the most cutting-edge technologies, can promote transparency among members of the supply chain network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tries to develop a novel bi-objective optimization model to integrate the transparency resulting from the use of blockchain for designing a three-level supply chain network. The first objective function is to minimize total cost while the second objective function seeks to maximize transparency based on the application of blockchain technology. Moreover, it is worth noting that it is the first attempt to investigate the role of a blockchain model under stochastic conditions. The bi-objectiveness and stochastic nature of the proposed model are then treated using Fuzzy Goal Programming (FGP) and Chance-Constrained programming (CCP) approaches, respectively. To tackle the problem, an improved Branch and Efficiency (B&amp;E) algorithm is developed by incorporating transparency along with cost and service. The impacts of blockchain exclusively through transparency (Case 1) or through transparency, cost, and benefits (Case 2) in Supply Chain Design (SCD) are compared. The results demonstrated that the first case has less computational complexity and better scalability, while the second case has more transparency, less congestion, and more security. As one of the main implications, supply chain managers who are focused on cost minimization as well as transparency maximization are advised to take into account the trade-off between featuring costs and benefits of blockchain technology.</jats:p>"

These challenges pose significant risks to the livelihoods, infrastructure, and well-being of coastal communities, particularly in developing regions where resources for adaptation are limited. This study investigates the effectiveness of community-based adaptation (CBA) strategies in enhancing resilience in coastal areas by involving local populations in the design and implementation of adaptation efforts. The problem statement focuses on the urgent need for sustainable and scalable adaptation solutions that can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change while empowering communities to take ownership of these efforts. Traditional top-down approaches have often proven insufficient in addressing the unique socio-cultural and environmental dynamics of coastal regions. The objectives of this study are threefold: to identify and analyze the key CBA strategies employed in coastal regions, assess their effectiveness in reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience, and explore the role of local knowledge, resources, and governance in driving successful adaptation initiatives. The results demonstrate significant improvements in several key parameters. Income stability increased by 25%, with 35% of households adopting climate-resilient livelihoods. Disaster-related economic losses were reduced by 45%, and 80% of key infrastructure was fortified against climate threats. The study also found a 28% reduction in climate-related illnesses, a 90% increase in access to clean water, and a restoration of 600 hectares of ecosystems, leading to a 20% increase in biodiversity. Moreover, 75% of the population actively participated in decision-making, and 65% of adaptation projects integrated traditional knowledge. These findings suggest that CBA strategies not only effectively reduce the immediate risks posed by climate change but also foster long-term resilience by empowering local communities to lead the adaptation process. The study underscores the importance of scaling these initiatives to enhance coastal resilience globally.</jats:p>"

This paper describes a machine learning technique that was used to conduct a research study on the harmonic analysis of railway power stations. The research was an investigation of a time series whose values represented the total harmonic distortion (THD) for the electric current. This study was based on information collected at a railway power station. In an electrified substation, measurements of currents and voltages were made during a certain interval of time. From electric current values, the THD was calculated using a fast Fourier transform analysis (FFT) and the results were used to train an adaptive ANN—GMDH (artificial neural network–group method of data handling) algorithm. Following the training, a prediction model was created, the performance of which was investigated in this study. The model was based on the ANN—GMDH method and was developed for the prediction of the THD. The performance of this model was studied based on its parameters. The model’s performance was evaluated using the regression coefficient (R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The model’s performance was very good, with an RMSE (root-mean-square error) value of less than 0.01 and a regression coefficient value higher than 0.99. Another conclusion from our research was that the model also performed very well in terms of the training time (calculation speed).</jats:p>"

A systematic random sampling technique was adopted to gather relevant information from two hundred and ten households on their sources of water supply, frequency of trips to water collection points and their perception of quality of domestic water available to them. Relevant information was obtained from archival materials. Tables were employed to analyse the socio-economic composition of the respondents and the sources of water supply in their neighbourhoods. Likerts scale model was used to evaluate the perception of satisfaction on quality and adequacy of domestic water supply in the city. Analysis of Variance was also used to determine the level of satisfaction on the quantity and quality of domestic water supply across various residential areas in Lokoja. Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used to determine the strength of the relationship between domestic water supply on the one hand and income level, education profile and residential characteristics of households on the other hand. Findings reveal that more than 70% of households residing at Zango Daji and Army Barracks areas rely on borehole for their regular water supply. Well water and water from vendors are the principal sources of water for residents of Felele area and these constituted 48.1% and 25.9% respectively. Approximately 100%, 57.7% and 34.6% of urban households that reside at Old Poly Quarters, Lokongoma Phase 1 &amp; 11 and Kabawa areas respectively indicated that they rely on irregular and unpredictable public tap water supply provided by the Kogi State Water Management Board.Urban households perceived and rated the availability and quality of domestic water supply as dissatisfied. There was a positive correlation between sources of domestic  water supply and urban households income level as well as education profile, which was statistically significant (r = .196, n = 189, p = .01) and  (r = .282, n = 189, p = .01). The study recommends the provision of potable water to urban households in order to reduce the vulnerability of urban residents to water borne diseases in Lokoja and environs.</jats:p>"

Based on theoretical and empirical analysis, investor confidence is affected by managerial compensation, managerial shareholding ratio, independent director ratio and board size. Moreover, in the sample of A-share listed companies in China stock market in 2017-2021, corporate governance level is constructed as a synthetical indicator by using PCA to investigate its impact on investor confidence under the supply chain finance model.

Using machine learning algorithm, especially with Bayesian networks, to predict risk in supply chain management network can help to control and monitor the supply chain process in particular in the second step of identification. If the supply chain risk is effectively evaluated, it can support supply chain partners to assess, identify, monitor, and mitigate risks in order to increase robustness and resilience, reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, ensuring continuity and profitability.

Earlier soft sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets were combined to form intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSS) which are rich potentials for solving decision-making problems. Dan et al.

In this paper, using the concept of soft sets over the intuitionistic type-2 fuzzy sets, we define a new hybrid set and named it as Intuitionistic type-2 fuzzy soft sets (IT2FSS). After defining the set we present the set-theoretic operations such as complement, union, intersection over these sets and mention some algebraic properties with examples of these sets. After that, we define the level sets over IT2FSS and represent two decision-making algorithms based on level sets. We put forth definitions for score and accuracy functions and rules for the comparison of a group of IT2FSS. We carry out a IT2FSS based investigation to find out the key success factors for effective Humanitarian Supply Chain Management (HSCM) in emergency relief operations. We observe that supply chain financing, collaboration and coordination, and public governance are the three critical factors as opined by the experts for effective HSCM.</jats:p>"

Despite increasing importance, limited studies have explored the underlying factors (i.e., efficiency, flexibility, integration, and risk management) impacting the supply chain operations of national defense companies. Hence, this study aims at exploring the relational impact of supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and organizational performance by hypothesizing a moderated-mediation model involving operational efficiency, flexibility, and supply chain integration (SCI). Using the information processing theory, the survey-based data of 2017 respondents was collected from defense-related national institutions in Pakistan. Empirical findings based on structural equation modeling validated a significant positive SCRM è Organizational Performance relationship. According to the findings, supply chain risk management is strongly connected to operational efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, the study also substantiates the mediating effects of operational performance (i.e., efficiency and flexibility), along with the significant moderation by supply chain integration in the relationship between risk management and operational efficiency. However, the results do not support the role of operational flexibility in mediating the relationship between SCRM and OP. Furthermore, the role of SCI as a moderator between SCRM è operational flexibility was not established. This research is the first to introduce an empirically validated framework of supply chain performance in the defense industry, besides conceptualizing the direct and indirect roles of SCRM, efficiency, flexibility, and integration. This study also navigates some of the critical issues and obstacles faced by the national defense industry and highlights a holistic model that facilitates a multistage supply chain decision-making.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Consequently, reducing wasted space in cartons can result in significant savings in shipping costs as well as corrugated material and dunnage costs. Most companies maintain a relatively small number of carton sizes, so the opportunity to select a carton to contain order items with a small amount of empty space is limited. Furthermore, choosing the best carton to pack items, either before or after they have been picked, is difficult for packers using the ‘eyeball’ method of selection and often requires repacking, which further adds to costs. Maintaining a large number of different carton sizes (eg 40+) increases the likelihood that a carton selected for packing will have minimal wasted space. This paper describes the challenges and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions developed to enable the determination of which carton sizes to maintain in a large set of different carton sizes, automatically calculate the best carton(s) for packing an order from the large set, quickly identify the best carton for a packer, efficiently replenish consumed cartons from a carton supply area, and simplify vendor managed inventory (VMI) by a carton supplier to enable frequent delivery of replenishment cartons.</jats:p>"

Environmental education contributes to the development of remanufacturing by increasing the number of consumers willing to purchase remanufactured products (RPs). However, the incumbent manufacturer usually has limited remanufacturing capability together with yield uncertainty, making a third-party remanufacturer (3PR) an alternate channel choice. This study develops an analytical model to examine the effects of environmental education on a retailer’s choice of remanufacturing channels under in-store competition. Results show that consumer environmental education has the potential to significantly improve the retailer and supply chain profits, and temperate environmental education is always desirable for 3PR. The introduction of 3PR benefits the consumer when the retailer’s remanufacturing technology level is low. Furthermore, when the environmental impact of defective RPs is relatively high, and environmental education is temperate, selecting a 3PR will enhance environmental sustainability. This study also shows that 3PR can help achieve a win–win situation when environmental education and consumer acceptance of RPs are both in a certain range.</jats:p>"

However, the optimum utilization of limited charging resources of an FCS while assuring a reliable charging process for plugged-in EVs under random failures of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is a real challenge for the FCS controller. When the FCS admits UEVs in addition to SEVs, assuring a satisfactory quality of service to both EV user categories is also dispensable. Therefore, we analyze the performance of reservation of off-board mobile chargers (MOBCs) to enhance the charging reliability of EV users while achieving high charging resource utilization. This work proposes resource allocation and charging coordination strategies for an FCS where MOBCs are used to enhance the charging reliability of both SEVs and UEVs. Moreover, the proposed dynamic charging resource coordination strategies are analyzed with a continuous time Markov-chain (CTMC). The presented results from the CTMC model demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform the EV charging process of the FCS in terms of high resource utilization and reliability while guaranteeing a satisfactory quality of service to EV users.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research background: Endogenous money creation is an inherent feature of today?s economies and widely accepted phenomenon. As the various theories of money rely on the money quantity equation, most empirical research is heading towards the analysis of the two-way relationship between the quantity of money and nominal GDP. In today's world, with the extraordinary development of the financial sector, money is used not only for transactions in the real economy, but increasingly also for purchasing financial assets. This observation was absorbed by Werner in the quantity theory of disaggregated credit.\nPurpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to join the debate on endogenous character of money supply by tasting a disaggregated equation of money. It assumes that the domestic money supply is positively determined not only by growth in GDP-based transactions but also by growth in non-GDP-based transactions (financial transactions). Additionally, it is assumed that in the age of globalization it can be also positively influenced by the global liquidity. \nMethods:  Testing of the above-mentioned hypotheses takes place with the use of panel unit roots tests, panel Granger causality test and panel estimations (OLS, models with fixed/random effects, GMM). In the study, annual data from 2002 to 2018 for OECD countries were chosen for statistical research.\nFindings &amp; value added: The article confirms the hypothesis that real and financial economic activity together with global liquidity positively influence domestic credit and thus money supply. As the amount of money in an economy is driven not only by the real economy but also by the financial economy, prudential regulations that restrict leverage (and thus control the amount of credit) and limit risk-taking during price bubbles periods should be therefore considered. In the research, the reaction of domestic money supply to the changes in US money supply is positive. It confirms the importance of spill-over effect of expansionary policy in major economies to other economies.</jats:p>"

Secondly, the \"As is\" scenario analysis and a screening process are performed to extract significant input parameters as well as sensitive outputs of the model. The final step optimizes the performance of PSC. The proposed approach validity is appraised by being applied to the PSC of a leading pharmaceutical company in Jordan.

This study addresses two literature gaps by examining supplier collaboration's effect on supply chain flexibility, visibility, and velocity in an African business environment and assessing the relevance of company size to this relationship. This study used a descriptive design. The population and sample were 1332 and 264 respectively. 219 questionnaire copies informed the analysis and it was performed using percentages and a structural equation model. The study reveals that resource sharing is the most effective strategy for improving supply chain resilience and collaboration practices are most effective for supply chain flexibility. Organisations pursuing supply chain resilience can implement resource-sharing and information-sharing strategies to yield resilience. Additionally, managers must note that supplier collaboration may not yield similar results across all resilience performance measurements. Medium-scale firms must focus on information sharing to improve supply chain flexibility.</jats:p>"

There has been a so-called ‘shortening’ of the supply chain. The paper addressed the problem of using digital tools in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The study aims to examine the main digital tools used by local businesses and evaluate the prospects for logistics management using new technology. The hypothesis is that SMEs that do not use digital tools in supply chain management are also characterized by the poor quality of management. A survey was conducted to identify the actual supply chain management practices during the COVID-19-induced crisis in the Russian Federation, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the Republic of Kazakhstan and discover common trends and differences in these countries. A set of recommendations for implementing best global practices in these countries was suggested. The study found that poor supply chain management correlates with a lack of digital tools application. The studied enterprises were divided into five groups based on the digital tools level and provided tailored recommendations to improve the integration of such tools.</jats:p>"

This article maps and analyzes the tomato value chain in Anis District . Primary data was collected through a survey method adopting a multistage random sampling technique. The value chain highlighted the involvement of various actors, who directly or indirectly participated in the value chain. The different actors identified in the study area were input suppliers, farmers, traders, wholesalers, retailers and finally consumersThe result revealed that the main actors in the value chain are input suppliers, tomato producers, tomato pickers, small and large traders, processors and consumers. The market share of the producers shows that the producers get the largest share, which is 1350 YER. The main problems facing the tomato value chain are found to be low prices, high perishable nature, lack of access to credit, inadequate storage and processing facilities, lack of market information, and lack of financing for cultivation. While farmers rated low price as the most worrisome constraint, poor transportation facilities for the region producing tomatoes were rated as the most pressing constraint for value chain players.</jats:p>",

In this solution, Predictive Analytics model was developed based on Algorithms using field sensor data, and well failure history to predict ESP well failure probability. Due to the limited available ESP real time data, it would be a challenge to have an accurate model. The downhole and temperature data is not available in these ESP wells. Hence, we have adopted unsupervised classification approach combined with statistical calculations such as MTBF based on failure history. The solution provides a probability of ESP failures based on the anomalies (anomaly severity) detected from unsupervised machine learning model (individual cluster based), MTBF &amp; number of starts. The probability is normalized based weight-based approach.

Hence, the United Nations (UN) adopted the sustainability 2030 agenda with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to pursue economic, environmental, and social objectives. One of the most prominent concepts to achieve sustainability is circular economy supply chain (CESC). The basic idea of CESC is a system that aims to eliminate waste and preserves natural resources by keeping materials in use and a regenerative natural system. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the connection between CESC and SDGs as well as the opportunities for research in the future. A systematic literature review on the CESC for SDGs is carried out. There is a significant increase in studies associated with the implementation of CESC to achieve SDGs. The results show that CESC contributes significantly to SDG 2, SDG 8, and SDG 12. Another finding is that technologies could assist CESC practices. CESC implementation for achieving SDGs is not only for big enterprises but also for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Discussions related to social aspects are less often carried out than from economic and environmental aspects. Future opportunities have been identified for four industrial sectors: manufacturing, agriculture, waste management, and natural resources.</jats:p>"

Hydrogen rises in the world energy scenario as an important non‐carbon‐based energy able to replace fossil fuels. For this reason, the rapid development of hydrogen‐related technology has been seen in recent years. This review paper covers hydrogen energy systems from fossil fuel‐based hydrogen production, biomass and power from renewable energy sources, to hydrogen storage in compressed gases, liquefied and solid materials, and hydrogen‐based power generation technology. It represents a quiet complete set of references that may be effective in increasing the prospects of hydrogen as a fuel in the coming years. The main conclusions drawn are that natural gas and coal supply nearly all of the current hydrogen. The commercially available technologies for hydrogen production are steam methane reforming, partial oxidation, and alkaline electrolysis. The most economical methods for hydrogen production are partial oxidation, steam methane reforming, coal gasification, and biomass gasification. Metallic cylindrical reservoirs are the most promising alternative to underground storage of compressed hydrogen at large scales. Some metal compounds and composites can store a significant amount of hydrogen while maintaining reasonable adsorption and desorption kinetics. The transportation sector is likely to see widespread use of hydrogen in the future, helping to reduce pollution. Vehicles can be powered by fuel cells, which are much more efficient than internal combustion engines. There are still several obstacles in the way of widespread hydrogen utilization. The first one is that the cost of producing hydrogen from low‐carbon sources is elevated. As the cost of renewable energy declines and hydrogen production is scaled up, it is anticipated that the hydrogen production costs would decrease over the next years. Innovative technologies are expected to increase the interest on thermochemical hydrogen production to massively substitute electrochemical technologies since they are theoretically cost‐effective. More research is needed to fix concerns with some of the thermochemical cycles in order to rise its maturity. Increasing the chemical reaction conversion ratios, which can be resolved utilizing nonequilibrium reactions, is one of them. The transportation sector is likely to see extensive use of hydrogen in the future, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The power required by vehicles may be supplied by fuel cells, which are more efficient than internal combustion engines.</jats:p>",

In particular, the following 11 technologies were considered: 3D printing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, computing, digital applications, geospatial technologies, Internet of Things, immersive environments, open and crowd-based platforms, proximity technologies and robotics. For the purpose of this research, 5011 peer-reviewed scientific articles were analysed and a comprehensive overview of the use of digital technologies in SCM to favour sustainable emerging practices was proposed. Therefore, four indices that measure the environmental, social, economic and total 3BL sustainability of each technology were used to assess sustainable emerging practices. This study could be useful for both academics and practitioners. For the former, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the application of digital technologies in sustainable emerging practices for SCM.

In this study, we asked whether ameliorating mitochondrial functions in cancer cells might limit their proliferative capacity. Specifically, we increased mitochondrial metabolism in a murine cellular model of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer by ectopically expressing the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. As predicted, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed an increased level of mitochondrial metabolism and reduced proliferative capacity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, compared with controls. In contrast, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α formed larger tumors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These tumors exhibited increased concentrations of glucose and the angiogenic factor VEGF as well as higher expression of ErbB2/Neu compared with controls. We discovered that ErbB2/Neu levels were sensitive to nutrient availability, such that reduced glucose concentrations resulted in diminished ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Therefore, our data indicate that PGC-1α prevents the nutrient-mediated downregulation of ErbB2/Neu in tumors by increasing glucose supply. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the regulation of ErbB2/Neu levels by glucose was mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). Incubation of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer cells in limited glucose concentrations or with drugs that activate the UPR led to significant reductions in ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Also, ErbB2/Neu–induced tumors ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed lowered UPR activation compared with controls. Together, our findings uncover an unexpected link between PGC-1α–mediated nutrient availability, UPR, and ErbB2/Neu levels. &lt;i&gt;Cancer Res; 72(6); 1538–46. ©2012 AACR&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

We study one potential practice—suppliers aligning their performance measurement systems with their largest customer’s performance priorities. Using survey data collected from face-to-face interviews with executives from over 1,000 electronic components suppliers, we find that suppliers with greater customer-supplier information asymmetry and higher partner interdependence have performance measurement systems that align more with their largest customer’s performance priorities. These results are particularly apparent when the exchange involves complex components and when the largest customer represents a greater proportion of supplier sales, suggesting that performance measurement system alignment is of greater value in such situations. We conclude that the performance priorities of large customers play a role in shaping suppliers’ management control systems.</jats:p>",

Vegetables, fruits, fish, milk lose nutrients during logistics if it is not properly monitored. Real-time tracking and monitoring, large data handling and secure business transactions are key to the effective operation of supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the need for handling unforeseen situations in various sectors. Limitations to logistic operations, inaccessible warehouses, shutdown of consumer outlets for an unexpected duration, have affected the supply chain drastically. This has laid emphasis on the need for technology-based solutions that can monitor, control and make quick decisions, that can reduce losses. With this scenario as a background, a system architecture has been proposed to detect the nutrient value of food by periodically monitoring temperature and humidity in real-time and alerting the cold chain entities in cold chain environments. This architecture is proposed as an integration of Internet of Things (IoT) with cloud-based storage, to provide real-time data collection at the end-user, seamless storage and computation in the cloud and secure transactions at the business layer. An experimental setup of the system architecture has been configured and the implementation has been tested at a preliminary level. The performance of the application is analyzed and the proposed web application is efficient for large scale supply chain applications, provided scaling of hardware resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Improving traceability in food supply chains has been a big part of ongoing effort to reduce contamination risks and food waste. Recent technology advancement such as blockchain technology has propelled innovative retailers to promote food traceability system adoption in their supply chains. We develop a three-tier supply chain model with multiple upstream (tier 2) suppliers to investigate how traceability technology adoption affects incentives of supply chain members and whether and how its anticipated benefits can be realized. We find that full traceability brings direct revenue benefit to every supply chain member by saving uncontaminated food from disposal (pure traceability effect) but also leaves each tier of the supply chain vulnerable to its immediate downstream buyer’s exploitation through strategically lowering the purchasing price (strategic pricing effect). The interplay of the two effects may result in some of the supply chain members (even the retailer) being worse off with traceability adoption and the system being exposed to higher contamination risk; the latter is because of the weakened upstream supplier’s incentive to exert contamination risk-reduction effort. Moreover, we find that the supply chain network structure also influences the benefit distribution of traceability adoption: The retailer always benefits from traceability adoption in network structures where the tier 1 supplier’s strategic pricing power is eliminated or weakened; all supply chain members benefit from traceability adoption in a network with a large number of tier 2 suppliers. Finally, we show that alternative risk-mitigation schemes such as tier 2 coordination can diminish the value of traceability adoption, and partial traceability enabled by tier 1 product inspection can be more beneficial to the retailer than full traceability. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4440 . </jats:p>",

As a knowledge-intensive industry, emerging technology industry is characterized by high technical complexity, high R&amp;D uncertainty, high innovation cost, and long R&amp;D cycle. Therefore, enterprises need to transfer and flow knowledge through strategic alliance, carry out complementary R&amp;D and resource complementing, constantly absorb new knowledge and high-quality resources, and rationally allocate resources. At the same time, in the face of emerging technologies, the core technologies, as the core elements of the production chain of emerging technologies, are often mastered by the core technology suppliers, which requires the effective collaboration of supply chain enterprises, the use of group knowledge to break through the bottleneck of technology research and development and marketization, reduce the uncertainty of research and development, and achieve the strategic goal of mutual benefit and win-win.</jats:p>"

Based on the influence of the government's carbon tax on the cold chain logistics service supply chain, this paper analyzes the influence of different government subsidy policies on the carbon emission reduction decisions of cold chain logistics service providers (CCLSP), logistics information integrators (LSI) and the supply chain as a whole under the two scenarios of joint emission reduction and independent emission reduction. The effects of different subsidy methods and subsidy rates on carbon emission reduction, wholesale price, retail price and profit of CCLSP and LSI were explored, and the results were analyzed by numerical simulation. The results show that: in the case of joint emission reduction, emission reduction subsidy has a more positive impact on supply chain emission reduction and profit. In the case of independent emission reduction, both subsidy methods have a positive impact on the wholesale price, retail price and the profit of CCLSP and LSI. Which method is more effective needs to be selected according to the size of subsidy rate. To a certain extent, this paper provides opinions for the government to formulate a scientific and reasonable subsidy policy, which can provide a basis for CCLSP to reduce carbon emissions for inquiries.</jats:p>"

In this study, we asked whether ameliorating mitochondrial functions in cancer cells might limit their proliferative capacity. Specifically, we increased mitochondrial metabolism in a murine cellular model of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer by ectopically expressing the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. As predicted, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed an increased level of mitochondrial metabolism and reduced proliferative capacity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, compared with controls. In contrast, ErbB2/Neu cells ectopically expressing PGC-1α formed larger tumors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These tumors exhibited increased concentrations of glucose and the angiogenic factor VEGF as well as higher expression of ErbB2/Neu compared with controls. We discovered that ErbB2/Neu levels were sensitive to nutrient availability, such that reduced glucose concentrations resulted in diminished ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Therefore, our data indicate that PGC-1α prevents the nutrient-mediated downregulation of ErbB2/Neu in tumors by increasing glucose supply. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the regulation of ErbB2/Neu levels by glucose was mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). Incubation of ErbB2/Neu–induced breast cancer cells in limited glucose concentrations or with drugs that activate the UPR led to significant reductions in ErbB2/Neu protein levels. Also, ErbB2/Neu–induced tumors ectopically expressing PGC-1α displayed lowered UPR activation compared with controls. Together, our findings uncover an unexpected link between PGC-1α–mediated nutrient availability, UPR, and ErbB2/Neu levels. &lt;i&gt;Cancer Res; 72(6); 1538–46. ©2012 AACR&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

To fully understand the role of the supply chain relationship, it is necessary to comprehensively assess different characteristics of supply chain partnership in achieving sustainability goals. This study explores the implication of concentrated supply-chain partnership on loan features. Using a sample of Chinese-listed firms, we find that concentrated customer or supplier bases positively influence loan features, including loan size, loan maturity, and loan cost. We propose that concentrated customer and supplier bases influence the loan features through different mediators. Through mediating analysis, concentrated customer bases affect loan features through better corporate governance and lower operational risk, and concentrated supplier bases through lower operational cost and longer accounts payable cycle. The benefit of a concentrated chain partnership is more pronounced when customers or suppliers have a greater certification role, less uncertainty, and stronger geographical advantage. The results are robust to instrumental variable analysis, propensity-matched analysis, and alternative measures of chain partnership concentration. Findings in this study have important implications for understanding the sustainable supply-chain partnership management and loan decisions of banks in an emerging market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An increasingly environmentally conscious global economy is placing new demands on supply chain engineering, with a focus on sustainable approaches to modelling transport chain. In addition to the price and time efficiencies that characterize agile and lean supply chains, strategies for low-carbon and energy-efficient external transport must also be incorporated. This research therefore focuses on the challenges of organizing the supply of small overseas shipments to define how the relationship between land and sea transport in the selected intermodal chain affects environmental and energy performance. Understanding the input parameters and their impacts is a prerequisite for planning CO2, NOx, SO2 and NMHC emissions, as well as energy efficiency (EE) of overseas transportation. The number of individual transport legs and their characteristics are crucial parameters for sustainable transport chains. The applicability of the proposed research framework is carried out on the example of outbound supply chains of the southern part of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor using intermodal transport chains of small shipments via the ports of Koper and Genoa. The results of the case study show that an additional transport leg representing only 2 % longer land transport to the port of Genoa significantly affects the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain's compared to chains via the port of Koper. Moreover, other results also require special attention in supply chain modeling. The study enriches the field of supply chain engineering, as there is a lack of such studies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, first, and of the 2011 European financial crisis, and second, important changes have been brought to the European banking regulatory framework. Banking capital requirements (capital adequacy ratios) have been tightened on a global scale - through the “Basel III” agreements. New liquidity and leverage requirements have been imposed on all European banks, to strictly curtail risk and indebtedness, rightly identified as two significant causes of the 2008 financial crisis.\nAs for any case of regulatory tightening, these changes in banking regulation have been resented by the regulates as excessive constraints on banks’ business - in particular their lending business, especially small and medium-sized firms, which have little access to capital markets, because of significant information asymmetries characterizing credit relations.\nIn this paper, we aim to analyse the implications of these modifications in banking regulation which tend to favor banks organized in the form of joint stock companies to the detriment of banks organized as non-profit enterprises such as credit cooperatives.\nThus, the question we are addressing in this paper is the following: to what extent have recent European banking regulatory changes affected regional economic development? We will answer the question by analysing descriptive statistics concerning the structure of the banking system and credit supply in two countries, Italy and Germany. These two countries share important characteristics, which underline the relevance of a strong nexus between banking sector development and growth on a local scale. In particular, both countries are characterized by a high number of small and medium-sized firms and both have a fragmented banking system, with a sizeable number of not-for-profit and local banks.\nThe hypothesis formulated here is that changes in banking regulation can affect local and regional economic development through two channels: a first, direct channel, through which regulatory changes directly and negatively affect banks’ credit supply to small and medium-sized firms; and a second, indirect channel, through which regulatory changes induce changes in the structure of the local and regional banking system, which, in turn, affect (among other things) credit supply. A comparison between Italy and Germany will allow us to assess the relative strength of these two channels, identify those factors, which may allow us to explain outcomes differentials, and thus help identify policy implications.</jats:p>"

Most enterprises in green supply chains have promoted their green innovation and thus have improved their green performance by managing upstream and downstream enterprises. However, the green innovation capability might be also related to the financing efficiency and financing constraints of enterprises. To reveal the impact of financing efficiency and financing constraints on corporate green innovation, we conducted an empirical study. We considered a sample of 120 listed companies of the green supply chain from 2018 to 2020. The financing efficiency score was calculated using the input–output analysis method of data envelopment analysis, while the financing constraint score was measured using the financing constraints model. Further, multiple linear regression was used to estimate the regression coefficient and investigate the impacts of financing efficiency and financing constraints on corporate green innovation. The results show that a higher financing efficiency can promote green innovation and the financing constraints can limit the green innovation of green supply chain enterprises. Afterward, we provide a summary of innovation embedded in green supply chains.</jats:p>"

This research develops a clinical and non-clinical activity-based hospital energy model for electrical load prioritization during periods of constrained energy supply.Design/methodology/approach: Discrete event modelling is adopted for development of the hospital energy model (HEM). The basis of the HEM is business process mapping of the hospitals clinical and non-clinical activities. The model prioritizes the electrical load demand as Priority 1, 2 and 3; with Priority 1 activities essential to the survival of patients, Priority 2 activities are critical activities that are required after one to four hours, and Priority 3 activities can run for several hours without electricity.Findings: The model was applied to a small, medium, and large hospital. The results demonstrate that Priority 2 activities have the highest energy demand, followed by Priority 1 and Priority 3 activities, respectively for all hospital sizes. For the medium and large hospitals, the top three contributors to energy demand are lighting, HVAC, and patient services. For the small hospital, it is patient services, lighting, and HVAC, respectively.Research limitations/implications: The model is specific to hospitals but can be modified for other healthcare facilities.Practical implications: The resolution of the electrical energy demand down to the business activity level, enables hospitals to evaluate current practices for optimization. It facilitates multiple energy supply scenarios, enabling hospital management to conduct feasibility studies based on available power supply optionsSocial implications: Improved planning of capital expenditure and operational budgets and during constrained energy supply. This reduces risk to hospitals and ensures consistent quality of service.  Originality/value: Current hospital energy models are limited, especially for operations management under constrained energy supply. A simple to use model is proposed to assist in planning of activities based on available supply.</jats:p>"

It has been assisted by a lot of interest in a decentralized and distributed public ledger system integrated as a peer-to-peer network. A tamper-proof digital framework is created for sharing and storing data, where the linked block structure is utilized to verify and store the data. A trusted consensus method has been adopted to synchronize the changes in the original data. However, it is challenging for Ethereum to maintain security at all blockchain levels. As such, “public–private key cryptography” can be utilized to provide privacy over Ethereum networks. Several privacy issues make it difficult to use blockchain approaches over various applications. Another issue is that the existing blockchain systems operate poorly over large-scale data. Owing to these issues, a novel blockchain framework in the Ethereum network with soft computing is proposed. The major intent of the proposed technology is to preserve the data for transmission purposes. This new model is enhanced with the help of a new hybrid algorithm: Adaptive Border Collie Rain Optimization Algorithm (ABC-ROA). This hybrid algorithm generates the optimal key for data restoration and sanitization. Optimal key generation is followed by deriving the multi objective constraints. Here, some of the noteworthy objectives, such as information preservation (IP) rate, degree of modification (DM), false rule (FR) generation, and hiding failure (HF) rate are considered. Finally, the proposed method is successfully implemented, and its results are validated through various measures. The recommended module ensures a higher security level for data sharing.</jats:p>"

When the seller provides lots for sale to his buyer then, the buyer separates the whole lots with the help of inspection process into defective and perfect quality items. Further, in this scenario, the percentage of defective items present in the lot follows the S-shape learning curve and it is also considered that the demand rate is imprecise in nature. Here, the demand rate assumes a triangular fuzzy number due to the imprecise nature and it is the model assumption. Based on this assumption, we developed an inventory model with the effect of learning and trade credit strategy under a fuzzy environment for the buyer. The buyer’s total profit has been optimized concerning the order quantity in the fuzzy environment where order quantity has been assumed as a decision variable. The results of this model were verified with the help of numerical examples and sensitivity analysis. We compared the buyer’s total profit in a crisp and fuzzy environment and the buyer gained more profit in a fuzzy environment compared to the crisp environment. Moreover, we compared the results with and without the effect of learning and trade credit on the buyer’s ordering policy and obtained a positive effect on the ordering policy in the numerical section. We determined positive results from the sensitivity analysis, which proved that the trade credit policy will be beneficial for both partners of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Neither had fully recovered by the end of 2022. The drop in participation between December 2019 and December 2022 implies a loss of 3 million people from the labor force; the decline in average hours over the same period translates to the equivalent of 2.6 million fewer workers. Demographic and other trend factors that predated the pandemic explain most of the participation shortfall. Taken together, COVID-19-related health effects and the persistent (though shrinking) effects of the fear of contracting COVID-19 more than explain the rest. In contrast, pre-pandemic factors account for little of the shortfall in hours. COVID-19-related health effects account for perhaps 40 percent of that decline, but we are unable to explain the majority of the hours shortfall. We speculate that the lower level of hours in the post-pandemic period may reflect a shift in the desired balance between work and other aspects of workers' lives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditional thermal sterilization technology is easy to implement and safe, but it will destroy food nutrition and change food taste. Therefore, people began to turn their attention to non-thermal sterilization. High-voltage pulsed electric field sterilization technology is one of them; it has attracted much attention because of its high efficiency and little damage to food. Different types of loads will cause serious trailing of the pulse falling edge. In view of this situation, this paper proposes a new topology circuit that combines a solid-state switch with a half-bridge Marx generator. It can be used for high-voltage pulsed electric field sterilization. By improving the structure of the classical Marx circuit, the high-voltage pulse power supply of the new topology circuit has the characteristics of steep rising edge and short falling edge delay; does not require isolation inductance or isolation resistance, which solves the isolation problem between the DC charging power supply and the high-voltage terminal; and has a good voltage-clamping function and load adaptability. The working process of the topology circuit under resistive, capacitive and inductive loads and the voltage clamping effect when the solid-state switch does not work properly in the discharge process are analyzed in detail. The power supply is composed of an adjustable DC power supply, five-stage half-bridge Marx generator and control protection circuit. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is used as the controller to generate control signals, and optical fiber isolation is used to provide control signals for the main loop. The power supply can output a high-voltage square wave pulse with a voltage amplitude of 10 kV, maximum pulse number of 1000 per second, maximum pulse width of 20 μs, pulse rise time of smaller than 300 ns and short pulse drop time, and the repeated voltage amplitude, frequency and pulse width are adjustable, which can meet the requirements of a high-voltage pulse sterilization experiment.</jats:p>"

However, because the supply chain network of this kind of factory is very complex, coupled with the impact of customized scheduling and environmental constraints on the enterprise, the 3D printing distributed intelligent factory is facing the great challenge of realizing green supply chain networks and optimizing production scheduling at the same time, and thus a theoretical gap appears. This paper studies the hybrid optimization of green supply chain networks and scheduling of the distributed 3D printing intelligent factory. Firstly, according to the green supply chain network architecture of the distributed 3D printing intelligent factory, the cost minimization model is constructed. Secondly, mathematical software is used to solve the model, and the scheduling plan can be worked out. Finally, through the simulation analysis, it is concluded that the influencing factors such as demand, factory size and production capacity complicate the production distribution, and it can be observed that the carbon emission cost has gradually become the main factor affecting the total cost. The study has a reference value for the management decision making of the distributed 3D printing intelligent factory under the background of carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

To the best of our knowledge, amino acid-(AaB) and seaweed extract-(SeB) based biostimulant application, in ornamental transplant production, is still poorly studied. Therefore, the aim of this work was to assess the hypothesis that, under reduced nutrient supply, SeB and AaB applications, via foliar spray, can promote quality and sustainability in the production of high-quality ornamental seedlings with a 90-day growing cycle. The CRF incorporated into the peat-growing medium was Osmocote Exact Mini in formulation N:P:K = 15 + 9 + 11 (3 months). Six treatments were compared in two economically important potted (0.3 L in volume) ornamentals: Abelia × grandiflora and Lantana camara: T1 = conventional full CRF dose: 4 gL−1 per pot; T2 = limited CRF dose: 50% of T1; T3 = T2 + MC-Extra® [SeB 0.5 gL−1]; T4 = T2 + MC-Extra® [SeB 1.0 gL−1]; T5 = T2 + Megafol® [AaB 1.5 mL L−1]; T6 = T2 + Megafol® [AaB 2.5 mL L−1]. The research results showed that the application of 50% CRF plus biostimulant application resulted in plant performance greater than or equal to those raised under the conventional CRF full dose. In particular, S1 (Abelia × grandiflora ‘Edward Goucher’) and S2 (Lantana camara ‘Little Lucky’) behaved differently concerning the Megafol® dose under 50% CRF; compared to T1, in A. × grandiflora young transplants, T5 increased root morphological characteristics, as well as number of leaves, leaf area, and dry biomass accumulation; in L. camara, T6 achieved higher performance. The application of biostimulants under 50% CRF also improved, in both A. × grandiflora and L. camara, the physiological and agronomical Nitrogen Use Efficiency, compared to a full CRF dose. This study can support decision-making in terms of agronomic technique choices in line with the sustainable development of high-quality ornamental transplant production.</jats:p>"

Supply chain steps that precede refinement (material extraction and transport) contribute marginally to the environmental intensities of circular LIB supply chains (&lt;5%), but are more significant in conventional supply chains (31%). This analysis disaggregates conventional and circular steps based on material extraction, transport, and industrial refinement operations to provide important insights for advancing sustainable LIB supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Solar energy is the most available renewable resource and has great potential for various applications. Solar heat pumps are limited when operating alone due to weather and the unstable and intermittent nature of solar energy. The idea of combining a solar collector with an air-source heat pump (ASHP) is proposed to solve the problems. Taking solar energy and air energy as the heat source of the system can improve the heat collection efficiency and heating performance coefficient of the dual-supply heating system in realizing the efficient and stable operation of the whole unit. This study investigated the application of a solar–air-source heat pump (S/AS-HP) dual-supply heating system for a residential building in Lhasa and compared the winter work performance and economic benefits of three different heating forms: solar–air-source heat pump, air-source heat pump, and solar–electric auxiliary heating systems. A simulation model was established and analyzed using the measurement data. The results show that during the heating period, the temperature of the primary side water supply is stable at about 60 °C, and the total operating hours of the solar collector period accounted for 26.9% of the total hours, of which 23.16% were independent operating hours. The average COPsys of the solar–air-source heat pump is 4.21, which greatly improves work performance compared with other systems, and the annual cost is the lowest among the three forms for the same service life at 41,824.6 CNY, saving 9.6% and 35.1% per year compared with the air-source heat pump system and the solar–electric auxiliary heating system. Considering conditions in alpine regions, S/AS-HP systems are the optimal heating solution for single buildings.</jats:p>"

The National Center for Agricultural Support (KOWR) is an institution whose tasks include control of compliance with this law. Observation of transactions in agriculture allows us to believe that the established legal regulations do not solve the problem of abuse of market power by recipients and the institutional solution does not shape economic processes.Aim: The aim of this article is to present the activity of the KOWR as an institution controlling the observance of the obligation to conclude contracts for the supply of agricultural products and its evaluation.Results: Analysis of the KOWR’s reports showed that between February 2017 and March 2022, a total of 465 controls were carried out, resulting in fines of PLN 6 670 428,19 for purchases of agricultural products without a contract or due to a defective contract (about 93% of this amount was imposed on purchasers in 2021). The relatively small number of checks carried out is due to the lack of complete information on the actual purchaser of agricultural products who is obliged to purchase agricultural products under contract. In the analyzed period, inspections were carried out based on notifications of suspected breach of contractual obligations and at market entities designated for inspection (mainly milk purchasers). In conclusion information asymmetries on the market for agricultural products do not only occur in “classical” forms. Incomplete information may be available to both parties, but also from the body responsible for monitoring compliance with the rules governing the conclusion of such transactions.</jats:p>"

A total of 250 chemical companies filled out the questionnaire. The findings of this study revealed a partial mediation effect of environmental education for internal environmental management, supplier selection, and green packaging in sustainable supply chain performance in Pakistan. However, the supplier selection results are more critical compared to internal environment management and green packaging due to the higher beta value.

For this purpose, laboratory data published in this field were used. Parameters including convergence angle (with a positive sign) and divergence angle (with a negative sign), relative depth, and relative distance were used as input variables. The results showed that all the used models have appropriate performance. However, the best performance was related to the SVM model with statistical indicators R2 = 0.998 and RMSE = 0.008 in the testing stage. The use of the adaptive fuzzy approach in developing the GMDH model led to a remarkable increase in accuracy so that its statistical indicators in the testing stage reached R2 = 0.985 and RMSE = 0.203. It was found that the best performance of the activation and kernel functions in the development of the MLPNN model and the SVM is related to the sigmoid and radial tangent functions.</jats:p>",

The integral modeling is combined with a strategy of far tape approximation allowing to model a reduced set of consecutive tapes instead of the entire coil. It makes it possible to estimate the losses and the current density distribution in the coil, under different current supply. This leads to a considerable reduction in the computation time. The calculated AC losses show a good agreement with the Norris ellipse formula and measurements, highlighting the importance of considering the elliptical section of the superconductor in the tape, in the modeling. The developed modeling approach is in particular useful in the AC + DC mode, where Norris’s formulas cannot be used to determine the losses. Besides, some interesting phenomena have been observed, related to the current distribution in the tapes at different AC and DC current values.</jats:p>",

In this article, the transformation of conventional milk-run-based in-plant supply solutions into a cyber–physical milk-run supply is described, where the application of Industry 4.0 technologies makes it possible to make real-time decisions regarding scheduling, routing, and resource planning. After a literature review, this paper introduces the structure of Industry 4.0 technologies supported by milk-run-based in-plant supply. A mathematical model of milk-run processes is described including both scheduling and routing problems of in-plant supply. This mathematical model makes it possible to analyze the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the efficiency, performance, and flexibility of in-plant supply logistics. The scenarios’ analysis validates the mathematical model and shows that significant performance improvement and energy savings can be achieved using Industry 4.0 technologies. This performance improvement can lead to a more cost-efficient and sustainable in-plant supply solution, where not only logistics aspects but also energy efficiency and emissions can be taken into consideration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid growth of contemporary cities, building sustainable smart water supply systems is facing significant hurdles worldwide. Water quality has a significant impact on every aspect of our lives and is given priority in urban planning. Previous methods of regulating urban water quality have mostly relied on performing routine tests on several physical, chemical, and biological groupings of quality indicators. However, the inevitable lag time for biological indicators has raised the risk of illness, resulting in mishaps like widespread infections in many major cities. In this essay, we examine the issue, the technological difficulties, and the research questions. Next, we offer a potential remedy by creating a methodology for risk analysis specific to the urban water delivery system. To detect risks and detect changes in water quality, we need the indicator data we gathered from industrial activities.  We provide an Adaptive Frequency Analysis (Adp- FA) method to resolve the data using indicators' frequency  domain information for their internal linkages and individual prediction in order to produce results that are understandable. We also look into this method's scalability in the indicator, geographic, and time domains. We choose data sets of industrial quality for the application that was gathered as part of a Norwegian project from four separate urban water supply systems: Oslo, Bergen, Strmmen, and Lesund. Comparing the new method to the traditional Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest approach, we examine the proposed method's spectrogram, prediction accuracy, and time requirements. The outcomes demonstrate that our strategy performs better in most areas. Supporting early alerts for industrial water quality risks and additional decision support is possible.

Aiming at minimizing costs, the model combines available resources and technologies, adhering to techno-economic and environmental limits. On the demand side, the study uses time series analysis to forecast future electricity demand in Zambia. The supply-side energy model identifies the optimal combination of resources and technologies needed to satisfy exogenously specified electricity demand levels at the least cost. The baseline scenario results revealed that the power outages in Zambia, especially at peak times, have been attributed to reliance on imported fuel for power generation, the slow-paced integration of renewable resources, and not fully utilizing resource potential for the supply side. To overcome the power outages and meet the electricity demand in 2035, a comprehensive scenario analysis was conducted, including the main scenarios of 30% integration of renewable energy, no coal power generation, and low emission targets (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% reduction from the baseline). The expected CO2 reductions from the renewable energy scenario, no coal scenario, and 50% low emission target are estimated at 5222 kilotons in 2035, respectively.</jats:p>"

To separate the effect of (ostensibly higher) quality from that of quantity, another group of communities was provided with an additional midlevel provider. A third group of communities received no additional workers. No other inputs were provided. I find a measurable decrease in mortality in communities assigned a doctor but not in communities assigned an MLP, suggesting that quality in the health-care sector is a significant constraint.

According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), reducing annual GHG emissions by 45 percent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, will limit net global temperature increases to 1.5°C. Reduction in carbon‐based pollutants, largely in the forms of carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and methane (CH4), are the principal aims of GHG reduction efforts constituting the bulk of global “decarbonization” efforts. Upon taking office, President Biden's Administration (Administration) sought to cut US economy‐wide GHG emissions by between 50–52 percent by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. As of 2022, the United States has consistently been the second largest contributor of GHG emissions behind China since 2006, with these two nations combined contributing a total of 52 percent of global GHG emissions according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Battery storage has emerged as a critical technology coupled with renewable and distributed energy resources (DERs) in efforts to decarbonize both sectors.</jats:p>",

Since the list of proposals, measures and activities for solving supply chain problems caused by sanctions is constantly updated both due to the development of experience in solving problems, and due to the increase in the number of problems in connection with the adoption of new packages of sanctions, it is necessary to periodically research and tune the criteria for assessing the effectiveness of supply chains. As a result of the study, the authors of the scientific publication identified four classes of approaches and corresponding criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of supply chains: classical economic approaches and criteria for evaluating efficiency; approaches based on the assessment of compliance with the developed standards; multicriteria approaches; approaches based on the assessment of business development barriers and, accordingly, its supply chains. With regard to classical economic approaches and performance evaluation criteria in the form of indicators traditionally used for any type of business, one can note the validity of their application in a large number of business situations. The second class of approaches is applicable in practice only if there are developed and justified supply chain standards. Most often, in this case, the justification is the recognition of the developed standard by an association of professionals, for example, the MRP I, MRP II and MRP III standards. A multi-criteria approach to evaluating supply chains would be quite logical. This is due to the fact that supply chains (if they are not shortened, which are mainly operated by 1PL-operators or 2PL-operators) are large systems. The fourth class of approaches could also be used, since in practice there is experience of its application with respect to one of the components of the supply chains, the essence of the approach was an integral assessment of barriers to the development of international road transport.</jats:p>"

Hydroponics is used as a growing medium for planting without using large areas of land by utilizing water and prioritizing the nutritional needs of plants. NFT is a hydroponic method that is easy to implement and is quite effective for plants. However, this method requires a cycle that cannot be stopped, so it requires a pump that must be on all the time. Therefore, a backup supply is needed that can guarantee the availability or continuity of the supply of electricity to the load by using an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) which keeps the system running if the PLN goes out by using PLTS and can be monitored and controlled at any time using Internet of things (IoT) technology. ). From the results of trials and analysis carried out that the performance of the system when in automatic mode, that is, when the battery reaches a value of 11.3 Volts, it will switch to the PLN supply. The supply from PLTS will change to PLN's supply automatically with a predetermined time, namely from 09.00 WIB to 15.00 WIB. If PLN experiences a blackout, it will switch to the PLTS source until PLN is back on.</jats:p>"

Актуальность темы исследования обусловлена нарастающей глобальной проблемой обеспечения человечества питьевой водой, соответствующей нормативам качества и безопасности. Особенно остро нехватку доброкачественной воды испытывает население Ближневосточного региона и, в частности, Ирака. Проведен анализ современных методов очистки и кондиционирования воды, выявлены наиболее эффективные методы на сегодняшний день, такие как метод обратного осмоса и ионный обмен. Разработана новая схема сооружений и оборудования для кондиционирования природных вод с приведением их к требованиям централизованного водоснабжения. В схеме предусмотрено: обогащение гидрокарбонатом кальция мягких питьевых вод с помощью фильтрационной технологии путем предварительной карбонизации фильтруемой воды диоксидом углерода; интенсификация процесса кальцинации при помощи применения двух сильных кислот или совместного применения одной сильной кислоты и диоксида углерода. В качестве решения проблемы и как результат изученных методов и сделанных расчетов предлагается технологический проект мобильной двухконтурной станции очистки и кондиционирования питьевой воды модульного типа производительностью 20 м3/ сутки. Описаны все этапы технологических процессов кондиционирования воды, рассмотрены вопросы состава и размеров сооружений, оборудования и параметров мобильной станции. Использование такой станции предполагается в удаленных от крупных городов районах, в которых отсутствует централизованная система водоснабжения.

The relevance of the topic of research is due to the growing global problem of providing mankind with drinking water that meets the standards of quality and safety. The population of the Middle East region and, in particular, Iraq is experiencing a particularly acute shortage of good quality water. To solve these problems we carried out the analysis of modern methods of treatment and conditioning of water; identified the most effective methods, such as reverse osmosis and ion exchange. We developed a new scheme of structures and equipment for the conditioning of natural water, bringing them to the requirements of a centralized water supply. The scheme provides for enrichment of soft drinking water with calcium bicarbonate using filtration technology by preliminary carbonization of filtered water with carbon dioxide. The scheme as well provides for intensification of the calcination process by the use of two strong acids or the combined use of one strong acid and carbon dioxide. As a solution to the problem and as a result of the methods studied and the calculations made, we offer a technological project for a mobile double-circuit station for purification and conditioning of drinking water of a modular type with a capacity of 20 m3 per day. We describe all the stages of technological processes of water conditioning and consider issues of the composition and dimensions of structures, equipment and parameters of the mobile station. The use of such a station is expected in areas remote from large cities in which there is no centralized water supply system. The operation of such stations solves several problems at once, primarily economic and epidemiological ones.</jats:p>",

As a statistical database, the authors use the results of the Rosstat surveys entitled \"The Comprehensive monitoring of the living conditions of the population\" that were conducted in 2011 and 2020. We analyze the data on cold and hot water supply systems, sewage systems and toilets in homes of households across the country in general, in rural areas and in individual houses (the private sector). The article reveals that there are no modern types of sewage systems in homes of almost two-thirds of households, whereas modern toilet is not installed in one-third, hot water supply — in 26 per cent, and cold water supply system — in homes of 11 per cent of households in rural areas. When considering individual houses in rural settlements the situation is even worse, and the numbers reach 81 per cent, 42 per cent, 30 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Six groups of regions of the Russian Federation are distinguished by the share of households that do not have access to any water supply system in their homes. Subsequently, we define four reasons why rural areas have been consistently lagging behind cities and towns in terms of infrastructural development, including the decline of local Soviet-era agricultural enterprises (kolkhozes and sovkhozes) in the beginning of the 1990s and the development of rural territories as a generally low priority topic for the Federal executive bodies. The other two reasons are the virtual disconnection of rural territories from the state policies in the area of housing construction and utilities and the insufficient compatibility of the current model of providing state and municipal services to the population living mostly in individual houses on private land under the conditions of shortage of financial resources. In conclusion, we propose a set of measures aimed at boosting resolution of the ongoing problems with universal access to modern water supply and sewage systems in rural areas of the Russian Federation.</jats:p>",

This paper combines two uncertainty-oriented methods (stochastic programming and robust optimization) to examine the conversion of capacity between different product types and construct a two-stage mathematical planning model maximizing the net profit of manufacturers. Through the introduction of blockchain technology and information sharing among enterprises, we improve the effectiveness of our model to realize the optimal allocation of long-term capacity planning.

The systematic literature review leads the author to the exploration of several CSFs, followed by their prioritisation by using principal component analysis. The paper highlighted eleven vital CSFs: top management commitment, development of an effective SCM strategy, logistics synchronisation, use of modern technologies, robust information and communication technology, information sharing with SC members, collaborative partnership, improved forecasting, trust development in SC partners, collaborative partnership, strategic partnership, development of reliable suppliers, continuous improvement in the preparedness and response practices, capacity building and training and staff development. The CSFs highlighted in the paper relate to all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper identifies the CSFs for developing a resilient supply chain that is comprehensive and has the potential to address uncertain circumstances. This work is the first of its kind on CSF assessment and categorisation in resilient supply chains.</jats:p>",

OBJECTIVE: To describe the barriers and facilitators of digital transformation in a hospital supply chain from the employee perspective. METHODS: We conducted two rounds of interviews, one year apart, with supply chain employees at an urban academic health system preparing to adopt an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software (N = 11 in Round I and N = 8 in Round II). Two researchers coded transcripts for themes using NVivo 11. RESULTS: We identified the following barriers to technology integration: silos between supply chain groups (e.g. Purchasing, Information Management, Strategic Sourcing), between employees and management, and resulting from prior mergers; focus on short-term problems and fear of change; and lack of transparent communication about upcoming changes. Facilitators of technology integration included motivation to work in supply chain; long-term vision that allowed tolerance of change and positive outlook; and transparent communication. CONCLUSION: Desire for shared leadership among employees emerged as a major theme, indicating the need for active involvement of employees during transition to new integrative technology.</jats:p>",

Research on inventory management and control, the heart of the healthcare supply system, has demonstrated that these targets can be reached by managing inventories efficiently while aiming at desired service levels. Although this can be enabled by adopting various supply chain management practices, the healthcare sector appears to lag compared to other industries. Seeking to investigate these aspects, this study draws on operations management literature, identifies and categorizes technology-driven supply chain management practices that are applied in hospital operations, develops a holistic conceptual framework delineating the key factors influencing their adoption in healthcare facilities, and examines their aggregated impact on financial performance. The research model is tested using structural equation modeling with survey data collected from Greek public hospitals. The study results indicate that technological readiness, organizational readiness, perceived benefits, and hospital size significantly influence the adoption of these practices in hospital supply chains. Moreover, they show a statistically significant association between the supply chain management practices applied and improved hospital cost performance, suggesting greater urgency for hospitals to exploit them fully. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</jats:p>"

The specific seasons selected for reconstruction are based on the strongest monthly precipitation signals recorded in the tree-ring data. Earlywood width of gray pine is best correlated with Oct-Dec precipitation at the onset of the wet season. Latewood width of ponderosa pine is correlated with Mar–Apr totals at the end of the wet season. These earlywood and latewood width chronologies are used to develop separate reconstructions of precipitation for the “autumn” (Oct–Dec) and “spring” (Mar–Apr) seasons. Total ring-width chronologies of blue oak are highly correlated with October–April precipitation totals and are used to reconstruct precipitation for the “wet season.” We then computed one additional skillful reconstruction by subtracting the reconstructed spring totals from the wet season precipitation estimates (i.e., “winter” [Oct–Feb]). We compare the winter and spring reconstructions because they are well calibrated and provide an interesting long-term perspective on the interaction of winter–spring precipitation amounts near March 1, when important reservoir management decisions are often made. Consecutive wet winter and very wet spring precipitation anomalies increased after 1950 in the instrumental and reconstructed time-series, often coinciding with the largest spring streamflow and flood events recorded on the American River at Folsom. Once the sub-annual tree-ring data can be improved, it may be possible to develop discrete reconstructions of early-, middle-, and late-season precipitation for the past 250 to 500 years, to help define natural variability and anthropogenic forcing of seasonal precipitation totals in California.</jats:p>"

Only half of the identified articles utilize theories for investigating third-parties in Sustainable Supply Chain Management. In addition, major theories are overweighed. This predomination leads to influencing the conceptualization of third-parties in Sustainable Supply Chain Management. Future research opportunities exist in broadening the utilization of theories and methods applied in the field, investing in under-explored aspects and broadening the scope of testing and building frameworks.

The main challenge associated with DAC is the high energy and material requirements, which results in a relatively high cost and may limit its environmental benefit. Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), most established in situ recovery approach for Alberta oil sands reservoirs, leave a considerable amount of energy under the ground at the end of their life. The objective of this work is to investigate the energy and environmental viability of exploiting the abandoned thermal energy from oil sands reservoirs to generate DAC energy requirements. This work focuses on a unique concept of integrating DAC with SAGD after the cessation of bitumen recovery to recover energy from the reservoir and use this to supply energy for DAC. The retained energy in reservoirs can be extracted by water circulation. The recovered hot water is sent to surface energy extraction unit to generate power and heat energy. CO2 captured from the atmosphere is then transported by pipeline and sequestered in a suitable geologic reservoir. To conduct our analysis, we create an energy balance on the coupled system and calculate the life cycle carbon balance with the goal of creating a stand-alone, carbon-negative CO2 capture system.</jats:p><jats:p>We consider the electrical and thermal energy for CO2 capture in the range of 100-600 tCO2/day using a solid-based DAC process, in which the loaded sorbents are regenerated at a temperature of 90-105 °C. An isobutane Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is utilized to generate electricity from a geofluid circulated in post-SAGD heat recovery process with the temperature varying from 130 to 170 °C. The heat required by the DAC is extracted directly from the produced geothermal fluid. The analysis uncovers that Direct Air Capture and post-SAGD reservoir can be combined in a stand-alone power island to capture up to 284.5 tCO2/d at 130°C and 427 tCO2/d at 170 °C geofluid surface temperature assuming deploying the technique in 40 production wells.</jats:p><jats:p>Furthermore, our modelling results show that CO2 capture efficiency for abovementioned ranges of capture rate and geofluid temperature varies between 70-99%. For no external energy demand, CO2 capture efficiency touches 99% but as the external sources of energy is being involved, the efficiency declines to a minimum of 70%. This study presents a novel concept for using the waste heat in oil sands reservoirs to provide DAC energy.</jats:p>",

We used an analytic network process based on the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory to calculate the centrality and weight of each barrier factor, and we determined the critical barriers to coordination by combining their results. A causality diagram of the barriers was drawn, and a scheme of coordination of the WSC was designed based on a closed-loop supply chain around the critical barriers. The results show that contradictions in benefits between subjects, contradictions between economic and social benefits, excessive subsidies, the failure of the market mechanism, the lack of a mechanism for supervision, and blocked information and distrust among the subjects are the five most critical barriers to the coordination of the WSC, with excessive subsidies the root cause of the lack of coordination. The subsidy for direct waste disposal should be used to reduce the cost of the operation of the WSC, waste recycling should be improved, an information-sharing platform should be built, and the cost of recyclable waste for manufacturers should be reduced to improve the efficiency of the WSC.</jats:p>"

Currently, it recognizes the substantial role that companies play in its successful implementation. Initiatives in the field of sustainable development may be undertaken by companies independently as part of their own activities, or together with entities forming the supply chain as an element of sustainable supply chain management.\nPurpose of the article: Identification of groups of companies that are characterised by a different approach to cooperation in the field of sustainable development in the supply chain.\nMethods: The quantitative research was conducted in September 2020 with the use of the CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview) technique and a standardised survey questionnaire. A total of 500 randomly selected companies located in Poland participated in this study. The respondents were representatives of top management of the companies. In order to identify various groups of companies, a cluster analysis was performed using the k-means method in SPSS.\nFindings &amp; value added: Based on the literature analysis, 3 areas of sustainable development have been identified, in which companies can become involved ? green design, sustainable operations, and reverse logistics &amp; waste management. For each of the 3 areas, 3 clusters of companies were identified: companies that are not involved in sustainable development at all (1), companies that carry out most of the sustainable development initiatives independently (2), companies that carry out most of the sustainable development initiatives jointly with supply chain partners (3). The article also shows that the companies in different cluster differ in terms of perceived economic benefits achieved thanks to the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. This may suggest the need to develop separate sustainability solutions for such groups of companies in the future.</jats:p>"

The Nation currently suffers from an acute electricity shortage, making nearly 40% of on-grid customers receive unreliable and inconsistent power below their demand. Solar resources are widespread in the country at considerably good potential than in many European nations. Nevertheless, Nigeria's solar photovoltaic (PV) installation capacity could be better. This paper presents the techno-economic, environmental and risk analysis of a grid-connected 10 kW, 100 kW, and 1 MW PV system for three customer segments in Abuja, Nigeria. It is found that a 1 MW grid-tied PV system is very viable at an electricity export rate not below 0.01 USD/kWh and a total initial cost (TIC) of not more than 2000 $/kW for fixed axis system and 2600 USD/kWh or lower for the two-axis system. The 10 kW and 100 kW PV systems are only financially viable with fiscal incentives. However, they become profitable with a minimum feed-in tariff of about 0.294, 0.297, 0.223 and 0.214 USD/kWh for the fixed 10 kW, 2-axis 10 kW, fixed 100 kW and two-axis 100 kW systems, respectively.</jats:p>"

The key issue in a supply chain is the coordinated management and control of all these activities, which is achieved through proper integration of the supply chain. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of internal and external integration on the performance of hospital with the mediating role of added value of the supply chain in Hazrat Valiasr Bafaq Hospital.\r\nMethods: The current cross-sectional research was conducted with the structural equation approach in 1400. The statistical population included all the employees (250 people) of Hazrat Waliasr Bafaq Hospital, 163 of whom were randomly selected based on Cochran's formula. Data collection tools included value added questionnaires of supply chain, internal integration, external integration and performance. The validity of the instruments was investigated and confirmed using convergent and divergent validity, and reliability was studied using Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. The structural equations model and SPSS 24 and LISREL 8 software were used to analyze the data.\r\nResults: Findings showed that internal integration with a significant value of 1/925 and path coefficient = 0/177 does not affect performance, and external integration with a significant value of 5/670 and path coefficient = 0/446 had a positive and significant effect on performance. Moreover, internal integration with a significant value of 2/281 and path coefficient = 0/265, and external integration with a significant value of 5/586 and path coefficient = 0/495 had a significant positive effect on the added value of the supply chain. The added value of the supply chain had a positive and significant effect on performance with a significant value of 2/315 and path coefficient = 0/231. In addition, the added value of the supply chain explains the mediating role between integration and performance. The quality of the final model of the research had a good fit with the overall model fit index (0.38).\r\nConclusion: The findings of this study showed that External integration has a significant effect on both the performance and supply chain value addition. But internal integration only affects supply chain value addition. It was also found that interdepartmental coordination is one of the important parameters for improving hospital performance. According to the results of this research, it is suggested that all the internal activities of the hospital be carried out based on a written program. Moreover, a special focus on the added value of the supply chain should be included as one of the hospital's strategies.</jats:p>"

We first develop revenue‐based measures of firms' vertical (across supply‐chain segment) and horizontal (within supply‐chain segment) diversification. We then compare post pandemic outcomes of more diversified and less diversified firms using several inverse‐probability weighting techniques. We find that vertical diversification reduces firms' resilience, whereas horizontal diversification increases firms' resilience.</jats:p>",

In the logistics supply chain, due to the high value of the items inside the arrival carton, appearance inspection must be carried out before warehousing. However, manual inspection is slow and ineffective, resulting in the waste of manpower and packaging carton resources, which is not conducive to sustainable development. To address the above problems, this paper designs a logistics supply chain carton packaging quality defect detection system based on improved Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) in the context of green sustainable development. The Implicit Feature Pyramid Network (IFPN) is introduced into SSD to improve the feature extraction ability of the model; the multiscale attention mechanism is introduced to collect more feature information. The experiment shows that the mAP and FPS of the system on the self-built data set reach 0.9662 and 36 respectively, which can realise the detection of the appearance defects of logistics cartons and help promote green sustainable development.</jats:p>",

In order to optimize the control performance of supercritical unit boiler system, the power supply loop model and sliding mode control method of supercritical unit boiler system debugging power supply are proposed. Firstly, the power supply circuit model is established according to the data of voltage doubling rectifier circuit, inverter circuit, high frequency transformer and LC resonant circuit. Secondly, the capacitance voltage value and the inductance current value are calculated in the power supply circuit model. Finally, based on the numerical results, a terminal sliding mode controller and a linear sliding mode controller are established to complete the double closed‐loop terminal sliding mode control and realize the power control of the debugging power supply. The experimental results show that when the input voltage is 50 V and the current is 14 V, the input voltage and current waveforms remain stable. When the input voltage is between 40 and 50 V, the change of switching frequency is small, only increasing from 22 to 26 kHz. The steady state of the power supply is high, and when the input voltage increases, the DC offset is 21.2. The convergence time in the calculation process is less than 200 ms. The instantaneous change of inductance is 0.7 A. The steady‐state error is less than 0.005 V. The output voltage distortion rate is less than 4%. It is proved that this method has strong control performance in the supercritical unit boiler system.</jats:p>",

Due to the shortage of financial funds and the political performance pursuit of local governments, environmental decentralization gives local governments greater autonomy in environmental management, and increases the possibility for local governments relying on land transfer income to make up for the financial gap and provide public goods and services. This paper analyses the impact of environmental decentralization on the construction land supply scale of local government based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2015. The results indicate that: (1) environmental decentralization has a positive effect on the increase in urban construction land supply scale; (2) environmental decentralization affects urban construction land supply by strengthening land financial dependence and distorting land resources misallocation; (3) there are regional disparities in the effect of environmental decentralization on urban construction land supply. The impact is greater in regions with high financial pressure, high economic growth pressure, and low environmental protection pressure. In summary, some policy suggestions are put forward to reasonably supply urban construction land against the background of Chinese decentralization.</jats:p>"

The studied area is Lorestan province located in the western part of Iran. To achieve this goal, time series of annual and monthly rainfall data were collected for different statistical periods. Moreover, in order to analyze the drought, the standard precipitation index and the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test were used. To predict the meteorological drought in this province, the monthly time series of the precipitation parameter was incorporated. The results showed that most parts of Lorestan province are facing an extreme drought and such conditions will happen again in the future. Furthermore, the amount of precipitation was predicted until 2032, and the trend of predicted precipitation data in the entire Lorestan province showed that there is a significant trend in most months. The results of the research on an annual scale showed that all stations have a significant negative trend at the level of 5%, which indicates the existence of a negative trend, or in other words, a decrease in irrigation in the studied stations. Therefore, according to the obtained results, it is necessary to plan water consumption in Lorestan province toward sustainable management.</jats:p>",

To date, battery-powered implanted devices have been used to collect biometric information. However, these have the disadvantage of not being able to collect real-time information due to battery capacity. To solve this problem, we propose that biometric acquisition devices be driven by a contactless power supply. The shape of a transmitting and receiving coil is studied to enable power to be supplied to an implantable device regardless of the position and posture of the experimental animal.

To resolve the scattered geographical locations, small individual capacities and poor controllability of distributed energy storage (DES) devices, edge computing is applied in conjunction with aggregate service providers to build an edge computing‐based aggregate model of DES. Regarding its characteristics, the schedulable potential of the energy storage device is analysed through modelling. A multi‐objective scheduling model with multiple parties participating in the subject's behaviour is established using the Internet of Things (IoT) optimization strategy. The simulation example of concrete data further verifies the validity of the model. Results demonstrate that the edge computing‐based aggregate model of DES effectively reduces the calculation load's peak‐valley load and reduces the wind power abandonment. In the meantime, the multiple starts and stops of the thermal power unit reduce the operation cost of the unit. The multi‐objective dispatch model can reduce the opportunity cost and payment of DES effectively. This model achieves load peak reduction and valley filling and reduces the peak dispatch cost of the power grid. The research results can provide some ideas for storing and utilizing the new energy.</jats:p>",

Through the analysis of the correlation between the electrolysis current and temperature of the proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and the electrolyzer port voltage, energy efficiency, and hydrogen production speed, it was concluded that the hydrogen production power supply should be characterized by low output current ripple, high output current, and wide range voltage output. To meet the requirements of the system of hydrogen production from electrolytic water based on new energy, a hydrogen production power supply scheme was proposed based on Y which is the type three, is the phase staggered parallel LLC topology. In the proposed scheme, the cavity with three is the phase staggered parallel output is resonated to meet the operating characteristics (high current and low ripple) of the electrolyzer, and pulse frequency control is adopted to achieve resonant soft in the switching operation and increase conversion efficiency. Lastly, a simulation model and a 6kW experimental prototype were built to verify the rationality and feasibility of the proposed scheme.</jats:p>",

For its part, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of managing the agri-food supply chain to ensure the food that the population needs. Industry 4.0 and its extensions can address the needs of the agri-food supply chain by bringing new features such as security, transparency and traceability in line with sustainable development goals. This study aims to systematically analyze the literature to address the challenges and barriers against the application of industry 4.0 and its related technologies in the management of an agri-food supply chain. Currently, despite the large number of publications, there is no clear agreement on what Industry 4.0 is, and even less its extensions. The next revolution that includes new technologies and improves several existing technologies brings additional conceptual and practical complexity. Consequently, in this work we first determine the main components of I 4.0 and their extensions by studying the literature, and then, in the second step, define the agri-food supply chain on which I 4.0 technologies are applied. Two well-known databases—Web of Science and Scopus—were chosen to extract data for the systematic review of the literature. For the final evaluation, we identified 24 of 100 reviewed publications. The results provide an exhaustive analysis of the different I 4.0 technologies and their extensions that are applied in regards to the agri-food supply chain. In addition, we find 15 challenges that are classified into five major themes in the agri-food supply chain: technical, operational, financial, social and infrastructure. The four most important challenges identified are technological architecture, security and privacy, big data management and IoT (internet)-based infrastructure. Only a few articles addressed sustainability, which reaffirms and demonstrates a considerable gap in terms of the sustainable agri-food supply chain, with waste management being the one that has attracted the most attention. This review provides a roadmap for academics and practitioners alike, showing the gaps and facilitating the identification of I 4.0 technologies that can help address the challenges facing the efficient management of an agri-food supply chain.</jats:p>"

It examines the supply chain strategy employed by Nestle to produce and distribute its popular coffee brand, Nescafe. The main focus is on evaluating the key challenges faced by the company, including post-COVID-19 issues, sustainability concerns, climate change, and supplier profitability. In response to these challenges, Nestle has implemented a structured approach to develop a resilient, sustainable, competitive supply chain for Nescafe. The Nescafe Plan, a global sustainability initiative, has provided a competitive advantage to Nescafe’s supply chain. This initiative involves collaboration with suppliers, distributors, and customers at all levels, ensuring accountability and promoting ethical practices. Results show significant positive impacts, including local sourcing of coffee, reduced carbon emissions, and water withdrawal. Nescafe operates its coffee supply chain based on a lean strategy, ensuring supply and demand stability. Customer demand for Nescafe’s products is well-predicted, allowing for unique positioning, high service levels, and cost efficiency. To enhance supply chain resilience, Nescafe focuses on mitigating internal and external risks in coffee lands, addressing issues like labour shortage, child labour risks, climate change, and natural disasters. The study also explores Nestle’s approach to supply chain outsourcing and supplier selection processes. Furthermore, the study examines Nestle’s commitment to sustainable development, encompassing economic, environmental, and social aspects. The company invests in economic development by situating production in developing countries and ensuring growth and long-term success for stakeholders. To continue its journey towards sustainability, Nestle has set ambitious goals for the future, aiming for recyclable packaging, zero net gas emissions, and 100% sustainably produced materials by 2030. The company also plans to empower 10 million young people with economic opportunities globally by the same year. Generally, this study provides valuable insights into the strategies adopted by Nestle to create a resilient and sustainable global supply chain for Nescafe, offering lessons for other manufacturing companies seeking to achieve future success through effective supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This paper fills the gap by framing the financial sector; to the development of financial intermediation (supply side) and individual use of financial services (demand side). The first approach decouples the financial sector into the banking and stock market. We use the 5‐year nonoverlapping averaged data from 1980 to 2017 across 49 countries and employ a panel data fixed effect and two‐stage least squared estimation (2sls). We show that banking and stock market development widens income inequality. Besides, the effect is more prominent in countries that have a banking and stock market than countries only with the banking sector. The second approach uses financial inclusion and financial technology (Fintech) data from three waves of survey data in 2011, 2014 and 2017 on the individual use of financial services across 39 countries. We obtain three key findings. First, institutional quality significantly affects financial inclusion and Fintech. Second, Fintech positively affects inclusion and savings. Third, financial inclusion and Fintech exacerbate income inequality. Our result asserts a natural tendency that financial sector development exacerbate income inequality in Africa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Textile industry is one of the major sources of revenue generation for Pakistan. For the last two decade this has been the key source of the inflow of foreign exchange through export of garments and textiles goods. Many global retailers and brands like Tesco, JC Penny, Wal-Mart, and Next etc. are sourcing their goods from Pakistan. These Retailers purchase garments and textile on some specific conditions such as cheap merchandising, quality standards and social and environmental compliance.  In order to comply with social standards these multinational buyers enforce their vendors to follow the land law and their own code of conduct. The severity of issues varies from violation to violation. For example, nonpayment of overtime violations is taken as serious issues. In contrast, failure to pay legal benefits to labors as EOBI, group insurance and leaves are less threatening. Hiring contractual employment especially on piece rate is one of the core factors that lead to these non-compliances (NCs). A total of 60 unpublished social compliance onsite audit reports of textile and garment factories working with foreign buyers in Pakistan were analyzed. Chai-Square test applied to test the hypothesis. The result reflects that there is an association exists between hiring contractual piece rate workers, employment old age benefit, and group insurance and leaves violation. Current study may be helpful in exploring the major factors that may lead to overtime, employment old age benefit, group insurance and leaves violation. The findings may also help NGOs, government and global buyers to develop policies that provide better control over workers’ rights in developing countries like Pakistan for sustainable business growth.</jats:p>",

The study employed a case study design to explore the research area intensively. Unstructured interviews were conducted with seven pharmacists from Central Medical Stores who were purposively selected. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis with the aid of ATLAS.ti software. Seven (7) pharmacists working at Central Medical Stores were included in this study. The participants highlighted various thematic issues reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on medicines procurement, access and distribution within the healthcare system. These themes included managing the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 pandemic-induced supply chain challenges; Approaching supply chain challenges; medicines shortages; and looking into the future. The study found that there needs to be government intervention to encourage local manufacturing, international intervention to prevent the hoarding of pharmaceuticals by rich nations, adoption of long-term procurement contracts, establishing of good communication with suppliers, having a sufficient budget for pharmaceuticals, training employees in supply chain management and adequate storage space in order to mitigate pharmaceutical supply chain challenges at the Central Medical Stores during COVID-19.</jats:p>",

To achieve this objective, a modular stand-alone solar energy-based direct current (DC) power supply was designed and implemented. The converter topology used is a two-stage interleaved boost converter, which is monitored in closed loop. The diagnosis method is based on analytic redundancy relations (ARRs) deduced from the bond graph (BG) model, which can be used to detect the failures of power switches, sensors, and discrete components such as the output capacitor. The proposed supervision scheme including a passive fault-tolerant cascade proportional integral sliding mode control (PI-SMC) for the two-stage boost converter connected to a solar panel is suitable for real applications. Most model-based diagnosis approaches for power converters typically deal with open circuit and short circuit faults, but the proposed method offers the advantage of detecting the failures of other vital components. Practical experiments on a newly designed and constructed prototype, along with simulations under PSIM software, confirm the efficiency of the control scheme and the successful recovery of a faulty stage by manual isolation. In future work, the automation of this reconfiguration task could be based on the successful simulation results of the diagnosis method.</jats:p>"

Among them, Fuel Cells (FCs) are on the Energy Agenda due to their potential to reduce the demand for fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions, their higher efficiency (as fuel cells do not use combustion, their efficiency is not linked to their maximum operating temperature) and simplicity and absence of moving parts. Additionally, low-power FCs have been identified as the target technology to replace conventional batteries in portable applications, which can have recreational, professional, and military purposes. More recently, low-power FCs have also been identified as an alternative to conventional batteries for medical devices and have been used in the medical field both in implantable devices and as micro-power sources. The most used power supply for implantable medical devices (IMD) is lithium batteries. However, despite its higher lifetime, this is far from enough to meet the patient’s needs since these batteries are replaced through surgeries. Based on the close synergetic connection between humans and microorganisms, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were targeted as the replacement technology for batteries in IMD since they can convert the chemical energy from molecules presented in a living organism into electrical energy. Therefore, MFCs offer the following advantages over lithium batteries: they do not need to be replaced, avoiding subjecting IMD users to different surgeries and decreasing medical costs; they do not need external recharging as they operate as long as the fuel is supplied, by the body fluids; they are a more environmentally friendly technology, decreasing the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions resulting from the utilization of fossil fuels and the dependency on fossil fuels and common batteries. However, they are complex systems involving electrochemical reactions, mass and charge transfer, and microorganisms, which affect their power outputs. Additionally, to achieve the desired levels of energy density needed for real applications, an MFC system must overcome some challenges, such as high costs and low power outputs and lifetime.</jats:p>"

There is a constant circulation of heat, which increases heat transfer efficiency by eliminating additional partitions between the panel and thermal insulation. The controller has sensors that register using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) STM32, designed to monitor the entire solar system, and the actuators include power relays.

Among the nine oilseed crops in India, the highest average contribution to total production of oilseeds is soybean followed by rapeseed &amp; mustard and groundnut. Similarly, the highest average area contribution to the total oilseed area is of soybean (44%) followed by rapeseed &amp; mustard (24%) and groundnut (20%). Against this backdrop, the present study attempts to employ the Nerlovian lagged adjustment function for significant oilseed crops in Rajasthan to estimate the degree of acreage/supply responsiveness analyses. For the study secondary data from 1997-98 to 2020-21 were collected to obtain the results of acreage responsiveness of oilseed crops like groundnut, rapeseed &amp; mustard and soybean in Bikaner, Alwar and Baran districts respectively.</jats:p>"

First, in the sufficient external supply scenario, the optimal price and transshipment quantity to maximize retailer's profits is discussed. Second, in the scenario of learning-type external supply, this study analyzes the optimal decision in three mechanisms of the hybrid strategy and their application: price priority mechanism, quantity priority mechanism and price–quantity balance mechanism.

Second; in the context of learning external supply, there are three coping strategies for retailers, including: Price priority mechanism, Quantity priority mechanism and Pricing and transshipment balance mechanism. This will help retailers make strategic choices, make more scientific management decisions and improve the supply chain emergency management theory. Third; the demand side response was managed through the change of external supply during supply side recovery period and supply disruption. The proposed model enables managing and analyzing supply disruption efficiently and effectively via handling uncertainty by considering all aspects of decision-making process. The proposed model can be applied in various fields such as vegetable and fruit, fresh food, etc.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This paper examines the relationship of information risks with supply chain disruptions and proposes blockchain applications and strategies to mitigate and manage them. We critically review the literature of SCRM and SCRES and find that information flows and risks are relatively attracting less attention. We contribute by suggesting that information integrates other flows, processes and operations, and it is an overarching theme that is essential in every part of the supply chain. Based on related studies we create a theoretical framework that incorporates fake news, misinformation and disinformation. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt to combine types of misleading information and SCRM/SCRES. We find that fake news, misinformation and disinformation can be amplified and cause larger supply chain disruptions, especially when they are exogenous and intentional. Finally, we present both theoretical and practical applications of blockchain technology to supply chain and find support that blockchain can actually advance risk management and resilience of supply chains. Cooperation and information sharing are effective strategies.</jats:p>",

For guaranteeing reservoir safe operation, stepped spillways are often used to discharge the flood from the reservoir. But under large unit discharges, cavitation erosion and low energy dissipation may occur on stepped spillways, which possibly leads to the hydraulic structures being instable and the reservoir outwork for water supply. Herein, an orifice plate is introduced as a pre-aeration device for the stepped spillways to avoid cavitation damage. To detail the effect of orifice plate on the flow over the stepped spillways, experiments were conducted. The results demonstrate that the orifice plate contracted the flow into a jet. Large amounts of air were entrained, and cavitation damage could be avoided according to the air concentration distributions along the stepped spillways. The orifice plate also significantly increased the energy dissipation of stepped spillways. Further, flow depth before the orifice plate increased because of flow block, and was emphatically discussed for providing a calculation formula to estimate the jet trajectory.</jats:p>",

In contrast with existing works, in our study, we innovatively construct a duopoly Bertrand–Cournot game model in a transnational supply chain with bounded rationality and asymmetric information. It is assumed that upstream firm 1 knows all the market information and adopts boundedly rational expectation, while downstream firm 2 only partially knows the market information and uses naïve expectation. Based on game theory and nonlinear dynamic theory, the complexity of the discrete system is analysed with respect to effective information, shareholding ratio and price sensitivity. Results reveal the following: (i) When the downstream firm knows little about the price information of the upstream firm, the market may be unstable or even chaotic; otherwise, it is conducive to the stability of the product market. (ii) When the shareholding ratio or the price sensitivity is relatively small, the market is more stable, and as they increase, the discrete price-production system goes through bifurcation and eventually falls into chaos. Our research has an important theoretical and practical significance for price-production supply chain competition in oligopoly markets.</jats:p>",

First, the concepts, and characteristics, related applications of supply chain information sharing (IS) and genetic algorithm back propagation (GABP) neural networks, are expounded. Then, the feasibility of applying BP neural network (BPNN) to evaluate supply chain IS is analysed. Next, the assessment indicator system for IS is constructed from four aspects: IS infrastructure, IS member characteristics, IS content, and the quality of supply chain enterprises. Finally, the principle and algorithm of BPNN are analysed, the network model is constructed, the BPNN process based on GA is designed, and every step in the process is explained in detail. The sample input is provided for the network model by obtaining and sorting data. The supply chain IS assessment model based on the GABP neural network is constructed. The results show that the assessment model of supply chain IS based on the GABP neural network has high accuracy, and the highest network accuracy reaches 95.01%, which proves that the assessment model based on BPNN has certain advantages for the supply chain IS of the financial industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors of the scientific publication explore the supply chain problems that arose as a result of the imposition of sanctions. According to business reports, logistics in our country has been hit, and it has found itself in a crisis situation, with all types of transportation affected. The logistical problems, which have worsened with the imposition of sanctions, have been most pronounced in international supply chains. Regardless of the localization of the supply chain, the imposition of sanctions by Western countries affected the international transportation of material flow. Therefore, the problems that have arisen have led to the need for a significant transformation of supply chains in our country, both in terms of export and import material flows. The systematization of supply chain problems due to the introduction of sanctions that impede sustainable development allowed the authors of a scientific article to divide them globally into two typical sets. The identified problems that arose as a result of the imposition of sanctions were systematized by the authors of the scientific article in chronological order. This makes it possible to better assess the very fact of the immediacy of their occurrence at the beginning of the period of imposition of sanctions and the corresponding complexity of their solution. Such problems were distinguished by the fact that they required considerable time and effort to solve them, including from state regulatory bodies, including the need for a quick response to develop and implement appropriate changes in regulatory legal acts. The analysis performed showed that as we moved through the hierarchical set of problems, both business and state regulatory authorities related directly or indirectly to the transport sector were able to respond more quickly to emerging problems as sanctions were tightened, since certain experience had already been gained</jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the strategies for mitigating pharmaceutical supply chain disruption during COVID-19 using Central Medical Stores Namibia as a case study. The study employed a case study design to explore the research area intensively. Unstructured interviews were conducted with seven pharmacists from Central Medical Stores who were purposively selected. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis with the aid of ATLAS.ti software. Seven (7) pharmacists working at Central Medical Stores were included in this study. The participants highlighted various thematic issues reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on medicines procurement, access and distribution within the healthcare system. These themes included managing the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 pandemic-induced supply chain challenges; Approaching supply chain challenges; medicines shortages; and looking into the future. The study found that there needs to be government intervention to encourage local manufacturing, international intervention to prevent the hoarding of pharmaceuticals by rich nations, adoption of long-term procurement contracts, establishing of good communication with suppliers, having a sufficient budget for pharmaceuticals, training employees in supply chain management and adequate storage space in order to mitigate pharmaceutical supply chain challenges at the Central Medical Stores during COVID-19.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, this study sought to examine the factors influencing consumer choice of retail outlets from a retailer perspective. To be more precise, the study investigated the influence of customer service, product quality and store location on consumer choice of retail outlets. A convenience sample of 138 retailers was pooled up in Awka metropolis, South-East, Nigeria while multiple regression analysis was used to test the formulated hypotheses with the aid of SPSS Version 20.0 software at 5% level of significance. Results indicate that the three attributes investigated namely customer service, product quality and store location influence consumer choice of retail outlets. More importantly, customer service has the most influence on consumer choice of retail outlets followed by store location and product quality in that order. Overall, the study concludes that the success of any retailing business depends on consumer patronage. In consequence, this piece of research recommends that retailers should invest in technology to enable customers use the necessary tools to purchase products and services as well as receive help from customer service personnel.</jats:p>",

However, the relationship between green supply chain management (GSCM), green human capital (GHC), green innovation (GIN), managerial environmental knowledge (MEK), and firm performance (FPR) has received only a minimal amount of research focus. This study addresses this research gap by providing empirical evidence to motivate firms to implement GSCM, GHC, GIN, and MEK to enhance their FPR in developing countries substantially. A conceptual framework was developed to connect the concepts mentioned above. A questionnaire-based survey was used to collect the data. A total of 736 respondents from manufacturing firms in China were selected. Utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM), the data were analyzed. The findings indicate that neither GHC nor GSCM directly affects FPR; rather, GIN mediates the connection between GHC, GSCM, and FPR. In addition, the findings showed that MEK directly affects FPR and moderates the link between GIN and FPR. This study examined several theoretical and managerial implications and expanded research in the related fields. The results may help practitioners and managers comprehend how GSCM practices impact GIN and FPR. The outcomes of this research will benefit experts, policy makers, and stakeholders who seek to encourage FPR enhancements.</jats:p>"

However, there are inevitably some potential risks. Thereby, to study the supply chain risk management of badminton supplies companies in the general environment, the supply chain risk evaluation index system of badminton supplies companies is established in this study by studying the connotation of supply chain risk management and combining the steps of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method. Then, according to these evaluation indexes, the modelling process of the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm in the corporate overall supply chain risk decision tree is proposed. Moreover, the corporate overall supply chain risk decision tree is established. Moreover, the financial data of 10 A‐share listed companies of badminton and other sports goods listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2020 are selected as the sample dataset for model training and testing. The potential risks of badminton enterprises are predicted. The results show that the scale of badminton enterprises has been increasing gradually since 2018, but the return on total assets has steadily decreased with the increase of years. It shows that the badminton supplies enterprise's input and output assets are unbalanced, and the overall asset operation effect is relatively poor. However, the growth rate of total assets shows a significant upward trend from 2018 to 2020, rising from 4% to 12.69%. It indicates that the corporate investment and domestic and foreign investment expansion in recent years are high‐speed. The FCE method is employed to obtain the maximum eigenvalue  of the enterprise, which is 5.4698. Then, the C.I value is 0.1205, the R.I value is 1.12, and the consistency ratio value is 0.0958 &lt; 0.1, indicating that the judgement matrix is acceptable. It suggests that under the influence of the macro environment and economic situation, the sales situation of the badminton supplies company is subtly affected by the macro environment, and there is a great business risk.</jats:p>",

Reflecting actual diet patterns, this study explored the role of total meat (red + white) in predicting CVD incidence. Data from 217 countries were extracted from United Nations agencies for the analyses in five steps. Bivariate correlations were applied to examine the relationship between total meat and CVD incidence globally and regionally. Partial correlation was applied to identify that total meat was an independent predictor of CVD incidence while socioeconomic status, obesity, and urbanization were statistically constant. Stepwise linear regression was conducted for selecting the significant predictor of CVD incidence. SPSS 28 and Microsoft Excel were used for correlation analyses. Globally, total meat correlated to CVD incidence strongly and significantly in bivariate correlation models. This relationship remained significant in partial correlation when socioeconomic status, obesity, and urbanization were statistically kept constant. Stepwise multiple regression identified that, second to socioeconomic status, total meat was a significant predictor of CVD incidence. Total meat correlated to CVD incidence in different country groupings. However, the correlations between total meat and CVD incidence were significantly stronger in developing countries than in developed countries. Worldwide, total meat (flesh) consumption correlated to CVD incidence independently, but significantly stronger in developing countries than in developed countries. This correlation is worth exploring further in longitudinal cohort studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>These researches concern the use of renewable sources of electricity during emergency shutdowns for uninterrupted operation of water management systems. The ability to purify drinking water during a power outage requires a backup power source. A mobile power plant, which is usually used as a backup power source during blackouts and emergencies, is known to cause environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The use of wind energy for these purposes requires the location of wind stations next to small treatment plants and households in order to quickly switch to autonomous mode, which does not always meet the territorial requirements and wind resources of the region. Open areas for the location of solar panels make the use of this type of renewable sources as a reserve in the conditions of military operations in Ukraine not quite suitable. On the basis of foreign experience in the use of small hydroelectric power plants (MHPs) and with different layouts of their location when working at sewage treatment plants, four possible options for providing electricity to sewage treatment plants and households during a blackout are proposed for the conditions of Ukraine. The option of the location of the MHP, which uses the energy of water transported through pipelines and which has successfully proven itself at operating treatment plants, is considered. Variants of using the pressure of an artesian well are proposed: MHP located in a vertical well that supplies artesian water under pressure; when an active artesian well supplies water under natural pressure at a constant flow rate to an above-ground (or underground) tank that simultaneously supplies normal household needs and a connected turbine-powered alternator. In addition, an option for the location of the MHPS was considered for the treatment and further use of rainwater sewage, including for the use of rainwater collected from \"green roofs\" in a tank-reservoir. The peculiarities of using this scheme are that it is easy to combine it with the case of using energy obtained from artesian wells. The proposed technological solutions allow for significant energy savings, including in places where high-quality water supply from artesian wells is possible, depending on the hydrogeological conditions of the area.</jats:p>"

We note that both ‘too much and too little water’ pose risks to water insecurity. Also, water security cannot be ensured by only dealing with water inadequacy without building a resilient water system and robust institutions. We found that water scarcity has affected other components of water security such as equity, quality, and affordability. Excess water has impacted water infrastructures, degrading the water quality, and risking human health and well-being. The responses to the water challenges were hindered by several constraints such as the limited capacity of the water institutions, frequent leadership changes, political influence, and emerging challenges in the federal context. We suggest timely planning and adopting site-specific innovations to address water scarcity and excess challenges, which include strengthening water services, infrastructures, institutions, and governance.</jats:p>",

The chain includes supply centers, relief, and damaged points under uncertainty of some key parameters. The major goal is to locate the relief centers and determine the allocations and transfer of goods between the two levels. The bi-objective model minimizes the high logistical costs and maximizes damaged points’ coverages with uncertain costs.

The sustainability of the apparel supply chain management in developing countries is characterized by operations highly hazardous to the environment and unethical to society and of important economic value. Studies showed that socioeconomic and cultural differences in different countries affect the success of sustainability practices. Therefore, extensive research is required to measure the current challenges of sustainable practices from environmental, social, and economic perspectives of the apparel industry. Due to unsustainable practices, competitiveness in export and local markets is low in the Ethiopian apparel industries. This paper explores the effect of different factors on the sustainable practices of Ethiopian apparel manufacturing industries. A conceptual framework was formulated to measure sustainable practices. Questionnaires, interviews, and secondary data sources were used for data collection. The data are prepared and pretested for reliability. Integrated interpretive structural modelling and structural equation modelling techniques have been employed for model building and data analyses to see the relationship between the challenges and the existing practices. The proposed model was validated using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The Bootstrapping technique in smart partial least square ensures the reliability of the data for small sample size. The result showed a significant relationship between the factors and sustainable practices. All the environmental, economic, and social perspectives were statistically tested and found significant at<jats:inline-formula><a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><a:mi>p</a:mi></a:math></jats:inline-formula>values of 0.05. Sustainable practice in the apparel manufacturing supply chain was found to be low with a mean value of three. This performance is far below the average standard in developing and developed countries. This research provides customized areas of intervention from environmental and social aspects that recognize the societal difference towards sustainability awareness and motivation to implement sustainability initiatives in Ethiopian apparel manufacturing industries. This research could provide awareness for business owners and policymakers and help understand the limitations of existing sustainability practices and the need for interventions. Therefore, apparel manufacturing industries could be potential sourcing destinations for global apparel manufacturing industries.</jats:p>",

Forty articles were analyzed, 15 of which were in the Web of Science and Scopus® databases, and 25 were taken from the bibliographic references of the articles selected in the Scopus database. The data analysis revealed that the main theories used to investigate the existing relationships between governance and the honey supply chain were: transaction cost theory; economic theory of conventions; productive arrangements theory; and organizational theory of the beekeeping sector. Regarding the authors, no production concentration in research groups was found. The most recurrent themes refer to training, management, and sustainability. The study revealed the scarce participation of family farmers in the beekeeping chain, and the fragility of governance structures in the beekeeping sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global supply chain network in the 21st century is faced with increasing unprecedented uncertainty, such as the unpredictable rage of Covid-19 and the fierce international competition for more efficient and affordable supply chain management. For such reasons, the Internet of Things (IoT), a modern tool in supply chain management, has been used more often. This research examined the application of IoT in the food grocery and manufacturing industries, both of which sustained severe challenges during the rage of Covid-19 and are essential for social and economic development. The findings of this research suggest that IoT is a powerful tool to increase food safety and security in emergencies like Covid-19. IoT also enhances the supply network effectiveness of the food grocery industry by working with e-commerce. In the manufacturing industry, IoT reduces costs and avoids waste in goods transportation. IoT also increased supply chain reliability by tracking the movement of goods and more effective equipment maintenance. However, the findings also reveal that IoT is not flawless, as it bears more risks in terms of data breaches. This should be the future focus for improving IoT’s application in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Government of Tanzania (GoT), in collaboration with development partners, has made significant improvements in the health supply chain since 2013 through developing of an electronic Logistics Management Information System (e-LMIS) and strengthening of the Logistics Management Services (LMS) component. Nevertheless, the use of reported data in the e-LMIS remained very low. In efforts to respond to low data use at all supply chain levels, the GoT introduced the Information Mobilized for Performance Analysis and Continuous Transformation (IMPACT) approach to reinforce data use culture for decision-making to improve the supply chain. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of IMPACT team approach implementation processes on health supply chain data use in Singida region. This was a pre- and post-cross-section study whereby the quantitative data were obtained from e-LMIS stock imbalance reports. This data was processed using Microsoft Excel power query and analysed using Microsoft Excel 2019 pivot tables to get indicator results on availability, not-in-demand and overstocked health commodities. The overall pre (2018) and post (2020) intervention results for both Iramba district council (DC) and Singida municipal council (MC) were 66% and 81% for the availability of essential health commodities, 17.2% and 21% for not-in-demand health commodities and 17% and 20.7% for overstocked health commodities respectively. Iramba DC demonstrated a significant statistical increase in both indicators compared to Singida MC, as the P-value was less than 0.05 at a 95% confidence level (df=35). Conclusively, the IMPACT team approach positively influenced data use and availability of health commodities. However, it was not the case for overstocked and not-in-demand indicator results. Apart from the possible low quality of logistics data, further studies should explore other contributing factors behind the increasing trends of overstocks and not-in-demand health commodities in the region.</jats:p>"

The GSHP system model was established using TRNSYS software. With the total energy consumption of the system as the objective function, several control strategies were proposed for the optimization work of water supply temperature at the load side of the heat pump unit. Firstly, a variable water temperature control strategy was adjusted according to the load ratio of the unit. In addition, the TRNSYS-GENOPT (TRNOPT) optimization module in TRNSYS was used to find the optimal water supply temperatures for different load ratios. After simulating and comparing the system’s energy consumption under the three control strategies, we found that the total annual energy consumption under the variable water supply temperature scheme is less than that under the constant water supply temperature scheme by 10,531.41 kWh. The energy saving ratio is about 5.7%. The simulation found that the total annual energy consumption under the optimized water supply temperature based on TRNOPT is lower than that under the variable water supply temperature scheme by 1072.04 kWh, and it is lower than that under the constant water supply temperature scheme by 11,603.45 kWh. The annual energy saving ratio of the system is about 6.3%. It is concluded that the optimized water supply temperature scheme based on TRNOPT has a better energy saving effect than the first two water supply temperature schemes.</jats:p>"

Firstly, convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep Boltzmann machines under deep learning are introduced. Second, cellular neural networks are used to perform feature recognition and extraction on images. Finally, a Parzen classifier is used to classify the obtained image features. The novelty is that through the structural design and research of the intelligent logistics system, the CNN is combined to construct a management system of supply chain logistics of image recognition and information processing. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy time of the proposed improved fusion algorithm on the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology data set is 198.85 s. When the improved algorithm achieves the same recognition accuracy, it takes 159.65 s. The recognition efficiency of the improved algorithm is 19.71% higher than that of the unimproved algorithm. In addition, when the unimproved algorithm reaches the maximum number of iterations, the error rate is 2.47%. The error rate of the improved algorithm is only 0.74%.

However, the empirical evidence documenting the association between SFSC participation and farm economic performance has been mixed. In this study, through a meta‐analysis using a logistic regression, we identify key factors to explain differences between studies that find better economic performance in SFSC and those that do not. Our meta‐analysis consists of 48 studies published in English and French from 2000 to 2022 that examine the economic performance of farms engaged in SFSC. Based on far more empirical evidence than previous reviews, we find that the relationship between SFSC participation and farmer income remains ambiguous. More specifically the findings indicate that the reported effect of SFSC on a farm economic performance varies depending on location and the indicator used to capture the economic performance of farms. Studies conducted in Europe are more likely to report higher farmer income as are studies that use profit satisfaction metrics rather than measures of gross or net income. We also emphasize the need to interpret the reported results cautiously because few are based on causal inference methods. Furthermore, the very few studies that account for selection bias often do so with inadequate corrections.</jats:p>",

Meat processors are critical to local meat producers and the meat supply chain. However, various barriers have restricted small-scale meat processors and challenged the local meat supply chain. Although local food systems have gained enormous scholarly attention, little attention has been devoted to specifically exploring the meat processing sector. This study investigated the characteristics and challenges of small-scale (&lt;750 employees) and very-small–scale (&lt;200 employees) meat processors in Missouri. Twenty-six meat processors participated in an online survey through Qualtrics, a mail survey, or a structured phone interview between May 2021 and March 2022. We identified the characteristics and constraints related to their businesses. The analysis revealed that 76% of meat processors perceived that their business was in better or much better condition than before the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting their adaptability to the disrupted meat supply chain. However, small-scale meat processing facilities were limited by the labor shortage, complicated regulations and high regulatory compliance costs, a lack of consistent supply, and limited access to tools and equipment. More integrated work is needed to aid smaller processors in positively impacting the local community and environment through locally sourced meat production. This study contains helpful implications for state-level policymaking, extension programs, and future research directions.</jats:p>"

The composition profiles of PHCZs in the surface sediments were dominated by 1,3,6,8-tetrabromocarbazole, 1,3,6-dibromocarbazole, and 3,6-dichlorocarbazole. The variation trends of PHCZs in the sediment cores showed an apparent peak concentration and subsequently a significant decreasing trend in recent years. A strong correlation existed between PHCZs and sediment physicochemical properties. Furthermore, human activities directly or indirectly affected PHCZ concentrations. The evaluation of the potential toxic effect suggested that the toxic equivalent of PHCZs was less than the safe sediment value.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study explored the influence of supply chain management practises on operational performance in the manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Conversely, the study adopted the cross-sectional survey research design. Data were primarily sourced through administered questionnaires. A collection of four thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four (4,984) employees of all manufacturing firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and operating in Nigeria's Edo and Delta States make up the study's population. A sample size of 370 was computed using the Yamane’s formula and same number of questionnaires was administered but 318 were found fit in testing the formulated hypotheses. Research data were analyzed, using descriptive and inferential statistical instruments. Based on the ordinary least squares regression, the study revealed that procurement outsourcing (?= 0.082974, t-Statistic= 3.049313 and p&lt;0.05) and order process management (?= 0.349839, t-Statistic= 7.972484 and p&lt;0.05) have positive and statistically significant relationship with operational performance of quoted manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Based on these conclusions, the study suggested that management of manufacturing firms conduct a benchmarking exercise for best players in the industry as a way to improve their procurement outsourcing practices, and that the facility and competence of order processing system should be routinely evaluated using indicators that tracked the flexibility and dependability of order handling. This would allow them to attain and keep up supply chain performance that is unmatched.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective risk management reaction improves the absorption of critical impacts on supply chains. Supply chain risk (SCR) sources, like control, process, demand, and supply, need to be identified, assessed, and mitigated to make rational decisions immediately. Late detection of a disruptive event can cause delays in handling risk. Since SCRs consist of complex, uncertain, and incomplete information, most of the provided risk assessment mechanisms cannot handle it in real-time. Hence, in this paper, we introduce NeutroMAS4SCRM, a framework incorporating real-time Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Neutrosophic Data Analytic Hierarchy Processes to best deal with the complexity, uncertainty, and vagueness of SCR management-related issues and which can hence help decision-makers adopt less risky decisions. In addition, the MAS technology contribution to SCR management is outlined through a comparative study among the most recent studies. In contrast, the proposed MAS for the supply chain is implemented under the JADE agent platform, where the FIPA-ACL-based message content is specified using a dedicated ontology. A simulation-based decision support system is used to assess the cost risk and its harmful effects and determine how well the proposed framework can help companies manage risks efficiently. The simulation has proven to reduce risk costs by about 85%.</jats:p>",

The  study  also determinate   the  factors  affecting the sustainability of supply chains in construction\n \nTheoretical framework: Supply chain integration in many industries is based on integrated enterprise resource and relationship processing systems (ERP), but the construction industry has traditionally lagged behind in these processes. The need to create effective relationships in supply chains and increase the resilience of supply chains in construction has become evident in the context of the pandemic. However, the weak formalization of these processes in construction has led to the need to find acceptable methods for choosing directions for increasing the sustainability of supply chains in this industry.\n \nMethodology: This is a  descriptive-based  study.  Approaches to factors of the supply chain stability were researched and systemized and from this the situations for the increasing stability of the supply chains are determinated. The choice of a model of the increasing stability of the supply chains was determined by the analytic hierarchy process.  Hierarchy analysis was used as a method for selecting a scenario for increasing the sustainability of supply chains in construction.\n \nFindings: The results of the research carried out to conduct a multi-criteria choice using the opinions of experts in the construction industry. The choice of scenarios for increasing sustainability is due to the fact that the introduction of adaptive information technologies allows to take into account all groups of selected factors, while ensuring synchronization of production planning, product shipment and inventory management, increasing market feedback, ensuring that production volumes correspond to product demand, as well as reducing logistics costs and the price of products for the end customer.\n \nResearch, Practical  &amp;  Social  Implication: The  study  contributes  to  a  better understanding crucial factors of the sustainability of supply chains in construction. The processes  of  analyzing   and evaluating   factors contribute  to improving  the sustainability of supply chains in construction,  by  focusing  on  critical  factors,    adopting  them  according  to  the requirements  of the construction.\nOriginality/value: Based on the presented results, concluded that the scenario formation of increasing sustainability of the sustainability of supply chains  by the introduction of adaptive information technologies allows to take into account all groups of selected factors, while ensuring synchronization of production planning, product shipment and inventory management, increasing market feedback, ensuring that production volumes correspond to product demand, as well as reducing logistics costs and the price of products for the end customer.</jats:p>"

Rather than taking this approach, we investigate a problem of substantial commercial value, multi-truck vehicle routing for supply chain logistics, at the scale used by a corporation in their operations. Such a problem is too complex to be fully embedded on any near-term quantum hardware or simulator; we avoid confronting this challenge by taking a hybrid workflow approach: we iteratively assign routes for trucks by generating a new binary optimization problem instance one truck at a time.

Our work gives a set of techniques that can be adopted in contexts beyond vehicle routing to apply NISQ devices in a hybrid fashion to large-scale problems of commercial interest.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study evaluated the removal efficiency of total (cell-bound and dissolved) microcystin (MC) by a hybrid process combining powdered activated carbon (PAC)-submerged hollow fiber membrane and compared the hybrid process performance with that of PAC adsorption and submerged hollow fiber membrane processes separately. The results indicated that up to 84% of the total MC was removed using the PAC adsorption stand-alone process, while 90% of it was removed by submerged hollow fiber membrane stand-alone process (with a 10 μg/L feed concentration). When the PAC dose of 20 mg/L and equilibrium time of 480 min were applied with a 51.9 μg/L feed concentration to the hybrid process, the removal efficiency of total MC increased to 99%. Moreover, the cell-bound and dissolved MC concentrations in the permeate were 0.34 and 0.65 mg/L, respectively. This permeate concentration level was ensured by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the guideline value for MC (1 mg/L). Overall, the hybrid process combining PAC-submerged hollow fiber membranes can be successfully used as an alternative advanced treatment technology to mitigate total (cell-bound and dissolved) MC.</jats:p>",

The divergence of research findings has led to many assessment factors that must be considered when choosing the supplier. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze factors affecting agroindustry supplier performance using a systematic review. The research from reliable databases such as Elsevier, Emerald, Proquest, and Taylor &amp; Francis from 2010 to 2020 has been analyzed.

The literature base is also significantly less in BT(Blockchain) using SSCM (Sustainable supply chain Management) fashion industries. To understand the literature clearly, the PRISMA technique is used to identify, screen, and include the related research concepts in the area of BT using SSCM fashion industries. The analysis of PRISMA gives the result of proposing the ABC framework shows significant factors involved in the A (adoption of Blockchain), B (the barriers during the implementation), and C (critical success factors) to be maintained to create a competitive advantage. The adoption of blockchain in SSCM has to be studied and involved through 1. Force Field Theory, and 2. When implementing the SSCM using BT, specific barriers have a concept of TOE framework, which includes (Technology, Organisation, and Environment) related to organizational performance. The performance factors should be identified to implement the factors in such a way as to get the maximum benefits out of it. The performance indicator factors are organizational, environmental, economic, information, and customer performance. After the implementation, the organization should maintain the factors effectively with the help of critical success factors such as top management support, financial constraints, supplier performance, customer acceptance, and Government regulations. This is the first paper that discusses the adoption, barriers, and challenges in implementing SSCM using BT in the fashion industries. Industry practitioners, academicians, and research scholars can use this paper as a guide to know the essential factors suggested by various eminent authors in BT and SSCM.</jats:p>"

Water injection is acknowledged as one of the most effective methods to keep the reservoir’s pressure and hence maximize the oil recovery. In X field, located in the South of Oman, oil recovery utilizing water injection started in 2005. Three water supply wells provide the water for injection. Since 2018 the uptime of these wells has been around +- 69% which is far from the target uptime of 95%. This affects the water injectivity to the reservoir and hence oil production. On average, around 370 bbl/d of oil production is deferred, with potential revenue of 6 million US$ lost annually.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods, Procedures, Process: To overcome the problem of low uptime of water supply, Lean Six Sigma was applied, using the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) method. The DMAIC approach has successfully proven process improvements in different industries but has yet to be used in the oil and gas industry. The DMAIC method was applied to identify the main contributors to wells failures, and hence remove process defects and reduce the downtime of the water supply wells. Six Sigma is generally known as a data-driven methodology for improving quality and reducing variation in business activities using multiple statistical tools.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results, Observations, Conclusions: The study was performed on various possible factors that can cause downtime to the water supply wells. Statistical analysis confirmed three leading causes: well surface leaks, overhead line failures and backpressure. Three dedicated teams were formed to develop and implement improvement plans. This improved uptime of the water supply wells from 69% to more than 98%, which translates to an increase of 1100m3/day (6900 bbl./day) of water injection. As a result, production increased by 1150 bbl./day of oil. The overall benefit for the 14 days pilot and sustain interval of this project was 640,000 USD (assuming 40 USD per barrel). The changes being sustained give an expected annual gain of 4.7 million USD per well. This approach will be replicated in another three fields with the same issue.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Novel/Additive Information: Applying the Lean Six Sigma methodology has effectively improved the uptime of water supply wells and hence water injectivity and oil production. This study proved that Lean Six Sigma could be used to help unlock many oil production opportunities.</jats:p>",

However, the rapid increase in measures to combat corruption globally portrays a picture of the losses due to corruption. Corruption, especially in developing countries, mainly manifests in the public procurement sectors due to the large amount of money involved. The emergence of covid-19 has also amplified corruption cases in the procurement of medical supplies in West Africa and the world. This conference paper examined the extent of corruption in public procurement in Nigeria, particularly the record systems. The paper was guided by various research questions, including; To what extent does corruption affect the performance of public procurement in Nigeria?, What are the various ways in which corruption affect the public procurement record systems in Nigeria?, What are the most effective methods of combating corruption in the public procurement systems in Nigeria?. The study employed a qualitative research method using a systematic review of the literature to answer these research questions. The study revealed that the systemic corruption in Nigeria could be combated using non-state approaches as compliments to the state-based plans. It also provides the reasons why corruption has persisted in Nigeria. Keywords: Corruption, Public Procurement, Performance</jats:p>"

The purpose was to investigate how legume processors of various sizes and in different locations in the European protein legume market are working to increase their market share within the paradigm of efficiency gains from agricultural specialisation and trade in order to improve both food availability and security. After identifying company typologies and characteristics, the company case studies along the legume value chain were investigated. The analysis revealed that the supply market for grain legumes is expected to grow rapidly, and the various processors are increasing their market shares in terms of product type and geography. Based on the principles of agroecology and levels of food system change, the companies were found to be adopting promising business strategies, but are not disrupting the competitive patterns among existing European legume supply companies and food consumers that dominate the current regime. System change is far from taking place. However, conventional perspectives are being challenged and new ways of operating are being developed, indicating that a significant transition can be initiated that would move legumes away from being a niche sector, demonstrating to legume processors and consumers in the regime that there is an alternative and more sustainable pathway for the future, possibly stimulating larger-scale initiatives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Climate change is a major global risk and a key driver for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Yet, firms’ internal emissions reduction may create a leakage leading to higher emissions in the supply chain. The related literature suggests that the pollution‐haven hypothesis explains such emissions leakage. In contrast, we explore an alternative reason for supply chain leakage, which is related to optimization of supply chain activities and supply chain innovation. Based on panel data from Bloomberg Environmental, Social, and Governance and Bloomberg Supply Chain, we estimate our models at a dyadic (i.e., firm and supplier) level using two‐way cluster‐robust standard error, treating various sources of endogeneity. We find empirical evidence of a supply chain leakage effect—a higher level of a supplier's emissions is associated with a lower level of a firm's internal emissions. More importantly, the supplier's innovation can be a major reason behind the leakage; the supply chain leakage effect is stronger when a supplier is more innovative. Furthermore, the role of innovation is strengthened when a supplier invests in eco‐innovation and has technological capabilities similar to those of the focal firm. Our findings suggest that supply chain leakage may not be completely driven by the pollution‐haven effect, but instead is associated with supply chain optimization and innovation that may be beneficial in the long run. </jats:p>",

Therefore, organizations need to develop a response capability that allows them to minimize the negative effect of such events and quickly recover from them, also known as resilience. This research performs a comparative analysis of the influence that risk, vulnerability, and adaptability have on the resilience capability of supply chains in Colombian defense sector organizations before and during the coronavirus outbreak. Based on a literature review, a survey was designed and applied online to collect data from respondents related to the activities of the Colombian Air Force supply chain. For the first wave, data was collected between December 2019 and January 2020. Data for the second wave was collected in August 2020. Results suggest that identifying and managing risks positively impact reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptability. Moreover, by decreasing exposure and improving adaptability, the organization positively influences supply chain resilience capability. The results also indicate that the pandemic positively affected risk and vulnerability awareness. The identification of vulnerabilities had a positive impact on the resilience capacity during the Corona Virus outbreak. This research provides relevant information for the Colombian government on developing public policies and mechanisms of service and support for defense sector organizations to strengthen their resilience capability. Likewise, the study offers valuable information to those organizations interested in improving their resilience capability and that of the sector in which they are involved.</jats:p>"

The results show that the measured jet trajectory and the values extracted from the jet projectile equations are not the same. This discrepancy may be due to the effect of air resistance on flow; the existing jet trajectory equations do not incorporate air resistance. Projectile equations used for calculating the trajectory of falling jets have an average error of 21 and 26% for free-falling and pressurized jets, respectively. To minimize this discrepancy, the projectile equations were corrected. Also, the numerical simulation predicts the trajectories of the free and pressurized jets on average with a relative error (RE) of 25.5 and 23.5%, respectively, compared to the laboratory data. These errors can be caused by neglecting the effect of air resistance. In addition, it was found that by increasing the Froude number, the location of the falling jet impact moves further from the dam toe.</jats:p>",

In the case of bofedales, the evaluation of the ANPP supply capacity as a service on a spatial and temporal scale through remote sensing has been little addressed. The capacity, intra and interannual, to provide the ANPP of the high Andean wetlands was quantified at a spatial and temporal level through remote sensing. The normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) of the MODIS sensor was used according to the Monteith model (1972), product of the incident photosynthetically active radiation, fraction of the absorbed radiation, and the efficiency of using the radiation of the calibrated vegetation with dry matter sampling in the field. Results show an ANPP prediction R 2 of 0.52 (p &amp;lt; 0.05), with no significant spatial difference between field samples. When applying the model, the intra-annual temporary ANPP supply capacity presents a maximum average of 160.54 kg DM·ha –1·month –1 in the rainy season (December–May) and a maximum average of 81.17 kg DM·ha –1·month –1 in the dry season (June–October). In 2003–2020, the interannual temporary capacity presented values of 1100–1700 kg DM·ha –1·year –1. This makes it possible not to affect the sustainability of the wetlands and prevent their depletion and degradation. Understanding the ANPP supply capacity of bofedales can favour the efficient use of the resource and indirectly benefit its conservation.</jats:p>"

The current study aims to identify and prioritize, through the quantitative decision-making technique of Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), a set of barriers to resiliency for the pharmaceutical supply chain in India. The rationale behind choosing the Indian pharmaceutical supply chain was that the pharmaceutical sector in India supplies over half of the global demand for vaccines and generic drugs, and the trajectory of growth is indicated around US$100 billion by the year 2025, along with exporting pharmaceutical products to nearly 200 destination countries. The findings of the current study are expected to aid the decision-makers in evaluating the relative criticality and the interrelationship between the potential (and critical) barriers to supply chain resiliency, and in turn to develop strategic plans. This, in turn, can help to combat unforeseen supply chain disruptors such as COVID-19. This methodology and the findings of the study can be generalized for other supply chains. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The Dynamic Modified Stochastic p-Median Problem (DMS-p-MP) is an important problem in supply chain network design, as it deals with the optimal location of facilities and the allocation of demand in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Methods: In this research paper, we propose a mixed-integer linear formulation for the DMS-p-MP, which captures the key features of the problem and allows for efficient solution methods. The DMS-p-MP adds two key features to the classical problem: (1) it considers the dynamic nature of the problem, where the demand is uncertain and changes over time, and (2) it allows for the modification of the facility locations over time, subject to a fixed number of modifications. The proposed model uses robust optimization in order to address the uncertainty of demand by allowing for the optimization of solutions that are not overly sensitive to small changes in the data or parameters. To manage the computational challenges presented by large-scale DMS-p-MP networks, a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is employed. Results: Our computational study in a real-life case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in solving the DMS p-Median Problem. The results show that the number of opened and closed buildings remains unchanged as the time horizon increases due to the periodic nature of our demand. Conclusions: This formulation can be applied to real-world problems, providing decision-makers with an effective tool to optimize their supply chain network design in a dynamic and uncertain environment.</jats:p>"

In the present study, monthly precipitation and streamflow data were analyzed to assess the variability in trends of precipitation over the Upper Narmada Basin (UNB), Middle Narmada Basin (MNB), and Lower Narmada Basin (LNB) for 41 years (1981–2021) using the widely accepted Mann–Kendall Test (MKT), Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA), and magnitude by Sen's Slope estimator, thereby extending further by a decade, the last study by Thomas and others in 2015. The inclusion of more factors affecting the streamflow in response to the rainfall often makes the model very complex and unreliable. In the present study, to overcome this limitation, a simple yet most definite correlation was established between rainfall and streamflow, which can serve as a meaningful indicator of basin behavior. Poor correlation was observed for the UNB and the MNB compared to the LNB, which may be attributed to the presence of tributaries. The result of this study will be helpful to policymakers and water resource managers to plan and adopt suitable schemes of water conservation and management in the Narmada basin.</jats:p>",

Thus, the main focus of this study was to evaluate the actual performance level of the water supply system of the town based on hydraulic efficiency, quality, cost recovery and customer satisfaction. The water distribution system status was measured by using reliability, resilience, and vulnerability as performance indicators. Weightage Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) and household-based questionnaires were used to evaluate the water quality and customer satisfaction, respectively. Pressure and velocity-based sustainability index of 0.614 and 0.132 showed acceptable and unacceptable water supply status, respectively, and overall moderate sustainability. Results of the WAWQI revealed that more than half of the sampled tap waters were either poor or unfit for drinking purposes. The comparison of income collected from customers and the water production costs of the utility showed that only 34.31% of production cost is covered by customers. Generally, 62.6% of the society confirmed that they are unsatisfied with the existing water supply system. Thus, to improve the performance, it is recommended to address all the major social, economic, environmental and technical problems.</jats:p>",

For the period 2001–2019, we investigated the relationship between satellite derived Day of Snow Disappearance (DSD)—the date at which snow has completely disappeared—and the seasonal water supply, i.e., the April—July total streamflow volume, for 15 snow dominated basins across the western U.S. A Monte Carlo framework was applied, using linear regression models to evaluate the predictive skill—defined here as a model’s ability to accurately predict seasonal flow volumes—of varied predictors, including DSD and in situ snow water equivalent (SWE), across a range of spring forecast dates. In all basins there is a statistically significant relationship between mean DSD and seasonal water supply (p ≤ 0.05), with mean DSD explaining roughly half of the variance. Satellite-based model skill improves later in the forecast season, surpassing the skill of in-situ-based (SWE) models in skill in 10 of the 15 basins by the latest forecast date. We found little to no correlation between model error and basin characteristics such as elevation and the ratio of snow water equivalent to total precipitation. Despite a relatively short data record, this exploratory analysis shows promise for improving seasonal water supply prediction, in particular for snow dominated basins lacking in situ observations.</jats:p>"

This work examines 103 academic articles on the topic of the perishable food supply chain published in various journals between 2001 and 2022. Research publications were selected from two reputed databases—Scopus and Web of Science. The study finds that the current trend in FCCM is toward sustainable FCCM, which offers financial, ecological, and social benefits. However, sustainable FCC practices are more common in wealthy nations but are still lacking in developing countries. High lead times, costs, waste, order returns, complaints, and dissatisfied consumers are the results of a fragmented market and the associated proliferation of chain intermediates. The authors have also developed a conceptual framework based on the findings that illustrates the interconnected nature of the food cold-chain facilities, collaboration among food cold-chain (FCC) stakeholders, concern among FCC stakeholders, economic enhancement, fulfilment of FCC stakeholders’ responsibilities, and overall functioning of the FCC. This study may be helpful to FCC professionals, food regulators, government authorities, and researchers because it gives a concise picture of the state of research in the field.</jats:p>"

However, it requires the use of reliable and robust methods and quality of data. In this study, the stochastic nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) method was employed to assess productivity change and eco-productivity change of a sample of Chilean water companies over the period 2010–2018. The StoNED approach overcomes the main limitations of stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis techniques which are the most commonly used to evaluate performance of water companies. Productivity change metric focused on the economic performance, whereas eco-productivity change evaluated economic and quality of service performance by including non-revenue water and unplanned water supply interruptions. Hence, this study analyzed the impact of quality of service variables on the dynamic eco-efficiency of water companies. The annual average productivity change and eco-productivity change estimations were 0.18% and −0.14%, respectively. It was evidenced that on average the Chilean water companies have put as priority to reduce operational costs than to improve quality of service. In both performance metrics, efficiency change was the main contributor to performance changes, whereas the role of technical change was negligible. It was illustrated that full private water companies performed better than concessionary companies and the public company. Reducing non-revenue water and unplanned water supply interruptions was particularly costly for concessionary water companies. The methodology and conclusions of this study are of great interest for water regulators and water utilities to improve the benchmarking process in the provision of drinking water services.</jats:p>"

Two characteristics of donors remain unchanged between 2019 and 2020. Most of them were males and age younger than 25 years old. However, there was a shifting characteristic of donors in blood group, weight, and hemoglobin level. Declined number of blood donations might be caused by the pandemic situation and Ramadhan fasting.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Security of natural gas supply to consumers in Ukraine and Poland in the face of open Russian military aggression in 2022 (comparative study).&#x0D;\nMilitary operations, including Russian attacks on natural gas production sites controlled by Ukraine and network restrictions, have led to a 7 % year- on-year decline in natural gas production and the temporary loss of natural gas access for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian consumers. In 2022, 18,5 bcm of natural gas is likely to have been produced. The autumn suc- cesses on the frontline allowed Ukraine to start clearing damage on reco- vered territories and increase the number of new drillings.&#x0D;\nThe extensive damage to companies using natural gas in production that was caused by Russian attacks and the scale of emigration reduced natural gas consumption in Ukraine by a quarter. Nevertheless, imports were ne- cessary. It was most profitable for the government in Kyiv to bypass transit costs and buy part of the natural gas supplied from Russia via Ukraine to the EU.&#x0D;\nDue to the cost of transit, a smaller part of the gas acquired by Ukraine was from other countries (e.g. Norway). The amount of natural gas (owned and owned by foreign companies) in storage in Ukraine at the end of October was 14,2 bcm. In the end, from its western partners Ukraine probably im- ported a total of only 1,5 bcm. Likely, some of the natural gas owned by foreign counterparties stored in Ukrainian storage facilities was purchased. As of 2021, the demand for Polish customers was lower than for Ukrainian needs. According to preliminary data, some 16,15 bcm of natural gas was sent to Polish consumers in 2022. Probably mainly due to the authorities’ protective moves towards households, natural gas transmission to domestic consumers in Poland fell by only less than 17,5 % compared to 2021. Indus- trial use of natural gas has decreased more.&#x0D;\nThe Polish authorities have completed many investments (or made progress in this area) in natural gas infrastructure long postulated by experts. The degree of depletion of deposits and the high capital intensity of natural gas exploration and production requires a significant increase in investment in natural gas exploration and production to stop the further decline in natural gas production in both countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Contrary to widely used traditional sequence‐stratigraphic models, highstand sublacustrine fans developed in the deep‐water environment in the middle of the third member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es3z, 42–40.5 Ma), Dongying Sag. Using four cores and 3D seismic data, we describe the sequence stratigraphy frameworks, sediment characteristics, depositional elements, and depositional model of the Liangjialou highstand sublacustrine fan. The Es3z is a complete third‐order sequence stratigraphic, bounded by T4 at the top and T6 at the base. Between T4 and T6, there is the maximum flooding surface (MFS) distributed from proximal to distal of the system in the third‐order stratigraphic sequence. Therefore, the Liangjialou Fan at the top of the Es3z, between MFS and T4, is a typical highstand sublacustrine fan as determined from seismic data. This highstand sublacustrine fan is characterised by gravel to fine‐grained sand, abundant amalgamation surfaces, and crude stratifications common in coarse‐grained structureless‐ to normal‐ graded sandstones. Climbing ripples and thin laminae rich in plant debris are common in inverse‐then normal‐graded sandstones. Channel‐levee, channel‐lobe transition zone, and lobes developed in this highstand sublacustrine fan, with clear internal progradation stacking patterns caused by hyperpycnal flow. The sudden increase in sediment supply in an accommodation decrease situation and the narrow shelf width are the primary controlling factors for forming highstand sublacustrine fans. In the late stage of the highstand systems tract, gravity‐flow deposits caused by hyperpycnal flow are developed from another new point source to form this highstand sublacustrine fan. Hyperpycnal flow in lacustrine basins can transport coarse‐grained sediments with the help of strong flood energy and steep slopes. Gravity flow deposits in lacustrine basins are not confined by sequence stratigraphy frameworks, and many additional areas of sand caused by hyperpycnal flow could be found in lacustrine basins.</jats:p>",

Also, using a geographical information system (GIS), the study area is located to identify the surface and groundwater sources. From the GIS data, a detailed map is prepared to conduct the physical verification and collect the water quality measurement. From the population forecast, it was identified that 435,000 and 480,300 l of water are required to meet the water demand in the year 2031 Namunaghar and Wander Panchayat, respectively. It also assessed the GIS data and found out potential water sources of 157 (67 wells, 58 ponds, and other minor sources) and 485 (215 wells, 229 ponds, and other minor sources) at Namunaghar and Wandoor Panchayats, respectively.

Till now, none considered the pricing of substitute bundles, produced and sold at the manufacturer’s level. Considering these, the effects of the above cognitive behaviours on the bundling pricing strategy are investigated. We develop several SC models, depending on the partner’s cognitive biases, with two manufacturers, producing substitute bundles of two uncorrelated items and selling through a retailer. Using the Stackelberg game, prices and profits are evaluated. It is observed that overconfidence does not increase retailer’s and overconfident – manufacturer’s profits but is beneficial for another rational manufacturer. Against the retailer’s fairness concern, her profit is augmented, but both manufacturers’ profits are adversely affected. The combined effect of both cognitive biases is adjuvant for the retailer but maleficent for manufacturers. Managerial insights are presented.</jats:p>",

The\n extreme annual average values of the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP) obtained are 3.48 and 4.55. In the system, with recharging the borehole, the net energy extracted from the ground is decreased by 30.4% compared to the reference case (GSHP). This can reduce the ground thermal\n imbalance problem, which positively affects the stability of the operational system.</jats:p>",

These pesticides are used to reduce the number of pesticides by different mechanisms. They have been utilized in agriculture to expand agrarian profit, crop yield, quality, and storage life. The incessant and extensive use of resistant pesticides has contaminated the water bodies, fields, crops, and aquatic biota as well as poses a threat to human health. As a result, stringent regulations and limits are established to monitor the pesticide matrix. The current review focuses on pesticide contamination in the food chain, particularly from the aquatic bodies to fishes and humans. It also discusses strict regulations and limits including maximum residual limits for food items, acceptable daily intake, theoretical maximum daily intake, and estimated carcinogenicity/non-carcinogenicity for fishes and human health risks. In addition to conferring the negative effects of pesticides, this article discusses cost-effective remediation techniques such as phytoremediation, adsorption, the Fenton oxidation method, microalgal/high-rate algal ponds, and nanotechnology with the comparison of their remediation cost.</jats:p>"

However, there has not been much discussion of implementing CE activities in literature, especially in the FSCs. The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers for implementing CE in the FSC. Barriers are identified from past academic literature and are finalized based on the fuzzy‐Delphi method. Nine experts provided their opinions to develop the contextual relationship between identified barriers using the DEMATEL with Neutrosophic set theory. As per the findings, top management commitment is crucial for the successful adoption of CE throughout the FSC followed by poor corporate social responsibility. The novelty lies in identification of the barriers for implementing CE in FSC using Neutrosophic theory. This study will assist professionals in developing advantageous ways for adopting the CE to gain sustained competitive advantage in the FSC. Managers and planners can better understand and implement CE strategies in the FSC. The FSC can become more sustainable in a number of ways by using the CE concepts.</jats:p>",

Variability of this kind provides a rich source of material to uncover molecular mechanisms supporting the necessarily divergent physiological traits. In this study, typical field-optimized and glasshouse-cultivated cucumber F1 hybrids were investigated, and displayed slower growth (‘Joker’) and faster growth (‘Oitol’) in seedlings. Antioxidant capacity was lower in ‘Joker’ and higher in ‘Oitol’, pointing to a potential redox regulation of growth. The growth response of seedlings to paraquat treatment indicated stronger oxidative stress tolerance in the fast-growing ‘Oitol’. To test whether protection against nitrate-induced oxidative stress was also different, fertigation with increasing potassium nitrate content was applied. This treatment did not change growth but decreased the antioxidant capacities of both hybrids. Bioluminescence emission revealed stronger lipid peroxidation triggered by high nitrate fertigation in the leaves of ‘Joker’ seedlings. To explore the background of the more effective antioxidant protection of ‘Oitol’, levels of ascorbic acid (AsA), as well as transcriptional regulation of relevant genes of the Smirnoff–Wheeler biosynthetic pathway and ascorbate recycling, were investigated. Genes related to AsA biosynthesis were strongly upregulated at an elevated nitrate supply in ‘Oitol’ leaves only, but this was only reflected in a small increase in total AsA content. High nitrate provision also triggered expression of ascorbate–glutathion cycle genes with stronger or exclusive induction in ‘Oitol’. AsA/dehydro–ascorbate ratios were higher in ‘Oitol’ for all treatments, with a more pronounced difference at high nitrate levels. Despite strong transcriptional upregulation of ascorbate peroxidase genes (APX) in ‘Oitol’, APX activity only increased significantly in ‘Joker’. This suggests potential inhibition of APX enzyme activity specifically in ‘Oitol’ at a high nitrate supply. Our results uncover an unexpected variability in redox stress management in cucumbers, including nitrate inducibility of AsA biosynthetic and recycling pathways in certain genotypes. Possible connections between AsA biosynthesis, recycling and nitro-oxidative stress protection are discussed. Cucumber hybrids emerge as an excellent model system for studying the regulation of AsA metabolism and the roles of AsA in growth and stress tolerance.</jats:p>"

First, combined with the literature, the identification and management of the service SC domestically and internationally are explained, providing a meaningful reference for improving sports service bases. Second, fuzzy comprehensive appraisal (FCA) algorithm process and artificial intelligence (AI) technology are used to evaluate and manage the risk of sports service SC. The FCA algorithm provides a comprehensive evaluation factor set for the sports service SC risk evaluation. Then, the complete evaluation set is established. To obtain the evaluation matrix, the ‘expert’ carries out fuzzy evaluation on each single factor. AI provides a data analysis platform for integrated SC risk management. The platform can realize the logical hierarchical relationship between indicators and rules, systematically standardize the sports service SC and rules, and conduct unified display, monitoring, and trend analysis. Finally, the FCA method is used to evaluate the risks of the sports service SC, and the results of the comprehensive management of the dangers of the SC are analysed. The results show that the evaluation indicators of sports service venues' SC service capabilities have a good consistency. The highest weight score of government service capability in the sports service SC is 0.2413, and the lowest weight score of the service capability index of the sports operation platform is 0.1708. Sports service venues' SC capacity in NANCHANG City is relatively average. This article deeply understands the structure of the sports service SC. It provides relevant basis and guidance for sports service integrators, service providers, and other market entities to adjust management strategies and improve market competitiveness. It also clarifies the risks and management results of the sports service SC, provides academic help for the researchers and enriches and develops the theory of the reform and construction of the Chinese sports service SC.</jats:p>",

Current research on the supply and management of medical devices in the context of healthcare reform mainly focuses on the downstream of the supply chain to innovate the management model of orthopedic consumables in hospitals and realize competent healthcare. However, only a few studies have focused on medical device manufacturers upstream of the supply chain and proposed measures to improve supply chain performance. This paper takes a medium-sized customer medical device manufacturer in China as a case study. This study analyzes the problems revealed in its supply chain operation through literature research, case study analysis, and fieldwork. It proposes countermeasures for the continuous improvement of the industry against the background of healthcare reform. The study found that small and medium-sized medical device manufacturers were not using management information systems adequately and were suffering from the impact of healthcare reform by sticking to their old distribution models. For long-term growth, these small and medium-sized medical companies should focus on research and development, cater to market needs, integrate downstream distributors, and work with hospitals to establish a more transparent and efficient healthcare supply chain.</jats:p>"

The hypotheses generated are tested with structural equation modeling. The sample size was 276 cases. The findings support the importance of governance form and relation‐specific resources as operant resources, as well as the importance of the latter in amplifying the governance form's effect. Five operant resources are identified: information sharing, governance form, relation‐specific resources, trust, and relational commitment.

Additionally, the implementation of blockchain technology in the supply chain is required to accomplish the objectives of industry 4.0. However, there has to date been a scarcity of blockchain implementations due to the numerous barriers associated with it. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to identify and investigate the major barriers to implementing blockchain technology in supply chains. We identified ten significant barriers to adopting blockchain technology through a literature review and expert opinions. Additionally, the finalized barriers were categorized into an influential and influenced group using the DEMATEL method. The findings of this study show that 'influential group' barriers require more attention from the supply chain partners to mitigate these barriers. The primary influential barriers are 'Lack of information sharing,' 'Trust management issues,' and 'Lack of upgraded technologies’, and these barriers require immediate attention from supply chain stakeholders wishing to use blockchain. These findings contribute to improving managerial decisions and digital strategies regarding blockchain within organisations, and how implementation can effectively be achieved.</jats:p>",

The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) is heavily dependent upon ditch irrigation to deliver water from the Rio Grande River to support its staple crop production. To date, no studies have been conducted to quantify the water quality and its variations along the distribution system. This research measured water quality parameters at seven sites in LRGV irrigation water in 2021. Chemical indices including salinity hazard (SH), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (Na%), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's Ratio (KR), and permeability index (PI) were calculated. Classification diagrams were prepared. Results revealed the locations that had doubtful water for irrigation use and more problematic water quality index levels. June and August had the highest index levels, which may have been attributable to the large rainfall events in May and July. The SH, Na%, KR, and MH indices exceeded recommended levels. ANOVA analyses showed significant temporal variations in SAR, RSC, MH, KR, and PI. These findings indicate the importance of incorporating water quality spatiotemporal variation information in routine irrigation planning and management.</jats:p>",

To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines whether environmental management systems influence the link between GSCM practice and market competitiveness. We also propose the articulating role of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and environmental visibility towards these associations in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. We evaluated the proposed model using regression-based structural equation modeling (SEM) with primary data (n = 330). This result provides empirical evidence of the impact of GSCM on EMS and market competitiveness. Moreover, the results show that the BDA-AI and the environmental visibility enhanced the positive relationship between GSCM-EMS and EMS and market competitiveness.

In wet soil (soil water potential &amp;gt; -50 kPa), upper canopy leaves had the highest <jats:italic>g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> (0.727 ± 0.154 mol m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and assimilation rate (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>; 23.4 ± 3.9 µmol m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) compared to the leaves at a medium height of the canopy (<jats:italic>g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>: 0.159 ± 0.060 mol m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>; <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>: 15.9 ± 3.8 µmol m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>). Under increasing <jats:italic>VPD</jats:italic> (from 1.8 to 2.6 kPa), <jats:italic>g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>, <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> and transpiration were initially impacted by leaf position rather than leaf age. However, under high <jats:italic>VPD</jats:italic> (2.6 kPa), age effect outweighed position effect. The soil-leaf hydraulic conductance was similar in all leaves. Foliage ABA levels increased with rising <jats:italic>VPD</jats:italic> in mature leaves at medium height (217.56 ± 85 ng g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> FW) compared to upper canopy leaves (85.36 ± 34 ng g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> FW). Under soil drought (&amp;lt; -50 kPa), stomata closed in all leaves resulting in no differences in <jats:italic>g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> across the canopy. We conclude that constant hydraulic supply and ABA dynamics facilitate preferential stomatal behavior and carbon-water trade-offs across the canopy. These findings are fundamental in understanding variations within the canopy, which helps in engineering future crops, especially in the face of climate change.</jats:p>"

Moreover, stevia leaves contain high amount of antioxidants. The use of plant compounds as components of functional nutrition and nutraceuticals is extremely relevant today. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of increased nitrogen and saccharose supply on growth and accumulation of steviosides and anthocyanins as well as antioxidative activity in fast-growing shoot cultures of S. rebaudiana. The morphological changes of the leaves, the accumulation of steviosides and anthocyanins, and the antioxidant properties of the extracts were determined. It was shown that during three weeks of in vitro cultivation of shoots on MS medium with double concentration of nitrogen, the biomass increased by 71.0%, after application of double concentration of saccharose – by 133%, and after increasing nitrogen in combination with saccharose supply – by 162.0% compared to the control. Sucrose stimulated the accumulation of biomass. Anti-oxidative potential after nitrogen application was 2.4 times higher than the control, and with saccharose supply it increased 2.7 times. Shoots treated with increased nitrogen and saccharose concentration contained 50.7 and 57.8 mg/g-1 steviosides, respectively. However, the combination of nitrogen and saccharose led to accumulation of 73.4 1 mg/g-1 steviosides. Shoots grown on MS medium culture had 26.0 mg/g-1 of steviosides. The content of anthocyanins was 1.7 times greater under added nitrogen supply, and 2.3 times greater after the application of nitrogen and saccharose. Optimum cultivation media developed individually for each in vitro culture increase the production of valuable plant secondary metabolites up to 3 times</jats:p>",

Several existing solutions focus on increasing the transaction count, but none of them address scalability challenges introduced by resource-constrained IoT device integration with these blockchains, especially for the purpose of supply chain ownership management. Thus, this paper solves the issue by proposing a scalable public blockchain-based protocol for the interoperable ownership transfer of tagged goods, suitable for use with resource-constrained IoT devices such as widely used Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. The use of a public blockchain is crucial for the proposed solution as it is essential to enable transparent ownership data transfer, guarantee data integrity, and provide on-chain data required for the protocol. A decentralized web application developed using the Ethereum blockchain and an InterPlanetary File System is used to prove the validity of the proposed lightweight protocol. A detailed security analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed lightweight protocol is secure from key disclosure, replay, man-in-the-middle, de-synchronization, and tracking attacks. The proposed scalable protocol is proven to support secure data transfer among resource-constrained RFID tags while being cost-effective at the same time.</jats:p>"

The retailer’s optimal order quantity, price, and the manufacturer’s wholesale price are derived assuming additive uncertainty in demand. The possibility of negative demand realizations, which may occur in adverse market circumstances, is verified in the investigated models. It was proved that the imposition of the non-negativity prerequisite on demand is vital to obtain complete results. The non-negativity constraint in this study incorporates consumer’s returns handling costs which is different than the previously used constraint.

The comprehensive approach includes a combination of methods of the factor analysis, the method of principal components and correlation and the regression analysis. The authors propose summary indicators of the components of economic potential that maximally reflect the adaptation of enterprises to modern conditions of economic management. On the basis of the correlation and regression analysis the integral indicator of economic potential evaluation has been calculated, the implementation of which will allow to build an effective system of spatial management of adaptation of economic potential of the company in circular economy. The practical value of the obtained results consists in substantiation of the spatial management of adaptation of the enterprise economic potential in conditions of circular economy by means of the suggested methodology of calculation of the economic potential level.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a new method based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is proposed to evaluate the irrigation water use efficiency of cotton fields in Xinjiang. The super efficiency DEA model is established by introducing the super efficiency DEA method and adjusting the predicted amount and actual amount of irrigation water use. Genetic algorithm is used to improve the super-efficiency DEA model. The indexes obtained include the indexes reflecting water resources conditions, water use situation and economic aspects, and the statistical sequence model of cotton field irrigation water information is established. Given the demand and actual usage of irrigation water for cotton fields, the numerical relationship between the demand and usage was defined by integrating the two indices as the index data set. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the water consumption of cotton field irrigation, and the efficiency of irrigation water consumption can reach 90%.</jats:p>",

This article builds on previous scholarship by: first, improving the market characteristics under examination; second, introducing multidimensional constructs for modeling community need; third, applying methodologies that account for spatial dependencies; and fourth, replicating the sector-wide analysis in two nonprofit subsectors. Results indicate consistency across subsector and suggest greater nonprofit supply in areas with less even markets and greater population. Contrary to popular conception, findings indicate evidence of less nonprofit supply in areas with greater demand and some potential “crowding-in” where nonprofit supply rises coincident with for-profit supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, environmental pollution and resource waste have become the focus of heated discussion around the world. In order to realize green and sustainable development, the development of green supply chain (GSC) has attracted the attention of many scholars. The research object of this paper is the dual-channel green supply chain (DGSC) composed of online channels and offline channels. The supplier is the leader of the entire DGSC, and it needs to optimize the wholesale price of the product and the level of green investment to maximize its own benefit. In addition, the supplier also needs to establish contracts with network sales platform (NSP) and store sales platform (SSP) to increase the benefit of NSP and SSP, and ultimately increase the benefit level of the entire DGSC. Among them, we constructed a centralized decision (CD) model and a decentralized decision (DD) model, and obtained the optimal pricing, optimal greenness and optimal benefit of the supplier, NSP and SSP under the two models. We found that the benefits of SC members under the DD model are generally lower than those of the CC model. Therefore, we built contracts between the supplier, NSP and SSP to coordinate. Finally, we substituted specific parameters to verify the model. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) When consumers prefer online sales channels, it will positively affect the online sales price, online sales volume and greenness level of DGSC. At the same time, it negatively affects offline sales price and sales volume. (ii) The benefit of DGSC and the benefit of NSP, SSP, and the supplier show a phenomenon of decline first and then increase with respect to consumers’ preference for online sales channels. (iii) Under the coordination contract, the subsidy factor positively affects the benefits of the supplier and online and offline wholesale prices, and negatively affects the benefits of online platforms and physical stores. </jats:p>",

The objectives are to efficiently manage an urban farm’s food, energy, and water resources, decrease food waste, and increase the food availability for the local community. A case study of eleven farms was investigated in Vancouver, Canada to study the linkages between the resources in the urban food, energy, and water nexus. Each urban farm in the simulation belonged to a community microgrid generating electricity from solar and wind. The local farms aimed to provide fresh produce for their respective local communities. However, at some points, they lacked supply, and at other points, there was excess supply, leading to food waste. Food waste can be converted into fertilizers or bioenergy. However, an alternative solution must be employed due to the natural resources required for production, efficiently managing resources, and adhering to sustainability guidelines. In this paper, an optimization framework was integrated within the agent-based model to create a micro supply chain. The supply chain directly linked the producers with the consumers by severing the links involved in a traditional food supply. Each urban farm in the study collaborated to reduce food wastage and meet consumer demands, establishing farmer-to-farmer exchange in transitional agriculture. The optimization-based micro supply chain aimed to minimize costs and meet the equilibrium between food supply and demand. Regular communication between the farms reduced food waste by 96.9% over 16 weeks. As a result, the fresh food availability increased for the local community, as exemplified by the consumer purchases over the same period. Moreover, the simulation results indicated that the renewable energy generation at the community microgrids aided in the generation of 22,774 Mwh from solar and 2568 Mwh from wind. This has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in areas that heavily rely on non-renewable energy sources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>This paper discusses the performance of the Bernoulli Polynomial‐based artificial neural network (BePANN) for the control of a single‐phase grid‐integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) system. A single‐phase, single‐stage topology of a grid‐integrated PV system is utilized to feed nonlinear loads at the point of common coupling. The fundamental load component is extracted from distorted load current using a single‐layer neural network. There are several control techniques mentioned in the literature for load compensation. However, many techniques show slower convergence response, higher oscillations, and a large computational burden. The designed BePANN controller attenuates harmonic components from nonlinear current and improves the power quality (PQ) under normal and distorted grid conditions. The single‐layer BePANN control has a simplified structure based on several polynomial terms; this reduces the computational burden and complexity of the controller. The objective of the designed controller is to fulfill the load's active power demand from the generated solar PV power and feed the excess power back to the grid when surplus. When solar PV is not integrated with the grid, the voltage source converter acts as a distribution static compensator, improving the system's utilization factor. The proposed control technique is simulated in MATLAB Simulink, and results are experimentally verified through laboratory prototype under normal and abnormal grid conditions. The application of higher order polynomials for PV‐integrated systems with multifunctional PQ capabilities has been implemented for the first time in this article. The main outcomes of the proposed control technique are solving current‐related PQ issues and reactive power compensation and providing improved power factor under both normal and distorted polluted grids.</jats:p>",

Here, we present consumption and supply-based hypoxia (CSH) imaging, an approach that integrates images related to oxygen consumption and supply into a single image. This integration algorithm was developed in patients with prostate cancer receiving hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to prostatectomy. We exploited the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) signal in diagnostic diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images to generate separate images of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional blood volume (fBV). ADC and fBV correlated with cell density (CD) and blood vessel density (BVD) in histology and whole-mount sections from 35 patients, thus linking ADC to oxygen consumption and fBV to oxygen supply. Pixel-wise plots of ADC versus fBV were utilized to predict the hypoxia status of each pixel in a tumor and to visualize the predicted value in a single image. The hypoxic fraction (HF&lt;sub&gt;DWI&lt;/sub&gt;) of CSH images correlated strongly (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.66; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) with pimonidazole immunoscore (HS&lt;sub&gt;Pimo&lt;/sub&gt;); this relationship was validated in a second pimonidazole cohort (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.54; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54). We observed good agreement between CSH images and pimonidazole staining in whole-mount sections. HF&lt;sub&gt;DWI&lt;/sub&gt; correlated with tumor stage and lymph node status, consistent with findings for HS&lt;sub&gt;Pimo&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, CSH imaging could be applied on histologic CD and BVD images, demonstrating transferability to a histopathology assay. Thus, CSH represents a robust approach for hypoxia imaging in prostate cancer that could easily be translated into clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance:&lt;/b&gt; These findings present a novel imaging strategy that indirectly measures tumor hypoxia and has potential application in a wide variety of solid tumors and other imaging modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graphical Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/16/4774/F1.large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/16/4774/F1.large.jpg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Cancer Res; 78(16); 4774–85. ©2018 AACR&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Investment Savings-Liquidity preference Money supply (IS-LM) model is represented as a graph depicting the intersection of products and the money market. It elaborates how an equilibrium of money supply versus interest rates may keep the economy in control. In this paper, we combine the basic business cycle IS-LM model with Kaldor’s growth model in order to create an augmented model. The IS-LM model, when coupled with a certain economics expansion (in our instance, the Kaldor–Kalecki Business Cycle Model), provides a comprehensive description of a developing but robust economy. Right after the introduction of capital stock into the system, it cannot be employed and also, while making some investment choices, this requires some time in execution, which ultimately alters resources, i.e. capital. Thus, in the capital accumulation, we will be incorporating double time delays in Gross product and Capital Stock. These time delays represent the time periods during which investment decisions were made and executed and the time spent in order for the capital to be put to productive use. After formulating a mathematical model using delayed differential equations, dynamic functioning of the system around equilibrium point is examined where three instances appeared based on time delays. These cases are: when both delays are not in action, when only one delay is in action and when both delays are in action. It is shown that time delay affects the stability of the equilibrium point and, as the delay crosses a critical point, Hopf bifurcation exists. It is observed that by using Kaldor type investment function, the delay residing in capital stock only will destabilize in less time as compared to when both the delays are present in the system. The system is sensitive to certain parameters which is also analyzed in this work.</jats:p>",

We analyze the socioeconomic effects - defined as health gains, lockdown-easing effect, and supply-chain rebuilding benefit - of a set of idealized COVID-19 vaccine distribution scenarios. We find that an equitable vaccine distribution across the world would increase global economic benefits by 11.7% ($950 billion per year), compared to a scenario focusing on vaccinating the entire population within vaccine-producing countries first and then distributing vaccines to non-vaccine-producing countries. With limited doses among low-income countries, prioritizing the elderly who are at high risk of dying, together with the key front-line workforce who are at high risk of exposure is projected to be economically beneficial (e.g., 0.9%~3.4% annual GDP in India). Our results reveal how equitable distributions would cascade more protection of vaccines to people and ways to improve vaccine equity and accessibility globally through international collaboration.</jats:p>"

In order to determine indicators in a CSR-intensive environment, data, and literature, the energy sector publications on EUR-Lex, international and European official papers, and the online site of the European Commission data sources were analyzed in this study. The indicators were divided into groups based on their sources (sets of standards and guidelines, council frameworks, document series, tools, and comprehensive legislation), as well as their intended uses (financial, social, and environmental).\nFindings\nThe findings state that supply chain collaboration completely fulfills CSR for a viable economy. It focuses on three leading fashion brands and assesses their impact using open-source data, past research, and their official websites. It also highlights how, in comparison to global corporations, Pakistani business satisfies their corporate social responsibility. \nConclusion\nIt is concluded that a supply chain can help companies minimize the environmental impact of their supply chain processes. Further, CSR is a part of the supply chain that helps businesses determine their social and economic responsibilities by focusing on environmental aspects to add to a more sustainable economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia are recommended to receive anti- biotic therapy. In case of severe pneumonia in hospital, infusion of Amoxicillin preparations is used. In the Russian pharmaceutical market during the study period, there are no solutions for parenteral administration in pediatric dosages, which leads to high financial losses of medical organization and environmental risks in the disposal of antibiotics. Objective of the study evaluation of losses of drug weight and financial losses when using «adult» doses of anti- bacterial agents for infusion therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in children (on the example of the drug «Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, powder for preparation of solution for intravenous injection»). Materials and methods the objects of the study were clinical guidelines on treatment of community-acquired pneu- monia in children, information from the State Register of Medicines, instructions for medical use. The source of data on prices was the information from the State Register of maximum selling prices. Analytical, statistical, logical, and computational-constructive methods of re- search were used in the work. Results: the study calculated the material losses of the drug in mg per vial and 12 vials (treat- ment course of 4 days). With a single therapeutic dose of 300 mg, the material losses of the drug, using a dosage of 1200 mg, were: 1200 - 300 = 900 mg (75% of the dosage form). Fi- nancial losses in rubles calculated for the course of treatment with the drug Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid 1200 mg amounted to 756.00 rubles (79.05%) per 1 child, and for treatment with the dosage of 600 mg - 252.00 rubles (52.70% of the cost of the drug). The development of the dosage forms for intravenous administration of Amoxicillin + clavu- lanic acid in the doses of 180 and 240 mg would allow decreasing considerably the losses of the drug during preparation of infusion solutions in pediatric practice. Conclusion 1. When administering antibacterial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in chil- dren, the drug Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, powder for preparation of solution for intrave- nous injection, manufactured in doses of 1200 mg and 600 mg, is used. 2. Modeling of weight losses of Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid powder for intravenous solu- tion preparation for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 1 year showed that when 1200 mg dosage was used, losses were 900 mg/ vial (10800 mg per treat- ment course), and in 600 mg dosage - 300 mg/ vial (3600 mg per course); 75 and 50% of drug weight respectively. 3. Calculations have been made and significant financial losses have been established in treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years old with the drug «Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, powder for preparation of solution for intravenous injection» 1200 mg and 600 mg, due to incomplete use of the package. The financial loss for the course of treatment with the drug Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid in the dosage of 1200 mg amounted to 756.00 rubles (79.05%) for 1 child aged 1 year, and for treatment with the dosage of 600 mg - 252.00 rubles (52.70% of the cost of the drug for the course of treatment). 4. For treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 5-11 years it is reason- able to use Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid 600 mg dosage. 5. For treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years old it is advis- able to commercially release the medicinal product «Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, powder for preparation of solution for intravenous injection» in doses of 180 mg (150+30 mg) and 240 mg (200+40 mg).</jats:p>",

This remains the case in Vietnam, a country that has achieved phenomenal economic growth and raised the educational attainment of the public. This paper examines the impact of language policy reorientation represented by the textbook supply program in Vietnam on the ethnic gap in children's learning measured by a vocabulary test. Applying difference‐in‐differences estimation to the Young Lives data between 2006 and 2015, we show that the program became more effective in narrowing the ethnic gap as the education policy became reoriented toward ethnic minority children. A causal mediation analysis reveals that increased study time is possibly a moderate mediator through which the language policy reorientation helped narrow the ethnic gap for the young cohort over and above the direct impact, but this was not the case for the old cohort. This paper, therefore, alludes to the importance of delivering learning materials carefully designed for the target group to bring about meaningful behavioral changes. It also underscores the importance of teaching in the right context, corroborating the findings from recent studies on teaching at the right level.</jats:p>",

To study the impacts of both the retail price uncertainty risk and retail price risk aversion preference on supply chain (SC) decision-making, we constructed a SC game model based on three different power structures, including Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) game, Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game, and Vertical Nash (VN) game. The results showed that the retail price uncertainty risk and the retailer’s retail price risk aversion preference weakened the manufacturer’s production effort input, decreased the retailer’s enthusiasm for ordering, and damaged the interests of manufacturer and retailer. Under the three different power structures, the production effort input of the manufacturer depended on the production effort affecting wholesale price efficiency and retail price efficiency. The retailer’s expected utility was largest under the MS game model and smallest under the VN game model. The manufacturer’s profits were closely related to each parameter under the three respective power structures. This study provides theoretical guidance for the decision-making of SC enterprises with retail price risk and retailer with retail price risk aversion preference under different power structure situations.</jats:p>",

The complaints are often offset by goodwill commitments from suppliers at great cost to them and delivery delays and lead time costs for customers. The reason is that the industry relies on several non-standardized classification systems for surface quality that are based on various combinations of and designations for surface defects, assessed by visual inspections at a defined distance to determine the severity of any detected surface deviations. These similar classification systems provide far too much scope for subjective and non-repeatable assessments causing communication problems between customer and producer at all stages in the supply chain. To challenge this situation, a common toolbox to communicate, describe and define surface quality should be developed, i.e. a standardisation of surface quality assessment including various effects and defects with a jointly established nomenclature and evaluation parameters. This work presents the first step of a research project bringing together 11 suppliers and OEMs along the supply chain, from the delivery of raw aluminium to finished alumina profiles included in consumer products. The final goal of the project is to develop an ‘objective classification of visual requirements’ on alumina profiles towards increased sustainability and decreased material wastage. Presented result is a common terminology with links to the process chain, surface defect geometry and visual appearance aiming at making the communication between producers and buyers of the aluminium profiles clearer and more unambiguous when it comes to specification and requirements of profile surfaces in each of the supply-chain links. Future work will add measurable parameters specifying surface quality.</jats:p>",

As these systems evolve, the integration of emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), offers transformative opportunities to expand ERP capabilities. This paper explores the current landscape of ERP systems in manufacturing and retail, examining their market share and assessing how LLMs can augment ERP functions such as demand forecasting, data analysis, and decision-making. By conducting an in-depth analysis of market dynamics, technical feasibility, and benefit- cost assessments, this study provides insights into how AI-driven advancements can reshape ERP systems, improving automation, data processing, and overall organizational performance. Additionally, the research evaluates the scalability of LLM-driven ERP systems across different industries and forecasts adoption rates over the next decade. The findings suggest that while LLM-enhanced ERP systems offer significant potential to revolutionize enterprise resource planning, challenges related to high computational costs, technical complexity, biases in AI models, and data privacy concerns remain critical hurdles to widespread adoption. Nonetheless, as AI technologies advance and industries adapt, LLM-driven ERP systems are poised to play an increasingly vital role in the future of business operations.</jats:p>"

However, how the government can reasonably formulate low carbon policies and how enterprises can implement optimal low-carbon production decisions are still key issues in China’s low-carbon transition development. In this context, this paper is based on the carbon trading mechanism and carbon consumption subsidies. In this context, based on the carbon trading mechanism, this paper focuses on green production and green consumption, considers the impact of low-carbon consumer preferences and government subsidies on enterprises’ low-carbon production decisions, and uses the optimal theory to study the optimal pricing strategy and the optimal carbon reduction strategy. The study shows that the increase in carbon price has a positive effect on the increase in enterprise profit; the increase of carbon emission has a negative effect on the increase of enterprise profit and the high carbon price will intensify this effect. In addition, changing the intensity of government subsidies to consumers will lead to the change of enterprise carbon emission strategy. The study of this paper provides a certain reference for the government to reasonably formulate carbon trading prices and consumer low-carbon subsidies. In addition, considering consumer low-carbon preferences is also conducive to promoting green production practices of enterprises, thus promoting the realization of the carbon neutral strategy.</jats:p>"

Difference‐in‐differences estimates based on eight years of data from over 1,800 factories show that the interventions were associated with an average real wage increase of approximately 5% by the third year of implementation. Our estimates suggest that the intervention‐associated wage increase was many times greater than if the retailer's cost for the program was instead paid directly to affected workers. We find that the wage effects were driven by factories with relatively poorer supplier ratings and do not find significantly different wage effects depending on the presence of trade unions. We also examine several nonwage outcomes such as factory orders, supplier price competitiveness, overtime pay, and total employment to probe the mechanisms underlying the wage increases. These findings offer new evidence on corporate social impact in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

This research focuses on the potential geochemical link between hammerscale and smelting derived slag inclusion contained in the metallic iron. In the frame of previous research, the smithing practice of African Dogon craftsmen (Mali) has been recorded in details. Different samples were collected including, slag, hammerscale, metal. Two different groups of iron bars produced by different bloomery process and more than one hundred experimental pieces of hammerscale were chemically investigated in situ by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) and by X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry (WD-XRF) in Fribourg / Switzerland. A small part of them was also analyzed by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in Orléans / France. The results show a strong contamination of the hammerscale by the working environment (flux, ashes, sand, etc.) impacting the concentrations of most of non-reducible elements, in particular the most abundant ones (Si, Al, K, Ca). However, several in situ analyses revealed abnormal high contents of Ti, Mn, Zr in contrast to the chemical composition of the forging environment. The concentrations of these elements are affected by contamination but the ratios, in this context, remain unchanged. TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Zr ratios measured in slag inclusion are consistent with the ratios measured in hammerscale produced from the same iron type. Those results support that hammerscale could still carry the chemical signature of the smelting system and thus the geochemical fingerprint of the iron worked. Applying this methodology on archeological hammerscale would make it possible to assess the chemical diversity of worked irons and to provide information about the primary ore sources. Improving our current knowledge of the workshop iron supplies and therefore the circulation of iron in the past times.</jats:p>",

This significantly impacts the voltage, network loss, and protection of the distribution network, thus putting higher requirements on the planning and control, power quality management, operation, and maintenance of distribution networks. Since the traditional OPF algorithm has great defects in solving large-scale decentralized, time-series, and stochastic nonlinear problems, in order to realize real-time control of distribution networks under more complex network conditions, this paper proposes an optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning and applies it to real-time control of active distribution networks, taking the optimal network loss as the objective function and considering network voltage, line load factor, and distributed power supply. As a de-modeling artificial intelligence method, reinforcement learning has great advantages in solving large problems with complex mathematical models. The method’s control effect and convergence time can be improved by introducing imitation learning and migration learning, expanding the knowledge matrix, and introducing risk assessment mechanisms. Based on MATLAB R2017a simulation platform for the IEEE 33-node improvement model, the simulation results show that the reinforcement learning method has a better control effect in solving the real-time control problem of active distribution network, significantly alleviates the voltage crossing limit, effectively reduces the network loss, and has good real-time characteristics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water distribution networks (WDNs) in urban areas are predominantly underground for seamless freshwater transmission. As a result, monitoring their health is often complicated, requiring expensive equipment and methodologies. This study proposes a low-cost approach to locating leakages in WDNs in an urban setting, leveraging acoustic signal behavior and machine learning. An inexpensive noise logger was used to collect acoustic signals from the water mains. The signals underwent empirical mode decomposition, feature extraction, and denoising to separate pure leak signals from background noises. Two regression machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and ensemble k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), were then employed to predict the leak’s location using the features as input. The SVM achieved a validation accuracy of 82.50%, while the k-NN achieved 83.75%. Since the study proposes using single noise loggers, classification k-NN and decision trees (DTs) were used to predict the leak’s direction. The k-NN performed better than the DT, with a validation accuracy of 97.50%, while the latter achieved 78.75%. The models are able to predict leak locations in water mains in urban settings, as the study was conducted in a similar setting.</jats:p>"

In the restrictive archetype, buying firms that are aware of their dependence on their suppliers use mediated power through contracts, with suppliers perceiving distributive injustice and developing ways to circumvent the brands. In the relational archetype, the awareness of craftmanship-induced buyer dependence leads buying firms to use non-mediated power through collaboration, but suppliers still do not perceive distributive justice, as there is no business security or future orders.

In order to overcome the impact of solar randomness on the energy supply of a distributed solar system, this paper proposes a solar tri-generation supply system which integrates a photovoltaic/thermal collector (PV/T), a heat pump (HP), and an absorption chiller (AC). The PV/T-HP integration system is adopted to provide stable heating for a building and AC. The system model is established in TRNSYS software, and its performance is evaluated based on energy, exergy, and economic aspects. The results demonstrate that the system effectively meets the load demand, with an energy efficiency of 32.98% and an exergy efficiency of 17.62%. The payback period (PP) is 7.77 years. Compared with the systems proposed in the other literature, the performance of the proposed system has a certain extent of advantage. Furthermore, the equipment and system exergy performance decline with an increase in the intensity of solar radiation. Increasing the PV/T area effectively improves the system’s profitability within the actual roof area limitation of the building. Moreover, increasing the capacity of the low-temperature heat pump after 68 kW improves the system efficiency and reduces the payback period. In summary, this paper proposes an efficient distributed solar energy system that is suitable for urban building energy supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article describes strategies and policies for compost development based on the potential value-addition (VA) of waste raw materials and the problems faced in the supply chain. This research, which was conducted in the central area of smallholder oil palm plantations in Jambi province in Indonesia, is important because it is an integral part of the oil palm farmer's household independence efforts in the face of temporary income loss during the oil palm replanting program. In general, this study aims to develop a supply chain management strategy to maintain added value stability by ensuring the availability and price stability of the supply of waste raw materials, and product marketing policies in dealing with a single buyer (monopsony market). The data collected consisted of group historical data, interviews, and participatory observations. The method of analysis was descriptive based on data analysis using a value-added approach in a supply chain management framework. The research results show that: 1) the compost developed is not only able to provide VA but also encourages an increase in the selling value of the waste, 2) varies VA of is waste influenced by the price factor compared to the proportion of its use, 3) the VA is quite sensitive to changes on output price. The problem encountered in the downstream supply chain is the increase in the price of raw material for solid waste in cowsheds due to the gap between demand and supply. The level of availability of raw materials for cowshed solid waste depends on efforts to accelerate livestock population growth, such as through the implementation of sharia-based profit-sharing investments. In the upstream supply chain, the weak bargaining position of compost entrepreneurs due to the monopsony market has caused output prices to drop dramatically. The monopsony market that is faced has resulted in the low bargaining power of the compost business groups in price negotiating. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that government intervention is urgently needed to encourage the development of organic crop cultivation to create a more diversified market demand for compost.

In order to evaluate the effect of each parameter, the rotor’s power coefficient (Cp) for different tip speed ratio (TSR) values and overall torque as a function of the azimuth angle are investigated. The results show that the generated power of a solid rotor with more buckets is less than that of the two-bladed rotor, and by decreasing the overlap ratio and spacing size, Cp values are enhanced. Moreover, a rotor with a larger bucket arc angle has less Cp value and total torque, in addition to shape factor, which changes the configuration of the rotor by adding arms, thus enhancing the aerodynamic performance of the prototype. Furthermore, it is shown that installing a curtain in the upstream section of the rotor improves Cp value by directing airflow. Moreover, it is observed that by increasing inlet wind velocity and, subsequently, the Reynolds number, generated power is boosted. In addition, it is noted that a suitable multi-bucket rotor configuration can boost generated power. Finally, the optimum design is achieved by using the Kriging method. Based on the optimization results, a 2-bladed Savonius VAWT with an overlap ratio of 0, spacing size of 0 (m), arc angle of 170°, shape factor of 0.5, and inlet wind velocity of 12 (m/s) at TSR = 0.37 introduces the highest efficiency.</jats:p>"

This cross-sectional convergence mixed-method study explored water, sanitation and hygiene challenges as the important contributors to childhood diarrhoea in rural Tanzania. The study involved questionnaire survey (N=340), key informant interviews (KII) (n=10) and eight focus group discussions (FDG) (n=61). Prevalence of diarrhoea was 22.2% and 18.7% in Sanza and Iwondo Wards, of Manyoni and Mpwapwa Districts respectively. Improved houses (iron roof and baked brick walls) were more common in Sanza, while 80% of the houses in both wards had earth floor. Water sources in dry period and frequency of sharing water sources with animal were significantly different between wards (P&lt;.001). Boiling drinking water was uncommon, practised by only 5.2% and 8.6% of the households in Sanza and Iwondo, respectively. More than 95% of the households in both wards used traditional pit latrines, and latrine sharing was more common in Iwondo than in Sanza (P=.035). The themes from KII and FGD were: knowledge of occurrence and causes of diarrhoea, water safety, hand-washing, availability of improved sanitation services, keeping chickens inside the house overnight, health effects associated with keeping chickens inside the house and knowledge of occurrence and causes of diarrhoea. Mixed methods analysis through merging data sets revealed poor community knowledge on the causes of childhood diarrhoea, ineffective hand washing, seasonal variation of drinking water sources and high human-chicken interactions. Prevention and control of gastrointestinal infections in resource-poor settings should promote the use of cheap and locally available resources and feasible practices in response to the existing challenges related to water and sanitation services, financial constraints, economic activities, and cultural practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of research studies have addressed supply chain planning from various perspectives (strategical, tactical, operational) and demonstrated the advantages of integrating both production and distribution planning (PDP). The globalisation of supply chains and the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) mean that companies must be more agile and resilient to adapt to volatile demand, and to improve their relation with customers and suppliers. Hence the growing interest in coordinating production-distribution processes in supply chains. To deal with the new market’s requirements and to adapt business processes to industry’s regulations and changing conditions, more efforts should be made towards new methods that optimise PDP processes. This paper proposes a matheuristic approach for solving the PDP problem. Given the complexity of this problem, combining a genetic algorithm and a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. The matheuristic algorithm was tested using the Coin-OR Branch &amp; Cut open-source solver. The computational outcomes revealed that the presented matheuristic algorithm may be used to solve real sized problems.</jats:p>",

Here, we calculate two network measures of supply chain complexity based on the relative number—horizontal complexity—and relative strength—vertical complexity—of a city’s suppliers. Using a large dataset of more than 1 million annual supply flows to 69 major cities in the United States for 2012–2015, we show that a trade-off pattern between horizontal and vertical complexity tends to characterize the architecture of urban supply networks. This architecture shapes the resistance of cities to supply chain shocks. We find that a city experiences less intense shocks, on average, as supplier relative diversity (horizontal complexity) increases for more technologically sophisticated products, which may serve as a mechanism for buffering cities against supply chain shocks. These results could help cities anticipate and manage their supply chain risks.</jats:p>"

The fully controlled rectifier has the function of supplying voltage directly to the BCR, and the BCR has the function of regulating the battery charge. Forced charging the battery at a constant voltage with a current that matches the life of the battery will have an impact on decreasing battery life, besides that it will have an impact on the efficiency of using the battery. Controlling the input voltage of the charging battery as a function of the battery voltage is regulated by the magnitude of the charging current flow. Charging the battery via BCR is adjusted to the battery voltage so that BCR can control it by adjusting the voltage to 13.5 V for High Voltage Disconnected (HVD) and 10.5 V for Low Voltage Disconnected (LVD). Based on the test results of the performance of the full control rectifier system and BCR on a 12 V battery with a capacity of 5 Ah, it shows that the output voltage is A fully controlled 12 V rectifier, the BCR can charge an empty internal battery in a few minutes with a current varying from 2 .1 A to 0.1 A.</jats:p>"

São Paulo, the greatest example of inequality in water distribution in Brazil with 22% of the population and only 1.6% of the country’s surface water, faced between 2014 and 2016 one of the biggest supply crises in its history, characterized mainly by the lack of rains. The work evaluated the current situation of reuse water use in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP) and interviews were carried out with specialists in the water resources sector, forming a representative tripod that involves the concessionaire of public water and sewage services, teaching institutions that study and research the topic and civil society entities responsible for managing the water resources that supply the city of São Paulo and 17 other municipalities in its surroundings. The study identified that much still needs to be done, necessarily counting on the active participation of the public power that has the largest structure to manage and encourage the practice of water reuse, that actions will be necessary to improve the legislation, so it is important that there is a permanent dialogue around the theme so that an alternative for water supply is available that meets the needs of society and collaborates with the sustainability of the planet.</jats:p>"

These supply chains are symbiotic. Changes in the demand for crops, agronomic technology, and knowledge about water will modify the water infrastructure, irrigation technology, land‐use and crop production patterns, and the pricing of water and related commodities. The parameters that guide investment in water innovation and the design of the water supply chain depend on political, economic, and technological considerations that have coevolved over time with water and crop systems.

However, the inherent purification capacity of natural biofilms and their physiochemical and biological properties are still poorly understood. In this study, outdoor sampling and indoor experiments were used to explore the purification abilities of natural biofilms. The physiochemical and biological properties of natural biofilms were further investigated to reveal their purification mechanism. The results demonstrated that natural biofilms had an excellent purification effect on heavily polluted water. Indoor experiments showed that the purification capacity of natural biofilms was dominated by microbial biodegradation rather than physical biosorption, and after 14.0 days of incubation, the removal rates of COD, TP, NH4+-N, and NO3--N could reach 93.6, 80.83, 85.93, and 81.03%, respectively. The SEM, FTIR spectra, and component analyses revealed that natural biofilms were mainly composed of polysaccharides and proteins. The dominant phyla in the bacterial community structure were Campilobacterota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Desulfobacterota, and the major phyla in the fungal community structure were Chytridiomycota and Ascomycota. These microorganisms might be the main degraders of riverine pollutants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: In this paper, we explore how a firm’s concern about profit distribution and the size of downstream firms in supply chains affect corporate social responsibility (CSR) investment strategy. Methodology/results: In a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one manufacturer, both players decide whether to invest to reduce CSR violations, and they negotiate over a wholesale price. Distributive comparison behavior makes the manufacturer compare the profit with his equitable payoff, which is determined by the supplier’s profit. Advantageous (resp. disadvantageous) inequality occurs when the manufacturer’s profit is higher (resp. lower) than the manufacturer’s equitable payoff. We compare this supply chain to the one without distributive comparison behavior. We find that when advantageous inequality occurs, or when neither inequality occurs and the manufacturer’s sensitivity to the supplier’s profit is low, the manufacturer’s distributive comparison behavior makes the manufacturer less (resp. supplier more) likely to invest in CSR, which we call negative (resp. positive) impacts of distributive comparison behavior; otherwise, it makes the manufacturer more (resp. supplier less) likely to invest. In most cases, the weak bargaining power of the small manufacturer leads to larger positive or smaller negative impacts of distributive comparison behavior. Also, the low efficiency of the small manufacturer to reduce CSR violations leads to smaller negative impacts of distributive comparison behavior. Managerial implications: Our results show that governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) should investigate firms’ distributive comparison behavior in supply chains. When downstream firms show the aversion to lower (resp. higher) profits than ones from upstream firms, the measures to monitor and support upstream (resp. downstream) firms’ CSR investments should be taken to avoid CSR violations. In the supply chains with small downstream firms, extra efforts should be made to induce firms’ distributive comparison behavior.</jats:p><jats:p>Funding: M.

In response to growing demand for water in the area in the 1970s and 1980 s, the National Rivers Authority developed the Lodes–Granta scheme to provide augmentation water to key rivers, subject to low flows. However, during the droughts in the late 1990s, the River Granta, which derives baseflow from the Chalk aquifer, was dry in some locations for several months. In response, the Environment Agency and Cambridge Water carried out investigations into the impacts of abstraction on the flow and ecology of the Granta and agreed to restrict abstraction from two operational groundwater sources during low flow periods. However, these abstraction restrictions could potentially result in a shortfall within the relevant public water supply zone under some climatic conditions and so Cambridge Water was considering increasing abstraction from an alternative source of groundwater within the catchment to retain the level of resilience of its supply. The Environment Agency was concerned that use of this abstraction could pose a risk of deterioration of the ecological status of the water body under the EU Water Framework Directive. This paper describes the investigations undertaken to assess the risk of deterioration and shows how these are being used to manage this risk going forward.</jats:p>",

However, with the development of e-commerce, consumer-bounded rationality has become an important issue with respect to supply chain coordination. Based on the assumption that some consumers are loyal to the offline shop and others are reference-dependent, this article examines the mechanism of vertical restraints and their competitive effects. This research study found that compared with the assumption of rational consumers used in previous literature, vertical restraints help internalize the “channel price gap externality” when consumers are loss averse. When separately operating, the offline shop will set a higher price due to its consumers’ higher loyalty and willingness to pay. However, given the positive externality of this price to the online retail sales, the offline price is still lower than the level under vertical integration. When the upstream manufacturer achieves supply chain coordination with vertical restraint contracts, the channel price gap externality is internalized, and the channel price gap expands to stimulate loss-averse consumers’ purchasing decisions.</jats:p>",

The information for this research was gathered via in-depth, personal conversations with manufacturing sector managers who are well-versed in green supply chain practices. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique was used in the evaluation phase to evaluate obstacles and assess efficient options for introducing green supply chain practices. The TOPSIS method is integrated with the neutrosophic set. The neutrosophic set is used to deal with uncertain data. This study used eight barriers to analysis and eight solutions to rank. We obtained collaboration as the best solution. To find places for improvement and garner support for sustainability efforts, it is helpful to work together with suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Identifying critical indicators is crucial to evaluation. This study examines the critical indicators in performance evaluations of GPC and provides relevant suggestions for managers to improve GSCs’ performances. Firstly, we summarized 24 evaluation indicators from five dimensions—financial value, customer service-level, business processes, innovation and development, and the so-called green level. Secondly, the Delphi method was used to determine the formal research framework. The fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory based analytic network process (fuzzy DEMATEL-based ANP) model was applied. The weighted prominence of each indicator was calculated to identify those that were critical, and a causality diagram was constructed for them. Finally, corresponding countermeasures and implications regarding those were put forward. The research results show that the critical indicators include the return rate of net assets, the growth rate of profit, the rate of service satisfaction, market share, production flexibility, and the green consensus. Among them, the green consensus, the growth rate of profit and the rate of service satisfaction form a virtuous circle, leading to the improvement of the overall performance of GSC.</jats:p>"

Each model’s equilibrium is determined by mathematical deduction. The applicable condition of each model and the influence of multiple factors are analyzed. The results indicate the following: (i) no single recycling channel is definitely superior to others, and different channels have their own applicable conditions that are influenced by transfer payments, supply chain cooperation, recycling prices, and supply and demand; (ii) cooperative scenarios are more conducive to attracting third-party enterprises to participate to increase supply chain revenue; (iii) rise in recovery and remanufacturing prices may lead to divergence among supply chain parties on channel selection; and (iv) oversupply requires government subsidies to maintain recycling and remanufacturing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global energy demand has unquestionably increased significantly in recent years. Nowadays, industries are very aware of global warming, and to save the environment, they produce green products with energy consumption. Day by day, energy use is increasing due to population, end-use markets of construction, transportation, industry, etc. But the energy limit is finite, whereas the daily use is rising, so the price is increasing. In this study, two situations have been shown in two models with renewable energy consumption. Model 1 analyzes the manufacturer and retailer’s optimal green quality and sales price in two-echelon supply chain systems with centralized and decentralized cases. In this case, the retailer sells their products through three different channels: online, offline, and buy-online-pickup-in store, with three different selling prices. In Model 2, Manufacturer 1 and Manufacturer 2 produce green and regular products with renewable energy consumption. In this case, both manufacturers sell their products through three different channels: online, offline, and buy-online-pickup-in store, with three different selling prices. There is competition between substitutable products with respect to green quality and the selling price of the products. A hybrid channel policy is studied here to maximize the total profit with considering corporate social responsibility under renewable energy consumption. The study has been analyzed mathematically. The classical optimization approach and game theory are applied here to find the optimal values of procurement cost, selling price, and green quality development cost. A numerical study shows that the centralized system gives a better result to the manufacturer than the decentralized system. When the demand is a power function of the selling price, the manufacturer producing eco-friendly products gains 0.99% more profit than the conventional product. This result shows that manufacturers creating eco-friendly products motivate other manufacturers to make eco-friendly products.</jats:p>"

At enterprises of any industry, the practical implementation of management processes (making management decisions) relies on information grouped and systematized in a certain way, the basis of which in Ukrainian practice traditionally consists of data from accounting and analytical systems combined into a single accounting and analytical model. The main functional purpose of the accounting and analytical system is noted, which consists in presenting complete information (synthesized in it by its subsystems) in a form suitable for making effective management decisions.  The content and informational parameters of this management toolkit and its compliance with modern management needs have been studied. The problem of the traditional Ukrainian practice of the system of accounting and analytical support is noted, which consists in its excessive emphasis on completed (past) financial and economic processes and the absence of instrumental means for displaying information that is not expressed by financial indicators.  The significance of the development of the system of accounting and analytical support is argued and the necessity of introducing an informational and analytical system adaptive to economic conditions at domestic enterprises is substantiated. The formulated aspects of improvement (adaptation) of the concept of accounting and analytical support are based on the actual dependence of the processes of stabilization of the functioning of domestic enterprises on foreign investments (prerequisites for the post-war reconstruction of the national economy). It is substantiated that the expected changes in the economic environment will require the adoption of decisions adequate to the situation, as well as the demonstration of the effectiveness of one's activities according to the criteria accepted in the world space, which are established on the basis of a wide array of information flows. In conditions of significant changes in the economy, this system requires the selection of a basic (key) criterion adequate to these changes as a management guideline.  The expediency of creating this type of system, which will inform users about the real economic value of the enterprise and its changes, has been proven. It was determined that the well-known indicator of the weighted average cost of capital may be the most suitable for the stabilization of Ukrainian enterprises.</jats:p>",

Application to three extensive real-world datasets, consisting of 92 multi-parameter water quality time series of data taken from different hardware configurations, shows how the algorithms can provide quality-assured data and actionable insight. Focussing on turbidity and chlorine, the framework consists of three steps to bridge the gap between data and information; firstly, an automated rule-based data quality assessment is developed and applied to each water quality sensor, then, cross-correlation is used to determine spatiotemporal relationships and finally, spatiotemporal information enables multi-sensor data quality validation. The framework provides a method to achieve automated data quality assurance, applicable to both historic and online datasets, such that insight and actionable insight can be gained to help ensure the supply of safe, clean drinking water to protect public health.</jats:p>"

The records of the initial excavations that took place beginning in 1967 do not allow the establishment of clear functionalities of the villa. The University of Évora, the owner of the site, conceived an action plan for the requalification and enhancement of the archaeological site. One of the tasks aims to investigate the site using applied geophysics. This work analyses the landscape directly related to the villa, given that it is in the flooded area of a river with a Roman containment dam. It is uncertain whether the water supply comes from this structure or other nearby springs. The use of ground-penetrating radar, combined with unmanned aerial vehicles, all integrated in a geographic information system, allows us to determine the location of underground water connections and create a topographic model with high resolution.

The results showed that the asymmetric effect of the global supply chain on the inflation rate is stronger when the supply chain increases than when it decreases in the long run for advanced economies and vice versa in emerging markets. A one standard deviation of the supply chain pressures has rebounded the inflation rate by about 1.7% and 0.71% for advanced economies and emerging markets, respectively. The findings establish that a 10 U.S. dollar increase in oil prices leads the inflation rate to rise by 0.1%–0.6% for all countries in the short run. However, the impact of the global supply chain index fits much better with the inflation rate than the oil prices in the short and long run, including the subprime crisis, such as the COVID‐19 outbreak, and the beginning of the Russo–Ukrainian conflict. Thus, the empirical results of the current study provide acumens for policymakers of advanced economies and emerging markets to consume green energy and make use of green technology and environmental innovations for counterbalancing the inflation issues induced by the higher rates of oil prices without halting the economic growth and sustainable development.</jats:p>",

Applying ESUs with high power density and high overload can compactly ensure fluctuating power source supply on demand. It can avoid the ultra-high configuration issue, which usually exists in the conventional lithium-ion battery-based or engine-generator-based ESUs. Moreover, it dramatically reduces weight and significantly increases the loading and endurance capabilities of the legged vehicles. In this paper, we present a hybrid energy-supply unit for a heavy-duty legged vehicle combining the discharge characteristics of lithium-ion batteries and peak energy release/absorption characteristics of supercapacitors to adapt the ESU to high overload power fluctuations. The parameters of the lithium-ion battery pack and supercapacitor pack inside the ESU are optimally matched using the genetic algorithm based on the energy consumption model of the heavy-duty legged vehicle. The experiment results exhibit that the legged vehicle with a weight of 4.2 tons can walk at the speed of 5 km/h in a tripod gait under a reduction of 35.39% in weight of the ESU compared to the conventional lithium-ion battery-based solution.</jats:p>",

The scaling-up of SFSCs is often challenged by critical issues which can be overcome with identification of the most sustainable, replicable schemes. This paper presents the results of a participatory analysis conducted within the agroBRIDGES H2020 project, with the aim of defining a list of economic, social, and environmental attributes and indicators to assess the sustainability of SFSCs and set up a decision-making tool to support producers in self-assessing their sustainability level and choosing the most appropriate business model (BM) from those identified within the project. The proposed framework was based on a literature review and validated using co-creation exercises (Delphi rounds and focus groups) with relevant European stakeholders. A final set of 47 indicators was identified, and their potential for use in assessing the sustainability level of various BMs was also validated. Early results highlighted three main issues: indicator calculation feasibility, business model categorization, and the simplicity of the framework for sustainability self-assessment. Some recommendations are made, including the importance of using a participatory process in building an evaluation framework on SFSC sustainability and the necessity of its adaptation to territorial contexts and needs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) have shown, at pilot scale, to be effective and beneficial in achieving genetic progress and in improving livelihoods of smallholder communities. In Ethiopia 134 sheep and goat CBBPs were operational producing their own improved rams and bucks. Based on experience the implementation of further programs is possible with appropriate private and public support. A different challenge is the efficient dissemination of the improved genetics produced in current CBBPs to create population-wide economic impact. We present a framework applied to the Ethiopian Washera sheep breed to meet this challenge. We propose the establishment of a genetic improvement structure that supports a meat commercialization model based on the integration of community-based breeding program cooperatives, client communities and complementary services such as fattening enterprises. We calculated that the recently established 28 community-based breeding programs in the Washera breeding tract can provide genetically improved rams to 22% of the four million head. To reach the whole population 152 additional CBBPs are needed. We simulated the genetic improvements obtainable in the current 28 CBBPs assuming realized genetic progress in CBBPs of a similar breed and calculated the expected additional lamb carcass meat production after 10 years of selection to be 7 tons and the accumulated discounted benefit 327 thousand USD. These benefits could be increased if the CBBPs are linked to client communities by providing them with improved rams: additional meat production would be 138 tons with a value of 3,088 thousand USD. The total meat production of the existing Washera CBBPs was calculated at 152 tons and the joint meat production of CBBPs if integrated with client communities would be 3,495 tons. A full integration model, which includes enterprises purchasing lambs for fattening, can produce up to 4,255 tons of meat. We conclude that Washera CBBPs cooperatives can benefit from a higher level of organization to produce population-wide genetic improvement and economic benefits. Unlike in the dairy and chicken industries, for low input sheep and goat smallholder systems the proposed commercialization model puts breeder cooperatives at the center of the operation. Cooperatives need to be capacitated and supported to become fully functional business ventures.</jats:p>"

In its implementation, different sources of risk factors emerge because the nature of the supply chain is too complex, causing supply and demand uncertainty for production. The furniture industry needs to implement supply chain risk management to overcome problems and cause a loss of trust from customers. This study aims to identify and manage supply chain risks in the furniture industry using the Supply Chain Risk Management Process (SCRMP) and COBIT 5 methods. After identifying the risk, the risk impact measurement uses the COBIT 5 method with the Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS) domain implemented into the decision support system. To find out changes after system implementation, the author conducts a risk assessment according to the COBIT 5 standard and evaluates the possibility of a risk occurring. The result of this study is a mapping of the handling of negative scenarios of risk after implementing the system that includes governance standards and input data to produce output documentation. Documents are applied to the decision support system to reduce risks in the supply chain. The SCRMP and COBIT 5 methods can manage supply chain risk more effectively. It guides the risk assessment area and provides information technology governance to the system. The implication of future research is to define standard operating procedure documentation for the application of decision support systems in all divisions of the furniture industry.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed method can supply a sufficient amount of O atoms to selectively measure the effect of O atoms on the surface treatment of polypropylene (PP).

As a result, O atoms decrease the WCA of the PP surface at rates of the same order of magnitude as OH.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the world population grows, the pressure to intensify an unsustainable food production system increases. At the same time, one-third of all the food produced is lost or wasted along the value chains. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods to increase food production while decreasing resource usage and minimising the environmental impact. Ecodesign concepts have already been implemented in various sectors, reducing the environmental impact of products. However, published work has yet to analyse the potential of ecodesign for food production across the value chain. This review assesses the existing literature on ecodesign principles and proposes a conceptual framework of strategies to be applied to current food chains, addressing the challenges posed by current agrifood systems. We suggest that the relevant ecodesign principles fall into three main categories depending on the supply chain stage: “design for sustainable sourcing (DfSS)”, “design for optimised resource use (DfORU)”, and “design for end-of-life optimisation (DfEO).” Applying this framework across the supply chain could significantly reduce the environmental impact of food production and indirectly contribute to dietary change.</jats:p>"

In this study, to understand the mechanisms associated with reproductive stage N remobilization and N partitioning to grain 2 years of field experiments were conducted with 30 diverse rice genotypes during 2019-Kharif and 2020-Kharif seasons. The experiments were conducted with two different N treatments; N deficient (N0-no external N application, available soil N; 2019-234.15 kgha-1, 2020-225.79 kgha-1) and N sufficient (N120-120 kgha-1 external N application, available soil N; 2019-363.77 kgha-1, 2020-367.95 kgha-1). N application increased the NDVI value, biomass accumulation, grain yield, harvest index and grain N accumulation. Post-anthesis N uptake and N remobilization from vegetative tissues to grain are critical for grain yield and N harvest index. Rice genotypes, Kalinga-1, BAM-4234, IR-8384-B-B102-3, Sahbhagi Dhan, BVD-109 and Nerica-L-42 showed a higher rate of N remobilization under N sufficient conditions.

The total amount of N remobilization was recorded to be high in the N120 treatment. The harvest index was higher in N120 during both the cropping seasons. RANBIR BASMATI, BAM-832, APO, BAM-247, IR-64, Vandana, and Nerica-L-44 were more efficient in N grain production efficiency under N deficient conditions. From this study, it is evident that higher grain N accumulation is not always associated with higher yield. IR-83929-B-B-291-3-1-1, Kalinga-1, APO, Pusa Basmati-1, and Nerica-L-44 performed well for different N use efficiency component traits under both N deficient (N0) and N sufficient (N120) conditions.

The main issue addressed here is how the manufacturer selects the optimal online selling format between agency selling and reselling to ensure profitability with a lower carbon footprint. In an uncertain market with considering different pricing sequences in dual-channel promotion,we explore six scenarios. The results show that the different pricing sequences will not affect the equilibrium green degree and pricing strategies under agency selling, whereas it may result in an improved greenness in reselling format. Furthermore, under the interaction of uncertain demand, pricing sequence and green technology investment, we reveal the agent selling format is not always superior to the reselling format with a double-marginalization effect, which contrary to the general intuition. Specifically, in an optimistic market, the manufacturer is more profitable in reselling format when the promotion price set in online channel prior to traditional channel, and in a pessimistic market, the opposite pricing sequence formulated will bring a considerable benefit to the manufacturer.</jats:p>",

Due to the increasing global population, changing climatic conditions, and other natural factors predominating in nature, agriculture practice is becoming less predictable and as a result, farmers’ confidence is being lost, poverty and food insecurity are rising, and other issues are becoming more prevalent. In addition, it affects the sustainability of the food supply chain. So, there is a critical need for agriculture to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Here, we want to select a suitable technology acceptance model which comprehensively and robustly defines all the aspects of technology adoption factors in agriculture. From the different adoption theories, we choose one theory that fits our criteria very accurately; for this, we use a hybrid MCDM approach. We utilised fuzzy AHP and fuzzy VIKOR to make the selection logically and systematically correct. Three experts are employed in the study. Fuzzy AHP helps to find the weightage of criteria used by the fuzzy VIKOR technique in ranking the theories. The results showed that the UTAUT ranking comes number one after applying all the suitable criteria and alternatives, and it is the most accurate theory for analysing the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. This article offers readers a methodical approach for choosing a technology adoption paradigm. The hypothesis that best fits a person’s criteria can be determined by comparing them to potential alternatives.</jats:p>"

The supply air characteristics and thermal comfort were analyzed using objective and subjective experiments in an environmental chamber. Thirty college students participated in the subjective experiments. Results showed that the proposed PV ATD could provide uniform distributions of air velocity at the human head and chest. Compared with the conventional round-monitor panel ATD, the proposed PV ATD can provide an improved cooling effect, wherein overall thermal sensation was reduced by 0.56 scale, showing a potential for energy saving. Moreover, the proposed PV ATD could produce a highly uniform distribution of local thermal sensation (LTS). Compared with the conventional PV, the proposed PV ATD could reduce the standard deviation of distribution of LTS by 41.7% and reduce overall thermal discomfort by 45.5%. Fewer sick building syndrome symptoms at a lower supply airflow rate of 6.3 L/s was achieved. Consequently, the proposed PV ATD could improve the comfort performance with the usage of lower supply airflow rates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. Regular inspection of cables on cable-stayed bridges is key to ensuring the safety of people's lives. However, the detection signals are usually complicated by the interwoven structures of the ropes, which cause the rope defect signal and the strand signal to be mixed. To ensure the working capacity of the wire rope, it is necessary to regularly check the integrity of the cables.  Research methodology. Analytical methods of observations and mathematical and statistical data processing are used in the work; system analysis when developing criteria for assessing the actual technical condition of wire ropes; the method of mathematical modeling in the development of prognostic models of cable breaks.  Research results. The paper analyzes the cable rope control system when changing the parameters of the lengths of the electric current applied to two cables, and shows the nature of the distribution when the number of the damaged cable is changed to another. The obtained results demonstrate the necessity of using this method of input, because the system clearly works in different cases.  Scientific novelty. The automatic cable break detection system with the function of determining the place of damage allows in automatic mode during the operation of a lifting machine equipped with a flat rubber rope to monitor the technical condition of the cables vulcanized in a rubber shell and to stop the machine in the event of a break of any cable.  The change in the electric voltage between the ends of the twisted cable depends on the length of the rope as follows: with a rope length of 10 m - the potential difference does not exceed 7V, and at 100 m - 106, at 300 m - 1015 proportionally depends on the square root and the product of the electrical resistance of the cable and the specific conductivity of rubber layers of rope.  Practical value. The introduction of an automatic control system will make it possible to quickly make decisions aimed at eliminating damage to flat single-layer and cable-stayed multi-layer ropes, stop the \"development\" of damage, reduce time spent on restoring the working condition of the lifting machine, and most importantly - increase its reliability and safety of operation.</jats:p>",

The models that were evolved used both accuracy and parsimony measures including autoregressive (AR), vector autoregressive (VAR), and self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR). The new method, called genetic-based SETAR (GTAR), evolved through the integration of state-of-the-art genetic programming with SETAR. To develop the models, high-resolution DOC concentration and daily streamflow (as the external input for VAR) were measured at the same gauging station throughout the ice free season. The results showed that all the models characterize the DOC dynamics with an acceptable 1-day-ahead forecasting accuracy. Use of the streamflow time series as an exogenous variable did not increase the predictive accuracy of AR models. Moreover, the hybrid GTAR provided the best accuracy for the holdout testing data and proved to be a suitable approach for predicting DOC in boreal conditions.</jats:p>"

Solutions such as the upgrading of waste biomass, the power-to-X paradigm, and an innovative energy carrier such as hydrogen can make an effective contribution to the transition toward a low-carbon energy system. In this context, the aim of this study is to improve the hydrogen production process from wet residual biomass by examining the advantages of an innovative integration of anaerobic digestion with thermochemical transformation processes. Furthermore, this solution is integrated into a hybrid power supply composed of an electric grid and a photovoltaic plant (PV), supported by a thermal energy storage (TES) system. Both the performance of the plant and its input energy demand—splitting the power request between the photovoltaic system and the national grid—are carefully assessed by a Simulink/Simscape model. The preliminary evaluation shows that the plant has good performance in terms of hydrogen yields, reaching 5.37% kgH2/kgbiomass, which is significantly higher than the typical value of a single process (approximately 3%). This finding demonstrates a good synergy between the biological and thermochemical biomass valorization routes. Moreover, thermal energy storage significantly improves the conversion plant’s independence, almost halving the energy demand from the grid.</jats:p>"

Population coverage for HIV treatment for both adults and children remained consistently high despite the increasing prevalence of people living with HIV. The value of expired commodities was reduced by 93% over the 4-year period.\nFurther, there was consensus that support from Global Fund was instrumental in improving the country's procurement and supply chain capacity. Key areas identified include improved infrastructure and equipment, data and information systems, health workforce and financing. The majority of the participants also cited the Global Fund-supported warehouse optimization as critical to improving inventory management practices.\n<bold>Discussion</bold>\nGovernment and the health donor community, need to collaborate through joint planning and implementation in order to strengthen health systems. Organizational autonomy and sharing of best practices in management while strengthening accountability systems are fundamentally important in the efforts to build institutional capacity.</p>"

To increase the efficiency of catching aerosol particles, the authors propose to combine self-sustained and non-sustained discharges in one discharge gap. To do this, it is proposed to use unipolar high-voltage pulses with a constant component and pulses with a duty cycle of more than 5. An analysis is made of the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the impact of electric fields when using circuits with two-sided power supply, the analysis of which makes it possible to increase the pulse repetition rate, as well as to regulate the process of the impact of electric fields on processed particles., regulation by the parameter of impulse voltage.</jats:p>",

However, relatively few studies have examined the role of biomass co-firing for future electricity in China by integratedly considering the economic supply potential and GHG effects. To fill this gap, we choose the Jiangsu Province in China as a case study and build up a partial equilibrium model with multiple agricultural commodities. Using this model combined with a life cycle assessment, we jointly determine the economic potential of the biomass supply for a biomass co-firing purpose and social benefits, including the agricultural producers’ surplus and GHG mitigation potential. The simulation incorporates the county-level biomass market of various crop residues as well as endogenous crop prices and transportation costs. We find that 0.7–12.5 M MT of residue-based biomass are economically viable for co-firing in coal-based power plants (up to 20%) at biomass prices between USD 50 and USD 100/MT. The net GHG savings achieved at these biomass prices are from 3.2 to 59 M MTCO2e. Our findings indicate that biomass co-firing with coal in power plants would be a feasible low-carbon energy transition pathway if the biomass price is above USD 50/MT. In addition to biomass prices, other factors such as crop yields, production costs of residues, and transportation costs are found to be impactful on the economic viability of biomass and GHG savings. Our results can inform policy to develop localized carbon reduction strategies in provinces with abundant biomass resources and a high share of coal-fired electricity.</jats:p>"

Environmentally Sustainable Supply Chain Management (ESSCM) is an approach to carrying out Supply Chain Management (SCM) in an eco‐friendly manner and according to environmental requirements. There are different environmental policies that companies can apply based on their resource availability. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of hard dimensions on Environmentally Adaptive (EA) and Mitigated Adverse Eco‐Effect (MAE) policies in the oil and gas industry. To rank the data, Bayesian Best‐Worst Method (BWM) and Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) have been applied. Cause‐and‐effect relationships are then calculated by employing the Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. The results indicate that the ranking of the hard dimensions varies based on the companies' business policies and their new product/technology development projects. In other words, the findings of this research demonstrate that ‘innovation’ is the crucial dimension in companies that are focussed on developing eco‐friendly products while ‘technologies for cleaner production’ is the most important dimension in the companies attempting to reduce destructive consequences on the environment. In both types of the company policies, ‘lean manufacturing’, ‘total quality management’, and ‘institutional pressures’ are the key dimensions for a successful implementation of ESSCM while the least important dimensions include ‘supplier relationship management’, ‘green purchasing’, and ‘green logistics’. The findings of this research can assist the decision‐makers in the oil and gas sector in prioritising and identifying the interrelationship of the dimensions that significantly impact the ESSCM.</jats:p>",

One way to optimize supply chains is sustainable supply chain performance in the economic, social, and environmental fields. Problems in apple chip small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) are the price of apples increases in the dry season, accumulation of apple peel waste, and poor employee work performance. This study aimed to analyze the level of importance variables in measuring the supply chain performance level and the strategies to improve the supply chain of apple chips SMEs in Batu City. The integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and Fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) was used to obtain the level of cooperation interest. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to determine the efficiency of each stakeholder's interest. The results showed that the three highest important cooperative behavior factors were production costs (0.16), raw material costs (0.15), and raw material inventory (0.14). The efficiency level of partner cooperation and apple chip SMEs from 17 SMEs indicated that two partners were inefficient, with an efficiency score of 0.973 (D3) and 0.957 (D4). The improvement strategies proposed to apple chip SMEs were reducing production costs, revising agreements between suppliers and farmers, and implementing information technology.</jats:p>",

Here, the water quality of the Verdinho River, an important hydrographic basin of Brazilian Cerrado, was evaluated using 16 physical–chemical parameters. The indicators with major interference with water quality were identified by principal component analysis (PCA), in order to suggest less laborious and less expensive assessments. The water quality index (WQI) was applied considering seasonal changes and the analysis of eutrophication potential was determined using the trophic state index (TSI). The concentrations of chemical water quality indicators (e.g., nitrate, total phosphorus, total nitrogen) increased mainly in the rainy season. The PCA explained 73.69% of the variance among the data. Total solids, temperature, turbidity, alkalinity, biochemical oxygen demand, hardness, total phosphorus, nitrite, nitrate and ammonia showed strong correlations. The water quality was classified in the ‘good’ category in most of the evaluations. The TSI presented conditions between mesotrophic and eutrophic. The indicators that are analyzed seasonally and spatially are associated with natural and anthropic factors. The future implementation of a water catchment project water depends on environmental planning strategies to reduce the impacts on the water quality of this hydrographic basin.</jats:p>",

The study uses a rough set method to solve feature selection problems and multivariate analysis of variance to assess the correlation between dependent and independent variables. We find 39 conditional seaport risk factors that are potentially influenced by about 21 dependent factors related to seaport-fulcrum supply chain entities. Furthermore, threats from the planning process, infrastructure, seaport service process, distribution process, financial costs of nuclear enterprises and security existed and affluent highest potential risk in Indonesia.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of ecological economics, energy-saving green energy chain management has been a wide concern of academia and industries. However, the relatively high cost of green investment makes manufacturers face the problem of financial constraints. On this basis, because the green level information of products is proprietary to manufacturers, manufacturers will lie about the green level of products in order to improve their profits out of the principle of profit maximization. As a result, banks cannot obtain the true green level of products, reducing the benefits of the green energy-efficient supply chain system and making the market of green products volatile. In view of this, blockchain technology is introduced in this paper to improve customer’s product green level sensitivity and obtain lower green credit interest rates from banks. In this paper, a green supply chain financing model based on blockchain technology was constructed under the condition of green information misreporting, and it is compared with the benchmark without blockchain technology. Research shows that the adoption of blockchain can achieve Pareto improvement of green supply chain members. In addition, manufacturers have an incentive to adopt blockchain if the cost of blockchain investment falls below a certain threshold, and consumer green sensitivity increases below that threshold. We compared the profits of green manufacturers with those of retailers and the total emissions of manufacturers. The results show that: (1) When the financing intensity exceeds a certain value, there is an optimal coverage of green financing to ensure that the profit target of manufacturers, the profit target of retailers and the emission reduction target are achieved simultaneously. (2) The adoption of blockchain can achieve Pareto improvement of green energy supply chain members. The actual data of green transformation of Jinyuan New Technology Company were cited. Through calculation, it was found that green transformation can reduce the emissions of enterprises. When the financing intensity is in a certain range, the profits of manufacturers and retailers can be maximized, and the emission reduction degree is the highest. Thus, the practicability and reliability of this model were proved. (3) Manufacturers have an incentive to adopt blockchain if the cost of blockchain investment falls below a certain threshold, and consumer green sensitivity increases below that threshold. The research results of this paper provide solutions for enterprises with limited funds for green transformation and provide a theoretical basis for the government to formulate emission reduction incentive mechanism.</jats:p>"

Variations in genetic response, inadequacy of nutrients in the soil, and insufficient access to nutrients are factors that aggravate drought stressors. The development of screening tools for identifying drought tolerance is important in the deployment of durum wheat varieties suited to drought-prone environments. An experiment was conducted to evaluate durum wheat varieties under a range of nutrient supplies in naturally imposed drought conditions. The treatments consisting of two nitrogen regimes (i.e., control and 60 kg ha−1), four durum wheat varieties, and three types of nutrients (control, sulfur, and zinc) that were arranged in a split-split plot design with three replications. Both foliar-based sulfur and zinc fertilization were employed at the flag leaf stage, at a rate of 4 and 3-L ha−1, respectively. The results showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) genetic variation in chlorophyll concentration, grain protein content, tillering potential, and leaf area index. Varieties that contained better leaf chlorophyll content had improved grain yield by about 8.33% under 60 kg/ha nitrogen. A combined application of nitrogen and zinc at flag leaf stage significantly improved grain yield of Duragold by about 21.3%. Leaf chlorophyll content was found to be a more important trait than spikes per m2 to discriminate durum wheat varieties. Foliar application of sulfur increased the grain yield of drought-stressed plants by about 12.23%. Grain yield and protein content were strongly correlated with late-season SPAD readings. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation coefficients were obtained between normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, grain yield, and protein content with late-season chlorophyll content, revealing the importance of chlorophyll content in studying and identifying drought-tolerant varieties.</jats:p>"

These events bring ship delays, port congestion and turnover inefficiency. In order to enhance the resilience of the CPSC, a modified two-stage CPSC system containing a container pretreatment system (CPS) and a container handling system (CHS) is built. A two-dimensional resilience index is designed to measure its affordability and recovery. An adaptive fuzzy double-feedback adjustment (AFDA) strategy is proposed to mitigate the disruptive effects and regulate its dynamicity. The AFDA strategy consists of the first-level fuzzy logic control system and the second-level adaptive fuzzy adjustment system. Simulations show the AFDA strategy outperforms the original system, PID, and two pipelines for improved dynamic response and augmented resilience. This study effectively supports the operations manager in determining the proper control policies and resilience management with respect to indeterminate container waiting delay and allocation delay due to disruptive effects.</jats:p>"

We analyze the impact of the operation costs of physical stores and the transportation costs of the online retailer on the above strategies, and with numerical examples, analyze the impact of consumers’ perceived value on the profits of each scenario. The results show that the default rate of consumers’ unpaid balance and the cross-channel return rate directly influences the online retailer’s strategy choice. The pricing of the physical store is related to the proportion of unpaid balance and return rate of the online retailer. Customers’ perceived value brought by advanced delivery leads to profit changes in supply chain members and is influenced by the online retailer’s cross-channel return strategy.</jats:p>"

However, it exhibits different operational strategies and economic benefits in different application scenarios due to its inherent degradation behaviour. This paper aims to explore the technical and economic feasibility of the flexible traction power supply system (FTPSS) integrating ESS and renewable energy sources (RES) based on the traction load characteristics. First, a battery degradation model applicable in its frequent charging and discharging operating conditions is derived. Then this paper develops an operational‐sizing co‐optimization framework for the ESS in the FTPSS, where the operation decisions are made considering the degradation costs varying with the sizes and energy throughput. To solve this large‐scale non‐linear intertemporal decision‐making problem, an iterative method with a linear programming (LP) core is proposed to achieve the trade‐off between computational efficiency and accuracy. The results of the extensive comparative cases show that the proposed approach can achieve approximately 10% higher economic benefits than the existing bi‐level sizing strategies for FTPSS.</jats:p>",

It is found that the conductivity of the solution has an important influence on the generation probability and stability of vapor layers together with the occurrence position of micro-discharges.

In this study, a numerical analysis of the correlation between the CO2 PP and O2 PP in AC trains and the air supply parameters (ASPs), fresh air volume (FAV), and oxygen supply volume (OSV) along the Qinghai-Tibet line in summer was conducted. The results show that the influence of the FAV on the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system (ACS) in different running areas is inconsistent, whereas the influence of the oxygen supply system (OSS) on energy consumption is significant. During the oxygen supply period, the FAV had the opposite effect on energy consumption of ACS and OSS. The energy consumption of the OSS was approximately five times that of the ACS. By studying the correlation between the internal environment and ASP of trains running in different regions, the operation modes of ACS and OSS can be reasonably set, which can effectively reduce energy consumption by 20–50%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This basic-applied and hybrid survey aimed to design and validate a policy-making model for biomass energy development training in the agricultural supply chain sector. Creating a supply chain for basic agricultural products by including a wide range of agricultural subsectors from the supply of required production inputs to the final consumer’s access to the goods will lead to an increase in the productivity of the agricultural sector as well as the upstream and downstream industries related to it. Therefore, considering the importance of creating an optimal supply chain for various agricultural products, in this study, the situation of the supply chain of agricultural products in the country has been examined. Considering that the lack of appropriate policies regarding the management of the supply chain of agricultural products can lead to the inefficiency of the supply chain of agricultural products in various stages including supply of inputs, production and distribution, and marketing of products, it is suggested that planning and related policies should be implemented in order to improve the infrastructure that leads to increasing the efficiency of some logistics subsystems such as transportation, warehousing, communication, and information systems. Purposive sampling was used in the qualitative part, and stratified random sampling was utilized in the quantitative part. The data were collected by reviewing resources and interviewing ten experts, who were mainly policy-making managers of biomass energy development training and academic researchers. The interviews continued until reaching theoretical saturation, and the samples of the quantitative part included 384 members of the environmental and agricultural Jihad employees, who were selected based on Cochran’s formula. The effective components of the education policy of biomass energy development and their factors were identified by the exploratory method and evaluated through descriptive-survey research. The validity and reliability of the components were examined, and Cronbach’s alpha of all components was higher than 0.7. The essential components of the effective factors were measured in the education policy of biomass energy development in the agricultural sector. The model validity was verified through the structural equation method, and the selection of concepts, dimensions, and indicators was highly accurate and could provide a suitable framework for developing a policy perspective document for biomass energy education. According to the coding results, the development and acceptance of biomass energy systems by the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad and Environment in the country is unsuitable and sustainable, considering the passage of more than a decade of designing and implementing plans. According to experts, some farmers implement this method in their fields for one or two years and return to traditional methods after accepting this technology. The main achievements are as a core category or phenomenon conditions to casual conditions path with coefficient 0.916 is significant. Strategies to the core category or phenomenon conditions’ path with a coefficient of 0.051 are significant. Strategies to contextual conditions’ path with coefficients 1.231 are significant. Strategies for intervening condition path with coefficients 2.235 are significant. Consequences to strategies’ path with coefficients 0.807 are significant. Therefore, the development of biomass energy is an inevitable necessity, considering the erosion and reduction of soil organic matter, increasing energy costs, and other factors.</jats:p>",

The study aims to identify and model the L4.0 CSFs for successful lean implementations in SMEs to suit I4.0 needs. The thorough analysis of the literature led to the identification of the L4.0 CSFs. The expert panel from SMEs was involved in selecting the relevant 22 L4.0 CSFs that suited the needs of manufacturing SMEs. Based on the feedback of the expert panel, a questionnaire survey was carried out. Further, collected responses were analyzed using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The EFA results identified four major groups: ‘worker-enabled technologies’, ‘IT-enabled technologies’, ‘management’, and ‘L4.0’ related CSFs. Furthermore, the study uses partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to simulate the L4.0 CSFs and identify the influence of each CSF toward successful lean implementation. The PLS-SEM results confirm that the lean CSFs have positive effects on successful lean implementation. The present research contributes to enhancing the knowledge and L4.0 practices of manufacturing SMEs. The results show that successful implementation will promote ‘productivity improvements (PI)’, ‘waste reduction (WR)’, ‘competitive advantage (CA)’, and ‘sustainable manufacturing system (SMS)’.</jats:p>"

Nowadays, due to the competitiveness of production and the need to reduce costs and deliver goods on time, equipment availability and prevention of unexpected stops are particularly important in industrial units. In recent years, equipment, machinery, and human resources have been the foundations of any organization. On the other hand, to increase the productivity and efficiency of providing services and achieve global standards, special attention should be paid to increase the efficiency of machinery and reducing downtime costs. This research conducted a mathematical formulation to find the best possible solution for the economic production quantity and inventory ordering by considering preventive maintenance. In this model, the success of organizations in providing services and increasing the quality depends on various reasons, such as maintenance and repair systems. In the proposed model, the defective items are considered, and the goal is to achieve an optimal amount of production in such a way that the costs of the entire system, including production cost, setup, maintenance, inspection, and rework costs, are minimized during a period per unit of time. The numerical results show that increasing the preventive maintenance periods leads to an upward trend in the total cost of the supply chain. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis shows that the longer the preventive maintenance on the machine, the higher reliability of the system as well as total costs will be achieved.</jats:p>",

However, emissions from ASHS in most cases are either not included in the summary calculations of atmospheric air pollution at all or estimated with significant uncertainties. \r\nThe purpose of this study was a hygienic assessment of methods and results of accounting for emissions of pollutants from the ASHS of individual residential buildings when conducting summary calculations of atmospheric air pollution for settlements. \r\nMaterials and methods. the original methodology of a phased survey of the city’s ASHS was used and the results of summary calculations of atmospheric air pollution in 18 cities conducted using this methodology are presented. Calculations of single, average seasonal (for the cold period) and average annual surface concentrations of pollutants were carried out in accordance with current regulatory documents using the unified software for calculating atmospheric pollution (UPRZA) “Ecologist-city”. In all the studied cities a significant number of sources of atmospheric air pollution was established to be ASHS. In more than 90% of these sources, coal and firewood were used as energy carriers. The greatest excess of hygienic standards of atmospheric air quality was noted \r\nfor benz(a)pyrene. In 15 cities, the highest calculated maximum single surface concentration of at least one pollutant created by emissions from ASHS exceeded the maximum allowable single concentration (MACs). \r\nLimitations of the study are due to the fact that direct instrumental measurements to determine the characteristics of emissions from ASHS into the atmosphere are impossible. \r\nConclusions. The area of the city’s territory where the estimated maximum single surface concentration of at least one pollutant exceeded the MACs, reached 45%, and the seasonal average concentration exceeded maximum allowable average annual concentration on 50% of the territory. The most effective measure to reduce air pollution by emissions from ASHS is the replacement of solid and liquid mineral fuels with natural gas. Unification of methods of accounting and inventory of ASHS as sources of atmospheric air pollution is required.</jats:p>",

This device can periodically provide electrical power for several hours after a short-time electrical activation. The electrical activation makes acetylcholine, which is infused into the subcutaneous tissue by iontophoresis. The interstitial fluid (ISF) with glucose molecules is then permeated autonomously for several hours. At this period, the device can provide electrical power. The electrical power is generated from the catalyzing reaction between the glucose oxidase immobilized on the anode and the permeated glucose molecules. After the ISF permeation stops, we give a short-time electrical activation to provide electrical power for several hours again. The power supply is flexible, which makes it adaptively conform to skin. The episodic short-time electrical activation can be enabled by an integrated small film lithium-ion battery. This method extends the service life of a lithium-ion battery 10-fold and suggests the application of small lithium-ion batteries for long-term epidermal sensors.</jats:p>"

Consequently, these disruptions have affected food and nutritional security all over the world. This study proposes a framework for investigating the impact of COVID-19 on food supply chains, considering Eastern Africa as a focus region with Kenya and Rwanda as case studies. A systems thinking approach with three systemic components (food and nutrition, COVID-19 contagion, and human health) was applied. The contagion component was characterized by the susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and deceased (SEIRD) epidemiological modeling method. We then applied a causal loop diagram and stock and flow diagrams to map the links and interactions between variables from the contagion, health, and food supply chain components of the whole system. The results reveal that COVID-19 has adversely affected food and nutritional security in Eastern African countries. Key response measures to COVID-19 such as lockdowns, closure of borders, isolation, and quarantining have resulted in labor shortages, increased unemployment rates, loss of income, and the subsequent contraction of economies. The disruption of the food supply chain has negatively impacted the main pillars of food and nutrition security, which are availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability. We suggest direct food supply from local producers to the consuming communities to shorten the food supply chain and therefore enhance food self-sufficiency to reduce the severe effects of COVID-19 on food and nutrition security. Overall, our study provides a useful framework to help design better policies and build more resilient and inclusive food systems during COVID-19 and similar pandemics in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The extant research on supply chain information sharing under wholesale pricing often assumes a model where the manufacturer can unilaterally set any wholesale price, and the retailer decides retail quantity or price while taking the wholesale price as given. Whereas this model may actually reflect the relative market power in some situations, its implementation misses out on certain win–win opportunities that could arise from information sharing. We propose a new wholesale pricing mechanism that promotes information sharing between a relatively weaker retailer and a more powerful manufacturer such that both parties become better off. The novel feature of the new mechanism is an extra stage of interaction, which happens before the retailer's information sharing decision: at the very outset the manufacturer and the retailer reach a contractual agreement on an upper bound which the wholesale price will not exceed if the retailer shares his information. This new, easily implementable, mechanism can be a win–win for both supply chain firms. In other words, facing market uncertainty, the manufacturer, while having the market power to dictate the wholesale price, can gain from a contractual restriction on the exercise of that power in order to induce the retailer, who is in a weaker position, to share useful demand information. </jats:p>",

However, such public development-oriented supply does not properly respond to changes in the social structure, such as changes in population and household structure and diversification of housing demand. In the case of the first and second new cities, which are representative public developments, development was carried out according to different supply purposes based on the ｣Housing Site Development Promotion Act｢. In the case of the recent third new city, the ground law was changed to the Special Act on Public Housing, not the ｢Housing Site Development Promotion Act｣, and factors to meet social demand were reflected.\r\nHowever, based on various special laws in supplying large-scale public housing sites centered on new cities, problems often arise due to inconsistencies with existing national space plans or urban plans or lack of connection with higher plans. In addition, as a result of the creation and supply of large-scale public housing sites, the real estate economic recession due to short-term oversupply, unsold problems, regional conflicts, and distortion of housing supply and demand. Problems with reckless development or bed towns arise as the housing site supply plan does not reflect the characteristics of the region and focuses on specific policy purposes such as the dispersion of the population in the metropolitan area. Furthermore, problems include inconsistency between plans and laws in the public housing supply legal system, inefficiency and rigidity in business procedures and housing site supply methods, and lack of urban function and project disconnection due to bias centered on the supply of large-scale housing sites.\r\nAccordingly, through the analysis of the legal system for the creation and supply of public housing sites, measures to improve the legislation for efficient and sustainable cities were proposed. It suggested improvement directions according to changes in the goals, policy directions, functions, and roles of the ｢Special Act on Public Housing｣, which is the basis for the supply of public housing sites, and suggested ways to improve the consistency of the legal system. In addition, measures to strengthen the functional elements of the city were reviewed by creating large-scale public housing districts centered on the ｢Special Act on Public Housing｣, efficient management of the created housing sites, and acceptance of social changes. Above all, in order to ensure the sustainability of the city, the direction of improvement in the overall legal system was suggested, from the planning stage to urban management after the supply of housing sites.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In any market economy, supply and demand processes are actively developing and interacting with each other, influencing the functioning of the economy as a whole. In this regard, problems related to supply and demand are relevant for scientific research in both theoretical and applied aspects, since their deep justification allows for the development of adequate economic policy and appropriate regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of effective interaction between sub objects of supply and demand and their formation of quality market solutions. Application of the method of conditional smoothing (conditional approximation) of data to build models of classic supply and demand functions with appropriate a priori properties based on observational data, which are characterized by violations of these properties. One of the approaches to the modeling of continuous functions (curves) of supply and demand based on the data of observation (monitoring) of the dynamics of supply and demand is proposed.The specificity of these data lies in the fact that due to the influence of external factors on them, their measurement errors in the process of observing changes in supply and demand, they do not always agree with the theoretical regularities reflected in the supply and demand curves (observed demand values with price increases should belong to a descending and convex (downward) curve, and offers – to an increasing and concave (upward convex) curve).The implementation of the proposed approach is reduced to the conditional smoothing of the observation data, i.e., the replacement of these data with other data satisfying the predetermined properties of the supply and demand curves and are solutions to certain optimization problems. Models of supply and demand functions (curves) built in this way also allow determining the equilibrium values of price, demand and supply. Both approaches to the construction of supply and demand functions, and these functions themselves have not only theoretical, but also important practical applications for the analysis of market phenomena and processes, in particular for establishing market equilibrium, specifying its parameters, and developing appropriate solutions related to the researched market.In addition, the toolkit proposed in the work can be successfully used when modeling other types of economic behavior functions, such as expenditure and output ЕК О Н О МІК О - МА Т ЕМ АТ ИЧ Н Е М ОД ЕЛЮ ВА Н НЯ Випуск І (89), 2023142 functions, utility functions etc.The effective practical application of the developed toolset for simulation of functional models in the economy is also facilitated by sufficiently powerful software and modern information technologies. The proposed models of supply and demand functions (curves) belong to the class of piecewise linear functions.On the basis of these functions, it is possible to develop a toolkit for constructing smooth (for example, twice continuously differentiable) supply and demand functions with the corresponding classical properties in supply and demand theory.The construction of such functions is the subject of further research and outlines their perspective.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering the network externality of remanufactured product, this paper develops the Stackelberg game models in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a retailer with dual sales channel under three scenarios, i.e., no sales effort (Model N), the retailer exerting sales effort (Model R) and the OEM exerting sales effort (Model M). The study investigates the pricing and sales effort decisions for CLSC members. The results show that: (1) Compared with no sales effort, the sales effort behavior can always improve the profits of the OEM and entire CLSC. The retailer’s profit can be improved in Model R, so OEM exerting sales effort could cause a loss for the retailer and the sales effort behavior can promote the sales of remanufactured products and further cannibalize the new product market. (2) Model M is more favorable to improve the profits of the OEM and entire CLSC, while the retailer prefers Model R. Model M is more beneficial for boosting the sales of remanufactured products. (3) As the network externality/consumer’s sensitivity of sales effort becomes more obvious, CLSC members exert more sales effort, and the OEM exerts more sales effort compared to the retailer. (4) Only when the retailer’s sales effort cost is much lower than the OEM sales effort cost is it that OEM could obtain more profit when the retailer exerts sales effort; then, the win-win situation between OEM and the retailer is achieved.</jats:p>"

We analyzed 1301 offered activities, which we further categorized. We carried out the analysis online using the Interactive Map of the Non-Profit Sector, which we supplemented by research on the websites of the Czech Union of Sport, Sokol, Orel, Pionýr, Junák – Czech Scout, the Brontosaurus Movement, and others, and by searching on individual websites. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey was used, where we contacted 280 associations electronically.\nFindings – The return rate was 35%, and 98 respondents willingly completed the questionnaire. The research aims to analyze selected leisure facilities' current supply and demand. According to the obtained data, it is possible to state whether the leisure activity of the mediated association is pervasive and versatile. The research revealed specific gaps in the market. Other goals of the research are to find out what leisure facilities and services they provide, to reveal whether the selected leisure facilities also provide activities in the online environment and whether there is interest in the given activities on the part of the participants, to find out the methods of promotion of the selected leisure organizations and to determine the factors that, according to the selected leisure facilities affect the demand for leisure activities.\nNovelty – Recommendations are presented that could ensure increased demand for leisure activities, including the use of modern technologies, which can also attract a large number of new interested parties, especially younger age groups, in the areas of programming, website creation, prevention of cyberbullying, cyber grooming, sexting or in the development of the ability to recognize disinformation within comprehensive digital competences.\nType of Paper: Empirical\nJEL Classification:  J2, J29.\nKeywords: Demand; Leisure Activities; Leisure Facilities; Online Environment; Supply.\nReference to this paper should be made as follows: Opletalová, A; Hýblová, S; Nováková, Z; Mičková, H.

The results indicate the need for actions to raise awareness of the agents involved in the dairy production chain. First, the role of the dairy, in understanding that the legal parameters must be measured and controlled, given the perishability of milk. Second, producers and dairies must understand that superior milk quality results in better quality products, and to achieve this, the actions carried out on the property and evaluated parameters must be worked out through action plans. Finally, that action plans will only be successful if they are carried out in partnership with the rural producer, understanding that the gain will occur if everyone works collectively and not individually along the production chain.</jats:p>",

Nutrient immobilization as a response to wood addition during oil sands' reclamation may be a concern since surface wood is salvaged with the soil, thereby becoming buried wood in reclamation cover soils. This project investigated the impact of buried wood on macronutrient supply and microbial communities in different reclamation soils. A 60-day incubation was performed with different rates and types of wood (0%–50%, aspen and pine) and four different soils: fine and coarse forest floor-mineral mix (fFFMM and cFFMM), peat-mineral mix (PMM), and peat. Analysis of macronutrient supply rates using Plant Root Simulator (PRS™) probes and a community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) to assess metabolic potential was performed at the end of the incubation period; microbial activity was measured through soil respiration during the incubation. Responses varied by soil type; however, buried wood caused nitrogen immobilization in three soils due to an increase in the C:N ratio. Soils with lower C:N ratios like fFFMM and PMM were more susceptible to immobilization with a decrease in available nitrogen by up to 95% at a 10% of wood addition. Phosphorus immobilization was observed in cFFMM, and potassium supply increased at 20% of wood and above. Soil microbial activity and metabolic potential increased but no significant changes in the soil profiles were observed. The findings of this study demonstrate that buried wood increases the soil C:N ratio and can potentially cause nitrogen immobilization when added by 10% of volume or more. </jats:p>",

Though much is known about risk and crisis communication responding to known cases of foodborne illnesses, less in known about reassuring messages that the food supply is safe. This study expands our understanding of message convergence by exploring how audiences react to convergent messages intended to reassure them that no risk exists. Focus groups observed and responded to a series of messages explaining that African swine fever, though a threat to the pork industry, is not a danger to consumers. Most focus group participants recognized and saw value in message convergence based on accurate science attributed to credible sources. The study concluded that message convergence is effective in promoting reassurance; however, message convergence cannot be fully effective or sustain its positive influence unless it is ethical, adapted based on continuous dialogue with and feedback from audiences, and maintained over time. Despite these rigorous demands, message convergence has clear potential as a communication strategy for providing reassurance to audiences about the safety of the food supply.

Accordingly, the proximal North China Craton is considered to have increased supply potential of dust to the CLP further eastward. However, the origin of the eastern CLP and the relationship between loess and proximal river sediments have never been systematically studied, which prevents us from working out the surface process between source and sink. In this study, we conducted U–Pb dating and analyses of the grain morphologies of detrital zircons and heavy mineral assemblages on the upper Quaternary loess and riverbed sediments on the eastern and central CLP. We also built a data set (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 48,161) of the zircon U–Pb ages of the Quaternary loess, deserts, and potential source areas. Our results show that most loess samples on the eastern CLP were strongly affected by the North China Craton. The dust supply ability of rivers to loess is very limited. Along the dust transport path, the proximal mountains, rivers and loess can all provide dust for loess deposition. Our findings emphasize the important role proximal supply has played in the evolution of the CLP since at least the late Neogene, for example, the northeastern Tibetan Plateau for the western and central CLP, and the North China Craton for the eastern CLP.</jats:p>",

To address this gap, we investigate the performance of inter-regional supply-side input–output (ISIO) models that incorporate precipitation and water intake under varying climates over time in a transboundary water management context. Using the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada as a case study, we develop four ISIO models based on available economic and hydrological data from years with different climatic conditions, i.e., two dry and two wet years. Accounting for price changes over these years, our findings indicate that the joint impact of changes in water availability and economic structural changes on economic output can be considerable. The results furthermore show that each model performs particularly well in predicting the economic output for similar climatic years. The models remain reliable in predicting economic outputs over several years as long as changes in water availability are within the range observed in the water-inclusive base year ISIO model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PT Asagri Selaras Asia is an agribusiness company in Jakarta, Indonesia that provides food supply for entrepreneurs in the tourism sector, such as hotels and restaurants. In running their business, the company has a supply chain network that effectively integrates suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and stores. Supply chain management optimization is deemed necessary to maximize efficiency in every process carried out at PT Asagri Selaras Asia. One of the processes that can be optimized is the determination of facility location. The right facility location can minimize distance, delivery time, and operational costs and optimize the company's profit. Currently, the contract period for the distribution center (DC) used by PT Asagri Selaras Asia is about to expire therefore a decision is needed regarding the determination of the DC location for the next period, either extending the current DC contract or moving to a new location. This study aims to maximize the company's profit by comparing the profit obtained under existing and alternative DC, and the proposed DC from the experimental results using the Green Field Analysis (GFA) method. This study also aims to determine the feasibility of the three DC locations using the Network Optimization (NO) method with Anylogistix software. Based on the data analysis, the new DC is recommended to be located in the West Pejaten area, South Jakarta with latitude -6.2729150574 and longitude 106.8230798418 which will give an increase in profit of 80.53% compared to the existing DC.</jats:p>"

Control group II (CG2) received a defined background diet without the smoothie. Control group I (CG1) received neither. Blood samples and 24-h urine were collected at the beginning and the end of the study. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, vitamin D3, selenium, iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased in IG1 (p &lt; 0.05), while 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 increased (p &lt; 0.05). In IG2, vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamins D2 and D3 decreased (p &lt; 0.05), while concentrations of fatty acids C20:5n3 and C22:5n3 increased. Serum and urine uric acid increased in IG1 and IG2 (p &lt; 0.05). Microchloropsis is a valuable source of n3 fatty acids, as is Chlorella of vitamin D2. Regular consumption of Chlorella may affect the iron and selenium status negatively but may impact blood lipids positively. An elevated uric acid concentration in blood and urine following the regular consumption of microalgae poses potential risks for human health.</jats:p>"

The motivation behind this article is to present a conceptual framework for examining SHRM in the context of Supply Chain Management (SCM). We present a system which distinguishes  factors that determine whether embracing a Supply Chain Management  (SCM) explains the possibilities that shape SHRM practices as required to accomplish and get benefit from SCO. Therefore, we relied on existing literature associated with SCM an SHRM. The study firstly highlights the significance of human resource management, and then it stretches the limit of administration and HR frameworks from a single organizational focus to intra-organizational and  hierarchical connections between SHRM an SCO. Then we propose a system for comprehension of the connections between HR frameworks and SCO, and administrating human resource for efficiency and effectiveness. After then, we also deliberated upon past studies about managing human resources and furnishing a proper system to effectuate research in the SCM orientation. Lastly, we offer suggestions for future research, alongside dishing out for both academicians and practitioners.

Despite this, research on the application of BDA-AI for green supply chain collaboration (GSCC) and its influence on environmental performance (EP) is still limited. The current research addresses this gap and extends organizational information processing theory by incorporating BDA-AI and exploring top management commitment (TMC) as a moderator. The current study developed a moderated mediation model based on 402 samples of data from Turkish manufacturing firms. The result revealed that the application of BDA-AI has a positive impact on GSCC and EP. The results also indicated that GSCC has a positive impact on EP. Our findings revealed that GSCC mediated the association between BDA-AI and EP. The results also revealed that TMC moderated the positive relationship between BDA-AI and GSCC, such that the strength of the positive relationship is further intensified at higher levels of TMC. The results also show that TMC moderated the positive relationship between BDA-AI and EP, such that the strength of the positive relationship is dampened at lower levels of TMC; significant findings have not been outlined in the extant literature. The current research will assist supply chain and logistics managers and top management in deploying BDA-AI technology to support GSCC and improve EP.</jats:p>",

Unsustainable and increased urbanization adds additional strain on combatting environmental degradation. Since the last decade, urban distribution centers (UDCs) have emerged in response to the steep rise in urban freight transportation and its negative impact on city congestion and air quality. Methods: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the performance of UDCs and investigate its alignment with the corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, including the shareholders’ governance strategies and policies, as well as environmental, social, and economic measures. Our systematic literature review consists of multiple phases: In the first one, we utilize bibliometric tools to implement a quantitative analysis of the extant literature. Next, a cluster-based network analysis complements this analysis to describe the evolution of research in this area. Results: Our descriptive analysis categorizes existing research on UDCs based on CG- and CSR-compliant themes. We classify pertinent peer-reviewed articles into topical clusters and offer research opportunities related to improving the performance of UDCs. Conclusions: This study aims to stimulate further scholarly inquiry into sustainable city logistics and provides a knowledge-based guide for academicians and practitioners, logistics service providers, policymakers, and customers.</jats:p>"

This paper deals with a supply chain system’s dynamical analysis and efficient management strategy using a four-stage hyperchaotic Lorenz–Stenflo equation under disruptive events. Nonlinear behaviors are intensely investigated by eigenvalue and bifurcation analysis to identify supply chain risks. Then phase portraits are presented to illustrate the bullwhip effect negatively influencing the performance of various stages of multi-echelon supply chains. Resilient supply chains have been developed along with dynamic identification by realizing an adaptive fractional-order controller. An efficient control algorithm can optimize the management system while reducing potential risks by employing control theory in a decision support system. Performance criteria have been exploited to validate the control methodology. Using digital management algorithms, decision-makers might effectively cope with chaos suppression and synchronization problems, ensuring productivity and sustainability. Finally, the novel decision-making strategy can offer new insights into effectively managing digital supply chain networks against market volatility.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to estimate annual TJA demand and orthopaedic surgeon workforce supply from 2020 to 2050, and to develop an arthroplasty surgeon growth indicator (ASGI), based on the arthroplasty-to-surgeon ratio (ASR), to gauge nationwide supply and demand trends.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>National Inpatient Sample and Association of American Medical Colleges data were reviewed for individuals who underwent primary TJA and for active orthopaedic surgeons (2010 to 2020), respectively. The projected annual TJA volume and number of orthopaedic surgeons were modeled using negative binominal and linear regression, respectively. The ASR is the number of actual (or projected) annual total hip (THA) and/or knee (TKA) arthroplasties divided by the number of actual (or projected) orthopaedic surgeons. ASGI values were calculated using the 2017 ASR values as the reference, with the resulting 2017 ASGI defined as 100.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The ASR calculation for 2017 showed an annual caseload per orthopaedic surgeon (n = 19,001) of 24.1 THAs, 41.1 TKAs, and 65.2 TJAs. By 2050, the TJA volume was projected to be 1,219,852 THAs (95% confidence interval [CI]: 464,808 to 3,201,804) and 1,037,474 TKAs (95% CI: 575,589 to 1,870,037). The number of orthopaedic surgeons was projected to decrease by 14% from 2020 to 2050 (18,834 [95% CI: 18,573 to 19,095] to 16,189 [95% CI: 14,724 to 17,655]). This would yield ASRs of 75.4 THAs (95% CI: 31.6 to 181.4), 64.1 TKAs (95% CI: 39.1 to 105.9), and 139.4 TJAs (95% CI: 70.7 to 287.3) by 2050.

High-temperature liquid lead corrosion tests were carried out for 120 h, 240 h, 500 h, 1000 h, and 2000 h, respectively, for three prepared samples. After the experiment, the corrosion behavior was evaluated and compared mainly based on the aspects of appearance, corrosion depth, microstructure, and composition difference. It was found that just the ODS design did not show a positive effect on corrosion resistance, while the addition of Al is beneficial to improving the corrosion resistance of ODS steel. The maximum corrosion depth of 9CrAl ODS is only 51.8 μm after corrosion for 2000 h, which is much lower than that of 9Cr-ODS steel.

Here, we present the study exploring the interactive effects of three manipulated factors ([CO2], nitrogen supply and water availability) on physiological (gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence), morphological and stoichiometric traits of Norway spruce (Picea abies) saplings after 2 and 3 years of the treatment under natural field conditions. Such multifactorial studies, going beyond two-way interactions, have received only limited attention until now. Our findings imply a significant reduction of [CO2]-enhanced rate of CO2 assimilation under reduced water availability which deepens with the severity of water depletion. Similarly, insufficient nitrogen availability leads to a down-regulation of photosynthesis under elevated [CO2] being particularly associated with reduced carboxylation efficiency of the Rubisco enzyme. Such adjustments in the photosynthesis machinery result in the stimulation of water-use efficiency under elevated [CO2] only when it is combined with a high nitrogen supply and reduced water availability. These findings indicate limited effects of elevated [CO2] on carbon uptake in temperate coniferous forests when combined with naturally low nitrogen availability and intensifying droughts during the summer periods. Such interactions have to be incorporated into the mechanistic models predicting changes in terrestrial carbon sequestration and forest growth in the future.</jats:p>",

The establishment of nature reserves has not only strengthened the protection of specific species but has also played a vital role in the protection of ecosystem services (ESs). However, few studies have been conducted to systematically assess the effectiveness of nature reserves from the perspective of ecosystem services supply and demand (S&amp;D) or make comparisons between the conservation effects of different types of nature reserves. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of ecosystem service supply and demand in 412 Chinese national nature reserves. The results showed that both supply and demand for ecosystem services per unit area show a spatial pattern of increasing from west to east. The supply–demand matching pattern is dominated by high supply–high demand (H–H) and low supply–high demand (L–H) in the central and eastern regions, and high supply–low demand (H–L) and low supply–low demand (L–L) in the northeast, northwest, and southwest regions. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) of ecosystem services supply and demand increased from 0.53 in 2000 to 0.57 in 2020, and the number of NRs reaching the coordinated level (&gt;0.5) increased by 15 from 2000 to 2020, representing 3.64% of the total number of protected areas. Steppe meadows, ocean coasts, forest ecosystems, wildlife, and wild plant types of nature reserves all improved more obviously. This provides a scientific basis for strengthening the ecological and environmental supervision of nature reserves, and the research methods and ideas can provide references for similar research.</jats:p>"

However, research related to ecological protection and restoration is insufficient for the study of the demand for ecosystem services. Many ecological protection and restoration projects have been implemented in the Fujian Province, but the ESs and the relationship changes between supply and demand are not clear. In this study, multisource remote sensing and public data and the InVEST model were used to quantitatively assess and map four typical ESs, including food production, water yield, soil retention and carbon sequestration. Hotspot analysis was used to analyze the spatial cluster of the ESs supply–demand ratio. The results showed that: (1) there were trade-offs between supporting and regulating services, particularly between carbon sequestration and water yield services, and the strength of trade-offs or synergies between food production and other services was stronger in protection and restoration areas than in other areas; (2) the supply of ESs in the Fujian Province exceeded the demand, and the supply–demand ratio for ESs decreased from the mountainous regions in the northwest interior to the economically developed regions in the southeast coast; and (3) ecological restoration projects improved the relationship between supply and demand for some ESs, while other areas (except protection and restoration areas) had many low-value clusters of supply–demand ratios, especially regarding water yield and carbon sequestration services. Based on the results, our findings also provide suggestions for ensuring the sustainability of ecological protection and restoration in southeast hilly areas and other similar regions.</jats:p>"

However, as a novel crop, the cost‐effectiveness and environmental feasibility of carinata feedstock are unknown, and there are questions about the optimal supply chain configuration for carinata‐based SAF production. This study aims to design a supply chain model for carinata‐based SAF production by optimizing the location of farms and facilities (e.g. storage units, crushing mills, biorefineries) for a minimum transportation cost under a set of supply and demand conditions. An integrated mixed‐integer linear programming (MILP) model was combined with geographical information system (GIS) analysis to design a spatially explicit supply chain configuration. The GIS‐based network analysis considered all of the counties in Georgia to set the candidate locations of carinata farms and facilities, and determined minimum cost and emission routes between those counties and the airport using existing transportation networks and modes (e.g. road, rail and pipeline). The MILP model determined the final selection of the farms and the number of facilities and their locations over those minimum‐cost routes. With this supply chain configuration, the minimum price of SAF was $0.92 L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which is $0.44 higher than conventional aviation fuel (CAF). The associated carbon intensity of SAF was estimated at 940.7 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, a reduction of 66% relative to the carbon intensity of equivalent CAF. The study found that a carbon tax (or subsidy) of $230.48 t CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> would be needed to overcome the cost differential with CAF and promote carinata‐based SAF in Georgia.</jats:p>",

The results were obtained through surveys of personnel in charge of hospital and pharmacy supplies. The questions focused on the level of training, seniority in positions related to the problem, knowledge of regulations, degree of innovation in the procedures used in logistics and supply chain and procurement. However, a very striking fact was related to the importance of the use of AI, where, very surprisingly, 64.7% considered that it would not help to reduce human errors generated in the areas analyzed.</jats:p>"

The AGPS uses a rectifier-inverter-isolated step-up structure. There is a DC bus between the rectifier and the inverter. In order to limit DC bus voltage ripple and transient fluctuations, a large number of capacitors are used, which degrades the reliability of the power supply and occupies a large amount of space. This work finds that due to the difference in the turn-off time of the rectifier and the inverter, the capacitance mainly depends on the rectifier current when the inverter is turned off. On this basis, an active power filter (APF) scheme is proposed to absorb the current. To enhance the dynamic response ability of the APF, model predictive control is adopted. In this paper, the circuit structure of the APF is introduced, the prediction model is deduced, the corresponding control strategy and signal detection method are proposed, and the simulation and experimental results show that APF can track the transient current of the DC bus and reduce the voltage fluctuation significantly.</jats:p>",

However, the complex and multibranched biosynthetic pathway of methionine has posed significant challenges to its efficient fermentation production. In this study, we employed a modularized synthetic biology strategy to improve the weakest branched pathway of methionine biosynthesis. Three exogenous modules were constructed and assembled to provide methyl donors, which are the primary limiting factors in methionine biosynthesis. The first module utilized added methanol, which was converted into 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate for methionine production but was hindered by the toxicity of methanol. To circumvent this issue, a non-toxic formate module was constructed, resulting in a visible improvement in the methionine titer. Finally, an exogenous betaine module was constructed, which could directly deliver methyl to methionine. The final strain produced 2.87 g/L of methionine in a flask, representing a 20% increase over the starting strain. This study presents a novel strategy for improving and balancing other metabolites that are synthesized through complex multibranched pathways.</jats:p>"

The IVHF-DEMATEL technique is applied to identify cause-and-effect relationships and draw the influence-relations map of the barriers. In contrast to prior work, which converts fuzzy sets into crisp sets and then uses crisp set operations, this study is the first study to investigate the Vietnamese agricultural supply chain that uses fully hesitant fuzzy operations representing experts’ assessment without information loss during the conversion. Our results show that ‘lack of government regulation’, ‘lack of scalability and system speed’, ‘a large amount of resource and capital requirements’, and ‘lack of trust among agro-stakeholder or public perception’ are the main barriers. Consistent with previous studies, ‘lack of government regulation’ is the most significant barrier. The results also indicate the hesitant degree of each barrier and better inform decision-makers about uncertain situations. Moreover, a priority order for tackling barriers is proposed to accelerate blockchain adoption in the Vietnamese agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>"

These reprocessed goods return to different echelons of the supply chain according to their quality, and the volume of each type of reverse flow (<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic> the returns share) may significantly vary between different supply chains, affecting the dynamic behaviour of the entire system. The aim of this work is to explore the impact of the volume of returns among multiple reverse flows in a closed-loop supply chain where each member can have its own reverse flow. We analyse a four-echelon closed-loop supply chain, where a collector is in charge of collecting and inspecting the returns and sending them to the different echelons depending on their quality. An agent-based simulation model considering different return rates, coefficient of variations for the forward lead times, and returns share is developed and evaluated in terms of bullwhip effect. We observe that considerable volume and medium–low quality of the returns enable bullwhip effect reduction in systems where returns are shared among all the members of the supply chain. However, in single reverse flow closed-loop supply chains, moderate volume and high quality of the returns are preferable to gain improvements both in terms of order and inventory variability. From a managerial point of view, we provide useful recommendations for companies adopting closed-loop.</jats:p>",

Fog is considered a type of low-lying cloud and is heavily influenced by water bodies, topography, and wind conditions.

In this work, we aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the fog-water contribution to the water balance? (2) How does the presence of vegetation affect the water supply to the ecosystem? We took as a case study the Central Mountain Region of Veracruz, in eastern Mexico, and measured components of the water balance; this included precipitation (gross and net), fog water, interception, transpiration, evapotranspiration, and condensation, and we estimated water gain and loss of the water balance. We registered 510 precipitation events distributed throughout the year with three peaks (October, May, and January). Of these, 386 were fog events, 41 were rain events, and 83 were events combining fog and rain. Fog had a substantial contribution of water to the system, with a volume 22 times greater than that of rain (4311.14 mm vs. 197.5 mm). From the total water gain, the highest proportion (91%) was contributed by fog interception. Fog was considered a constant source of moisture throughout the year; however, water intercepted during the dry season was higher (56%) compared with the wet season (36%). Our results highlight the importance of the fog as a source of water for the region.</jats:p>"

The findings were analysed using SPSS software and the Relative Importance Index (RII). Different in perspective and culture, financial limitations and fear of failure were internal challenges against implementing GSCM.

Drought induced a reduction in biomass accumulation of poplar cuttings and mulberry seedlings, and the cuttings and seedlings exhibited different biomass allocation patterns in response to drought stress. Under Ca0 treatment, poplar cuttings allocated more biomass to leaves and less biomass to stems under drought conditions, leading to an increased leaf/stem (L/St) ratio and higher SLA than under moist conditions in order to maintain higher Pn, and had enhanced WUE to cope with drought stress. Under the same treatment, mulberry seedlings allocated more biomass to roots and less biomass to stems, leading to an increased root/shoot (R/S) ratio and lower SLA, to improve drought resistance. Ca200 treatment decreased the growth of poplar cuttings and mulberry seedlings, whereas it enhanced the WUE, root growth, and R/S ratio of poplar cuttings and the WUE of mulberry seedlings, and alleviated drought stress in both species.</jats:p>"

The model was used to analyze some possible measures to reduce the climate impact of cement production. The main result from this study is that three factors may bring regulatory limitations to be imposed on cement production. The contribution of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to the atmosphere, the amount of iron used in construction and the use of energy in production are the main factors that may cause limitations. Cement accounts for about 8% of the global CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions and energy use at present, and this fraction is projected by the simulations to continue to increase. To reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from cement production, ending fossil fuel use for calcination, combined with a change towards using mortar as an alternative for making concrete should be considered. Our conclusion is that the long-term limitation for cement production is the availability of carbon-free energy, and the availability of iron for reinforcement bars. Eliminating the use of hydrocarbons for cement calcination may reduce the future the contribution from cement by 38%. Eliminating the use of hydrocarbons for calcination combined with substituting cement with mortar to 50%, the contribution to the future global average temperature increase is reduced by 62%. Eliminating the use of hydrocarbons for calcination combined with substituting cement with mortar to 90% is a reduction by 90% in the contribution from cement.\n</jats:p>",

Production is carried out in factories in certain centers, and the products produced are often distributed all over the world. There is a need for a multi-agent supply chain network and supply chain management with the stages of delivering the products to the final consumer, starting from the pre-production stage. It has become clear that the need for a complex supply chain network by producing products from a single center is no longer economical and environmentally friendly. In recent years, consumers have started to think about the harmful effects of the products they buy. Changing customer needs and demands have also made companies consider the mass customization production model. Recently, three-dimensional printing technologies, also defined as additive manufacturing technology, have emerged as a new production technology. With this disruptive technology, production models and supply chain networks are subject to change and transformation. In this study, the environmental and economic benefits of 3D printing technology are analyzed in the context of mass customization production model and supply chains.</jats:p>"

We conducted an online survey with US caregivers of infants under 2 years of age (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 319) to assess how the COVID‐19 pandemic impacted breastfeeding, formula‐feeding and household ability to obtain infant‐feeding supplies and lactation support (68% mothers; 66% White; 8% living in poverty). We found that 31% of families who used infant formula indicated that they experienced various challenges in obtaining infant formula, citing the following top three reasons: the formula was sold out (20%), they had to travel to multiple stores (21%) or formula was too expensive (8%). In response, 33% of families who used formula reported resorting to deleterious formula‐feeding practices such as diluting formula with extra water (11%) or cereal (10%), preparing smaller bottles (8%) or saving leftover mixed bottles for later (11%). Of the families who fed infants human milk, 53% reported feeding changes directly as a result of the pandemic, for example, 46% increased their provisioning of human milk due to perceived benefits for the infant's immune system (37%), ability to work remotely/stay home (31%), concerns about money (9%) or formula shortages (8%). Fifteen percent of families who fed human milk reported that they did not receive the lactation support they needed and 4.8% stopped breastfeeding. To protect infant food and nutrition security, our results underscore the need for policies to support breastfeeding and ensure equitable and reliable access to infant formula.</jats:p>",

With the original CF as the sensing layer, buffer layer, and current collector of C‐TENG, the maximal power of 91.5 mW is attained. The CECIS shows a competitive output performance. The time ratio of the duration of supply energy to the harvesting and storage reaches 9.6:1, meaning that it is competent for the continuous energy application when the effective working time of C‐TENG is longer than one‐tenth of the whole day.

In the context of the great challenge of rapid loss of arable land and rapid growth of food demand due to rapid socio-economic development, scientific forecasting of arable land demand and supply, can clarify the conservation pressure of regional arable land, provide a reference for formulating effective arable land policies, and ensuring regional food security and sustainable development. Therefore, with the help of system dynamics model and Gray-Markov model, this study predicts and analyzes the balance of arable land supply and demand in China, and reached the following conclusions. (1) During the projection period, with the continuous development of living standards and agricultural technology, both per capita food demand and food production show an upward trend. However, the combined effects of changes in diet structure and grain yields on changes in arable land demand are smaller than those brought about by population changes. Therefore, the trend of arable land demand is similar to that of population change, and the arable land demand in China reaches a peak of 112.78 million hm2 in 2026. (2) The amount of arable land possession is always greater than the amount of arable land replenishment, and the arable land supply area shows a continuous decreasing trend, and the arable land supply in China is 127.16 million hm2 in 2035. (3) China’s supply holdings are all able to meet the demand of China’s arable land, but combined with existing studies, it is insufficient to meet the demand of crop rotation fallow between 2023 and 2030, which is not conducive to sustainable development. In the future, arable land protection policies should be comprehensively improved and strictly implemented to ensure national food security and achieve sustainable use of arable land.</jats:p>"

In this study, we reconstructed the natural flow in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) not regulated by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) based on a long–short-term memory model. We then evaluated the dynamics of ecohydrological regimes using environmental flow components and ecohydrological risk indicators and quantified the impacts of the TGR. The results showed that the hydrological stability has increased after TGR construction, with significant decreases in the frequency and duration of extremely low-flows, large floods, and small floods. In addition, there is a high ecohydrological risk in the MRYR, with a higher ecodeficit and showing a continuous upward trend. The impact of the TGR on environmental flow components decreases along the river, averaging 42.1%, with the strongest impact on small floods, accounting for 56.2%. Overall, reservoir regulation has counteracted the increased eco-risk caused by climate change. Considering only the TGR, the ecosurplus in the spring and winter seasons increased, while the ecodeficit increased in the autumn season, with corresponding contribution rates of 81.4, 82.7, and 53.1%, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the fundamental role of renewable energy assets in achieving global temperature control targets, new energy management methods are required to efficiently match intermittent renewable generation and demand. Based on analysing various designed cases, this paper explores a number of heuristics for a smart battery scheduling algorithm that efficiently matches available power supply and demand. The core of improvement of the proposed smart battery scheduling algorithm is exploiting future knowledge, which can be realized by current state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, to effectively store and trade energy. The performance of the developed heuristic battery scheduling algorithm using forecast data of demands, generation, and energy prices is compared to a heuristic baseline algorithm, where decisions are made solely on the current state of the battery, demand, and generation. The battery scheduling algorithms are tested using real data from two large-scale smart energy trials in the UK, in addition to various types and levels of simulated uncertainty in forecasts. The results show that when using a battery to store generated energy, on average, the newly proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm, obtaining up to 20–60% more profit for the prosumer from their energy assets, in cases where the battery is optimally sized and high-quality forecasts are available. Crucially, the proposed algorithm generates greater profit than the baseline method even with large uncertainty on the forecast, showing the robustness of the proposed solution. On average, only 2–12% of profit is lost on generation and demand uncertainty compared to perfect forecasts. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm increases as the uncertainty decreases, showing great promise for the algorithm as the quality of forecasting keeps improving.</jats:p>"

How to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction has always been a difficult problem for hydrologists. The key to solve this problem is to reduce the complexity of runoff series and improve the accuracy of runoff prediction model. Based on the aforementioned ideas, this article uses the complementary set empirical mode decomposition to decompose the runoff series into multiple intrinsic components that retain time–frequency information, thus reducing the complexity of the runoff series. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) adaptive neuro-fuzzy system is used to predict each intrinsic component to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction. After that, the trained intrinsic components of the model are reconstructed into the original runoff series. The example shows that the absolute relative error of the runoff forecasting model constructed in this article is 0.039, and the determination coefficient is 0.973. This model can be applied to the annual runoff series forecasting. Comparing the prediction results of this model with empirical mode decomposition algorithm-ANFIS model and ANFIS model, complementary set empirical mode decomposition algorithm-PSO-ANFIS model shows obvious advantages.</jats:p>",

There have been few considerations of supply chains and enterprise characteristics included in previous research. This paper focuses on the supply chains of brand-name products, and systematically identifies principal factors that influence environmentally destructive behaviors in the supply chain of brand-name products from internal and external viewpoints of the supply chain. Considering the characteristics of the polluting industries, 416 valid questionnaires were obtained by investigating the supply chain of brand-name products in chemical, mechanical, food, and agricultural products, the light industry, and other industries. The results show that: (1) environmentally destructive behavior is differently exhibited in different industries among the investigated supply chains of brand-name products; (2) the enterprises’ attitudes, policies, and investments in pro-environment approaches play a fundamental role in the environmental management of the brand-name products supply chain; (3) environmental legislation and public supervision have significant effects on the environmental management of the brand-name products supply chain; (4) only when environmental regulation is combined with environmental legislation and public supervision is a restriction of environmentally destructive behavior in the supply chain of brand-name products triggered. Thus, we suggest that the attribution and sharing mechanisms of environmental responsibility in the supply chain of brand-name products should be established; a “push-pull-anchor” mechanism and coordinated co-governance supervision system for environmentally destructive behavior in the supply chain of brand-name products should be built.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the sound field distribution characteristics of 6206 silicon nitride ceramic deep groove ball bearings are studied under different oil supplies. A mathematical model of the sound field distribution of full ceramic ball bearings under oil lubrication is established, and the validity of the model is verified by experimental data. The bearing cavity simulation model of the full ceramic ball bearing is established, and the influence of oil supply on the operation characteristics of the full ceramic ball bearing is studied. Through theoretical and experimental research, the circular distribution law of the noise signal of ceramic ball bearings under different oil supplies is revealed. It is found that there is an optimal fuel supply when the speed and load are constant. Under optimal oil supply lubrication conditions, the full ceramic ball bearing has the minimum radiation noise, and the bearing exhibits optimal lubrication state, vibration and temperature rise characteristics. The new contribution of this paper: with the increase in oil supply, the sound pressure level of radiation noise of full ceramic ball bearings decreases and then increases. The research results reveal the radiation noise mechanism of full ceramic ball bearings, which is of great significance for enriching its theory and method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydroponic-producing selenium (Se)-biofortified vegetables in a greenhouse is a convenient and effective way to provide Se-enriched food and overcome hidden hunger. CO2 fertilization is commonly implemented to increase vegetable yield in greenhouse production. However, this application accompanies decreased mineral concentrations in the edible parts. Here we investigated the effects of [CO2] and Se supply on the growth, gas exchange, and cucumber fruit quality. A hydroponic experiment with two CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) (C1: 410, and C2: 1200 μmol mol−1) and four Se supply levels (Se0: 0, Se1: 0.125, Se2: 0.250, and Se3: 0.500 mg Se L−1) was carried out. A low level of Se supply (Se1: 0.125 mg Se L−1) protected the photosynthetic pigments and stimulated the stomatal opening, especially under [CO2] fertilization. It leads to a higher net photosynthesis rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr) than other Se treatments. The most significant changes in dry weight, fruit yield, and soluble sugar concentration were also obtained in Se1 under CO2 fertilization due to the enhanced CO2 fixation. Meanwhile, the Se concentration in fruit was 0.63 mg kg−1 FW in C2Se1, with the highest Se accumulation and use efficiency. According to the recommended dietary allowance of 55 μg Se day−1 for adults, an intake of 87 g of cucumber grown in C2Se1 is sufficient. Because of the improved Tr and better root structure in Se1, the uptake of mineral nutrients through mass flow and interception was well maintained under CO2 fertilization. So, the concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mn in cucumber fruits were not significantly decreased by elevated [CO2] in Se1. However, the concentrations of soluble proteins, S, Mg, Fe, and Zn in cucumber fruits in C2Se1 were lower than those in C1Se1, which was mainly attributed to the dilution effects under CO2 fertilization. Therefore, a selenite supply of 0.125 mg Se L−1 was found to be the optimal dosage for producing Se-enriched cucumber fruits with high yield and better qualities under CO2 fertilization (1200 μmol mol−1).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, the optimal design of a hybrid energy system (HES), consisting of photovoltaic technology integrated with fuel cells (HPV/FC) and relying on hydrogen storage, is performed to meet the annual demand of a residential complex to find the minimum total net present cost (TNPC), while observing the reliability constraint as the energy-not-supplied probability (ENSP) and considering real meteorological data of the Kuala Lumpur city in Malaysia. The decision variables include the size of system components, which are optimally determined by an improved artificial ecosystem-based optimization algorithm (IAEO). The conventional AEO is improved using the dynamic lens-imaging learning strategy (DLILS) to prevent premature convergence. The results demonstrated that the decrease (increase) of the reliability constraint leads to an increase (decrease) in the TNPC, as well as the cost of electricity (COE). For a maximum reliability constraint of 5%, the results show that the TNPC and COE obtained USD 2.247 million and USD 0.4046 million, respectively. The superior performance of the IAEO has been confirmed with the AEO, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO), with the lowest TNPC and higher reliability. In addition, the effectiveness of the hydrogen tank efficiency and load changes is confirmed in the hybrid system design.</jats:p>"

A detailed understanding of the cues controlling ASC differentiation is important to devise strategies to modulate antibody formation. Here, we dissected differentiation trajectories of human naive B cells into ASCs using single-cell RNA sequencing. By comparing transcriptomes of B cells at different stages of differentiation from an in vitro model with ex vivo B cells and ASCs, we uncovered a novel pre-ASC population present ex vivo in lymphoid tissues. For the first time, a germinal-center-like population is identified in vitro from human naive B cells and possibly progresses into a memory B cell population through an alternative route of differentiation, thus recapitulating in vivo human GC reactions. Our work allows further detailed characterization of human B cell differentiation into ASCs or memory B cells in both healthy and diseased conditions.</jats:p>"

Head loss and energy consumption are two problems in pressurized irrigation systems. Therefore, a combined filtration device – micro-pressure filtering and washing tank – was designed. In this study, the micro-pressure filtering and washing tank was taken as the research object, and a physical model test of inlet flow and sediment concentration was carried out. The head loss prediction model of the micro-pressure filtering and washing tank under clean water and muddy water conditions was established by dimensional and multiple regression analyses, and the determination coefficients (R2) were 0.987 and 0.953, respectively. In addition, the test data were used to validate the head loss prediction model for muddy water. The average relative error of the predicted values was 3.36%, suggesting that the proposed models are ideal for head loss prediction. The research results can provide technical support for the structure optimization and filtration mechanism of the micro-pressure filtering and washing tank, and enrich the theory of micro-pressure filtration.</jats:p>",

The antibacterial effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence of Ca2+ is affected by the Ca2+ concentration. The oxidative damage mechanism and oxidative damage process of EGCG in E. coli under the presence of Ca2+ were deeply analyzed under three aspects: reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant system, and oxidative stress response in E. coli to provide a theoretical basis for the use of EGCG as a disinfectant in drinking water disinfection. EGCG leads to excessive production of superoxide anion in E. coli and the presence of Ca2+ promotes further imbalance of superoxide anion in E. coli; Ca2+ has little effect on EGCG hindering the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals in bacteria; EGCG can hinder the effect of antioxidant enzymes in E. coli, and Ca2+ has a particular regulatory effect on antioxidant enzymes, thus hindering the oxidative damage of EGCG to E. coli; Ca2+ can cause the expression of the oxyR and DPS genes, protect bacterial DNA, and prevent EGCG from damaging bacterial DNA. In the presence of a high concentration of Ca2+, it may activate the cell efflux pump through the soxS gene, resulting in E. coli resistance to EGCG.</jats:p>"

On the basis of conventional μ modified adaptive control method, a compound modified adaptive control (CMAC) system based on neural network inverse model is proposed in this study. At first, the afterburner fuel actuator model of MEE is established through Simulink/AMESim co-simulation to study its fuel supply characteristics and reveal the reasons for dead-zone characteristics of the actuator. Subsequently, an integrated model of afterburner fuel actuator/MEE is established to investigate the effect of dead-zone characteristics on engine performance. Finally, the CMAC system for afterburner fuel flow closed-loop control based on neural network inverse model and improved μ modified adaptive control method is designed. The simulation results show that the dead-zone characteristics of afterburner fuel actuator can cause engine shaking and unstable operation. The engine thrust has a continuous fluctuation with amplitude of about 0.2%. The proposed CMAC system can effectively avoid the dead-zone interval of actuator and achieve stable transition of the engine state in the entire operating range of the afterburner fuel actuator. Thus, the stability of the control system can be significantly improved. Meanwhile, the improved μ modified adaptive control algorithm in the CMAC system has better dynamic characteristics when compared with the conventional μ modified adaptive control algorithm. </jats:p>",

Brazil is the largest soybean producer and exporter, with 60% from tropical and 40% from subtropical environments. Nitrogen (N) can play an essential role in the storage of proteins in seeds; thus, it could be a key factor in increasing the quantity and quality of seeds in high-yielding soybean crops. Unlike in temperate environments, there is a gap of knowledge on whether soybean grown under tropical and subtropical climates are limited by N-fertilization to sustain the seed yield increase without detriments in seed protein concentration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of N-fertilization on soybean seed yield, protein and oil concentrations in tropical and subtropical environments in Brazil, thus contributing to agricultural intensification procedures and food security studies. Two levels of N-fertilization (0 and 1000 ka/ha) were tested across 11 tropical or subtropical environments. The range of latitudes explored here was from 12°S to 29°S, representing the major soybean-producing regions in Brazil either under rainfed or irrigated conditions. We found that seed yield responses to N-fertilization were significant (in some environments under rainfed with an average increase of 7%) or not significant (in irrigated). Seed protein increases due to improved N-fertilization (on average 4% for irrigated and 12% for rainfed conditions) were much higher than previous reports from temperate environments. Regardless of N supply and water deficit, there was a trend of seed protein and oil concentration increasing toward lower latitudes.</jats:p>",

They are part of the emergency power supply system for auxiliary electrical equipment with a rated voltage of 0.4 kV. In such a reliable power supply system for especially responsible consumers, alternative networks and backup sources are necessarily used. Typically, groups of consumers for auxiliary needs of nuclear power plants are powered from the inverter network, so that in the event of a shutdown of the backup bypass network, these loads continue to be powered by the uninterruptible power supply unit. It incorporates a charger – a controlled rectifier, a battery pack and a transistor inverter. The transition from one network to another in any direction must be “shockless” in order to avoid the operation of the protections of uninterruptible power units and other electrical protections of the reliable power supply system. If there are failures in the algorithms or their irrational organization, the processes of transition between networks may be accompanied by a violation of uninterrupted power supply or phase-to-phase short circuits. A structural simulation model has been created in the MatLab computer mathematics system for testing transition algorithms for various phase shifts of networks and transition directions. The algorithm of transition between networks for uninterruptible power units of one of the manufacturing companies that supplied equipment to nuclear power plants was analyzed. A safer optimal algorithm for controlling network switching with phase-by-phase control of the current drop in the disconnected network is proposed.

Material and methods: Wistar-Kyoto inbred rats were exposed to local X-rays in the ilio-lumbar region of the back at a dose of 110 Gy (tube voltage 30 kV, current 6.1 mA, Al filter 0.1 mm thick), at a dose rate of 20.1 Gy / min. Irradiation field area was 8.5 cm2. Radiation exposure caused the formation of long-term (up to 3.5–4 months) non-healing radiation ulcers of the skin without a critical radiation load on the underlying tissues. For the treatment of radiation lesions, an antibiotic was used – levotetrasulfin forte, as well as drugs that affect the blood supply and trophism of irradiated tissues – pentoxifylline and detralex. The drugs were administered daily both in isolation from each other and together during the period (from the 21st to the 42nd or from the 28th to the 48th day after irradiation), when the radiation ulcer formed and its gradual healing began. The everity of radiation skin lesions and the effects of therapy were assessed in dynamics by clinical manifestations and using planimetry.  Results: It was found that the separate use of drugs in the treatment of severe local radiation lesions was not very effective. However, with the combined administration of drugs, a noticeable increase in the rate of healing of radiation ulcers was revealed. Thus, it was shown that with the joint administration of pentoxifylline (intraperitoneal, 50.0 mg / kg), detralex (75.0 mg / kg, per os) and levotetrasulfin forte (intraperitoneal, 0.1 ml / kg), the area of radiation ulcers in treated animals in the period from 98 to 126 days after irradiation was 26–80 % less compared to irradiated controls.   Conclusion: The experiments show the possibility of successful use of a complex antibiotic in combination with drugs that improve blood supply and trophism of irradiated tissues, in the treatment of severe local radiation lesions.</jats:p>",

All of these patients underwent PIB of the eye, because it was difficult to diagnose by routine ocular fundus examination, conventional ultrasound or/and ultrasonic biomicroscope (UBM) due to opacity of refractive media, pupillary occlusion, large involvement or special location of the lesion. The imaging features of difficult cases in PIB were analyzed. The diagnosis accuracy rating of PIB were evaluated and contrasted with conventional ultrasound or UBM by the standard of intraoperative diagnosis or/and pathological results.\nRESULTS: According to intraoperative diagnosis or pathological results as gold standard, among the 44 cases, there were 19 cases missed diagnosis, misdiagnosed or difficult-to-diagnose by conventional ultrasound or UBM, including 4 cases of long-standing RD difficult to diagnose, 4 cases misdiagnosed, and 11 cases incompletely observed or miss diagnosed. The diagnostic accuracy rate of PIB and conventional ultrasound or UBM were 100% (44/44) and 56.82% (25/44), and the sensitivity of them were 100% and 56.82%. All the patients underwent PIB and were diagnosed as RD (15 cases), retinal and choroidal detachment (4 cases), subchoroidal hematocele (1 case), vitreous opacity and/or organic membrane formation (4 cases), PHPV (12 cases), iris and/or ciliary body tumors (3 cases), and choroidal tumors (6 cases). According to the intraoperative diagnosis or pathological results, the diagnostic coincidence rate of PIB was 100%, which was significantly higher than conventional ultrasound and UBM.\nCONCLUSION: PIB can help to accurately diagnose complex RD, PHPV, and intraocular masses with special location or/and excessive size. It has important diagnostic value for patients with equivocal findings at conventional ultrasound examination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Teaching and learning are two basic processes underlying the activity of students and teachers nowadays. The learning process puts both parties toward each other,what it teaches, and what it takes, the teacher and the student. Today training students to teach themselves, and their education, equipping them with the skills of independent work with the most advanced methods of conscious, sustainable, active, and creative learning takes great importance. The purpose of this topic is to know the importance of usage of all skills during a lesson hour. The teacher is free to use a variety of methods and strategies for teaching and learning to suit the needs of students in different classes. He combines these methods during the learning process and adapts according to the increasing development of linguistic competence and independence of student development, the consistency of this process. Teaching has at its center the method of communication, task-based methods, functional methods, and situations as real life, etc. These methods are realized through various strategies and techniques, according to language skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Teachers and students collaborate on the organization of teaching and learning. To facilitate teaching/learning, the teacher finds efficient ways to organize communication activities and provides and suggests source materials for students. In contemporary teaching, the teacher does not only play the role of teacher but also plays the role of supervisor. Together they establish cooperative relations in the process of learning.The teacher clarifies the students and takes their understanding of what happens in the classroom. This means clarifying the rules of the line of work and the responsibilities of students in the process of activities. The teacher suggests and provides the use of audiovisual means, electronic, and helps students to use various forms of information technology within and outside the classroom. It gives students the website in accordance with their age and educational requirements. In teaching, an hour should be applied to all four language skills strategies, but they escalate from level to level depending on the objectives. Setting the students in the spotlight makes the student participate actively in linguistic interaction, preparing them for a new phase of their education or being able to face the demands of the labor market.</jats:p>"
