      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forecast sharing is studied in a supply chain with a manufacturer that faces stochastic demand for a single product and a supplier that is the sole source for a critical component. The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract, the supplier constructs capacity (if he accepts the contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime. </jats:p>",

Increasingly fragmented and volatile markets result in pressure on organisations to strategically align all aspects of their supply chain to ensure rapid and appropriate responsiveness. There is a paucity of research in this area in the steel stockholder supply chain. A strategic alignment model was selected which incorporated alignment from four key aspects, namely markets, strategy, culture and leadership style. The model is used as an analysis framework for a case study in the steel stockholder supply chain. Data collection included a survey of a stratified sample of customers, company archive and organisational material and semi‐structured interviews. The implications for the supply chain and the organisation’s response are discussed and evaluated.</jats:p>",

It reviews published literature in both fields and a number of supporting areas, revealing a minimal overlap in the research. A number of case studies of progressive organisations are examined, including an in‐depth study of Nortel Networks Corporation’s recent market repositioning and current supply chain integration activities. The study concludes that, while there is little evidence of research exploring the integration of processes extending throughout supply chains, some businesses are gaining competitive advantage by maximising the efficiency of their “global” supply chains or “virtual” organisations. A conceptual model of an integrated business process, derived from the case study, is presented, which highlights the importance of communication between processes and between partners in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The latter part of the twentieth century saw the lean production paradigm positively impact many market sectors ranging from automotive through to construction. In particular there is much evidence to suggest that level scheduling combined with the elimination of <jats:italic>muda</jats:italic> has successfully delivered a wide range of products to those markets where cost is the primary order winning criteria. However, there are many other markets where the order winner is availability. This has led to the emergence of the agile paradigm typified by “quick response” and similar initiatives. Nevertheless, “lean” and “agile” are not mutually exclusive paradigms and may be married to advantage in a number of different ways. This paper explores ways in which hybrid strategies can be developed to create cost‐effective supply chains and proposes an integrated manufacture/logistics model for enabling the essential infrastructure.</jats:p>",

To be reliable in an uncertain and changing environment, firms must be able to quickly respond to changes. The ability to do this in a useful time frame is called agility. Unfortunately, measures taken to increase agility often lead to increases in complexity, which works against agility.

We compared our results to those of a previous study conducted at a colony where food availability was higher (Coats Island, Nunavut). To control for underlying phenotypic correlations between egg size and parental quality, we switched eggs at random among pairs. Egg size positively affected the rate of early wing-feather growth, but contrary to prediction, the advantage enjoyed by chicks from large eggs over those from small eggs at Digges Island (1.6 days' feather growth on average) was no greater than at Coats Island (2.0 days). Egg size had no effect on the rate at which chicks gained mass at Digges Island, but young from large eggs tended to remain heavier than those from small eggs. At Coats Island, this occurred only in a year in which chicks grew relatively slowly, offering some support for the hypothesis that a large egg confers greater advantage when feeding conditions are unfavorable. Adults at Digges Island invested heavily in provisioning their chicks, but there was no evidence of a trade-off between egg size and provisioning. As costs associated with large eggs have not been detected in Thick-billed Murres, the existence of considerable variation in egg size, beyond that associated with female age or experience, remains unexplained.</jats:p>",

Locomotory and nonlocomotory muscles of four harbor seals (mass = 17.5–41 kg) were glutaraldehyde-perfusion fixed and samples processed for electron microscopy and analyzed by morphometry. Capillary-to-fiber number and surface ratios were 0.81 ± 0.05 and 0.16 ± 0.01, respectively.

All these values are 1.5–3 times lower than in muscles with similar or lower volume densities of mitochondria in dogs of comparable size. Compared with terrestrial mammals, the skeletal muscles of harbor seals do not match their increased aerobic enzyme capacities and mitochondrial volume densities with greater muscle capillary supply.

By chance, this period corresponded to a phase of a positive swing of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), whereas earlier studies in the North Atlantic generally took place during more negative phases of the NAO (Figure 1). This study demonstrates by means of a coupled ecosystem‐circulation model that the long‐term change in the NAO between the 1960s and 1990s may have induced significant regional changes in the upper ocean's nutrient supply. These include a decrease of nitrate supply by about 30% near Bermuda and in mid‐latitudes, and a simultaneous 60% increase in the upwelling region off West Africa. The results suggest that a synthesis of biogeochemical observations taken during the past decades must take into account NAO‐related climate variability.</jats:p>",

Although much of the current Internet discussion focuses on sales and marketing applications, step change improvements in the management of the supply chain are possible using the same fundamental technologies. However, it is argued that a paradigm shift in the way in which manufacturing companies plan and control their operations is required if full advantage is to be gained; an alternative to the traditional linear transfer of information within supply chains is required. The Internet provides the opportunity for demand data and supply capacity data to be visible to all companies within a manufacturing supply chain, consequently companies can be in a position to anticipate demand fluctuations and respond accordingly. This is in contrast to the more established reactive approach. This paper proposes the development of supply webs and a more interactive approach to supply chain partnering and identifies some of the research issues within this context to facilitate the development of Internet‐based manufacturing planning and control.</jats:p>",

Analysis of the survey results provided some interesting insights into factors differentiating “more agile” organizations from “less agile” organizations. “More agile” companies from this study can be characterized as more customer focused, and applying a combination of “soft” and “hard” methodologies in order to meet changing customer requirements. They also see the involvement of suppliers in this process as being crucial to their ability to attain high levels of customer satisfaction. The “less agile” group, on the other hand, can be characterized as more internally focused with a bias toward internal operational outcomes. They saw no link between any of the independent variables and innovation, and appear to see technology as more closely linked to the promotion of these operational outcomes than to customer satisfaction. The role of suppliers for this group is to support productivity and process improvement rather than to promote customer satisfaction.</jats:p>",

The nodules were diagnosed by percutaneous core biopsies as highly differentiated HCC. We also examined with PDI another 64 patients with 76 HCC nodules, and none of the nodules showed a constant‐flow afferent tumor vessel.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>An important aspect in the successful commercialisation of thermal spray processing is a safe and cost efficient gas supply system. As coating techniques such as High Velocity Oxygen Fuel spraying, (HVOF) High Pressure Plasma spraying (HPPS), High Pressure High Velocity Oxygen Fuel kerosene based systems (HPHVOF) and the recent developments in Cold Gas Dynamic spraying become more prominent, so the requirements on existing standard gas delivery systems designed for less demanding applications such as flame and plasma spraying need to be up-rated and improved. This work highlights recent developments in gas safety supply equipment dedicated to the thermal spray sector, the use of gas detectors in thermal spray workshops, more cost efficient gas delivery systems for fuel gases such as hydrogen, LPG propane, propylene and acetylene, and also covers improvements in gas delivery systems for the process gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon. The paper looks at various gas supply options, comparing compressed gas cylinders, liquid gas cylinders and bulk liquid supply vessels outlining the benefits and limitations of each systems in relation to the individual spray techniques. The higher pressures and flow rate associated with the growth of kerosene based fuel guns has resulted in an increased demand on the conventional compressed oxygen supply systems making them less cost effective and unworkable in a production environment. The paper covers new liquid oxygen supply cylinders and novel bulk tank systems that reduce cylinder holdings while reducing gas wastage due to lack of pressure. With the increase in higher thermal energy systems, necessity to more closely control the temperature of sprayed the component has outstretched the demands on conventional compressed air cooling systems. In the past, the use of cryogenic cooling gases such as carbon dioxide has been restricted by increased cost. However it has been shown in a number of cases that often the hidden costs of running air compressors, including the use of moisture traps, and oil filters can be greater than using clean, high purity cryogenic liquid gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The paper outlines the details of such cooling systems. The commercial success of Cold Gas Dynamic spraying may in future rely on a cost efficient, high pressure and high volume gas delivery systems for either helium or nitrogen. The paper describes a novel high pressure supply system presently used in another application suitable for Cold Gas Dynamic spraying with nitrogen able to generate pressure in-excess of 30 bar and flow rates above 120m3/hr from a liquid vessel.</jats:p>",

Growth and nutrient uptake increased with N supply, and was consistently higher in loaded than conventional seedlings, demonstrating the advantage of nutrient loading practices to accelerate seedling growth across the range of soil N tested. Compared to the poor soil, new shoot biomass of loaded seedlings increased by 34 and 134% on the medium and rich soils, suggesting loaded seedlings may be more efficiently transplanted on more fertile sites. Net retranslocation of N, P, and K increased by 569, 185, and 102% by nutrient loading in the nursery, supporting the hypothesis of translocation driven by the magnitude of plant nutrient reserves. However, net N retranslocation diminished with time due to root system expansion that promoted uptake and reduced the need for N redistribution. Net retranslocation of N (the most limiting nutrient) declined with soil N supply, but that of P and K were relatively independent of soil fertility. Increased N availability in the soil enhanced N accumulation in the plants but lowered N retranslocation. We conclude that higher net retranslocation of N on poor soils is a phenotypic adjustment by <jats:italic>P. mariana</jats:italic> seedlings to maximize N use at low availability.</jats:p>",

The effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and soil N supply did not interact for any leaf traits measured. Elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consistently decreased stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) leading to 40% increase in <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p> This substantial acclimation of photosynthesis was greater in magnitude than in most field studies, and was associated with the combined effects of decreased <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> and decreased leaf N concentrations in response to growth under elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To investigate the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on cardiac energy metabolism, isolated cardiomyocytes of Wistar rats were incubated in an Oxystat system at a constant ambient Po<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(25 mmHg) and oxygen consumption (V˙o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>); free intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>(fura 2), free cytosolic adenosine [ S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) method], and mitochondrial NADH (autofluorescence) were measured after application of the NO donor morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1). In Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-free medium (contracting cardiomyocytes), V˙o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>increased from 7.9 ± 1.2 to 26.4 ± 3.1 nmol · min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>· mg protein<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. SIN-1 (100 μmol/l) decreased V˙o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>in contracting (−21 ± 3%) and in quiescent cells (−24 ± 7%) by the same extent. Inhibition ofV˙o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>was dose dependent (EC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>: 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup>mol/l). S-nitroso- N-acetyl-penicillamine, another NO donor, also inhibited V˙o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, whereas SIN-1C (100 μmol/l), the degradation product of SIN-1, displayed no inhibitory effect. Intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>remained unchanged, and inhibition of protein kinases G, A, or C did not antagonize the effect of NO. Mitochondrial NADH increased with NO, indicating a reduced flux through the respiratory chain. In quiescent but not in contracting cardiomyocytes, NO significantly increased adenosine, indicating a reduced energy status. These data suggest the following. 1) NO decreases cardiac respiration, most likely via direct inhibition of the respiratory chain. 2) Whereas in quiescent cardiomyocytes the inhibition of aerobic ATP formation by NO causes reduction in energy status, contracting cells are able to compensate for the NO-induced inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, maintaining energy status constant.</jats:p>",
