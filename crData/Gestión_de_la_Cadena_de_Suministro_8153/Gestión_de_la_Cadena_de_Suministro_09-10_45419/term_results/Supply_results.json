In order to meet future demands, water supply systems must be developed to maximize the use of locally available water. It is also important to minimize the impact of water system developments on the environment. In this study, the overall environmental impacts were compared for water importation, reclamation and seawater desalination to address the water scarcity in areas where local supplies are not sufficient. The city of Scottsdale, Arizona was chosen for this study. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed and it suggests that seawater desalination has the highest impact whereas reclamation shows a relatively lower impact. However, Importation and reclamation systems have comparable results for several damage categories. The impacts of facility operations are significantly higher than the construction phase even when the life-span of infrastructure reduces from 50 year to 10 year. Due to the high impacts associated with the energy use during plant operations, different energy mixes were analyzed for their capabilities to lower the environmental burden.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In many multi-stage manufacturing supply chains, transportation related costs are a significant portion of final product costs. It is often crucial for successful decision making approaches in multi-stage manufacturing supply chains to explicitly account for non-linear transportation costs. In this article, we have explored this problem by considering a Two-Stage Production-Transportation (TSPT). A two-stage supply chain that faces a deterministic stream of external demands for a single product is considered. A finite supply of raw materials, and finite production at stage one has been assumed. Items are manufactured at stage one and transported to stage two, where the storage capacity of the warehouses is limited. Packaging is completed at stage two (that is, value is added to each item, but no new items are created), and the finished goods inventories are stored which is used to meet the final demand of customers. During each period, the optimized production levels in stage one, as well as transportation levels between stage one and stage two and routing structure from the production plant to warehouses and then to customers, must be determined. The authors consider “different cost structures,” for both manufacturing and transportation. This TSPT model with capacity constraint at both stages is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the results obtained are compared with the results of other optimization techniques of complete enumeration, LINDO, and CPLEX.</p>",

The authors consider such a channel relationship that the transaction quantity between the two members is sensitive to the supplier’s inventory level and that the supplier’s unit inventory holding cost has a linear stepwise structure. They devise a coordinated revenue-sharing contract with bargaining so that each party’s respective profit is better than that resulted from the simple sequential optimization mechanism. The key contract parameters, namely the supplier’s inventory level and the retailer’s revenue-sharing fraction, are obtained and analyzed. Numerical illustrations of the contracts are given and shed lights on how the supply chain should coordinate in order to gain better performance.</p>",

An immediate increase in the money supply may work well in response to a negative aggregate demand shock, but be counter‐productive in response to a negative supply shock. This paper finds that output will decrease when the Federal Reserve increases the money supply in response to an adverse supply shock.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The implication is that when the Federal Reserve first spots a negative supply shock (such as an increase in oil prices), it should not immediately respond with an increase in the money supply. Doing so might cause a recession.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>When there is a negative supply shock, conventional wisdom holds that an increase in money supply can offset the decrease in output that would occur without a policy response.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Résumé Cet article souhaite contribuer à la compréhension de la dynamique sociale caractérisant les relations inter-entreprises, plus particulièrement dans le contexte de la supply chain ou chaîne logistique. Relativement peu de travaux existent sur le pouvoir et le leadership dans la supply chain , peut-être du fait de la jeunesse du paradigme. Cependant, le management de la chaîne ne se limite pas à la mise en œuvre de systèmes d’information, mais relève à la fois d’un projet organisationnel et humain et d’une dynamique politique. A côté du pouvoir et de ses sources, attribués aux différents acteurs de la chaîne, émerge la notion de leadership fondée sur la centralité de l’acteur dominant. Dans ce cadre, le leadership peut apparaître participatif ou directif selon le contexte, industriel en amont ou commercial en aval. Les exemples des entreprises MW et LR nous permettent d’illustrer ces deux modes relationnels et de répondre en partie à la question du rôle du leader et de la nature de son leadership dans la chaîne.(1) (1) Laboratoire d’Économie Dyonisien</jats:p>",

Today, customers on five continents produce 2000 and 7000 series aluminum billets using this technology in sizes ranging from 75mm through to 1080mm in diameter. In order to produce such a range of sizes in hard to cast alloys and to aerospace standards, Almex has imparted complete casthouse process understanding and know-how, along with equipment supply to its customers. This paper provides an overview of Almex’s hard alloy casthouse technology and describes some of the critical parameters which must be controlled throughout the process route in order to produce defect free alloys for forging, extrusion and flat rolled applications. Explanation is also made of the microstructural requirements of the as cast product and how these influence the final product; along with the range of quality control solutions supplied by Almex to ensure these requirements are met on a continuous and repeatable basis by Almex’s technology users.</jats:p>"

Domestic radon removal units based on aeration have been commercially available for more than ten years. In order to determine how effectively these units remove radon a new test protocol applying frequent sampling while letting 100 litres of water flow, was developed. This way, removal efficiencies can be more accurately calculated and possible malfunctions detected. Seven models of domestic aerators designed for removing radon from household water were tested. The aerators were based on diffused bubble aeration, spray aeration or jet aeration. The average removal efficiencies for 100 litres with a medium flow rate were 86–100% except for a unit that circulated the aerated water back to the well that had removal efficiency of 80% at the maximum. By conducting a questionnaire study usual problems related to the aeration units were localized and recommendations on maintenance and installation are given accordingly.</jats:p>",

We present a practical model for managing inventory in a supply chain facing stochastic, nonstationary demand. Our model is based on the guaranteed service modeling framework. We first describe how inventory levels should adapt to changes in demand at a single stage. We then show how nonstationary demand propagates in a supply chain, allowing us to link stages and apply a multiechelon optimization algorithm designed originally for stationary demand. We describe two successful applications of this model. The first is a tactical implementation to support monthly safety stock planning at Microsoft. The second is a strategic project to evaluate the benefits of using an inventory pool at Case New Holland. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A vertically integrated channel would prefer to coordinate the pricing of its products. In this paper, we investigate drivers of product line pricing decisions in a bilateral monopoly where a manufacturer produces and sells two substitutable or complementary products to a retailer. In a two-stage game, each firm commits credibly in the first stage to a pricing scheme within its own organization: product line pricing (PLP) or nonproduct line pricing (NPLP). In the second stage, depending on the relative balance of power in the supply chain, the firms engage in either a Nash or a leader-follower pricing game. We study the equilibrium of the two-stage game under a general symmetric demand function. With strategic interaction between firms, a firm may choose NPLP as the equilibrium pricing strategy. In particular, when the second stage is a leader-follower game, the price leader chooses PLP, and the follower may choose NPLP only if the inefficiency of using NPLP empowers the follower by increasing the demand sensitivity to the leader's margin. When the second stage is a vertical Nash game, whether NPLP occurs in equilibrium depends on the nature of coupling between demand interdependence and vertical strategic dependence: NPLP can be an equilibrium only if products are demand substitutes (complements) and vertical strategic dependencies are complementary (substitutable). We find that prisoner's dilemma exists in the first stage for both types of second-stage pricing games. In those cases, one firm may have the incentive to commit to a pricing scheme in the first stage prior to its channel partner and steer the supply chain away from prisoner's dilemma. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a multiattribute competition model for procurement of short life-cycle products. In such an environment, the buyer installs dedicated production capacity at the suppliers before demand is realized. Final production orders are decided after demand materializes. Of course, the buyer is reluctant to bear all the capacity and inventory risk, and thus signs flexible contracts with several suppliers. We model the suppliers' offers as option contracts, where each supplier charges a reservation price per unit of capacity and an execution price per unit of delivered supply. These two parameters illustrate the trade-off between total price and flexibility of a contract, which are both important to the buyer. We model the interaction between suppliers and the buyer as a game in which the suppliers are the leaders and the buyer is the follower. Specifically, suppliers compete to provide supply capacity to the buyer, and the buyer optimizes its expected profit by selecting one or more suppliers. We characterize the suppliers' equilibria in pure strategies for a class of customer demand distributions. In particular, we show that this type of interaction gives rise to cluster competition. That is, in equilibrium suppliers tend to be clustered in small groups of two or three suppliers each, such that within the same group all suppliers use similar technologies and offer the same type of contract. Finally, we show that in equilibrium, supply chain inefficiencies—i.e., the loss of profit due to competition—are at most 25% of the profit of a centralized supply chain. </jats:p>",

The analysis on hexavalent chromium removal was carried out by varying experimental parameters such as pH, dosage and contact time. The study reveals that sawdust works best at pH 3 while eucalyptus shows better results at pH 2. Moreover, the optimum dosages determined for the absorbents were in compliance with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms.

There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. </jats:p><jats:p> Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e.g., using 100% money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e.g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings. </jats:p>",

Results from the base specification suggest that over the observation period, hours wage elasticities decreased by 82%, participation wage elasticities by 36%, and participation income elasticities by 57%. These results imply that changes in tax policy had a much larger effect on the labor supply and labor force participation behavior of women in this subpopulation in the early 1980s than in recent years. </jats:p>",

This research involves the characterization, through sample fractionation processes and experimental chlorination tests, of the reactivity of DBP precursors occurring within a WDS. The study is based on samples collected in various locations of a WDS during a complete year. For each sample, six fractions were generated to determine their potential for formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Fractionation processes on ROM demonstrated that the spatial behavior of precursors for THMs differs from that for precursors of HAAs. In addition, experimental chlorination tests showed that the reactivity of the investigated fractions, in terms of DBP formation potential (DBPfp), was different from each other according to location in the WDS. DBPfp for the studied fractions changed drastically during water treatment. However, changes of DBPfp for fractions were relatively low between the beginning and the extremity of the distribution system. Since the results of this research confirm that the ability to produce DBPs is related to the nature of the fractions, they could be useful to evaluate the impact of re-chlorination on DBP formation in a WDS.</jats:p>",

In this hybrid process, an ion exchange step converts monovalent chloride ions of saline water to divalent sulfate ions and the resulting solution, having a reduced osmotic pressure than the feed, is desalinated using a nanofiltration (NF) membrane. The sulfate rich reject stream from the NF process is used to regenerate the anion exchanger. Results validate that NF membranes can desalinate sodium sulfate solution at a much lower transmembrane pressure compared to RO membranes as well as yield a higher permeate flux. The sulfate-chloride selectivity of the anion exchangers plays important role in sustainability of the process. Laboratory studies have revealed that a single type of anion exchanger cannot sustain the process for saline water with different salt concentrations. However, anion exchangers with different sizes of amine functional groups (e.g. quaternary-, tertiary-, secondary- and primary amine) hold the promise that the process can be tailored to achieve sustainability. Laboratory studies have validated the basic premise of the hybrid process including greater than two times less energy requirement than RO process for the same feed water and same permeate recovery condition.</jats:p>",

Due to a lack of data the goal of this study was to generate more information on the growth promoting properties of pipe materials of different origin using the BPP test. The pipe materials under study showed different capacity to enhance bacterial growth and their BPP values could be ranked: Cu &amp;lt; SS &amp;lt; PP &amp;lt; PEx &amp;lt; PE &amp;lt; PVCp. A positive correlation between the planktonic biomass (PB) and the BPP was observed.

In practice, human beings have been found to be both surprisingly successful and disappointingly inept at managing supply chains. The related fields of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence have postulated a variety of potential mechanisms to explain this behavior. One of the leading candidates is reinforcement learning. This paper applies agent-based modeling to investigate the comparative behavioral consequences of three simple reinforcement learning algorithms in a multi-stage supply chain. For the first time, our findings show that the specific algorithm that is employed can have dramatic effects on the results obtained. Reinforcement learning is found to be valuable in multi-stage supply chains with several learning agents, as independent agents can learn to coordinate their behavior. However, learning in multi-stage supply chains using these postulated approaches from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence take extremely long time periods to achieve stability which raises questions about their ability to explain behavior in real supply chains. The fact that it takes thousands of periods for agents to learn in this simple multi-agent setting provides new evidence that real world decision makers are unlikely to be using strict reinforcement learning in practice. </jats:p>",

The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro‐economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with “inoperability” and “economic losses” metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the one hand, there are oversocialized accounts that claim that rules, social background factors, and supply-side factors shape observed career patterns. On the other hand, there are undersocialized accounts that claim that the decisions of strategic agents and demand-side dynamics shape course-taking careers. In this article, the authors use simulations to illustrate how these theoretical mechanisms can generate course-taking patterns. Grounding the simulations in empirical data on the mathematics course taking of students in two high schools, they assess the relative merits of these competing theories by testing how closely observed and predicted career patterns align. The results reveal that the characteristics of students and the organizational rules and requirements of course-taking career systems render certain allocation mechanisms more salient than others. In particular, highly competitive and structurally constrained systems are shaped by supply dynamics, while less regulated systems of diverse populations are shaped by agent-based decision making. </jats:p>",

More than 70% of the experiments could thus be modelled satisfactorily (predictions statistically classified as “good” or “very good”), having used only 26% of the experiments in calibrating the model. Results obtained for experiments performed at low NOM concentration are more contrasted, however the model is able to account for most changes in sub listed experimental parameters.</jats:p>",

Hence, we can use existing algorithms to find the optimal safety stocks. We use a case study with real data to demonstrate that there are significant benefits from the inclusion of the forecast process when determining the optimal safety stocks.

This paper aims to understand Pakistan's current and proposed water supply and sanitation institutions in the light of historical and ongoing practices and perceptions of relevant actors. The relevant institutions of the government, their service provision and policy formulation and implementation processes were examined and compared with the field data. An actor-oriented approach, open-ended interviews, group discussions with relevant actors and participant observation were used for data collection. Wide gaps were found between local people's needs, desires and expectations and government policies and services, between people's practices and historical and proposed institutions, and between local people's and policy-makers' understanding of the issues. The study warrants the formulation of realistic and people-centred water supply and sanitation institutions and engaging local actors in the processes. Along with regulatory mechanisms, the findings argue for the use of cognitive and normative instruments in the implementation of policies while tailor-making solutions to local culture, working together with local actors, rather than imposing solutions on them.</jats:p>",

To ensure success, the process had to fit within the existing planning processes. In practice, this meant that setting service-level and inventory targets, which had previously been external inputs to the process, had to become part of the structured decision-making process. Although other Intel business units had achieved success implementing a multiechelon inventory optimization model, the boxed processor environment posed some unique challenges. The primary technical challenge required correcting for the impact of forecast bias, nonnormal forecast errors, and heterogeneous forecast errors. This paper documents the procedure and algorithms that Intel developed and implemented in 2008 to counter the impact of forecast imperfections. The process resulted in safety stock reductions of approximately 15 percent. At any given time, Intel applies this process to its 20–30 highest-volume boxed processors, determining an on-hand inventory commitment between $50 million and $75 million.</jats:p>",

We examine the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth, price and income elasticities of demand, and the barriers to adoption of energy-efficient equipment. We also examine the performance outcomes of economic policies affecting the electricity sector, including institutional reforms such as privatization and regulation. We find that electricity demand is driven by GDP, prices, income, the level and characteristics of economic activity/urbanization, and seasonal factors. The magnitude of their effects differs across countries, time periods, and studies even for the same country. These demand studies suffer from a number of limitations, including data availability and price distortions that limit responsiveness of demand to price signals. The literature is inconclusive on whether reforms, particularly privatization, improved supply efficiency. Effective regulation, competitive markets, and appropriate sequencing of reforms are important factors that influence the outcomes of privatization. There is a need for more quantitative analysis of the social welfare and distributional impacts of privatization of the electricity sector in developing countries.</jats:p>",

The two models are implemented on the Hanoi water distribution system, one of the more explored systems in the research literature, through base runs and sensitivity analysis. The single-objective model produced the best known least cost solution for split pipe design, while the multi-objective model has shown robustness and well explanatory outcomes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This review considers the role of nearshore processes and morphological change as a flexible and dynamic constraint on the supply and transport of sediment between beach and dune. It is argued that the lack of information in this regard remains a central barrier to the development of a theory of beach-dune interaction that can be translated across scales and between field sites. Existing beach-dune models do not consider how and when sediment gets transferred to the backshore where it becomes available for transport by wind. Rather, existing models largely ascribe regional variations in dune morphology to fixed constraints on beach slope and sediment budget, without explicit recognition of processes involved. Recent (process-scale) transport studies have shown that the transfer of sediment is both spatially variable and temporally intermittent as a result of transport limitations across the beachface. While these studies have identified varied controls on sediment transport and exchange, there remains a limited capacity to predict the evolution of beach-dune systems, largely because the beachface tends to be viewed as a static transport surface without regard to supply or to the changing limits to transport. Following storm erosion, dune recovery first requires that the beach recovers through the onshore migration and welding of nearshore bars, followed by accretion in the backshore to create a supply of sediment for transport by the wind. The dependence of dune recovery on the synchronization of transport events with the recovery of sediment supply in the backshore creates a strong asymmetry in dune recovery that makes barrier island susceptible to widespread erosion and breaching if a change in the frequency or grouping of storm events is capable of resetting the bar system (offshore) before the next extreme storm. </jats:p>",

Then why is the supply of health care in the United States so insensitive to steeply rising prices? This paper conducts an econometric study to show that high health‐care costs have an adverse impact on labor productivity, causing a negative production externality in all industries. So, can the rising cost of health‐care affect the U.S. comparative advantage? The paper seeks answers to these questions in a general equilibrium model and finds that the labor productivity shock is responsible for the sluggish or declining supply of health care. Consumers are able to afford less health care due to a possible decline in real wages. U.S. comparative advantage becomes a nonissue, provided that the equilibrium is stable in spite of a negatively sloped health‐care supply curve. Negative externality, leading to market failure, may be addressed in two alternative ways</jats:italic>. (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> F11, I11, I12, I18)</jats:p>",

This can be achieved by optimising the removal of those fractions of interest during treatment; however, this requires a better understanding of the physical and chemical properties of these NOM components. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and liquid chromatography with online organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) were used to characterize NOM in water samples from one of the two water treatment plants serving Amsterdam, The Netherlands. No disinfectant residual is applied in the distribution system. Fluorescence EEM and LC-OCD were used to track NOM fractions. Whereas fluorescence EEM shows the reduction of humic-like as well as protein-like fluorescence signatures, LC-OCD was able to quantify the changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of five NOM fractions: humic substances, building blocks (hydrolysates of humics), biopolymers, low molecular weight acids and neutrals.</jats:p>",

The American Society for Clinical Pathology reported in March 2009 that laboratories across the United States were struggling to fill MT and medical laboratory technician (MLT) positions. A survey of “positions available” advertisements from several months of the ABC Newsletter revealed that 35% were for MTs compared with 22% for physicians and 43% for all other positions. While not a scientific study, on the surface, this would indicate that blood centers are not immune from the struggle to fill positions within their laboratories.

In this study, the potential membrane-fouling materials presented in the raw water were mainly attributed to particulate matters and UV254-absorbing materials. Coagulation pre-treatment mitigated the effects of these components on membrane fouling because it induced a change in the characteristics of the cake layer and a decrease in the content of UV254-absorbing materials. Even though the coagulated suspensions were not removed before MF membrane filtration, their impact on resistance to filtration was insignificant when compared with that caused by the suspensions without pre-coagulation. However, insufficient dosages of coagulant or the improper controls of coagulation pH might cause severe membrane fouling in the treatment of low turbidity water (i.e. turbidity below 10 NTU). It appeared that a selection of coagulant dosage that focused on the reduction of specific cake resistance was possibly the best way to achieve the optimal condition in this study. Also, the coagulation pre-treatment process at pH values between 5.3 and 6.8 was found to be most effective in providing the lowest specific cake resistance as well as residual UV254 absorbance.</jats:p>",

Field study and bench scale experiment on iron release from corrosion scale were carried out. In old cast iron pipe, higher iron release occurred with lower chlorine residual concentration, while lower iron release occurred with higher chlorine residual concentration. The reason lay in the structure of scale and the electro-chemical reactions occurring on the scale and in the bulk. The passivated-out-layer of scale was formed by ferric oxide. It could be broken down by reductive reaction in an atmosphere of low chlorine residual concentration. In contrast, the situation was quite different with new cast iron pipe, the age of which was only half a year. Iron release was considered as the product of the iron matrix and chlorine since the passivated-out-layer of scale had not formed yet. This iron release was consistent with chlorine residual concentration. It is suggested that maintaining a high chlorine residual concentration in a drinking water distribution system is beneficial to controlling both microorganism' regrowth and iron release.</jats:p>",

However, this problem arises in a variety of industries including the sales of fashion garments, flight seats and hotel rooms. In this article, we deal with an inventory system in which sales cycle is divided into an advance sales period and a spot sales period. We consider order cancellation effect which depends on the waiting time of the customer orders. The goal is to determine the optimal order quantity and optimal prices in order to maximize the profit. We also show the concavity of the profit function using mathematical lemmas and theorem. Besides we develop a solution procedure which computes optimal policy effectively. Finally we present the results of numerical study for linear and exponential demand functions.</p>",

With the introduction of neoliberal reform policies, Indian cities have also begun experiencing the effects of telescoped environmental burdens. A compelling theoretical perspective in this tradition suggests that large Indian cities now display a “degenerated peripheralization” whereby the experience of environmental burdens is becoming increasingly uneven between the urban core and its peripheries as a result of policy neglect. However, reliance on this theory overlooks how place-specific historical, social, and technical processes in the urban context often support a dynamic of active appropriation of resources from the periphery and core. Drawing on the histories of urban politicalization and the institutionalization of water supply infrastructure, this article will contextualize the process of peripheralization in the Indian metropolitan city of Chennai as an appropriative and exploitative one rather than a degenerated one. </jats:p>",

According to nowadays plant production principles it is important to investigate and optimize the site-specific nutrient-supply and other production factors, such as hybrid and irrigation, in the case of this plant as well.At the Research Institute of the University of Debrecen, Center of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, at Látókép the effect of nutrient-supply and irrigation on the quantity and quality parameters of different hybrids were investigated in a small plot long-term field experiment. In this paper we introduce the results regarding the corn moisture-content and the starch content of the yield.We have chosen three maize hybrids – that have been bread in Martonvásár – for our investigations. The effect of macronutrients is investigated in this experiment on five levels. The half of the experimental area can be irrigated during the vegetation period – whenever it is needed – by linear irrigation equipment, but on the other half only the water amount originating from the precipitation can be used by plants.In the year 2008 the hybrid affected the grain moisture content at P=0.1% level, while nutrient-supply had an effect at P=10% significance level. We haven’t revealed either any effect of irrigation or of interrelationship between production factors. It can be stated that there are differences between the hybrids on each nutrient-supply and on both irrigation levels. The grain moisture content increased parallel to the longer vegetationperiods.The starch content of maize is mostly affected by the hybrid,so on P=0.1% significance level. Regarding our results, it can bestated, that the starch content shows a decreasing tendencyparallel to the longer vegetation periods.</jats:p>"

The model has three components: (1) definition of individual exposure over time and the outcomes of exposure, (2) definition of the geographical dispersal of exposures, and (3) response of the public health authorities to symptomatic individuals. The model explicitly considers the variation in the multiple interrelated facets of the response system, including differences among individuals' responses to exposure, variation between health care providers, and the subsequent processing of samples and confirmation of cases. To illustrate use of the model, case studies with <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> O157:H7 and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. in three categories of food vehicle were compared. The level of detail required to run the public health component of the model is not trivial. While some data may not be available for hazards of particular interest in potential bioterrorism events, the application of expert judgment permits comparisons between different agents, different system reactions, and other assumptions within the system. The model provides the capacity to study the impact of system changes, to compare scenarios and to quantify the benefits of improvement in terms of averted exposures and risk reduction, and constitutes a significant aid to understanding and managing these threats. Essentially, the model provides an explicit valuation of time saved in the identification and intervention in terrorist events in the food supply.</jats:p>",

Principal component analysis and cluster analysis of 51 WaSCs business function characteristics was employed to derive groups of similar WaSCs. Results indicate that there is difference in how WaSCs approach raw water quality issues. It appears that small WaSCs with relatively large agricultural areas in their supply catchments are more likely to seek managerial solutions to raw water quality problems.</jats:p>",

A vital component of these health programmes is the drug supply system. Based on a field research conducted in Pakistan 2007 and a field work experience in Afghanistan within an international NGO—Merlin—this paper analysed the four functions of the Drug Supply Cycle (Selection, Procurement, Distribution and Use) focusing attention on the importance in management support systems once the emergency phase is over. It shows the core role that the pharmacist plays within NGOs as a member of the health staff with the ability to improve the management of the Drug Supply Cycle.

In the present study, we tested the effect of pyruvate, lactate and insulin (all in the presence of glucose) and glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) on the ATP-producing and -consuming blocks in perfused rat heart, in a system where HR (heart rate) was allowed to vary (no pacing). Changes in RPP (rate-pressure product) and PCr (phosphocreatine) concentration were measured. PAA (Proportional Activation Approach) was used to visualize and quantitatively analyse the data. It was demonstrated that addition of glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) exerted essentially no effect on the system. Insulin (in the presence of glucose) activated only the ATP producer. The most interesting finding is that, in our system, pyruvate and lactate (added in the presence or instead of glucose) activated ATP producer, but significantly inhibited ATP consumer (their effect was quantitatively identical).</jats:p>",

Primary symptoms occurred on the youngest tissue for both elements, but distinct differences between Ca and B deficiencies were observed. Plants responding to Ca deficiency exhibited discoloration and upward rolling of leaves and ultimately necrosis. Plants responding to B deficiency exhibited minor chlorosis, upward curling, and thickening of leaves, distorted meristems, and strap-like leaves. A second experiment investigated how a temporary disruption of Ca or B affects the plant throughout the crop cycle. Either Ca or B was removed from the nutrient solution for a 7-day period from Day 15 to Day 21, Day 22 to Day 28, or Day 29 to Day 35 after sowing. After the 7-day disruption, the respective element was reintroduced to the plants. Regardless of when the plants were deprived of Ca or B, the symptoms of the respective deficiency were present at the end of the experiment. These studies have shown that a temporary disruption of either Ca or B can cause lasting symptoms throughout the plug production cycle. Also, the symptoms that have been observed in plug production were most similar to those symptoms caused by B deficiency, not Ca deficiency.</jats:p>",

We extend the framework to allow for endogenous supply‐side changes and show that this fundamentally alters the mechanism of the adjustment process. Allowing for such an extension attenuates quite significantly the implied exchange rate adjustment. The paper also provides some empirical evidence of variations in the supply‐side structure and correlations with the exchange rate and the current account. The policy implications are that measures to foster a supply‐side reaction would facilitate the external adjustment by alleviating an exclusive reliance on demand and exchange rate changes, with the latter being potentially destabilizing for the global financial system.</jats:p>",

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace. </jats:p>",

We estimated full‐time equivalent (FTE) EP demand at each ED by dividing the actual number of visits by the estimated average EP visit volume (3,548 visits/year) and then summing FTEs by state. Our model assumed that at least one EP should be present 24/7 in each ED. The number of EM board‐certified EPs per state was provided by the American Board of Medical Specialties (American Board of Emergency Medicine, American Board of Pediatrics) and the American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine. We used U.S. Census Bureau civilian population estimates to calculate EP population density by state.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> The supply of EM board‐certified EPs was 58% of required FTEs to staff all EDs nationally and ranged from 10% in South Dakota to 104% in Hawai’i (i.e., there were more EPs than the estimated need). Texas and Florida had the largest absolute shortages of EM board‐certified EPs (2,069 and 1,146, respectively). The number of EM board‐certified EPs per 100,000 U.S. civilian population ranged from 3.6 in South Dakota to 13.8 in Washington, DC. States with a higher population density of EM board‐certified EPs had higher percent high school graduates and a lower percent rural population and whites.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> The supply and demand of EM board‐certified EPs varies by state.

Data were collected from households, village water committees, focus groups of village residents, system operators and key informants in 400 rural communities in Peru, Bolivia and Ghana. Our findings suggest that the demand-driven, community management model, coupled with access to spare parts and some technical expertise, has come a long way toward unraveling the puzzle of how best to design and implement rural water supply programs in developing countries. In all three countries, rural water supply projects were working. Among the households included in our sample in Peru and Bolivia, 95% had operational taps at the time of our field visit. In 90% of the villages in Ghana, all project handpumps were still working. Not only had the rural water systems not broken down, but almost all the households in these communities were obtaining at least some of their water from the systems. However, some households were also still using water from other sources. In Ghana, 38% of households still reported using water from unprotected sources (e.g. springs, river, open wells) for drinking and/or cooking. Another troublesome finding is that rural households in the sample villages are paying very little for the improved water services and, as a result, the finances of many village water committees are in poor shape.</jats:p>",

Phosphorylation by AMPK impairs the interaction of TIF-IA with the TBP-containing promoter selectivity factor SL1, thereby precluding the assembly of functional transcription initiation complexes. Mutation of Ser-635 compromises down-regulation of Pol I transcription in response to low energy supply, supporting that activation of AMPK adapts rRNA synthesis to nutrient availability and the cellular energy status.</jats:p>",

In <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> carotenoid biosynthesis is strongly upregulated when seedlings that germinate in the dark (etiolated) emerge from the soil and light derepresses photomorphogenesis, causing etioplasts to become chloroplasts. We found that carotenoid biosynthesis is also induced when deetiolation is derepressed in the absence of actual light, eventually resulting in improved greening (chlorophyll accumulation) upon illumination. The increased production of carotenoids in the dark correlates with an upregulated activity of phytoene synthase (PSY; the first committed enzyme of carotenogenesis) and the induction of <jats:italic>PSY</jats:italic> gene expression in cotyledons (where carotenoids accumulate in dark‐grown seedlings). The metabolic precursors for carotenoid synthesis under these conditions are mostly supplied by the plastidial methylerythritol 4‐phosphate (MEP) pathway. Accumulation of flux‐controlling MEP pathway enzymes, such as deoxyxylulose 5‐phosphate synthase (DXS), is post‐transcriptionally increased when deetiolation is derepressed in the dark. Unlike the situation observed in light‐grown plants, however, the sole overexpression of DXS in dark‐grown seedlings does not increase carotenoid accumulation. By contrast, induced expression of a PSY‐encoding transgene results in increased carotenoid levels and a concomitant post‐transcriptional accumulation of DXS. These data provide evidence for a feedback mechanism by which PSY controls metabolic flux to the carotenoid pathway in plants.</jats:p>",
