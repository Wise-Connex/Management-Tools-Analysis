      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capacity of the maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) ear to accept greater assimilate supplies is an important parameter in some strategies to increase grain yield. This problem was studied by increasing assimilate supply at several growth stages and determining the effects on grain yield, yield components and partitioning ratios. During a 2‐year period, a single‐eared hybrid was grown at a control density of 64,500 plants/ha and was thinned to 43,000 and 21,500 plants/ha at growth stages ranging from soon after emergence to 3 weeks after silk emergence. In a second experiment, light reflectors were placed between rows of three different hybrids for 2‐week intervals ranging from about 3 weeks before to about 6 weeks after silk emergence. Both thinning and reflector treatments were designed to increase assimilate supply to the ear.</jats:p><jats:p>In thinning experiments, control densities yielded about 10,700 kg/ha during 1978 and 1979. Thinning at 2.5 weeks before silking increased yield per plant up to 41% while thinning at 3 weeks after silking caused an 11% increase. Increased kernel number and weight/kernel accounted for the yield increase, and the relative contribution of each shifted from one year to the next even though yields were similar both years. Ear number, kernel row number and duration of grain fill were unaffected by increased assimilate supply. Yield increases obtained by thinning to the intermediate density occurred with little change in partitioning ratio of dry weight and N. Thinning to the lowest density caused a decline in the partitioning ratios. Reflector experiments in spite of some heat stress demonstrated that increased assimilate supply for short, discrete periods could cause similar results. We conclude that under our U.S. Corn Belt conditions, increasing assimilate supply can result in a grain yield increase per plant and can do this without altering the length of grain‐filling or the partitioning ratios.</jats:p>",

Values were obtained by adding standardized O2-containing solutions to anaerobic cell suspensions and observing absorbance changes at wavelength pairs specific for cytochromes a + a3, c + c1, and b561 + b566. Half-maximal oxidation, calculated relative to aerobic cells, occurred at 3.5, 6.2, and 4.9 microM O2, respectively. These values are similar to those for changes in cellular ATP/ADP, lactate/pyruvate, and NADH/NAD+ but are much higher than corresponding values for isolated mitochondria. Analysis of these data indicate that the diffusion coefficient in the region of mitochondria in situ is considerably smaller than the extracellular diffusion coefficient and suggests that a significant O2 gradient in the vicinity of mitochondria occurs under hypoxic conditions. These results suggest that the rate of O2 diffusion may be a critical factor for intracellular O2 supply to mitochondria during hypoxia. </jats:p>",

The blood supply to the entire visceral pleura came exclusively from the bronchial arteries. Lymph vessels formed an extensive plexus throughout the serous membrane of all lobes. Trunk lymphatics (&gt; 100 μm diameter) had a density of about 2/cm of pleural length on all lobar surfaces except for the cranial and middle lobes, where their density on the costal surfaces was ≤ 1/cm. Pleural trunk lymphatics coursed to the pulmonary ligaments and to the hilum on their way to regional lymph nodes. At the hilum they anastomose with intrapulmonary lymphatic trunks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The specification of supply/demand relationships has received considerable attention in agricultural economics (Heien 1977). Economic theory has helped provide a basis for the specification of such relationships, one of its contributions being the proposition that prices should be interpreted only in relative terms. This has had a profound influence on model building in agricultural economics, leading a number of researchers to avoid the use of absolute prices in economic analysis. For this reason, numerous market models of the agricultural economy use price ratios as explanatory variables (e.g., Chen; Chen et al.; Heien, 1976; Gerra; Kulshreshtha and Wilson; Rahn; Talpaz; Morzuck et al.; Houck and Gallagher; Wilson et al.); these examples suggest that the use of such ratios is fairly widespread in econometric modeling of the crop and livestock sectors. One of the best examples of price ratios is the “feed cost to price” ratio commonly used in the analysis of livestock supply response. Indeed, since feed cost constitutes a major part of the total production cost in livestock activities, the “feed cost to price” ratio is often considered a proxy for profitability. For this reason, data on such ratios are regularly published for various livestock activities (e.g., USD A). Also, “feed cost to price” ratios are often employed in the specification of models of livestock supply response, (e.g., Chen; Chen et al.; Heien 1976; Gerra; Kulshreshtha and Wilson; Rahn; Talpaz). However, not all models of aggregate supply response follow this approach. For example, Freebairn and Rausser, and Arzac and Wilkinson, use prices as separate variables rather than in ratio forms in their models. In particular, they do not employ price ratios in their livestock and crop supply equations. The existence of these different approaches raises questions about the appropriateness of the use of price ratios in the modeling of aggregate supply.</jats:p>",

A total of six diets based on maize silage were formulated to examine the effect of protein- and non-protein-nitrogen, and energy supplementation on the flow of amino acids to the small intestine and the synthesis of microbial amino acids in the rumen of growing cattle. All diets contained 24 g totai nitrogen (N)/kg dry matter (DM), of which 550 g N/kg total N was supplied by either urea or fish meal. Four diets contained low levels of barley (estimated total dietary metabolizable energy content of 10·4 M J/kgDM) and urea-N and fish meal-N were supplied in the ratios 3:1, 1·4:1, 0·6:1 and 0·3:1.

Microbial-N synthesis was increased by the two intermediate levels of fish meal supplementation but declined at the highest level of inclusion. With increasing levels of fish meal inclusion, a greater proportion of the dietary protein was found to escape rumen degradation and the apparent degradabilities of fish meal and maize-silage protein of all four diets were estimated to be 0·22 and 0·73 respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>3. The substitution of barley for part of the maize silage enhanced duodenal supply of amino acids, irrespective of the form of the N supplement, and stimulated microbial amino acid synthesis. For all diets efficiency of microbial-N synthesis was found to vary between 22·5 and 46 g N/kg rumen-digested OM. Contrary to what was found for low-energy diets, the inclusion of fish meal tended to reduce the flow of dietary protein to the small intestine, but these differences were not statistically significant.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The results appertaining to microbial synthesis, dietary protein degradabilities and duodenal amino acid flow for all diets are discussed in relation to the Agricultural Research Council (1980) proposals for the protein requirements of ruminants, and the production responses observed when similar diets were fed to growing cattle.</jats:p>",

In brain, tryptophan fell by 46%, whereas 5‐HT rose by 20% between 8 and 40/42 days after birth. Thereafter, the levels of both tryptophan and 5‐HT remained essentially constant. Brain 5‐HIAA showed a more complex pattern, rising by 63% between 8 and 19 days, falling between 19 and 40/42 days, and then gradually rising until values at 16 months were significantly higher than those at 40/42 days. In plasma, the concentrations of free fatty acids, free and total tryptophan, and large neutral amino acids all decreased between 8 and 19 days and thereafter either remained constant or increased slowly, the exception being total tryptophan values, which showed large increases between 28/30 and 60/70 days. Also, the unidirectional uptake of tryptophan from blood to brain was determined using a carotid artery injection technique. Uptake values obtained using a tracer concentration of tryptophan in the injection solution decreased progressively with age.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effects of interrupted K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> supply on different parameters of growth and mineral cation nutrition were evaluated for spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L. cv. Svenno). K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (2.0 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) was supplied to the plants during different periods in an otherwise complete nutrient solution. Shoot growth was reduced before root growth after interruption in K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> supply. Root structure was greatly affected by the length of the period in K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ‐free nutrient solution. Root length was minimal, and root branching was maximal within a narrow range of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> status of the roots. This range corresponded to cultivation for the last 1 to 3 days, of 11 in total, in K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ‐free nutrient solution, or to continuous cultivation in solution containing 0.5 to 2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. In comparison, both higher and lower internal/external K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentrations had inhibitory effects on root branching. However, the differing root morphology probably had no significant influence on the magnitude of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>, Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake. Uptake of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and especially Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> significantly increased after K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> interruption, while Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake was constant in the roots and slowly increased in the shoots. The two divalent cations could replace K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the cells and maintain electroneutrality down to a certain minimal range of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentrations. This range was significantly higher in the shoot [110 to 140 μmol (g fresh weight)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>] than in the root [20 to 30 μmol (g fresh weight)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>]. It is suggested that the critical K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> values are a measure of the minimal amount of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> that must be present for physiological activity in the cells. At the critical levels, K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (<jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Rb) influx and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> concentrations were maximal. Below the critical K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> values, growth was reduced, and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> could no longer substitute for K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> for electrostatic balance. In a short‐term experiment, the ability of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> to compete with K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in maintaining electroneutrality in the cells was studied in wheat seedlings with different K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> status. The results indicate that K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, which was taken up actively and fastest at the external K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentration used (2.0 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>), partly determines the size of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> influx.</jats:p>",
