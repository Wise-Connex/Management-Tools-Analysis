First, it considers the hypothesis that a scarcity of consumer incentive goods so reduces the elasticity of supply to real prices that it becomes negative. Next, it analyses various effects of real price instability on supply, effects that vary according to the availability of consumer goods. Finally, it considers the indirect influence of stabilization schemes on supply, through their effect on the average level of producer prices. The various hypotheses are then tested for the case of coffee supply in Madagascar during the period 1965‐84.</jats:p>",

The Post Keynesian assumption that bank lending is demand determined, is not compatible with Keynes’endogenous monetary constraint centered upon the interest rate, and oversimplifies the relationships between banks and firms. On the other hand, a consistent modelling of the bank behaviour requires a sequence model which contrasts with the General Theory’s equilibrium method. Given the necessity to introduce money endogeneity, this paper leads to two conclusions : Post Keynesians miss the chance of restating Keynesian theory ; the equilibrium method should be dismissed.</jats:p>"

The conclusion is that,\nwhere supply chains are identified (even within vertically integrated\norganisations), then an approach based on effective management of each\nof the customer‐supplier relationships is key to success.

In 1988 it was estimated that about 2.883 million people in PWA's service areas or about 58.0 percent can be served by PWA's systems. If the number of population in service areas increases by 2.5% per year, PWA has to increase the number of connections at the rate of 12.62% per year for the remaining two years of the Decade in order to meet the 7 0% coverage target in 1990.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A budget of about 7,485 million baht (US $299 million) was allocated in FY 1980-89 for the expansion of water supply systems and services. It was estimated that the budget in 1990 should not be less than 1,950 million baht if the same target is to be accomplished. At any rate, there are still many constraints that could hamper the achievement, such as:–inadequate water resources, both in terms of quantity and quality due, to a great extent, to deforestation and pollution from factories and farming activities, etc.–inadequate manpower and equipment,–inadequate budget.–inadequate tariff, since the present tariff only covers operating expenditure but not future capital investments.</jats:p>",

In spite of small anastomoses between the right and left sublingual arteries, one half of the sublingual mucosa may also be considered as a segment. The same refers to the mucosa of one half of the hard palate. Even smaller units of varying extent of the palatine mucosa maybe differentiated as distinct vascular areas.

Ants are the principal scavengers of this type of remains, although the species that collect them vary according to the time of day and season of year, with the corpses’disappearance being the most rapid during the middle hours of the day, precisely when ants’density on the ground is less. The reason for this was the peak daytime abundance of insectivore, opportunisms ants. Anyway, the short time lapse that the prey stay in the field ‐ at any time of the day ‐ can be considered as an indirect estimate of the scarcity of these resources.</jats:p>",

The authors suggest that Keynes' apparatus of aggregate supply and demand decomposes correspondingly in two pairs of aggregate functions. They thus extend to the supply side a duality which had already been noticed on the demand side. Such an extension leads to a reconsideration of the debate between two conflicting views of the aggregate supply function which originated in Patinkin's contributions. The authors' argument emphasizes the role of aggregation over optimizing producers, and the status of intermediate goods and imperfect competition.</jats:p>"

Insufficient milk supply (IMS) is a major reason reported by mothers for early termination of breast‐feeding in both developed and developing countries. Using the IMS conceptual framework by Hill and Humenick (1989), a survey was conducted to determine which set of predictors distinguished between mothers who reported an inadequate supply of breast milk (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 100) from those who reported an adequate supply of milk (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 284) during the first 8 weeks postpartum. Factor analysis suggested that Potential Determinant factors Maternal Confidence, Paternal Support, Maternal Health, Mother‐in‐Law Disapproval, and Infant Birthweight accounted for 56.7% of the variance while Potential Indicator factors Baby Behavior, Solid Foods, and Formula accounted for 70.4% of the variance. Using discriminant analysis, factors Maternal Confidence, Maternal Health, Mother‐in‐Law Disapproval, Baby Behavior, Solid Foods, and Formula predicted 78.04% of the cases accurately. The Potential Indicator factors alone predicted 76.58% of the cases accurately. These findings suggest that the IMS model is valid but additional variables may need to be considered.</jats:p>",

In the context of an attack on the vulgar wage-fund theory, which was wielded in popular discourse to emphasize the futility of trade unions, Thornton offered a more general assault on what he labelled “demand and supply.” John Stuart Mill had expected Thornton's book to play an important role in furthering his own campaign in support of trade union legalization, but the book received mixed reviews. Most critics missed the opportunity to respond to Thornton's social commentary, and focused instead on his analysis of demand and supply. The negative reviews found the theory wanting and, to John Stuart Mill's chagrin, dismissed the entire book. But the positive reviews were even more devastating from Mill's perspective. Not only did they ignore the social analysis, with which Mill was in agreement, but they seemed convinced that Thornton had demolished the demand and supply theory. Since Mill was then trying to consolidate the intellectual basis of the Liberal party on the foundation of classical political economy, this was hardly an outcome he could accept. The recantation article, which combined a sympathetic treatment of Thornton's social analysis with a criticism of his economic analysis, was the inevitable result (see Forget 1992).</jats:p>"

The authors have proposed a fault detection method for the combinational circuit based on the supply current and indicated the feasibility of fault detection. However, the method proposed in the past is based only on the supply current waveform, and it is required to determine the feature vectors for all the measured supply currents. Consequently, to apply the method to the practical fault detection of logic circuits, the computational complexity as well as the computation time in determining the feature vector should be reduced.</jats:p><jats:p>From such a viewpoint, this paper proposes the following method of fault detection. Whether or not a fault exists is determined first by the average, the maximum and the minimum of the supply current. Only for the supply current waveform, which cannot be decided as the nonfaulty circuit, is the feature vector employed to make a further decision using the pattern recognition technique. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated experimentally for the TTL logic circuit. Also, an algorithm is presented which can determine, from the set of faults, the fault for the reference pattern of the supply current.</jats:p>",

While dry matter production was not affected by K supply or rootstock, greater K supply increased K contents in the various plant parts by 25-32%. Vines grafted on Freedom had the highest K content in the scion parts, and those grafted on 1103 Paulsen had the lowest. Potassium and magnesium (Mg) accumulation, expressed as the relative contribution to total cations, clearly distinguished between V. champinii (Ramsey and Freedom) and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris (1103 Paulsen and 140 Ruggeri), with higher K and lower Mg accumulation in vines grafted on V. champinii rootstocks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. The experiments reported here support the view that some spindles in the peroneus tertius muscle of the anaesthetized cat lack a nuclear bag1 intrafusal fibre. 2. The bag1 fibre is characterized by the fact that it is innervated exclusively by dynamic fusimotor axons. A method was devised to test each spindle in peroneus tertius for a dynamic fusimotor innervation. The ventral roots containing the muscle's motor supply were subdivided into five portions, approximately equal in terms of the tension they generated, and each piece was stimulated in turn, repetitively, at fusimotor strength, during ramp stretch of the muscle, to look for a large increase in dynamic response. 3. The method allowed confirmation that the majority of spindles in peroneus tertius had a dynamic fusimotor innervation. However, where the dynamic effect was weak and accompanied by a strong static fusimotor action and extrafusal unloading, it risked being overlooked. 4. The confirmatory test for the presence of a bag1 fibre was whether or not the spindle showed a large increase in dynamic response in the presence of the drug succinyl choline (SCh) injected arterially close to the muscle in which the spindle is located. SCh is known to induce a contracture in the bag1 fibre and therefore mimics tonic dynamic fusimotor stimulation. 5. In five experiments, of a total of forty‐two spindles with afferents conducting within the group I range, five examples were encountered where there was no increase in dynamic response, either with ventral root stimulation or perfusion with SCh. It was concluded that these were spindles which lacked a bag1 fibre. 6. Passive stretch of such spindles revealed no feature in the response which allowed them to be distinguished from spindles in which the bag1 fibre was present. This conclusion posed the question, what contribution, if any, does the bag1 fibre make to the stretch response? 7. It was possible to show that under some conditions the bag1 fibre did contribute to the response to stretch. If the spindle was conditioned by repetitive nerve stimulation, at fusimotor strength, at a length longer than that at which a test stretch was applied, the response to the stretch was delayed, and it began at a lower rate than after conditioning stimulation at the test length. The delayed response was attributed to the presence of slack in intrafusal fibres.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</jats:p>",

It is observed that the TAT-PB, a chief vascular pedicle, anastomoses freely with other arteries and supplies most parts of the muscle.

We manipulated adult pigeons' food supply and measured the effect of food availability and hatching order on the frequency and allocation of parental feeding, squab growth, and parental weight loss. Food availability did not affect any of the dependent variables during the first week, when squabs are fed crop milk. Throughout the remainder of the nestling period, when squabs are fed foraged grain, parents in the food‐poor condition delivered fewer regurgitations and lost more weight, and then squabs gained less weight. Within broods, neither the allocation of parental feedings nor squab growth was differential, even in the food‐poor environment. Apparently, production of crop milk is buffered from the parents' food supply, thus allowing both squabs to grow rapidly during the first few post‐hatch days. The result is nondifferential feeding and growth within broods and delayed effects of food availability on the overall frequency of parental feeding, parental weight loss, and squab growth.</jats:p>",

Daily rates of water turnover were generally higher for males than females, and for bats receiving ad libitum food than for those receiving a controlled food supply throughout winter, indicating that food availability affects torpor in N. geoffroyi.  Pre-winter fat deposition was more efficient under conditions of a temperature-determined food supply, where activity, weight and fat-level fluctuations of captive N. geoffroyi closely resembled those known for free-ranging temperate-zone microchiropterans.</jats:p>"

In Experiment 1 wurde der Verlauf der Fe‐Retention während des Wachstums bei bedarfsgerechter Fe‐Versorgung (40 ppm) unter Anwendung der vergleichenden Schlachtkörpertechnik ermittelt. Dazu wurden an Tag 0, 6, 10, 14, 18 und 22 jeweils Gruppen von fünf Tieren seziert. In Experiment 2 wurde über 20 Tage an insgesamt 30 Ratten ein Diät mit 3,6 ppm Fe verfüttert, wobei diese Diät entweder nicht oder mit 40 bzw. 400 ppm Fe ergänzt war. Die Hälfte der Tiere erhielt zusätzlich zu Beginn des Versuchs eine intravenöse Dosis von 2,72 mg Fe. Als einzige Eisenverbindung für die verschiedenen Behandlungen wurde Fe(III)‐hydroxid‐Polymaltose verwendet.</jats:p><jats:p>In beiden Versuchen waren Diäten mit 40 ppm Fe für maximales Wachstum und physiologische Werte bei den hämatologischen Parametern ausreichend, ohne daß vermehrt Eisen in Speicherorganen eingelagert wurde. Im ersten Versuch wurden täglich ungefähr 150 μg Fe retiniert. Der Fe‐Bestand der Ratten erhöhte sich von 2,9 mg bei 67 g Lebendmasse auf 6,0 mg bei 174 g Lebendmasse. Ohne jegliche Fe‐Zulage während der 20 Tage von Experiment 2 entwickelte sich eine hypochrome, mikrozytäre Eisenmangelanämie, ohne daß jedoch die Wachstumsraten merklich beeinflußt wurden. Mit einer ad libitum‐Aufnahme von insgesamt 6,9 mg Fe mit der 40 ppm Diät wurde Fe‐Mangel völlig verhindert, nicht jedoch mit einer einmaligen i.v. Dosis von 2,7 mg Fe. Überschüssiges Eisen, das oral oder i.v. verabreicht wurde, beeinflußte die hämatologischen Werte mit Ausnahme der Plasma‐Fe‐Konzentration nicht, und wurde in die typischen Speicherorgane eingelagert. Die Plasma‐Fe‐Konzentration korrelierte signifikant mit dem Fe‐Bestand von Körper, Leber, Milz und Femur und zwar sogar bei überschüssiger Fe‐Zufuhr. Jedes Prozent Anstieg in der Plasma‐Fe‐Konzentration im Vergleich zum Kontrollwert bei bedarfsgerechter Versorgung entsprach einem Anstieg von 0,66 Prozent im Körper‐Fe‐Bestand. Der Fe‐Bestand der zuletzt ungefähr 160 g schweren Ratten betrug ohne Fe‐Zulage 2,1 mg, bei bedarfsgerechter Versorgung 5,3 mg und bei bedarfsüberschreitender Fe‐Zufuhr bis zu 8,2 mg.</jats:p>",
