Since the peak in 1967, the lower 48 states proved reserve inventory of natural gas has proved reserve inventory of natural gas has shrunk by more than one-third and reserve additions during this period have been less than one-half the amount necessary to maintain a constant level of proved reserves. In recent years the domestic drilling effort has responded well to higher gas prices and other incentives, but the discovery results have been disappointing. These trends could be an indication that the size of the undiscovered natural gas resource base may be the most serious constraint on future conventional gas supply.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Domestic natural gas production peaked in 1973 and has declined each year since then. Based on recent trends of annual reserve additions, the staff of the FPC projects that lower-48-state conventional natural gas production will decline to approximately 14 Tcf production will decline to approximately 14 Tcf by 1985, a 38-percent drop from the 1973 peak of 22.5 Tcf. While further increases in price incentives might ameliorate the situation somewhat, industry and government policymakers should proceed on the expectation of decreasing gas availability.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The views expressed herein are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Power Commission or of individual commissioners.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>There were two major energy events that took place in 1973. The contrast between these two events is interesting and says much about our national perception of serious energy problems. The first event, the OPEC oil problems. The first event, the OPEC oil embargo, followed by the new tough OPEC bargaining posture and skyrocketing world oil prices was given extensive press coverage, and prices was given extensive press coverage, and of course, the temporary gasoline shortage had a direct impact on the lives of most citizens. By contrast, the second major energy event in 1973 received little, if any, media coverage. This second event was the peaking of U.S. natural gas production and the beginning of its decline for the first time in the history of the modern gas industry.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The fluorosis was correlated with different infant diets and also with the calculated supply per kilo body weight. As in cattle, 0.1 mg F/kg body weight daily appears to cause fluorosis. This dose may for example be reached with water‐diluted gruel powder in low‐weight infants with high consumption in low F areas, in normal weight infants in 0.8 areas, and also in high‐weight infants in 1.2–1.5 areas. The resultant fluorosis is very mild or mild and not disfiguring. Enamel fluorosis can be avoided or minimized in areas with up to at least 1.2 mgF/1 water if F‐supply, e.g. water‐diluted gruel and/or supplementary fluoride, is not commenced until 6 months of age when body weight is higher. With a water fluoride content of 2.75 mg F/l a very mild fluorosis is difficult to avoid also with normal water consumption during the 1st year of life.</jats:p>",

From CBF studies it was predicted that a substantial number of patients (27%) would suffer severe cerebral ischemia if carotid ligation were carried out. No single angiographic feature provided this predictive information. Bilateral fetal type of posterior communicating arteries were associated with significantly lower carotid artery back pressure on temporary carotid occlusion, and unilateral absence of posterior communicating arteries was related to lower CBF, but neither feature was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of successful carotid ligation. We believe that preliminary percutaneous digital carotid compression with electroencephalographic monitoring, followed by intraoperative measurement of the change in regional CBF and internal carotid artery pressure during temporary carotid clamping provides a safe method of selecting patients for carotid ligation. Carotid angiography with or without contralateral carotid compression is of little value in this respect.</jats:p>",

The first experiment investigated the effects of time of planting the weed seedlings (simulating different times of emergence), nitrogen supply and cereal seed rate in winter wheat and the second, the same factors in spring wheat and spring barley.</jats:p><jats:p>In winter wheat, delaying planting of the weeds from autumn until spring greatly decreased shoot growth and almost completely prevented rhizome formation. Nitrogen fertilizer increased the weight of shoots of both species planted at both times but whereas it increased the amount of rhizome produced by Agropyron it decreased that of Agrostis. Without nitrogen Agrostis had twice as much rhizome as Agropyron but with nitrogen Agropyron had twice as much as Agrostis. Decreasing the cereal seed rate had little effect on rhizome weight when nitrogen was not given but it allowed twice as much rhizome to be produced when it was supplied. However, more longer rhizomes were formed at the smaller than at the larger seed rate with both amounts of nitrogen.</jats:p><jats:p>In spring cereals, late planting decreased the shoot growth of Agrostis more than that of Agropyron, and of Agropyron in barley more than in wheat, especially at the smaller seed rate. Nitrogen increased shoot weight of Agropyron in wheat but had little effect in barley; it decreased that of Agrostis in barley. On average, rhizome growth was decreased by nitrogen, by increasing the seed rate and by delaying planting. Agropyron rhizomes were heavier in wheat than in barley but those of Agrostis were heavier in barley than in wheat. Agropyron produced most rhizome in thinlysown wheat given nitrogen, but Agrostis most in thinlysown barley without nitrogen. The two treatments had an equal number of rhizomes longer than 100 cm.</jats:p><jats:p>The agricultural significance of the interaction of the various treatments is briefly discussed.</jats:p>",
