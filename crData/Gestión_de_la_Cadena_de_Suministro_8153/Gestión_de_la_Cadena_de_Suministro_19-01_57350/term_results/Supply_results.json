It is very important to have supply chain collaboration (SCC) with major suppliers to maintain a long-term stable relationship with them. The aim of this chapter is to find the relationship between trust and SCC established with major suppliers. An empirical research is conducted to measure the relationship between trust and SCC with major suppliers. Positive relationships between trust and supply chain collaboration is hypothesized. It is empirically proved that there is a strong positive relation between two constructs. This research will provide theoretical and practical contributions to both academicians and practitioners working in supply chains. </jats:p>"

The survey was administered and collected from employees and sales managers from three small medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vellore district. Correlation, regression, mediation effect using SPSS is performed to test the hypothesis. The findings of the study reveal that there exists a positive relationship between marketing orientation and supply chain performance and the manufacturing organization's supply chain management strategy mediates the connection between marketing orientation and supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has been garnering interest because of its multi-approach in nature. SSCM has emerged as an essential method for organizations to develop and to enhance their competitive strategy through innovative ways in order to satisfy customer basic needs. It facilitates competitive advantage, faster flow of information, material, less response time, speeding up delivery action, better relation and coordination among partners, easy way of information sharing, and increasing order fulfilment rate. Implementing SSCM in organizations like thermal power plants has other benefits such as increasing attention about environmental performance intending the integration of social as well as economic performance. In this chapter, the artificial neural network (ANN) method is used to measure the customer satisfaction after implementing SSCM by thermal power industries. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the early 2000s, the advent of internet and e-communication enabled organizations to be more responsive and cater to their customers' needs in a better way. Over the last few years, integrated technologies and ERP systems has allowed organizations to gain market share and establish themselves as e-commerce players. This has been achieved through better synchronization, business realignment, and operational flexibility. The rapid development in fields of information technology has transformed old partnerships between suppliers, buyers, and service providers into a more collaborative business process where information and knowledge sharing is a key success parameter. Through enhanced IT capabilities, SMEs can cooperate to form a network and promote their joint capacities to acquire a complex project and integrate resources for a better planning and execution. In this chapter, the author seeks to highlight the importance for e-SCM to be implemented and adopted, current status of adoption through case studies, benefits of e-SCM as strategy and challenges plaguing adoption of e-SCM. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter focusses on the concept, drivers, and perspectives of supply chain complexity of a firm. It discusses the impact of number of tiers, number of nodes in each tier, its links and flows on complexity of a firms' supply chain. This chapter tries to bring out the dynamic interactions between tiers and nodes. This chapter suggests that the levels of supply chain and its dynamic complexity are influenced by the products, processes, relationships, and the environment of the firm and its suppliers and distribution partners. Here the drivers, namely, the 5Vs (value, volume, variety, volatility, and visibility), 3Ps (process, people, and planet), and the global market (as a driver) that lead to complexity have been discussed. The complexity of supply chain has been explained from different perspectives. These are the system and process perspectives. This chapter introduces the concept of systems thinking proposed by Forrester and Senge. It illustrates the need to apply a holistic approach in reduction of supply chain complexity. The causality doctrine, proposed in this chapter, enables a supply chain manager to carry out policy experimentation. Supply chain structure varies across organisations. This suggests that a process framework along with application of systems thinking will aid supply chain managers to make supply chain less complex and lean. That is, the supply chain has the desired properties, namely, repeatability, testability, serviceability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. The next section talks about the importance of production processes in reducing complexity. Finally, the chapter discusses about the optimal number of suppliers a firm may have to meet its objectives. It argues that if past do not extend in future, the number of suppliers will add redundancy to the upstream supply chain, and at the same time, if future exceeds past, the supply chain fails. There are different options available to meet these challenges. These could be “buy-back” or “pay-back” or “rate contract” options. This chapter introduces the computational framework for assessing complexity of a firm based on its structure. This framework will help supply chain managers to carryout experimentation on the design of a supply chain network. </jats:p>"

It highlights the differences in supply chain strategies, its alignment with corporate strategies, and the associated drivers of supply chain management. This chapter also highlights the dynamics associated with inventory and success of supply chain of a firm. It tries to provide a framework to resolve the supply chain managers' dilemma as to hold inventory for order fulfilment or to enhance the inventory turnover ratio to maximize profitability. The chapter discusses all facets of inventory management – it includes inventory management of constant as well as dynamic demand. This chapter introduces the concept of adaptive inventory control for non-stationary demand. There are situations when all assumptions of conventional approach may fail and hence points out the importance of application of artificial intelligence and data science in inventory management. This chapter brings out the varied dimensions of contracts that are crucial to have an effective supply chain system. Here the author attempts to put forward an outsourcing decision framework to facilitate make or buy decision. This chapter relates the concept of materials requirement planning (MRP) with independent items. Since supply chains are going global, this chapter introduces the concepts behind global sourcing including the significance of INCO (international commercial) terms. </jats:p>"

Over 75% of the markup on pharmaceutical products takes place at the manufacturer. This causes inventory-carrying costs to increase dramatically once the distribution segments of the supply chain purchase the product. Wholesalers and large pharmacy chains suffer high carrying costs on the final product. Inside pharmaceutical supply chains, companies must also face issues of product expiration and limited shelf lives. Seasonal and short shelf life products such as flu vaccines leave companies without the opportunity to redistribute or reallocate product in order to meet demand. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The pharmaceutical industry is under severe pressure due to complex supply chains that are underutilized, inefficient, and ill-equipped to cope with the sort of products. The pharma supply chain must meet the demands of a fast-evolving marketplace and the shift from patient to an outcome to undergo a radical overhaul. Research and development (R&amp;D) costs in the pharma industry are spiraling, development timelines are growing, and consumers are becoming increasingly knowledgeable about care options including drugs and treatment. The marketplace is fixed through the development cycle and increasing efficiency through rationalization or outsourcing of non-core activities. Recently, the pharma industry moved from the “one-size-fits-all” approach for the supply chain flexibility, responsiveness, and reliability. This chapter enables readers to understand the techniques for rapid commission and decommission new products and markets and alternate supply models, inventory tracking tools to eliminate counterfeiting and parallel-importing risks. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter provides an understanding of basic essence of supply chain management. It introduces a multi-dimensional facet of supply chain management. A typical supply chain has at least three entities, that is, the supplier, the firm, and its customer. The inter-link between these three entities comprises three primary components of a supply chain, namely, the inbound or upstream supply chain, internal supply chain, and outbound or downstream supply chain. However, in a real-life scenario, many firms (especially in case of large and complex firms), the suppliers, and production centres are more than one. This increases the complexity of the supply chain structure. This concept has been introduced in this chapter. The drivers of supply chain have been categorized under strategic and operational drivers. This aspect has been explained, with examples. The chapter discusses the enablers and inhibitors of a supply chain of a firm. It proceeds to explain the issues in assessing and integrating the drivers, enablers, and inhibitors in the supply chain planning process. Bull whip and snow ball effects are two important outcomes of an inefficient supply chain. These concepts have been introduced here. Finally, the chapter concludes by laying down the objectives and the strategies of supply chain management. It prioritizes the focus of supply chain management, stating that customers come first followed by cost optimization. The chapter discusses on the ways to make supply chain agile and flexible. Supply chains are always prone to disruptions; hence, this chapter talks about a resilient supply chain. Next to customer, cost is an important element that enables a firm to keep its price competitive and be profitable. Here the concept of a lean supply chain has been discussed, a way to minimize waste and hence reduce cost. Supply chain management varies with firms' business strategy. The firm may choose to follow either a cost-leadership strategy or a differentiation or a focus strategy and thus would accordingly adopt push or pull or push-pull (supply chain) strategy. In case of cost-leadership strategy, the firm is expected to follow “make-to-stock” (operations) strategy; in case of differentiation strategy it would adopt “make-to-order” strategy; and for focus strategy the firm embraces “engineer-to-order” strategy. This chapter discusses these aspects to correlate the different dimensions of business and its supply chain management. Firms now are focussing on global operation to leverage on opening up of economy, enabling them to lower the cost of operations and achieve the desired quality. Besides, globalisation has also led to widening of market coverage. A brief introduction to global logistics management has been made in this chapter to emphasise on operationalization of a firms' global supply chain. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of software agent has become important in both artificial intelligence and mainstream computer science. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are providing the way to design and implement information system solutions that exhibit flexibility, adoptability and reconfigurability in a distributed environment, which are main benefits over traditional centralized software systems. The analysis, design, deployment and testing of such distributed agent-based software systems, particularly those exhibiting intelligent decision-making properties, are usually a challenging task. Simulation plays a key role to analyse the behaviour of MAS solutions during the analysis and design phase of automated software solution. This chapter uses the concept of multi-agent computing and presents software architecture for green supply chain management, in particular carbon footprint assessment planning for a multi-modal transportation problem. In this architecture, all the software agents' operations are governed by a hybrid knowledge-based which utilizes case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR). The describe architecture accepts a transportation service request and plans a transportation strategy with a minimum environmental impact (i.e. CO2 footprint), by retrieving best practices (from a carbon footprint perspective) for each route leg, from a repository of best practiced cases. Carbon footprint best practices from each route leg in a multi-modal transportation scenario are used to minimize environmental impact and thus demonstrate system functionality. </jats:p>"

In this study, the authors use the Stackelberg game model to analyze the decisions of a two-stage supply chain, providing environmentally friendly products affected by a consumer greenness preference which is represented by the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for product greenness. The authors found that manufacturers may lower the product greenness level with the decrease of the valuation of consumer's WTP for product greenness, but he may prefer keeping the same product greenness, he will even improve it, when there is a reduction in reservation utility for the traditional product. Moreover, this article shows that there is different impact for different combinations of both WTP for product greenness and product greenness level (different market segmentations) on price decisions of the manufacturer and retailer. In consideration of the asymmetric information about consumer's utility and willingness to pay between manufacturer and retailer, the authors introduce the bargaining power into the study, and then they conclude that during the different market segmentations, the wholesale price and retail price go down as a retailer strengthens his bargaining power, and increasing sales volume can improve profit to make up for a loss in retail price.</jats:p>",

It has been around for as long as we can look back in history, and yet, we still have a very limited understanding of what strategic supply chain management entails or constitutes. A strategic approach to supply chain management necessarily needs to consider wider corporate strategic objectives and initiatives, while it has to contribute to the achievement of these goals as all other managerial functions do. We further differentiate between strategic supply chain management, when the supply chain function provides unique competitive advantage and supply chain strategy, when it takes on a supporting role to corporate strategy. The authors develop a case for strategic supply chain management based on edge computing applications through IoT sensors such as GPS or RFID to illustrate that supply chain practitioners need to fundamentally rethink the way current supply chain systems process data and information and also that the approach to collaboration between supply chain partners changes drastically. </jats:p>"

The high-level view over their supply chains allows them to function better in a multi-channel world. It also helps them identify where to reduce stock without compromising customer service. Otherwise, it leads to a delay in delivery, counterfeit products, thefts, fraud, and cyberpiracy, which may lead to lawsuits and losing of brand image. The tacit function of supply chain management is to provide tracking of specific goods in the supply chain.

The region or country fixes the CAP which is the limit for emissions emitted by an organization. This chapter depicts the performance evaluation of a supply chain under the carbon cap and trade scheme. A mathematical model is proposed which considers carbon emissions as a result of supply chain operation, carbon trading among members of the supply chain, and carbon trading with members of outside supply chain. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for the performance evaluation of a forward supply chain having 4 stages. The analysis shows that carbon trading allows economic benefits as well as environmental benefits. </jats:p>"

It defines the raw material to be used, the possible supplier to select, the industrial processes involved in its fabrication, the packaging for its transportation and the newest stage where the product reaches its end of life and needs to be disposed. The Product design then becomes Green Product Design (GPD), where energy, time, resources become critical for a company. GPD takes into account the whole product life cycle.

The overall integrity and sustainability of the supply chain can be provided by satisfying the expectations of each parties. The loyalty in the supply chain is achieved by offering distinguished service among suppliers and customers rather than delivering almost same services. This can only be achieved through network design models by taking into account multiple conflicting objectives. The firm's competitive strategy defines a particular set of objectives to achieve specific goals on these performance attributes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advent of information and communication technologies (ICT) ushers a cost-effective prospect to take care of large volumes of complex data, commonly known as “big data” in the supply chain operational environment. Big data is being generated today by web applications, social media, intelligent machines, sensors, mobile phones, and other smart handheld devices. Big data is characterized in terms of the velocity, volume, and variety with which it produces along the supply chain. This is due to recent advances in telecommunication networks along with centralized and decentralized data storage systems, which are processed thanks to modern digital computational capabilities. There is a growing interest in the use of this large volume of data and advanced analytics for diverse types of business problems in supply chain management (SCM). Such decision-support software applications employ pure mathematical techniques, artificial intelligence techniques, and sometimes uses both techniques to perform analytical operations that undercover relationships and patterns within supply chain generated big data. This chapter proposes a framework for the utilization of big data in SCM decision making. The framework is based on the SCOR (supply chain operations reference) model, which is endorsed by Supply Chain Council (SCC). The proposed framework is influenced by the enterprise potential of augmented reality and virtual reality in supply chain applications, and it identifies key categories of big data analytics applications for the key businesses of SCOR model. Finally, the chapter highlights research issues to extract insight from big data sources for enterprise decision making. </jats:p>"

The petrochemical industry was selected because of its role in the Iranian economy and its considerable environmental and social impacts. The interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was used as a useful technique to identify interrelations between different sustainable practices. According to the results, set up reduction and pull production system (related to JIT practices) are driving other practices, and these practices have vital role among other practices.

Many researchers studied a phenomenon called downstream demand inference (DDI), which presents an effective demand management strategy to deal with forecast problems. DDI allows the upstream actor to infer the demand received by the downstream one without information sharing. Recent study showed that DDI is possible with simple moving average (SMA) forecast method and was verified especially for an autoregressive AR(1) demand process. This chapter extends the strategy's results by developing mean squared error and average inventory level expressions for causal invertible ARMA(p,q) demand under DDI strategy, no information sharing (NIS), and forecast information sharing (FIS) strategies. The authors analyze the sensibility of the performance metrics in respect with lead-time, SMA, and ARMA(p,q) parameters, and compare DDI results with the NIS and FIS strategies' results.</jats:p>"

In addition, with the shortening of product life cycles, the rate of returning products is increasing day by day. Therefore, businesses are trying to find ways to get more value from these returning products. Here, the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), which comes into effect at this point, refers to the design, operation, and control of the system to ensure maximum value from returning products of different breeds and quantities. Recycling these returned products by different methods will provide significant savings in terms of both the production costs by providing return of the economically valuable materials to the economy as an input and the waste disposal costs by reducing the amount of waste. This chapter investigates the concept of closed-loop supply chain and its benefits to the businesses. </jats:p>"

In an attempt to reduce the level of working capital, a firm has to achieve some goals: to minimize cash available, reduce accounts receivables, extend its accounts payable, and shorten inventory days. To achieve these goals supply chain activities should be related with working capital requirements. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the relationship between supply chain management and working capital management. A theoretical framework is proposed as an evidence to prove the relationship between supply chain activities and working capital components. Consequently, this chapter investigates how improvements on working capital components can add value to the supply chain process. </jats:p>"

One of the challenges in the transformation is that there is so much dependency among various digital technologies that if one is implemented without the other, it might lead to no value creation at all. Furthermore, some of these technologies are dependent on other technologies that are still in its early phase of adoption. The existing technologies (namely artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality, internet of things, virtual reality, big data) are critical enablers for the digital supply chain network; however, to unleash the full potential of these technologies, an extensive data sharing and analysis is required. This will only be possible if there is a robust telecom network. 5G with its features of low latency, high bandwidth, higher speeds, and low power requirements is expected to fill the void and hence expedite the digital supply chain transformation. </jats:p>"

In this chapter, the authors present a novel big data analytics methodology to accurately forecast international trade volumes between countries for specific products. The methodology uses various open data sources and employs random forest and artificial neural networks.

During adoption of sustainability concepts in traditional supply chain management, some hurdles can be anticipated. These hurdles are called barriers, and industries must equip themselves to remove them. The difficulties associated with removal of barriers are identification and analysis for selection significant barriers. In this chapter, the significant barriers for incorporating sustainability in supply chain of high volume manufacturing are consolidated from the literature and categorized into seven groups: people, strategic, environmental, economic, societal, regulatory, and functional. The widely used evaluation methods are interpretive structural modeling and DEMATEL for which the procedure and guidance to infer the results are detailed. The chapter is expected to support the practicing engineers involved in implementation of sustainable concepts in supply chain. </jats:p>"

A maturity model by design provides a road-map to the next level of performance. In this chapter, the authors propose using maturity models as a structured way of identifying current capability or maturity level of any supply chain. The authors provide guidance on selecting the right “causal linkages” between supply chain objectives and performance measures. They then define a mechanism for specifying even more granular definitions of measures linked to strategic objectives, as the level of maturity progresses. In this chapter, the authors survey widely used supply chain/business process maturity models and current practices related to measuring operational metric. And then present a tiered framework for operational metric alignment and KPI governance based on perspective-based modeling design principles.</jats:p>"

Under these circumstances, studies aimed to improving the understanding of the main blockchain diffusion factors are fundamental. This chapter is a contribution to bridging such gaps, as it aims to unlock the driving factors of blockchain diffusion in the SCM environment. Based on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain management, expectancy theory, and diffusion of innovations, a model was developed and validated, considering data from India's supply chain management professionals. The data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that IT deployment capability, compatibility, and trading partner pressure are factors that affect blockchain diffusion significantly. Also, the results bring essential managerial and theoretical implications regarding the blockchain diffusion in the SCM.</jats:p>"

Familiarity with various manufacturing and logistics firms would help students to better understand such topics. Information on the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexed firms and top 50 supply chain firms by Gartner is easily accessible and typically covers a variety of industries from chemical, food/beverage, high‐tech to retail, to name a few. Instructors of OSCM courses can take advantage of this kind of information to discuss industry characteristics and supply chain classification. We present how to collect financial data, calculate supply chain metrics (e.g., inventory turns, profit margin, and cash‐to‐cash cycle) by building a spreadsheet model and creating an earns‐turns matrix, which prescribes supply chain classification. We also show how to analyze supply chain performance and describe industry characteristics based on the earns‐turns matrix. We provide vital questions and takeaways for instructors to lead and wrap‐up discussions. Students claim that they appreciated learning about industry characteristics and different supply chain strategies through the earns‐turns matrix analysis.</jats:p>",

A mono-method, qualitative, inductive, single case study approach was taken on a cross-sectional scale from June 2018 to August 2018, with two individuals interviewed: a beef and a blockchain expert. The case study also involved observations, a field visit, and other secondary source data. Beef is a high demand, valuable food product with a limited shelf life. By using blockchain in conjunction with RFID and sensor technologies, farming and processing stages in the beef supply chain can be streamlined. Firstly, using the technology to monitor the animals on the farm and during transportation can reduce the amount of water and energy wasted. Secondly, blockchain can be used to establish exactly when and where the meat is cut and packaged, improving the accuracy of information between supply chain entities, resulting in improved inventory management, specifically more accurate delivery times and lengthened product shelf lives. </jats:p>"

While fossil fuel science and technology is well established, the scientific understanding and technological implications of biofuels are not clearly laid out. In recent years, a large number of assessments have been conducted to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biofuels. However, contradicting results were noted in the published articles. The current chapter attempts to understand the importance of triple bottom line (TBL) aspects for the life cycle sustainability analysis (LCSA) over the conventional life cycle analysis (LCA) of biofuels-based supply chain. Along with energy and environmental indicators, LCSA also evaluates the economic and social factors. Hence, a statistical assessment with multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) analysis has been implemented to highlight and achieve coherence in conducting the sustainability analysis of biofuels supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this research, confirmative factor analysis, correlation test, co-linearity test, and path analysis were used. The chapter tries to describe quantitatively all the relations in multidimensional structure. Effective knowledge sharing in SC is influenced by the hierarchy of strategies. Thus, SC strategies influence the business strategies, business strategies affect knowledge strategies, and knowledge strategies influence the effective and systematic knowledge sharing in the SC. Therefore, knowledge sharing is most of all influenced by KM strategies but is indirectly influenced by business and SC strategies.</jats:p>"

Objective: To assess the effect of staff turnover on organizational (PFSA) efficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Using sample size determination formula 96 respondents was obtained from 478 permanent employees of target population. Data obtained through structured questionnaires were analyzed using the version 20 SPSS. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance, and percentage) was computed and summary results was present using tables and graphs. Chi-square test was compute to see the association and proven the research hypothesis. Result: A total of 96 respondents were participated. The result showed that majority 90 (93.8%) of the respondents were responded PFSA has experience of employee turnover. A mean of 4.05, 4.00 of respondents agreed that lack of incentives and poor wages, low level of employee motivation, were the reasons of employee turnover respectively. Even though 50 (52.1%) of the respondents felt that the organization had not taken any measures to manage employee turnover, a mean of 3.55 and 3.41 respondents indicated that establishing of functional and effective human resource management system and create an open communication between employee and management respectively could decrease employee turnover and improve organization efficiency to a great extent, this supported by (X2= 10;97, df=4, p&lt; 0.027) establishing effective human resource management system is the way of reducing staff turnover implies significant relationship between staff turnover and organizational effectiveness. A study showed that a significant association between staff turnover and organizational efficiency (X2= 20.49, df=4, p&lt; 0.000).Conclusion: The study concluded that almost all the employees had an intimation to left the Agency due to poor incentives and wages, low level of employee motivation, lack of career development opportunities.</jats:p>"

There are contradictory findings on applying the cost-benefit element to green supply chain management (GSCM) and no clear theory on how to combine these elements to gain a competitive advantage. The primary objective of this study is to identify the impact of GSCM on competitive advantage of business organizations in Sri Lanka. Sample technique used was convenience sampling method. Data was collected from 30 organizations that were following green practices in Sri Lanka. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, correlation coefficient, and simple regression model. The results show that there is a strong positive relationship between GSCM and competitive advantage, and rather than applying just one element to gain a competitive advantage, it was considered more effective to apply both cost-benefit and customer value enhancement simultaneously.</jats:p>"

Till the early 2000s, supply chain optimization problems were being addressed by conventional programming approaches such as Linear Programming, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Branch-and-Bound methods. However, the solution convergence in such approaches was slow. But with the advent of Swarm Intelligence (SI)-based algorithms like particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization, a significant improvement in solution of these problems has been observed. The purpose of this paper is to present and analyze the application of SI algorithms in SCM. The analysis will eventually lead to development of a generalized SI implementation framework for optimization problems in SCM.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A structured state-of-the-art literature review is presented, which explores the applications of SI algorithms in SCM.

Many different process notations are known (e.g., detailed vs. rough, flexible vs. standardized, etc.), and at the same time, fundamentally different SCM process types make various assumptions about suitable modeling (e.g., integration of value chain partners, standardization). This chapter presents an association model that suggests which notation fits best to which SCM type.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For random distributors under supply disruptions caused by emergency incidents, a fuzzy emergency model and a robust emergency strategy of the supply chain system are studied. First, for a kind of supply chain system composed of a strategic manufacturer, a backup manufacturer, and multiple distributors, the basic emergency models, including the inventory models and a total cost model, are constructed under random supply disruptions. Then, based on the Takagi‐Sugeno fuzzy system, the basic emergency models of the supply chain system are converted into a discrete switching model, which can realize soft switching among the basic emergency models. Furthermore, according to the different inventory levels, the strategic manufacturer’s production strategies and the distributors’ ordering strategies are designed to reduce the inventory costs of the node enterprises in supply chain system. Second, by defining a discrete piecewise Lyapunov function in each maximal overlapped‐rules group, a new fuzzy robust emergency strategy for the supply chain system is proposed through the principle of parallel distributed compensation. This emergency strategy can not only restore the impaired supply chain to the normal operation state but also keep the total cost of the supply chain at a low level and guarantee the robust stability of the emergency supply chain system. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy robust emergency strategy of the supply chain system.</jats:p>",

They then review hierarchical planning and execution discussions for the strategic, tactical, and operational decisions in supply chain literature. They continue the discussion with public healthcare services cases on medicine and equipment maintenance supply chains. They compare hierarchical planning execution discussions in supply chain management literature vis-a-vis healthcare services cases. Their main argument is that much can be gained by the public healthcare services by striving for reduced information asymmetry and employing appropriate functional aggregation at various levels of the hierarchically organized public healthcare supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter presents a methodology to evaluate the benefit of using sensors in closed-loop supply chains. Sensors can be embedded into products to collect helpful information during their use and end-of-life (EOL) phases. This information can subsequently be employed to estimate the remaining lives of components and products and to ensure that proper maintenance is provided to avoid premature failures. The information is also useful in determining the quality of the components and products when planning EOL operations such as disassembly, inspection, and remanufacturing. To statistically illustrate these benefits, discrete event simulation is employed to a case study consisting of regular and sensor-embedded refrigerator systems. A design of experiments study is then employed where experiments are run to compare the two systems. The results reveal that the sensor-embedded systems perform much better than the regular systems in terms of disassembly costs, inspection costs, and EOL profits generated by selling the remanufactured products and components. </jats:p>"

Who should monitor compliance with global standards? How should compliance with global standards be monitored? The unit of analysis for compliance monitoring should be global supply chains that adopt compliance programmes applied to internal business units, subsidiaries, and independent suppliers, operating across different jurisdictions. The objective of effective compliance monitoring is to minimize costs of governance and transactions, and maximize effective oversight. Monitoring compliance of business units within large corporations and independent suppliers calls for different yet coordinated instruments including corporate, employment, and contract law. The structure of the chains, their composition, and the allocation of power significantly influence the architecture of compliance and the mix of hierarchical, peer, and delegated control.</p>",

Accordingly, the European Commission has outlined different measures to ensure supply security, one of which is the diversification of routes and sources through the Caspian region. Taking up the conceptual perspective of critical geopolitics, the book analyses the European Commission’s geopolitical reasoning. It observes that the proposed policy solution of diversifying gas supply and routes through the SGC has turned into a publicly accepted narrative in Commission discourse.</p>"

Customers expect to obtain a product that has benefits and are available within an acceptable price and time. It is necessary for companies to optimally use their ability to satisfy customers' specified needs. Researchers and industries are working on developing green supply chain concept in the last few years due to environmental concerns. The objective of this chapter is to propose a three-echelon supply chain model that optimizes economic and environmental objectives simultaneously. The objectives considered are minimizing the total supply chain cost and minimizing CO2 emission of the supply chain network. The proposed model falls into NP-hard category. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed model and illustration is provided to explain the use of the proposed model. A procedure that could be followed to find the best possible solution based on user's choice among the Pareto front solutions is also explained. </jats:p>"

The analysis shows that this time consists of the time for obtaining information about failure, the time of information recognition about failure, the damage repair time and the time of connection and disconnection harmonization. Each of them, in turn, is also considered in more detail that allows identifying reserves to reduce the power supply outage time. The chapter proposes reducing the power supply restoration time by going to the monitoring system combination of both operating modes and technical condition of power networks. Based on the study results, there are methods allowing to reduce the power supply outage time of rural consumers by means of automating rural electrical networks and improving the operating mode monitoring of power supply systems. The chapter also suggests a set of devices that allows to implement the proposed methods. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The polarization of the Nigerian society with a population of about 198 million people, growing at the rate of 3.2% per annum, into a large rural sector and a small urban component provides a basis for the inadequate provision of health infrastructure in the rural areas. For instance, over 65% of Nigerian population who live in the rural areas are most neglected and deprived of basic services as well as other modern infrastructural necessities that are essential to the maintenance and promotion of good health. Hence its supply is a major factor for consideration in the health of any community. This study aimed to assess the sources of water supply, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices in an island community of Amassoma, Bayelsa State. Materials and Method: A cross sectional descriptive study design was used, the 357-sample size for housing units was determined using the appropriate statistical formula and systematic sampling method was used with a sampling interval of two. A 30-item administered closed-ended structured questionnaire was used. Data was collected from 198 households and analysed using descriptive statistics with frequency counts and simple percentages using computer aided statistical analysis by Microsoft Excel. Results: The result identified multiple sources of water supply which includes rain, river/stream, pipe borne, borehole, sachet water and table water with borehole and sachet water being the major source. The sanitary condition of the water source shows that 28.8% dirty, 5.6% fairly clean, 68.7% admitted to not treating their water at home, while 15.2% just store at home, 10.1% use water guard and 6.0% practice boiling. For the toilet facilities, 40.9% use septic tank, 33.8% do open defecation, 15.7% use the river, 13.1% use traditional pit latrines, while 9.0% use ventilated improved toilet pit latrine. 5.6% were fairly clean, 28.8% dirty while 39.4% use the river for bathing purposes, 14.1% have open bathrooms while 1.6% have other forms of bathroom facilities. 63.6% dump their refuses at open dump sites while 10.6% burn theirs. 9.9% dump refuses in the river while 22.2% practice other forms of refuse disposal. Hand washing, an important hygiene practice with 95.9% practicing hand washing after visiting the toilet, 76.8% before cooking, 72.7% after cooking while 85.9% before eating. Common health problems show, 25.3% of the respondents had malaria, 20.7% diarrhoea, 9.1% skin rash, while 2.0% had cough. About 31.8% of them attributed poor sanitation as a causal factor, 23.2% of the respondents associated water as a possible causal factor, while 44.9% did not attribute their health challenges to any causal factor. 52.0% purchase drugs from patent drug stores for treatment, 36.9% visit hospitals, while 11.1% patronize traditional doctors. Conclusion: Sanitation facilities and safe water supply are insufficient in Amassoma community. This along with hygienic practices led to the prevalence of common illnesses in the community. Poor sanitation and unhygienic practices are still widely practiced. The State and Local Government should provide adequate portable water and sanitation facilities in public places with emphasis on citizen advocacy in the area of health education campaign.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Domesticated ruminants play a key role in world livestock production, while some other ruminant species are important in the hunting economy. Non-farm species kept in zoological gardens pose a new challenge for veterinarians. In addition, cervids are increasingly often maintained under farm conditions, in which it may be necessary to undertake medical interventions.  The pattern of the brain base arteries is one of specific morphological features of species from the suborder Ruminantia, including the domestic cattle, zebu, buffalos, sheep, goats, reindeer and other deer species, giraffes, musk deer and antelopes. A specific feature of the arteries of the brain base in ruminants is the presence of the arterial nasal epidural rete mirabile, and in some species also the caudal epidural rete mirabile. In addition, in these animals the extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery obliterates, and as a consequence, blood flows into the brain by an alternative route from the maxillary artery, via the vasculature of the nasal epidural rete mirabile.   It is widely accepted that the retia mirabilia in the system of head arteries in mammals are the anatomical basis of the so-called selective brain cooling. Essentially, this mechanism consists in cooling the warm blood expelled from the left ventricle during the contraction of the heart, which flows to the brain, creating a vast vasculature of the rete mirabile. It is encircled by a cooler blood, returning from the nasal cavity via the cavernous sinus. Retia mirabilia located on the brain base are the main effectors of heat dissipation and protection of the brain from overheating. This mechanism fits into the very current topic of animal welfare.</jats:p>"

This paper considers the impact of inventory on the economics of the businesses and the whole chain and discusses causes of inefficiency. In most supply chains the goods are inactive for the majority of the time, and this leads to longer term and therefore less accurate forecasting. The result is typically excess inventory, shortages, and inflexibility. By analysing the wasted time and costs in the supply chain, a clearer view of the whole process can be created. Total supply time can be considered as three components, namely value added time, non-value added process time, and waste time. This basic approach shows where improvements should be focussed. Using this time-based measurement enables more relevant comparison between supply chains than the normal supply chain efficiency ratio.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction industry is one of the industries that have a great impact on the economy. A construction supply chain (CSC) is an important process affecting the circular economy (CE) and sustainability in practice. In order to analyze the efficiency of CE and CSC, a performance measurement system (PMS) is needed. At such a point, adopting a PMS to a supply chain at relatively early stages of a project could lead to sustainable supply chain management (SCM). Collaboration between all parties such as designers and contractors will be advantageous to gain competitiveness in the sector. This chapter aims to determine the need of PMS adaptation to construction supply chain process for sustainable and lean construction supply chain management based on the literature review. This chapter is expected to be beneficial for academics, researchers in the relevant field as well as policy makers and professionals. </jats:p>"

The providers’ infrastructure (warehouses, transport, information technology, cold chain, gross domestic product) were adequately regulated and they adopted a wide list of indicators for monitoring performance. Private providers showed high interest in investing in the hospital sector. On the demand side (56 hospitals from 28 regions) the main weaknesses of SC are related to infrastructure, information technology, human resources, a lack of financial resources and inadequate process control.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0266462319002605_sec_a703\" sec-type=\"conclusions\"><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The study highlighted extremely limited outsourcing in the hospital field to date, weaknesses in the public system and a high interest of private providers in investing in public hospital SC.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has attracted increased attention in the recent years all over the world. Unlike an ordinary supply chain, sustainable supply chains confront two major hurdles in the planning as well as in the operational stage, namely barriers and risks. Barriers are usually associated with technical, economic, and marketing infeasibilities, whereas risks induce disruptions and uncertainties. These factors demotivate the organizations from adopting sustainable practices in supply chain operations. The chapter consolidates the significant barriers and risk factors influential in the current Indian business environment. The analysis is based on the expert survey conducted in the South Indian manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the above barriers are ranked utilizing the grey relational analysis method in an intuitionistic fuzzy setting. Finally, the effects of the risk factors induced by sustainable practices are also discussed to facilitate selection of proactive strategies for the success of sustainable business in India. </jats:p>"

The world food crisis highlights a large quantity of food going waste or lost due to many unsustainable practices in the food supply chain. This chapter provides a conceptual model to build a sustainable food supply chain while minimizing the food waste that occurs at different stages. By incorporating stakeholder management and other behavioral aspects while at the same time following a continuous improvement cycle, the model deviates from other techno-oriented or fragmented guidelines available on the subject. For the purpose of better understanding or providing practical applications, real-life case studies are also presented. Hence, the model provides useful guidelines for business organizations and other actors in the food supply chain to incorporate sustainability while minimizing environmental, social, and economic impacts of food losses/waste. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of integrating and coordinating supply chain business partners have been appreciated in many industries. In the global manufacturing industry, supply chain business partners' information integration is technically a daunting task due to highly disconnected infrastructures and operations. Information, software applications, and services are loosely distributed among participant business partners with heterogeneous operating infrastructures. A secure, and flexible information exchange architecture that can interconnect distributed information and share that information across global service provision applications is, therefore, immensely advantageous. This chapter describes the main features of an ontology-based web service framework for integrating distributed business processes in a global supply chain. A Scalable Web Service Discovery Framework (SWSDF) for material procurement systems of a manufacturing supply chain is described. Description Logic (DL) is used to represent and explain SWSDF. The framework uses a hybrid knowledge-based system, which consists of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR). SWSDF includes: (1) a collection of web service descriptions in Ontology Web Language-Based Service (OWL-S), (2) service advertisement using complex concepts, and (3) a service concept similarity assessment algorithm. Finally, a business scenario is used to demonstrate functionalities of the described system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A power supply is a device that supplies power to an electrical load. The primary function of a power supply is to convert electrical current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power a load. As power supply technology expands, the manual calibration process has become more complex and time consuming. On average, manual calibration time is approximately 1.5 to 2 hours per individual module, however when there are 6 modules installed on a main frame the total direct labor can easily balloon to 9 to 12 hours. The process described here is a step-by-step tutorial to set up a customizable automated system to calibrate a variety of power supplies, such as the Keysight XXXXX. At JPL, one of the most hardware intensive projects is MARS 2020. This program utilizes hundreds of power supplies in different test setups and test stations. As such, the Metrology &amp; Engineering Services Group was tasked to find a solution to calibrate the various types of power supplies in-house in a timely manner, as opposed to outsourcing or the conventional time-consuming manual method. Many OTC software options were identified and studied, however due to shortcoming in one form or another the OTC option was disqualified. At which point, the M&amp;ES team decided to develop its own Smart Calibration System with the explicit purpose of reducing turnaround time and establishing a measurement process complaint with ISO17025.</jats:p>"

The number of types of monitors installed at more than one water purification plant was 34. Chlorine, high sensitivity turbidity, pH, and turbidity monitors were (highly) recommended for installation in four water purification processes (rapid sand filtration, chlorination only, slow sand filtration and membrane treatment), except for high sensitivity turbidity of chlorination only. The number of installations of the monitors recommended and their installation points were dependent upon the processes. Highly recommended points of turbidity were raw water and sedimentation points, which were set for (critical) control points in water safety plans. That of high sensitivity turbidity was the rapid sand filtration point for confirmation of Cryptosporidium control. Chlorine monitors were applied for automatic control, regardless of the water purification processes. Some interesting monitors, such as those for musty odor compounds and trihalomethane, were newly developed and utilized. The results of this study showed that water quality monitors were important for water quality management systems based on water safety plans in Japan.</jats:p>",

It also examines how business has responded to the MSA. It concludes with some practical steps that business can take to address the risk of modern slavery in its supply chains. Among these are ensuring that top management is supportive of tackling modern slavery in the organisation and supply chains; understanding how these obligations fit within any wider mandatory or voluntary reporting undertaken by the business; putting policies in place; establishing robust due-diligence processes; mapping the supply and value chain of the business.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The adverse effects of climate change and climate variability have become some of the biggest environmental and socio-economic challenges for society, and for food supply chain actors, in particular. Serving as a serious inhibitor to the attainment of food security, climate change poses a fundamental threat to the availability, accessibility, stability and utilization of nutritious food and quality drinking water. The threat of this global phenomenon is not only apparent from the difficulties faced by all food supply chain actors, but is also felt acutely by households dependent on semi-subsistence agriculture. As evidenced by numerous studies conducted by the academic community, governmental and non-governmental organisations, climate change and climate variability will have disastrous effects on entire food supply chains across the world. \r\n\r\nThis edited volume looks to address: How vulnerable are food supply chain actors to climate change and climatic variability? What adaptation strategies are they adopting? How is the resilience of food supply chains being supported? Are they being financed and/or supported by international organizations to cope with climate change? And what governmental support are they receiving to help cope with climate change? \r\n\r\nThis book is an essential resource for students, lecturers, researchers, agribusinesses, marketing firms, agricultural institutions, climate change adaptation institutions, policymakers and many others with an interest in agricultural development and the global food industry.</jats:p>"

Aside from climate change, inequality and poverty remain the biggest crises of our age. While the top 1 per cent continues to make gains in their share of wealth, the number of low income people in precarious and insecure work is also increasing. In a unique approach that draws on legal sociology, political economy and regulatory studies, this book describes existing regulatory measures that have succeeded, but which have to date attracted little scholarly attention. It builds on these successful experiments to set out a vision for a new multi-level, international labour law that would increase minimum wages incrementally across all nations until they reach the level of a living wage.</jats:p>",

Any solution concern employee mobility or the use of mobile technology are due to growing market competition and constant search for new solutions that may enable the companies in the supply chain to be more efficient than the competition. In the supply chain the E-business creates for the companies new challenges they have to face. One of the possibilities to improve your business in the supply chain is to use virtual work. The new challenge facing the e-economy needs to be met. The aim of the article is to refer the virtual work, that is used by selected links in the supply chain to meet e-economy requirements, identify the key factors that characterize e-economy and refer them to the possibilities and benefits of using virtual work in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Supply chain firms rely on cloud system to share resources and to achieve integration through the Internet. Cloud systems could transform customer relationship and internal operation to achieve sustainable competitive advantages. Cloud services are providing the ability to share information to the supply chain at any time anywhere. This chapter explores the relationship between supply chain organization and cloud computing. This chapter also discusses the benefits and advantage to evaluate of cloud system in successful factors.</jats:p>"

I exploit the staggered nature of the recent German reform to extend school hours and assess whether or not gaining access to a full day school increases the likelihood that mothers enter into the labor market or extend their hours worked if already employed. I use the German Socio‐Economic Panel data set (GSOEP) and link it to a self‐collected school‐level data set with geographical information software (GIS). Using a flexible difference‐in‐difference approach in the estimation of linear probability and logit models, I find that the policy has a statistically significant effect of approximately five percentage points at the extensive margin, drawing more women into the labor market. I find no significant effect of the policy at the intensive margin; women who were already working do not extend their hours worked. This has implications for policies to extend the school day that do not correspond to the working day.</jats:p>",

This paper refines an instrument to empirically test the significance of the following drivers for participation in GSC initiatives: Government Regulation, Buyer/Supply Chain Influence, Internal Readiness, Competitive Advantage, and Corporate Social Responsibility. Corporate Social Responsibility emerged as the most significant variable that effected the decision making of the organizations around green supply chain management practices. Surprisingly, Competitive Advantage, which has been found to be a significant contributor in prior research when studied in isolation, did not emerge as a significant factor in this study. The emergent high correlation between the Corporate Social Responsibility and Competitive Advantage could imply that the Competitive Advantage could be embedded within the Corporate Social Responsibility when agencies focus on greening their supply chains. </jats:p>"

GSCM refers to the management of all activities involved in sourcing, purchasing, manufacturing, transportation and distribution of products and services to customers in an eco-friendly way (Sharma, 2013). A conceptual framework of GSCM is presented that consists of eco-friendly organizational culture, collaborative relationships, innovative products and eco-friendly processes (Mutingi, 2013). A SWOT analysis for context specific implementation strategies for global GSCM is presented (Lee and Chen, 2010). The contribution of GSCM practices to a firm's performance is discussed (Laisirihongthong et al., 2013). The critical success factors required to achieve GSCM include top management commitment, government regulations, environment protection literacy and compliance among the supply chain partners, and ISO14001 certification (Jain and Sharma, 2014). </jats:p>"

Chapter 10 concludes by recapping the overlapping dynamics of informalization that reoccurred in the case study chapters. These include: mass migration and circulation of labour within countries and between countries; large scale macro-economic and institutional liberalization; integration of previously separate economic systems as socialist and capitalist systems were combined following the fall of the Eastern bloc and the opening to global trade; new ways of organizing production resulting in the vertical disintegration of productive units (firms) and the expansion of supply chains; the explosion of new, non-employment forms of work; the complexity and scale of production outstripping national labour regulation systems; and lack of transnational orchestration in labour regulation resulting in gaps in the scale of labour regulation. The book concludes by imagining a future in which action is not taken to promote a global living wage.</jats:p>",

Logistics and later supply chain management discipline has gone through a number of changes in the last 50 years, namely transition among mass, lean, agile, resilient, and green. All of them are paradigm changes as each significantly reshapes the orientation of the discipline in the source of competitiveness, risk concern, customer services, productivity, process management, externalities, costs, and other aspects of the disciplines. The author presents findings gained in the exploration of these fundamental changes and provides a comparison with a previous change of paradigm. The chapter proposes a transformation that the company supply chain system has to go through to re-establish its competitive position at the time of Industry 4.0. The chapter provides a case study of 3PL perception of Industry 4.0 based on in-depth interviews conducted among the major global 3PLs operating in the Czech Republic. </jats:p>"

It explains how she survived the transition to a market economy by scrounging together informal work of various types. This book is centrally concerned with what regulatory strategies can best improve the working standards and lives of Elena and workers like her around the world. It goes without saying that employment creation policies and those that foster industrial growth are crucially important for improving Elena’s well-being. This book is not aimed at addressing these types of policies, however. It is concerned with the realm of regulation—hard laws, soft initiatives and other institutions that shape behaviour and set incentives in particular directions. The chapter describes the prevalence of informal, low paid work worldwide and defines core terms. It concludes by summarizing the outcome of the global search conducted in this book for realizable policy responses to this persistent problem.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The processes of globalization and increased competitiveness caused that the company have begun to look for solutions and strategies that give opportunities for development and further market expansion. The intensification of competition on the global scale in the 1980s, forced companies to offer low cost, high quality and robust products with greater design flexibility. Various management concepts have been used to improve production efficiency and speed up the cycle. In the 1990s, many manufacturers and service providers began to focus on improving collaboration with suppliers and improving purchasing and supply management. Initially the cooperation was mainly developed in the area of purchasing policies and supply management in factories, but as time went on, it became increasingly popular among wholesalers and retailers who also decided to integrate their transport and logistics functions in a supply chain with a view to gain competitive advantage (Choon T.). The increase in customer requirements with the same pressures to reduce costs and accelerate time service delivery resulted in the growing importance of planning and anticipation of future events. The increasing amount of data makes management depended on systems that allow for rapid decision-making. Apart from ERP systems, which mainly support the management of individual businesses, more and more companies invest in systems APS (Advanced Planning System), which provide better support in planning processes throughout the supply chain. The aim of the article is to present the idea of advanced supply chain planning, constraints and challenges facing the managing the flow of products and information. The study also addressed the role of Advanced Planning Systems in supply chain management and identify main problems and obstacles that users and decision makers come across while implementing and using IT systems.</jats:p>"

The supply chain risks are represented by any threatening event that may unexpectedly disrupt or restrict material flow, or directly stop the scheduled logistic or manufacturing activities. Supply chain risk management includes risk identification, analysis and implementation of measures against potential risk consequences. This article describes supply chain management, risk elimination methods in the case of a technological breakdown and potential subsequent supply chain failure and application of the modified Failure Mode, Effects &amp; Criticality Analysis (FMECA).</jats:p>",

During the recent discussions about integrating our country into the European Monetary Union, a money illusion was conceived without taking into the consideration the rational effects of this process into the savers of the economy. Beyond this illusion— after analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the unification process— this paper aims to look up into the main obstacles this process bears; for instance this article carefully observes the misalignment issue of inflation and exchange rate after the possible currency conversion in Albania. The main indicators on which our analysis is based are: money supply, interest rates, targeted inflation, GDP and velocity of money velocity. Further this paper aims to examine the relationship between money supply, GDP and targeted inflation. Based on this study we drive these following issues to a solution on the reference of Fisher’s Quantitative Theory of Money. Based on an empirical analysis, we expect to find a controversial behavior of money supply after the currency substitution. This research paper opens a new lieu of discussion in terms of academic and decision making debates.</jats:p>"

In economics, mobility is the ability of an individual or a group to improve their eco-nomic status in relation to income and wealth within their lifetime or between gen-erations. In information systems and computer science, mobility is used for the concept of mobile computing, in which a computer is transported by a person during normal use. Logistics creates by the design of logistics networks the infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods. Electric mobility is one of today’s solutions from an engineering perspective to reduce the need of energy resources and environmental impact. Moreover, for urban planning, mobility is the crunch question about how to optimise the different needs for mobility and how to link different transportation systems. In this publication we collected the ideas of practitioners, researchers, and govern-ment officials regarding the different modes of mobility in a globalised world, fo-cusing on both domestic and international issues.</jats:p>"

Modeling the complex systems in green supply chain can be hard in a computational utilization and inventory management of relationships exists. Two of the problems of IoT-enabled system are the lack of stable integrated architecture and autonomous mechanism. This paper proposes the intelligent IoT-enabled system in green supply chain using FCM and fuzzy QFD method. It aims to simulate complex system by linked physical and digital objects with relationships while enhancing decision-making performance efficiency for green inventory management. A case study and experiment evaluation of the proposed FCM approach on green supply chain is presented to provide some indication for work improvement. The experiment compares the total effects performance of the green inventory status as estimated by the two methods using the proposed IoT-enabled FCM and traditional FCM. </jats:p>"

More and more organizations have adopted cloud-based solutions to be their primary sourcing applications. Nevertheless, this technology is not without challenges, and in order to deploy and implement cloud-based solutions successfully with minimal risks organizations need to have practical guidance on this emerging technology. Despite the rapid growth of cloud computing in supply chain areas, the existing literature is still conceptual, inadequate, and mainly focused on the pre-adoption stage of this technology. This research examines the post-adoption stage of cloud-based supply chain solutions from the decision science perspective and intends to provide organizations with practical guidance on how to ensure the efficiency of a cloud-based supply chain system and control risks associated with cloud-based solutions.</jats:p>"

Existing literature related to green supply chain indicates that most of the scholarly works have been limited to the manufacturing context and retailing has not been paid enough attention. It signifies that integrating green policies into retail sector is a new potential area of research from academicians' and practitioners' point of view. This chapter discusses about the drivers, barriers, different dimensions, issues, existing environmental practices and policies adopted by leading retailers, future research avenues, different green polices adopted by various organizations and government bodies in the area of retailing. Thus it facilitates researchers, industry practitioners, policy makers to find the existing works, new research opportunities as well as to improve practices and policies. </jats:p>"

This paper develops a model that identifies the antecedents and outcomes associated with sustainable supply chain management linkage. The model starts by identifying two antecedents (internal and external orientation) that firms may adopt in order to cope with their sustainability goals. The hypotheses are tested based on the major survey data from 342 Taiwanese and Chinese public corporations. This study not only demonstrates that both the internal supply chain and external environmental orientation exert a positive on green SCM, sustainability orientation, and alliance performance, but also, more importantly, they delineate how green SCM is practiced. This study also sheds light on the role of a sustainable orientation in strategic supply chain alliance's performance, and builds a comprehensive conceptual framework that fills some key gaps in previous research. </jats:p>"

Companies and construction companies have recognized the concept of supply chain management as a way to reduce costs, improve production quality, shorten project execution time and increase scheduling flexibility. Construction Supply Chain (CSC) refers to the whole project. The links in this chain are the suppliers and recipients of raw materials, materials, machines and equipment, people (workers), money and technical documentation, as well as many different information and intangible assets that are necessary for the execution of works and structures. Well planned and developed logistics concepts and logistics management solutions provide the opportunity for efficient project execution and cost reduction related to logistics as well as total project cost. An important element in increasing the efficiency of the project is the proper coordination of the logistics processes of all its stakeholders at every stage of the investment cycle. High risk of construction investment, mortgage crisis and high customer demand - this is the real estate market nowadays. Looking for solutions, on the one hand minimizing the costs of contractors, on the other hand it is important to maintain the high quality of the product. Can CSCM be the answer to the current state of affairs?</jats:p>"

Using the case of PDW in Jakarta, Indonesia, we call for theorizing the politics of PDW through a situated Urban Political Ecology (UPE) analysis of the wider urban water distributions in which it is inserted. We do so in order to interrogate the unevenness of individual “choices” for securing safe drinking water, and highlight the ambiguity of PDW’s impact on inequalities in access. We first review research on PDW supply to specify how dominant theoretical approaches used for understanding PDW supply through analyses of the individual making “choices” for drinking water are power neutral, and why this matters for achieving equitable water access. We illustrate these points through a case study of PDW consumption by low income residents in Jakarta, and then identify how a situated UPE framework can help attend to the uneven societal relations shaping different socio-material conditions, within which individual “choices” for PDW are made. For Jakarta, connecting choices of the individual to power relations shaping geographies of urban water access and risk explains the rise in PDW consumption by low income residents as a situated response to the uneven exposure of poorer residents to environmental hazards. We conclude with reflections on how this can inform interventions towards more just distributions of safe drinking water.</jats:p>"

The problem with DHC systems is that increased conveyance power is required to provide heating to consumers. As one of the measures to solve this problem, Demand-Supply Coordinated (DSC) control is introduced; however, its effectiveness and limitations have not been clarified so far. In this paper, first, the fundamental characteristics of a DHC system under DSC control are numerically examined. The results showed that the conveyance power consumption of DHC systems under DSC control can be classified into three regions, depending on the relative rate of demand change against the load-following capability of the heat source. Next, the authors compared the conveyance power of DSC control with that of Constant Supply Pressure (CSP) control adopted in conventional DHC, and showed regularity for each of the three regions mentioned above. Finally, the authors show the appearance frequency of these three regions of the practical DHC system under a real heat load in Japan. The results showed that the conveyance power required for DSC control is markedly lower than that of CSP control.</jats:p>"

Informal work is understood in this study as a regulatory problem or conundrum. The chapter explores insights and concepts from the regulatory literature in order reflect upon the reason why labour regulation is failing so many workers around the world, leaving them stranded in a state of informality. The chapter proposes, first, that traditional state-based labour law is not responding to the various forms of work that have proliferated in recent years. Second, it is not responding to advances in the structures of production and relations of distribution that work occurs within. Third, it is not employing tools that are appropriate to or effective in regulating new working relationships. And fourth, it is not creating incentives for compliance which overcome the countervailing disincentives which arise from private and informal regulation, culture, and informal institutions. Having established the problem, it then draws on various literatures to set up the conceptual framework for examining how institutional change could occur so that a more responsive labour regulation could be generated.</jats:p>",

Literature-based interpretive structural modelling (ISM), a pairing of the systematic literature review (SLR) and ISM approaches, is proposed for investigating and identifying a set of key performance measures of resilience for supply chain (SC) management. In line with previous research, we identified and updated 13 key SC capabilities out of 24 as core performance measures of supply network resilience. Furthermore, our findings categorised each capability and element into one of four types of influential power variables (drivers, dependent, autonomous, or linkage). This study (i) lends support to and updates previous research that examined the core capabilities of SCRES and (ii) provides complementary classifications for the influential powers of SCRES capabilities and elements. The literature indicates that there has been no research that has integrated SLR as a basis to ISM for an effective way to utilize existing studies for increasing awareness and developing managerial guidelines to achieve SCRES.</jats:p>"

Wooden furniture is the most important component of China's furniture industry. Its capacity and scale have been expanding; however, the industry's income and profit growth rate have declined. China's wooden furniture industry is in a period of transition, and industry regulators, participants, and even investors need to understand the future development trends of the industry. This study collected time series data for annual sales as well as the value of output, exports, and imports of the wooden furniture industry in China and used the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict future market supply and demand. The study found that each figure will continue to grow over the next 5 years. However, the industry as a whole will face the challenge of oversupply. In addition, the domestic market share on behalf of industrial competitiveness will decline year by year. Through a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the changing trend of China's wooden furniture production and its domestic and foreign markets, this study is the first to predict the supply and demand of research, filling the gap in the research field of wooden furniture, and its research ideas have some innovation. It can provide a reference for industry regulators, enterprise decision makers, and domestic and foreign investors.</jats:p>"

The authors analyzed 30 interviews with young parents and childless couples, and also carried out a content analysis of 150 discussions on family forums and materials on websites promoting commercial services for families to identify the transfer of certain family functions to external paid experts. According to the results of the study, the authors conclude that most of all changes can be traced on the example of reproductive, educational, running the house, emotional and leisure functions. Special attention is paid to the institutionalization of the recreational function, in particular such aspect of it as holding children’s parties.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nHistorically LNG projects have been established to monetise large gas finds in remote areas with little existing gas demand. The development of gas supply to the LNG project generally stimulated demand growth in the domestic gas market. As the supplying fields depleted, the LNG projects faced competition with domestic producers for declining gas supplies, but this was late in the project life when LNG plant capital had already been recovered. Recently, LNG export projects have been established within existing mature gas markets, most notably in Australia and North America. These plants now face competition with domestic gas consumers for access to feed gas from the beginning of their operational life when strong revenue has the greatest impact on the return earned on capital invested, with the greatest stress felt in Australia. This paper considers the underlying causes of domestic price rises experienced in Australia following the start-up of LNG export supplied from gas fields linked to the domestic market and the response by both plant developers/operators and the government. This historical view is used to inform forecasts of how the east coast gas market will react to the interplay between domestic and LNG plant demand, declining Bass Strait production, maturing CSG operations, LNG imports and completion of the Northern Gas Pipeline. In particular the ability of gas supply and pipeline capacity to meet the strongly seasonal domestic demand in Victoria and to a lesser extent NSW will be examined, together with the linkage to counter-cyclical seasonal demand for LNG from the Queensland LNG export plants in the key north Asian markets.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The third step of distance protection is used as backup protection against phase-to-phase short circuits on 110–220 kV transmission lines. The main problem when using these protections on a line with several branches is to ensure the effectiveness of distant backup protection in case of phase-to-phase short circuits behind branch transformers of substations. The effective solution to distant backup protection is possible to provide by expanding the information base of protection. Currently, backup protection of lines with branches is being developed with control of currents and their components when using a communication channel, and based on algorithmic models of the facility. In this regard, the urgent task is to develop an algorithm for the distance protection ensuring the required sensibility during short circuits on the lower voltage side of the branch transformers. Analytical methods of determining the impedance measurement and simulation in Simulink and SimPowerSystems of the Matlab modeling system are used. The effectiveness of distant backup protection can be evaluated on the basis of recognition possibility of short circuit modes behind the branch transformers. Analytical expressions have been obtained to determine the impedance measurement during phase-to-phase short-circuits behind a branch transformer and under load conditions. Criteria have been developed to assess the proposed protection possibility to recognize the mode of phase-to-phase short circuits behind the branch transformer. Studies have shown that the main factor determining the possibility of mode recognition is the ratio between the protected transformer power and the total power of the branches loads. The use of several impedance measuring elements with their own response characteristics for branches with transformers of different capacities provides mode recognition for any possible correlation of power of branch substations. The use of the distance protection implementation option developed by the authors allows providing the required sensitivity for short circuits behind branch transformers and to solve the problem of distance backup line protection on a line with several branches. The reliability of the data obtained is confirmed by the correspondence of analytical research and simulation results.</jats:p>"

The budget, expenditures and deficit of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in the period 2010-2018 are analyzed. The amount of pensions was calculated taking into account the change in the dollar exchange rate and the inflation rate for the analyzed period and it was proved that the increase in the size of the pension does not lead to its actual growth. Emphasis is placed on the principle of calculation of pensions and attention is paid to the concept of a single social contribution, which has the minimum and maximum possible sum of payment. Based on the data, the author compared the size of the minimum (state) pensions in different countries of the world and in Ukraine and showed that the size of the pension is the lowest among the compared countries. An important aspect of the study was the comparison of average life expectancy. This suggests that the increase in life expectancy is causing the states of the world to raise the retirement age in order to delay the payment of state pensions. Alongside this the alternative to state pensions are private pensions. During the working period, every citizen has the right to make savings in different financial institutions as they have the right to invest. Funds that have been saved and multiplied are the main source of retirement income. Voluntary pension institutions are also envisaged in Ukraine. However, despite the legislative support and the general need to have their own retirement savings, citizens do not actively take the opportunity to create additional pensions. The reasons for this are lack of awareness of the population by the state about the essence of the pension reform, the general economic situation in the country, as well as the lack of financial literacy of the population itself, the unwillingness to take responsibility for their future and the low level of income. On the basis of these data, the need for active involvement of both public administration and citizens in the cumulative system is substantiated.\nKeywords:\nretirement age, pension fund, cumulative insurance, life insurance companies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Charged System Search (CSS) metaheuristic algorithm is introduced to the field of water resources management and applied to derive water-supply and hydro-power operating policies for a large-scale real-world reservoir system. The optimum algorithm parameters for each reservoir operation problems are also obtained via a tuning procedure. The CSS algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the governing laws of electrostatics in physics and motion from the Newtonian mechanics. In this study, the CSS algorithm’s performance has been tested with benchmark problems, consisting of highly non-linear constrained and/or unconstrained real-valued mathematical models, such as the Ackley’s function and Fletcher–Powell function. The CSS algorithm is then used to optimally solve the water-supply and hydropower operation of “Dez” reservoir in southern Iran over three different operation periods of 60, 240, and 480 months, and the results are presented and compared with those obtained by other available optimization approaches including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Constrained Big Bang–Big Crunch (CBB–BC) algorithm, as well as those obtained by gradient-based Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach. The results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the CSS algorithm in solving long term reservoir operation problems, compared to alternative methods. The CSS algorithm is used for the first time in the field of water resources management, and proves to be a robust, accurate, and fast convergent method in handling complex problems in this filed. The application of this approach in other water management problems such as multi-reservoir operation and conjunctive surface/ground water resources management remains to be studied.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The article provides a discussion on freight transport planning. The existing solutions applied in this sphere have been compared with environment-related needs. The concept which has been proposed involves a dedicated travel planner that takes some additional non-standard criteria into consideration. At the same time, the authors have highlighted the necessity to expand the algorithms being applied and to address the comprehensive nature of the problem. However, it is the first and last mile section of supply chains on which the article focuses. The planner described in the paper is being developed as a part of an integrated platform implemented under the international S-mile project. Research methodology: The solutions proposed for transport planning purposes include application of ICT. A review of the available solutions has made it possible to indicate one of the planner currently in use as the foundation upon which a more advanced freight transport planning tool dedicated to the first/last mile section can be built. The planner requires application of several optimisation algorithms, including those which consider route parameters, the selection of fleet vehicles available for the given task, cargo distribution over the vehicle etc. The article defines primary as well as secondary criteria that such a planner should take into account, including the environmental ones. What the authors have also highlighted is the possibility to make use of open data sources. The approach they have proposed makes it possible to raise the level of environmental awareness at the first and the last mile management stage, and since multiple transport aspects have been addressed, it also increases planning efficiency. Goals: The purpose of the article has been to discuss an eco-friendly solution which may limit the negative environmental impact of transport. Conclusions: The solution described in the paper may change the manner in which freight transport is managed in cities. Taking environmental criteria into consideration makes it possible to reduce the negative environmental impact of transport. Planning of freight transport requires that far more criteria should be taken into account compared to route planning for the travelling population. A comprehensive fleet management platform featuring a planning module combined with other modules of the S-mileSys system being currently developed is also aimed at integration of large freight companies with the carriers that service first and last miles.</jats:p>"

Most of these environmental criteria are either synergies (non-trade-offs) or compromises (trade-offs) within environmental metrics. This forms a multi-objective problem of supply chain network design. The product environmental footprint is an aid or tool that enterprises may use to measure and improve the life cycle environmental performance of their products. In this research, a multi-criteria method, Pareto optimization, is used to design a supply chain network based on the results of a product environmental footprint. In Pareto optimization, two objectives are formulated: Environmental impact and cost. Using the results of this research, designers will be able to choose a material with a lower environmental impact and supply chain managers will be able to select suppliers with lower environmental impacts. A case study of industry practice is also analyzed. It shows an environmental footprint is useful for the supply chain design network.</jats:p>"

Supplementing these concepts with the fundamental questions on the meaning of ‘what a moral supply chain is’ and ‘what moral supply chain ought to be,’ we develop some descriptive and normative propositions for management education on the ethics of supply chains. Against a descriptive viewpoint, we propose that judgments on the morality of supply chains should be viewed from multiple perspectives, often conflicting.

Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand, based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050. We expand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and, in specific cases, resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals.</jats:p>"

Backup sourcing is one of the most commonly used strategies to mitigate the adverse consequences of supply risks. In this paper, we study a procurement strategy with backup sourcing when a manufacturer faces stochastic supply risk and demand. The optimal decisions of the players involved are investigated theoretically using the game theoretic framework, and the impacts of the key parameters, such as wholesale prices and the risk probability, are assessed numerically under supply information symmetry and asymmetry. The results illustrate that the reservation price provided by the backup supplier varies greatly under different information‐sharing conditions. Reservation quantity is negatively correlated with the reservation price, which is affected by the risk probability, wholesale prices, and marginal cost of the backup supplier. We also show that given the same wholesale prices, the potential supply risk has a substantial impact on the manufacturer’s expected profit, and the performance of the manufacturer under asymmetrical supply information is not always better than that under symmetrical information. In addition, we also discuss the impact of wholesale prices on reservation price and participants’ profits based on numerical examples. The research enriches the understanding of a procurement strategy under stochastic supply risk, and the conclusions have certain management significance.</jats:p>",

Three questions will be investigated in relation to this issue: 1) Which MCDM techniques were prevalently applied in GSCM literature? 2) Which MCDM techniques have been overlooked in GSCM literature? 3) What are the major application areas of MCDM techniques in GSCM practices? To this aim, literature is reviewed between the period of 2008 and the first half of 2016. In total, ninety eight journal articles were examined. Consequently, this paper represents a detailed picture of application areas of MCDM techniques in GSCM practices and can definitely give a blueprint to researches in solving multiple objective problems effectively in the area of GSCM. </jats:p>"

This study explores the impact of partnership orientation on partnership commitment and firm performance using a model based on social capital theory and resource dependence theory. It aims to understand the appropriate partnership orientation for the desired level of commitment and firm performance, including innovation, operational, and financial performance. Using a survey of 423 respondents representing three different partnership structure types (supplier, buyer, and parallel-aligned firms’ perspectives), the relationship between partnership orientation and commitment in enhancing firm performance is investigated using structural equation modeling. Additional analysis identifies the moderating role of commitment and investment exchange on performance. The findings show that positive relationships between both investment and contractual-based partnership orientation positively contribute to partnership commitment, but the direct association between partnership commitment and firm performance type varies by partnership structure. Furthermore, (i) investment exchange level moderates the relationship between commitment and innovation and operational performance regardless of partnership structure type, (ii) negative investment exchange signals higher firm performance from the buyer firm’s perspective, and (iii) positive investment exchange is absolutely necessary for financial performance from the supplier firm’s perspective.</jats:p>"

Further investigation was done to understand the role of big data and predictive analysis (BDPA) in managing the supply uncertainties. The paper finally uses partial least square regression analysis to study the relationship among buyer-supplier relationship, big data and predictive analysis and supply chain performance. The analysis supported the second and third hypothesis. Therefore, it is established that firstly, there is a positive relationship between big data, predictive analysis and supply chain performance and secondly, there is a positive relationship between and big data, predictive analysis and buyer-supplier relationship. The study is a unique contribution to the current literature by shedding light on the practical problems persisting in the South African context. </jats:p>"

It was an entrenched feature of the Bulgarian economy. The aim of this chapter is, first, to track the way that national and international factors converged in the 1990s to create dramatic social change, leaving at least a third of the working population in Bulgaria stranded in informality. It is, second, to assess the expansion of the contract of employment as a means to achieve formalisation. In 2011, Bulgaria’s labour law underwent reform, following a successful campaign for the extension of employment laws to cover home-based workers. The state’s expansion of employment law was in part, a reflection of Bulgaria’s desire to demonstrate adherence with European Union (EU) recommendations as part of its integration into the EU.</jats:p>",

It is believed that by utilizing wood residuals produced from sawmill operations, a stable source of revenue could be provided to local wood processing businesses while simultaneously providing clean energy to the region. In order to evaluate the amount of available material available for energy production, all known mills were surveyed within the 16-county study region for their annual production of sawdust, slabs, and other residual products. Data on production of residuals were developed into supply curves and equations. Supply was found to be inelastic for both hardwood and softwood mill residuals in the region. Given that residual production is a secondary effect of timber processing, supply inelasticity is expected. Increasing the quantity of mill residuals in the region will likely be accompanied by greater-than-proportional price increases. We determined that 96,744 tons of ovendried material would be available annually for purchases at a delivered price of $38 per ton. With this quantity, the region could be expected to support a small combined heat and power energy facility with output between 5 and 10 MW.</jats:p>"

In a tough competitive environment, you can survive and develop only by orienting your business activities to a logistic approach. The gold mining industry plays a key role in the global economy. This industry has a high asset value, large-scale production lines and large infrastructure. One of the main tasks of strategic planning of gold mining enterprises is the choice of a rational marketing system. Planning and selection of schemes for the supply of precious metals is an important condition for the effective functioning of the marketing activities of gold mining enterprises. For these purposes, the need for improving logistics flows and creating an information system for sales planning is growing. The article explores the planning and selection of precious metals supply schemes using the example of PJSC “Vysochaishy”. Much attention paid to the construction of the company’s logistics flows. The main problems in the supply chain of PJSC “Vysochaishy” are identify. The algorithm of the process of introducing a new supply chain planning system for Vysochaishy PJSC is considered, and an improved strategic planning process for PJSC “Vysochaishy” is present. A new scheme of operation of the transport and logistics system for the direction of logistics flows of PJSC “Vysochaishy” proposed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii is a pre-eminent commodity in the field of marine and fisheries Indonesia which has been widely cultivated in coastal waters. Currently, the main problem faced by the cultivators is the limited stock of seeds, both in terms of quality and quantity. Selection is one method that is expected to increase the rate of seaweed growth quickly, cheap, easy, bulk, and sustainable.This study aims to determine the effect of selection on the growth of seaweed so that it can be done superior seed production for cultivation purposes. Seaweed cultivation was done in Kulu Village, Wori District, North Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi by using long line method in April-June 2015. Selection is based on the daily growth rate parameter (DGR) and the selection method refers to the selection protocol that has been developed on K. alvarezii seaweed. Results showed that DGR of selection seedlings were higher (P &lt;0.05) compared to controls, in which DGR of selection reached 5.87%/day, while DGR of control was 1.89%/day. From three seed production cycles (G-1 - G-3), the average DGR resulted from the selection was 5.53%/day and control 2.19%/day. Carrageenan content of selection result is relatively higher (47.66%) than control (31.28%) with mean for three cycle (G-1 - G-3) that is 43.55% for selection and 33.20% for control. Water quality (temperature, salinity, nitrate, phosphate) during the study is still within the appropriate range for seaweed growth. Therefore it is concluded that with the application of the method of seaweed selection can increase the daily growth rate and carrageenan content of seaweed K. alvarezii which directly affects the increase of production both in quantity and quality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchains are attracting the attention of stakeholders in many industrial domains, including the logistics and supply chain industries. Blockchain technology can effectively contribute in recording every single asset throughout its flow on the supply chain, contribute in tracking orders, receipts, and payments, while track digital assets such as warranties and licenses in a unified and transparent way. The paper provides, through its methodology, a detailed analysis of the blockchain fit in the supply chain industry. It defines the specific elements of blockchain that affect supply chain such as scalability, performance, consensus mechanism, privacy considerations, location proof and cost, and details on the impact that blockchains will have in disrupting the supply chain industry. Discussing the tradeoff between consensus cost, throughput and validation time it proceeds with a suggested high-level architectural approach, and concludes as a result with a discussion on changes needed and challenges faced for an in-vivo deployment of blockchains in the supply chain industry. While the technological features of modern blockchains can effectively facilitate supply chain uses cases, the various challenges that still remain, bring in front of us a wide set of needed changes and further research efforts for achieving a global, production level blockchain for the supply chain industry.</jats:p>"

Fungsi mineral bagi tubuh adalah sebagai pendukung metabolisme tubuh, mengatur keseimbangan kadar air, dan untuk menjaga kesehatan tubuh. Dari sekian banyak mineral yang dibutuhkan yang akan menjadi bahasan dalam penelitian ini hanya kebutuhan mineral jenis Kalsium, Natrium, Kalium, Iodium dan besi. Â Kebutuhan mineral tersebut berbeda beda pada masing masing orang sesuai dengan umur, jenis kelamin, fisikologis dan riwayat penyakit. Pada rumah sakit untuk memenuhi kebutuhan mineral pada pasien dapat dilakukanÂ  dengan cara memberikan obat obatan tertentu serta melalui makanan. Pada sebuah rumah sakit, orang yang pakar dalam menentukan kebutuhan mineral dalam tubuh seorang pasien adalah dokter dan ahli gizi. Dokter akan memberikan obat tertentu untuk pasien, sedangkan ahli gizi akan mengatur makanan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan mineral pasien dengan memperhatikan kondisi dan jenis penyakit pasien. Pembuatan Sistem Deteksi Kondisi Supply dan Kebutuhan Mineral Pada Tubuh dapat digunakan oleh pihak rumah sakit untuk membantu ahli gizi dalam menetapkanÂ  makanan yang cocok untuk diberikan kepada pasien yang memenuhi kebutuhan mineral serta tidak bertentangan dengan penyakit yang dideritanya. Dengan adanya sistim ini diharapkan beban kerja ahli gizi rumah sakit bisa terbantu. Aplikasi yang dikembangkan ini bertujuan untuk menentukan kondisi mineralÂ  pada tubuh mulai umur 19 tahun dengan hanya memperhatikan gejala-gejala yang dialami. Penelitian dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode Certanty Factor (CF), didapatkan nilai kemungkinan kondisi mineral tubuhÂ  yang dialami pasien.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The logistics network in the oil industry is highly inflexible, which arises from the production capabilities of crude oil suppliers, long transportation lead times, and the limitations of modes of transportation and energy planning and management. The paper considers the key factors for reducing costs and increasing the company’s profits in managing supply chains: demand management, efficient distribution of petroleum products among customers, better transportation scheduling, warehouse management, and quality and timeliness of information through the automation of the supply chain. And this principle is carried out within the framework of the logistics concept of supply chain coordination - Supply Chain Management. The paper also considers advantages from implementation of supply-chain management. Implementation of supply-chain management in the oil industry can help to reduce costs, increase the company’s profits in managing supply, and manage the planning of deliveries.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, matching properly the emission spectra of UV-LEDs and the spectral sensitivity of microorganisms is a reasonable strategy to enhance inactivation. In this study, UV-LEDs with nominal peak emissions at 265, 280 and 300 nm were applied to pathogens including Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and feline calicivirus, in comparison with indicator species including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis spores, bacteriophage Qβ and MS2. The results indicated that, for all species tested, 265 nm UV-LED was highest in the fluence-based inactivation rate constant k, followed by 280 nm and 300 nm was much lower. The k value at 280 nm was close to that at 265 nm for feline calicivirus and MS2, suggesting that 280 nm UV-LED can be as good an option as 265 nm UV-LED to inactivate these viruses. Bacteria tended to show fluence-response curves with shoulder and tailing, while viruses followed log-linear profiles at all wavelengths tested. This study indicates the fluence-response profiles and the fluence required for a target inactivation of microorganisms, which would serve as reference data for future study and applications of UV-LEDs.</jats:p>",

I elucidate the key interactions between supply and demand that generate macroeconomic problems and lack of affordability, and emphasize the distinction between short run and long run housing supply. My main conclusions are not new: policymakers should be aware of the Tinbergen rule. We should use multiple tools to address the multiple problems arising from housing markets. By solely focusing on one dimension we may miss big on all objectives. I argue that countercyclical supply-side policies are particularly damaging, and advocate the use of better data-driven mortgage underwriting models that go beyond mark-to-market and try to forecast future equilibrium prices. Finally, I make an argument for a return to ambitious master-planned city building endeavors in our most expensive cities.</jats:p>"

Oilseeds are the second most important agricultural economy in India next to cereals growing at a pace of 4.1% per annum in the last three decades. Oilseed brassica shares 23.5% area and 24.2% production of total oilseeds in the country. Despite being the third largest producer (11.3%) of oilseed brassica after Canada and China in the world, India meets 57% of the domestic edible oil requirements through imports and ranked 7th largest importer of edible oils in the world. Oilseed brassica achieved significant growth in India in the past, however, the productivity levels are still low owing to large cultivation under rainfed situation, biotic and abiotic stresses, and resources crunch. It is also facing the challenges of low genotypic potential, climate change and price fluctuation. Though, it embraces the immense scope to increase the production in traditional and non-traditional areas in India with proper inputs, technological interventions, and suitable policy framework. This needs to develop strategies in a well-planned, targeted manner with multi-scientific inputs, policy interface and stable price systems to bring the desired growth in oilseeds brassica production, and to reduce the import of edible oils in the country.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this article is to analyze the agricultural sector of Ukraine and to determine the importance of supply chains for industry efficiency increasing.\nAs a result of the study, the main indicators of the agricultural sector functioning in Ukraine were analyzed. The obtained results make it possible to characterize the burning situation, as well as to develop appropriate proposals for its improvement in the future (taking into account marketing and logistical components). Almost 18% of the able-bodied population of Ukraine were employed in the agriculture sector in 2016. At the same time, the largest share of agricultural enterprises is located in three regions of Ukraine – Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Mykolaiv.\nIt is determined that in 2007-2016 there is a steady increase in agricultural production. It is enough to meet the internal needs of the population and export needs. It is proved that the basis of Ukrainian exports is primary agricultural products (wheat, corn, soybeans). Despite the gradual increase in food exports (by 16% from 2010 to 2016), the share of value-added goods in exports remains low. It indicates Ukraine's specialization as a supplier of raw materials on the world market.\nBesides, it is found that the share of imports for agriculture needs remains high. Mainly mineral fertilizers, agricultural machines, petroleum products are imported. The reason is that the need for these things is not fully met by domestic producers. Accordingly, it is determined that all the above requires the formation of internal supply chains of agricultural enterprises (they allow to establish relations between structural units) as well as external supply chains (they allow to establish partnerships with counterparties in Ukraine and abroad).\nIt is established that in the supply chains’ formation it is necessary to take into account the main problems of the agricultural sector, in particular, the involvement of new producers of agricultural products in export activities; increasing the share of value-added products in exports; coverage of new markets in foreign countries. The solution to these problems is crucial for the country too.\nKeywords:\nagriculture, import, export, supply chain, industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Due to changes in forest management in various European countries, hardwood forest areas and amounts will increase. Sustainable and individual utilization concepts have to be developed for the upcoming available resource. Studies conclude that there is low potential for hardwoods in the traditional appearance market thus the application areas have to be extended to new structural innovative products. This paper examines the extension to a future laminated beech wood supply network which would be a combination of already existing and new production facilities. For a better future use of hardwood raw materials it is necessary to consider the entire supply chain. This also better shows a total hardwood value chain. Therefore, this paper provides data to the solid hardwood business and develops a mixed integer linear programming to design a laminated beech wood supply network. The model is applied to Austria as the sample region. It covers the important strategic decisions where to locate a downstream facility within the existing production network with the lowest supply network cost. Fourteen scenarios are developed to examine various future network configurations. Results about optimal material flows and used sawmills as well as downstream production facilities are presented in form of material and financial performances. Two optimal laminated beech production locations are determined by the calculated scenarios results, and the impact of a new sawmill is analyzed which is focused on beech.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy supply sustainability is an important issue in the field of energy security. To successfully achieve the goals of sustainable economic and social development and to implement the “Paris Agreement”, we need to accurately evaluate and predict the energy supply sustainability of countries or regions. However, it is very difficult to evaluate and predict energy supply sustainability, because it belongs to a complex multi-attribute decision-making problem. This paper proffered a new definition of the energy supply sustainability in China and put forward sixteen indicators for it from the four dimensions of energy availability, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and technical sustainability. First, the energy supply sustainability index (ESSI) was quantified by a comprehensive evaluation method. Secondly, based on the exponential smoothing and GM(1,1) prediction models, two ideas were put forward to predict the sustainable level of China’s energy supply, enriching the theoretical study of energy security prediction. The study found that: (1) China’s energy supply sustainability index changes dynamically; it has an asymmetric “W” trend from 2000 to 2016. The energy supply sustainability level of China is low; it cannot satisfy the Chinese people’s need for high-quality eco-energy products or the needs of social sustainable development. The three indicators of reserve and production ratio, production diversity and clean power generation are very important to China’s energy supply sustainability. (2) Referring to the accuracy criteria, the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the Exponential smoothing-GM(1,1) hybrid model for forecasting China’s energy supply sustainability is only 2%, and the Root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0278; therefore, it is suitable for use in the forecasting of the energy supply sustainability level in China. (3) In the short term, from 2017 to 2020, many unsustainable factors remain within China’s energy supply, and the sustainable level is level II. In the long term, the sustainable level of China’s energy supply will be greatly improved and will increase to 0.8765 by 2030, attaining a sustainable level. However, China remains far behind other countries, with high levels of energy sustainability and energy security in the world.</jats:p>"

Restricted supply will typically make quantities, which determine construction employment, less volatile, and prices, which determine financial stability, more volatile. A prominent exception occurs when supply-unconstrained areas build so much during a boom that construction halts during the bust, and in that case, elastic supply can be associated with both price volatility and a limited ability to use credit instruments to boost employment during a bust. As institutions with counter-cyclical missions grapple with housing policies, they must recognize that housing regulation interacts with monetary policy, and that reforming housing policy may have implications for the business cycle.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, in 110–220 kV transmission lines the problem of interphase short-circuits in the long-distance backup protection zone, in most cases, is solved by a backup level of current or distance protection. The existing protection solutions for lines with branching are based on the use of special high-voltage equipment, various current components and their ratios, a virtual resistance relay; on the control of emergency and orthogonal current components with adaptive braking and signal correction as well as with correction of the response characteristics according to the data on the voltage change and the state of the switching devices of the main substation. A number of developments are aimed at increasing the sensitivity of back-up protection of branch substations by changing the connection circuit, improving the response characteristics and refining the method for selecting the settings. However, these protection solutions in many cases do not provide the required sensitivity during short circuits on the low voltage side of a low-power branch transformer. All this means that an urgent problem to be solved is developing an algorithm for the operation of backup protection, providing the required sensitivity to short circuits on the low voltage side of the branch transformer. Analytical methods and simulation in the Simulink and SimPowerSystems packages of the Matlab modeling system were used to determine the impedance measurement of the distance protection measuring element. A mathematical model of the lumped-parameter line was used. When deriving analytical expressions, the impedances of the positive and negative sequences were assumed to be equal. Analytical expressions were obtained for determining the impedance measurement of the proposed and existing distance protection during phase-to-phase short-circuits appearing after a branch transformer and under load conditions. The studies have shown that the proposed distance protection has the required sensitivity to short circuits on the low voltage side of the branch transformer and the necessary detuning from load modes. The characteristics and methods for selecting response parameters of the additional stage of distance protection were determined using information on the currents of the line supply ends. The use of an additional distance protection stage developed by the authors based on the sum of currents of the line supply ends can ensure the required sensitivity to phase-to-phase short circuits on the low voltage side of the branch transformer with a star-delta connection circuit and solve the problem of distant backup protection of low power branch substations. The reliability of the data obtained is confirmed by the correspondence of the results of the analytical research and simulation modeling.</jats:p>"

Nerlovian Partial Adjustment Model was used to analyze the supply response. In the acreage response model, lag maize area and lag maize price were found to be positively 1 per cent and 5 per cent significant with the current maize acreage respectively. If lag maize area and lag maize price is increased by one per cent, it will lead to an increase of about 0.59 per cent and 0.96 per cent of current maize acreage respectively. In the yield response model, lag maize yield and lag maize price were found to be significant with the current maize yield. In the production response model, lag own price was found to be significant with the current maize production.</jats:p>"

As one of the worlds largest Electronic Manufacturing Service companies, Jabil prides itself with understanding logistics, compliance, and operations competencies to support the growth of current and future business, all while mitigating and avoiding potential risks in the market. With the impact of the imposed tariffs beginning to affect John’s business, he knew that he needed to make a quick decision; either move operations out of China to a non-sanctioned country, continue the operations in China with the hope that the sanctions would end but risk customer satisfaction, or continue manufacturing the products in China and shipping the incomplete goods to another non-sanctioned location for final assembly, ultimately avoiding the tariff impacts. How was John expected to make this decision without understanding the trade uncertainties in the future? John knew that he needed to make his business profitable for him and the customer, but what approach did he need to execute on to keep the business sustainable?

Firms have responded by increasing and improving product traceability throughout their global supply. Traceability is a significant benefit to firms. Areas affected include quality control and product safety, tracking product recalls, and reverse logistics. Research does exist on the importance and benefits of implementing traceability initiatives but in very targeted areas. In addition, missing from the literature is the important discussion of what factors predicate firms to implement traceability initiatives beyond those prescribed by law and how industries other than very specific categories, create and implement effective traceability initiatives throughout the supply chain. In turn, the purpose of this research is to investigate traceability to gain greater understanding of why firms implement traceability &amp; what actions or initiatives lead to greater traceability effectiveness.</jats:p>",

To achieve this objective, a qualitative research approach was used. The data gathered for the study was examined by document analysis. The strategic analysis of Cargolux Airlines International was underpinned using Porter’s Five Forces Model. The study found that Cargolux has developed an extensive portfolio of products that satisfy discrete air cargo market segments’ requirements. The airline has also entered strategic partnership agreements with Emirates SkyCargo, Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA), and Oman Air, which has enabled the partners to expand their route networks and to better optimize their available air cargo capacities. Cargolux has also established Milan-based Cargo Italia, which focuses on serving the important Italian air cargo market. The airline has also developed a successful two hub strategy in conjunction with one of its major shareholders, Henan Civil Aviation and Investment Company (HNCA). In 2017, Cargolux commenced a journey of transformation with the introduction of the “Cargolux 2025 Strategy”. A limitation of the study was that Cargolux’s annual revenues were not available. It was, therefore, not possible to analyze the airline’s revenue performance.</jats:p>"

This assumption can be excluded in the case of the functioning of the disposition system, carried out taking into account large contracts with the supplier. Optimization in this situation does not apply to the quantity in the contract, but only to a single call, which is information for the supplier who must deliver a certain amount of goods and at the same time reduce the balance appearing in the contract.</jats:p>"

Rumen models have been developed over the past several decades in an effort to better predict metabolisable protein supply for ration formulation for ruminants. These models have both empirical and mechanistic components. Separation of dietary protein into fractions that include non-protein nitrogen, true protein and unavailable protein has been a fundamental element of these models. Ruminal degradation of one or more true protein fractions is then estimated on the basis of the kinetics of digestion and passage. Some models use the same method to predict substrate supply for microbial protein production. Although mechanistic models have been extensively used in diet-formulation programs worldwide, their ability to improve accuracy of prediction of metabolisable protein over simpler empirical models is questionable. This article will address the potential of mechanistic models to better predict metabolisable protein supply in ruminants as well as their limitations.</jats:p>"

Thus, security of supply is an important part in EU energy politics based on competitiveness and sustainability. In the case of regional cooperation with Central Asia, EU is trying to be self-sufficient for its internal market to build its future safe in energy. Thus, security on energy supply becomes on the fore. So, EU, as a prominent actor in global political system, has growing interest on Central Asian states because of their high energy potential.

Meanwhile, some relevant sub-criteria are included as well. Based on existing literature review and managerial interviews obtained from leaders in the southern region of India, these issues are compared and ranked. In this chapter, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted to identify the importance of these considered criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, the chapter concludes with a presentation of rankings and priorities of the proposed seven criteria. Given the obtained results and recommendations, it would be helpful to establish a useful method for selecting the best supplier based on CSR. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A better design of gas supply chains may lead to a more efficient use of locally available resources, cost savings, higher energy efficiency and lower impact on the environment. In optimizing the supply chain of liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG) or biogas for smaller regions, the task is to find the best supplier and the most efficient way to transport the gas to the customers to cover their demands, including the design of pipeline networks, truck transportation and storage systems. The analysis also has to consider supporting facilities, such as gasification units, truck loading lines and CNG tanking and filling stations. In this work a mathematical model of a gas supply chain is developed, where gas may be supplied by pipeline, as compressed gas in containers or as LNG by tank trucks, with the goal to find the solution that corresponds to lowest overall costs. In order to efficiently solve the combinatorial optimization problem, it is linearized and tacked by mixed integer linear programming. The resulting model is flexible and can easily be adapted to tackle local supply chain problems with multiple gas sources and distributed consumers of very different energy demands. The model is illustrated by applying it on a local gas distribution problem in western Finland. The dependence of the optimal supply chain on the conditions is demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis, which reveals how the model can be used to evaluate different aspects of the resulting supply chains.</jats:p>"

This assumption can be excluded in the case of the functioning of the disposition system, carried out taking into account large contracts with the supplier. Optimization in this situation does not apply to the quantity in the contract, but only to a single call, which is information for the supplier who must deliver a certain amount of goods and at the same time reduce the balance appearing in the contract.</jats:p>"

The selection of respondents used the purposive sampling and snowball sampling method. Result shows that the R / C ratio of farmers is lower than that of traders. The R/C ratio received by farmers is 1,48, while that received by traders is 2,64. The average Farmer Share (41,2%) is lower than the seller share (58,8%). The average marketing margin is Rp 14,576.5. The supply chain that take side to farmers regarding to the value of R/C, the total margin and the farmer's share value are found in potato commodities because it has a higher R / C ratio than traders, higher farmer shares than traders, and trading margin that lower than the three other commodities compared</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conservation of natural resources in order to protect the environment, support the economy, and offer a better life to living beings has become an urgent need of modern business so that future generations can survive within available resources and in a healthy environment. Recycling of used products plays an important role in the conservation of natural resources and the development of sustainable business for deteriorating products because the number of these items increases with time, which creates economic loss and environmental pollution. This paper considers the production and cycle time as decision variables to design a forward and reverse supply chain system that produces two different types of products, which are subject to deterioration. Rate of deterioration is time-varying and depends on the maximum lifetime of products. Used products of a forward supply chain are collected and treated as raw materials in a reverse supply chain to produce other products. The system involves three types of inventory stocks,<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic>, product 1, 2, and returned inventory. The objective of this research is to minimize total cost per unit time for two types of systems, one in which products of both the supply chains deteriorate and the second in which the products of the first supply chain deteriorate. Kuhn−Tucker method is employed to solve the model and a solution algorithm is proposed to obtain optimal solution. Application of the model is supported with numerical examples and sensitivity analysis. Some managerial insights are provided to help managers while applying the proposed models in real situations. Results of numerical experiments suggest for deteriorating products to plan short replenishment cycles of inventory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Multiphase (more than three) power system has gained popularity due to their inherent advantages when compared to three-phase counterpart. Multiphase power supply is extensively used in AC/DC multi-pulse converters, especially supply with multiple of three-phases. AC/DC converter with multi-pulse input is a popular solution to reduce the ripple in the DC output. Single-phase and three-phase transformers and phase transformation from single to multiphase are employed in variable speed drives application to feed the multi-cell H-Bridge converters and multi-pulse AC-DC converters. Six-phase system is extensively discussed in the literature for numerous applications ranging from variable speed drives to multiphase wind energy generation system. This paper shows the systematic phase transformation technique from three-phase to six-phase (both symmetrical and asymmetrical) for both understanding and teaching purposes. Such an approach could help students understand a promising advanced concept in their undergraduate courses. When phase difference between the two consecutive phases of six phases has a phase difference of 60°, it is called a symmetrical six-phase system; while an asymmetrical or quasi, six-phase has two set of three-phase with a phase shift of 30° between the two sets. Simulation and experimental results are also presented.</jats:p>"

The work normally consists of loading, unloading, carrying, shifting, weighing, tapping, and stacking goods. This is harsh physical labour, often undertaken in extreme heat. Following a concerted campaign in the 1960s, a tripartite regulatory system was introduced to overcome many of the problems historically faced by the mathadi workers, such as a lack of job security and access to social security. The study is a fruitful site of regulatory learning because India’s legislatures have been more active in regulating informal work, particularly in the domain of providing social security, than perhaps anywhere else in the world. The Indian state has used various mechanism to do this, the best-documented of which are the Welfare Boards of Kerala. In contrast to the Welfare Boards, there is very little written about the Mathadi Boards of Maharashtra, which have a broader regulatory reach and have arguably been far more successful.</jats:p>",

This chapter tracks the informalization of apparel production in Australia throughout the 1980s and 1990s, asking how national and international factors converged to leave a migrant group stranded, without the employment conditions and protections that Australia prided itself on providing to its working population. It then examines the subsequent attempts to re-formalize work by the creation of innovative legislation and ethical initiatives that add levers and regulatory agents. This study is important because Australia’s novel regulation combines market and non-market forms of regulation, with a successful ethical labelling system at the heart of the model.</jats:p>",

Mathematical modeling is applied to derive short-term marginal costs first and then the supply function of a price-taker from the energy unit performance characteristics. It is shown that the short-term marginal costs function of a unit can be decreasing or can have decreasing segments. In this case the supply function of a price-taker is not the same as the short-term marginal costs function. It is shown also that the supply function can be undefined for the output below the minimum safe output of the unit as well as within the range of decreasing short-term marginal costs. And the form of the supply function does not correspond with amount of units that the supplier runs.</jats:p>",

In order to control the electromagnetic situation, 2x25 kV traction systems, sucking transformers with a return wire for the 25 kV system, amplifying and shielding wires of the traction network, passive screens on passenger platforms, optimization of train traffic schedules can be used. Fazonord software package developed at the Irkutsk State Transport University was used as a tool for the analysis of the above events. Using computer simulations, it was shown that the most effective methods for reducing the magnetic field strength are the use of screens on passenger platforms, optimal train schedules, and the use of “soft” train driving modes. The latter measure is able to reduce the peak magnetic field strength by about 25%.</jats:p>"

The defined and validated factors of the BTOPC are further investigated via the lens offered by ambidextrous supply chain strategy, which is defined and measured through the simultaneous practice of exploitative and explorative activities. The exploratory nature of this study aims to help academics to further the theory of port competitiveness and assist practitioners in improving port management. Eight in-person interviews with practitioner and academic port experts were conducted in addition to follow-up telephone conversations. This study finds that supply chain exploitative and explorative practices indeed offer a unique vantage view for assessing the port competitiveness when utilizing the BTOPC factors.</jats:p>",

None of the models entail comprehensive reform of the way work is regulated in a nation. Nor do they fundamentally challenge the international institutional arrangements, which have altered and undermined the power of national institutions to regulate work, and which were seen to be at play in each of the case studies. They have instead sought solutions which were politically feasible and improved the conditions of a specific group of workers—homeworkers, head-load workers, and garment workers. They arose out of particular political moments and institutional trajectories. The initiatives have in common that they (a) expand or sidestep the employment relationship so as to encompass broader forms of work (with the exception of the Cambodian initiative); and (b) increase the strength of regulation in order to push against countervailing pressures which lower working conditions. However, each initiative has achieved this in different ways and to different extents. This chapter compares these different methods and explores why some levers are stronger than others.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to illustrate how information structures work in the strategic interactions between banks and firms in a supply chain, and why the transaction information in a supply chain may serve to reduce information asymmetry and improve SMEs’ access to external financing. We find that under incomplete information, the transactions between SMEs and suppliers can serve as signals for banks, which may help banks access the private information of SMEs, thus reducing information asymmetry between them. To maximize profit, banks should dynamically adjust both their interest rate policies and risk management strategies when providing financing services to SMEs, according to the structure of the financial market. The improvement of the external financial environment for SMEs may benefit the entire supply chain, thus facilitating its sustainable development and the growth of SMEs. Our framework sheds light on how SMEs in a supply chain may enhance their survivability and facilitate their development through appropriate strategies to improve business performances and manage credit risks.</jats:p>"

That is not the case for food. It is a biological necessity to participate in the food market. This coercive property of food demand and other unique market characteristics make the agricultural sector very unresponsive to changes in price and hence—in contrast to textbook expectations—its ability to quickly self-correct. In recent decades agricultural policy legislation has not taken into account the root causes of agriculture's chronic price and income problems. As a result, it has been largely ineffective and unnecessarily expensive. We argue in this paper that a well-designed supply management program can take agriculture's unique characteristics into account in a way that benefits farmers, consumers and the public as a whole.</jats:p>",

The first section of Chapter 3 describes the overarching case-study methodology employed in this book. The second section describes the primary approach deployed in the case studies: historical institutionalism.

The nature of the impact of these technologies on the supply chain is shown, the stages of implementation of each of the logistics innovations are determined. The place of modern technologies in the structure of logistics process is shown. It is revealed that one of the important management problems is the lack of competences and knowledge, the misunderstanding of additional benefits by the staff from the introduction of logistics innovations in the activities of companies. It has been proven that the vast majority of digital technologies are technologies that can, in conjunction with other technologies, achieve some common result that is greater than the total result in the ordinary sum of the results from the separate action of each of the interacting digital technologies. Possible impacts on each other relevant to digital logistics systems (Big Data, the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, battery life, Artificial Intelligence, self-propelled vehicles and drones, 3D printing, sensor technologies, virtual and augmented reality, Blockchain, next generation wireless communication, bionic technologies) on the emergence of synergy effect; a schematic representation of such connections between digital technologies in the context of their synergy.</jats:p>"

Currently, government is encouraging manufacturing to reduce carbon emission and conduct low carbon supply chain management (LCSCM). In order to solve the greenhouse gas emission dilemma, LCSCM is essential for manufacturing firms' stakeholders. Supply chain partners are expected to know the proper measurement of emissions to solve this problem. This chapter's aim is to review literature on how to measure LCSCM. In the past, the concept of green supply chain management (GSCM) was practiced to promote and reduce environmental risks. However, GSCM is a driver or practice to achieve environmental outcomes. The extended model of GSCM currently practices LCSCM through carbon footprint (CF) concept. In other words, LCSCM is an outcome that both interests researchers and persuades practitioners. </jats:p>"

Azerbaijan has large areasof fertile lands that can produce high yields of agricultural plants.The purpose of the research is to investigate the sources and factors of food security that are of particular importance for ensuring food security of Azerbaijan and meeting the needs of the population in foodstuffs. The current state of food production in Azerbaijan, ways to improve food supply, and food market problems are investigated. Statistical data on the output of cereal grain products, legumes, potato, vegetables and melons, fruit and berries over 2003–2017 are given. The self-sufficiency and import dependence of Azerbaijan in plant products are estimated. The statistical analysis shows that Azerbaijan is still unable to meet the demand for basic food products through their domestic production; the share of imports of grain, grain legumes, vegetable oils, milk and dairy products in the total consumption remains to be high. This means that the positions of foreign producers in the domestic agricultural and food markets have been strengthening compared with the local producers’ positions in respective product segments. Another problem is related with the economic efficiency in the agricultural sector, including more efficient use of land, material and technical means, dissemination of agricultural innovations, intensification of production processes. Recommendations on optimization of food supply and achievement of food safety in Azerbaijan are given.</jats:p>"

Stress testing corporations and municipalities however is relatively new. The authors present a process for both corporate and municipal stress testing together with a review of legal considerations. Over time, it is expected that stress testing corporations and municipalities will become as routine as an annual visit to the family physician. This chapter is designed to establish the ground work for stress testing corporations and municipalities, including supply chains and not-for-profit organizations.

This formula maintains the same basic structure as the existing formula but is amended to incorporate the fact that the flocculated sediment has an internal fractal architecture and is composed of different-sized primary particles. The input parameters needed for calculating the settling velocity include the median size and size distribution of the primary particles, the fractal dimension of the floc, the density of the sediment, and two calibrated coefficients that incorporate the effects of floc shape, permeability, and flow separation on drag. The proposed formula is compared with four data sets of settling velocity–floc size collected from the published literature, and a good agreement between the model and these data can be found.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global shift in ecological movement has significant impacts on business operation of manufacturing firms that are located in developing countries. The intense pressure of being environmentally sustainable has caused Green Supply Chain Management (Green SCM) concept to emerge as an important corporate environmental strategy for manufacturing companies. Information technologies and systems have permeated in most business activities, in which, they extend important opportunities to resolve environmental issues. However, many researchers, including manufacturers and government bodies often disregard the green concept of information technologies and systems in minimizing environmental issues. A comprehensive review on Green SCM, Green IT and Green IS for sustainable environmental performance in manufacturing companies is presented using Input-Process-Output (IPO) Theory and Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) theory. In bridging the research gap, a model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Next, the paper reports on the development of survey questionnaire using cognitive interviewing strategies, followed up with semi-structured interview to investigate and obtain preliminary findings on the influential factors, green activities and performance outcomes from implementing Green SCM. Lastly, the finalized survey questionnaire was distributed to 60 ISO14001 certified manufacturing companies located in the region of Perak and Kulim. Out of 60 manufacturing companies, only 32 responses received as the dataset in analyzing for improvements in reliability, measurement error, and validity of measured items. The findings from this pilot study explain that internal and external factors have stronger influence over the implementation of green initiatives in supply chain with substantial outcome on environmental performance. The information technologies and systems being the physical resource, capability and backbone to run a business seamlessly are significantly recognized. But, the green component of IT and IS were poorly attended and disregarded to an extent in the process of greening the processes, operations or entire business. Therefore, further investigations are required in the main study to validate the findings obtained here and other possible association between the factors, practices and outcomes in realizing ecological improvements in the supply chain and firm itself. </jats:p>"

In this paper, when the supply point is insufficient, the emergency vehicle routing can be optimized in the shortest possible time and at the same time to meet the requirements of the disaster site. By establishing the corresponding mathematical model and using the genetic algorithm to solve the relevant examples, the new solution is provided for the emergency logistics vehicle routing problem when the relief materials are insufficient.

In Eastern European countries production, processing, and breeding of confectionery sunflower differ from oil-type sunflower. There is no precise information on the sowing areas of confectionery varieties and hybrids in Eastern European countries, mostly because, in statistical reports, sunflower producers do not provide separate data on the share of varieties in gross revenue of all manufactured products. Confectionery sunflower seeds are used in bakery products, but also in a number of natural health products and healthy snacks, as well as for direct consumption in the hull, dehulled, raw or backed form. Confectionery sunflower breeding is characterized by the fact that different markets have different demands when it comes to the seed size, hull colour, and other traits, which make this process more difficult and costlier. Market demands and production area of confectionery sunflower show a steady increase due to its nutritional value and use in human nutrition. In Eastern European countries, it is expected that the highly productive confectionery hybrids will replace varieties, which will lead to the increase of surfaces under this crop.</jats:p>"

A major pillar of this economic-strengthening is the idea that more direct markets support the development of viable, small-scale farm businesses. However, literature has increasingly shown that even direct sales may prove challenging as an avenue to economic viability for small-scale farmers. This paper contributes to this literature through an examination of market perceptions and pricing strategies used by small-scale farmers engaged in direct sales opportunities. Interviews with nine farm owners and managers, as well as three leaders of local food initiatives, revealed the creative strategies that small-scale food producers use to mitigate costs, set prices and convey the value of their products. Though farmers employ these creative strategies to make ends meet, their ability to become viable businesses is limited by the scope of current opportunities available within Atlanta's local food system, primarily farmers’ markets and Community-Supported Agriculture. In order for local food production to provide viable livelihoods for small-scale farmers, Atlanta's local food infrastructure may need to support small-scale farmers’ access to more diverse direct-market opportunities.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

However, RFID-based systems have numerous security- and privacy-related threats for the deployment of such technology in supply chain automation purpose. This chapter explains the technical fundamentals of RFID systems and its security threats. It also classifies the existing security and privacy threats into those which target the RFID components such as the tag, the communication channel, and the overall system threats.

So, the study considers a genetic-algorithm-based clustering method to identify homogeneous precipitation regions for 39 gauge stations of the north-eastern region of India. The performance evaluation is done using six cluster validation measures. Further, considering all the six indices together, selection for the optimum cluster is modelled as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Three MCDM methods, namely TOPSIS, WASPAS and VIKOR, are applied to obtain ranked clusters which are then subjected to a heterogeneity test using the L-moments approach. The results suggested the stations to be grouped into three homogeneous regions. Comparison with the k-means method indicated relatively better performance for genetic-algorithm-based clustering. Finally, an L-moment ratio diagram and goodness-of-fit measures were conducted to select regional frequency distributions for the identified homogeneous regions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is to explore whether the ability to adjust and redistribute resources has a positive effect on improving a supply chain’s competitive capabilities. In addition, we also verify whether information transparency is an antecedent to improving the ability to adjust and redistribute resources. Finally, this study explores the moderating effects of investment cost controls and absolute dominance on the relationship between information transparency and the ability to adjust and redistribute resources. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was the main method used in this study. The empirical data were obtained from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS). Regarding the research results, in addition to the relationships among information transparency, resource adjustment and redistribution ability, and supply chain competitive capabilities, our research results demonstrated that overemphasizing investment cost controls and absolute dominance will moderate the relationship between information transparency and resource adjustment and redistribution ability and further lead to weak competitive capabilities.</jats:p>",

However, there is little published research on carbonation – one of the main causes of concrete deterioration – in relation to RC tanks, leaving room for improvement with regard to methods for preventing surface deterioration. This study discusses the impact of surface coating and environmental conditions on the carbonation rate of concrete based on a survey of the present state of RC tanks of the Sapporo Waterworks Bureau. Coating was found to have an inhibitory effect on carbonation. Because the carbonation rate of concrete used for the inside and outside of RC tanks was slow, the sufficient concrete cover depth to protect rebar from carbonation while in service was found to be 75 mm for RC tanks without coating.</jats:p>",

An exploratory survey was carried out using semi-structured interviews with employees of the company that operates the container and coal terminal of the second largest Brazilian port. The results revealed there is no structured risk management process by the port administration, but several actions taken revealed concern for reaction to risk situations. This highlights the benefits of clarifying the issues, contributing to the literature and assisting professionals in structuring a supply chain risk management process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper is devoted to the problem of optimal design, construction and operation of water supply systems and their elements. The key element of the system is a water well. The quality of its design and construction determines the operation of the water intake as a whole. Disadvantages in the construction of a well lead to disruption of the entire water supply system of a particular object. The paper proposed a methodology for selecting the optimal diameter and length of the well filter of a water well. Based on the methodology, an example of filter parameters selection for hydrogeological conditions of the city of Kursk is given. The above calculation showed that the use of the entrance velocity criterion in the design of wells can significantly reduce the cost of well construction while ensuring the design flow rate and allowable lowering of the water level. The cost of the filter, depending on the well design, is 20-30% of the total price for its construction. The most important filter parameters affecting the cost of a well are its length and diameter. Justifying the minimum diameter of the filter that ensures the designed water intake and allowable dewatering can significantly reduce the cost of the well, taking into account the fact that modern pumping equipment allows the use of columns of small diameter above the filter.</jats:p>"

A product lifecycle (PLC) is the progression of stages from the product's production to the world until its last withdrawal from the market. Product lifecycle comprises various stages that a product must possess in its lifespan, for example, launching, growth, maturity, and decline stage. While each stage brings huge changes, a progression of procedures for the administration of product lifecycle is required. Product lifecycle management (PLM) is a precise, controlled idea for overseeing and creating products and product-related data. Enhanced patient consistency, income development, extended clinical advantages, and faster market dispatch are among the primary utilization of product lifecycle management. To create a viable and productive product lifecycle management program many qualities are viewed like promising start, vital arranging clear authority, supporting information and abilities, readiness for changing tenets of government and associations. </jats:p>"

In view of this, many companies have implemented the ISO14001 system in their supply chain to comply with green regulations. However, implementing such a system involves technical and communication efforts; hence, an effective method is needed to support the implementation. In this paper, the authors propose a value engineering (VE)-based model with quality tools to support the implementation of the ISO14001 system in the Green Supply Chains. In it, they applied the framework of VE with the quality engineering tools Fishbone Analysis and Failure Mode Effect Analysis for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of green issues in supply chains to cover quality, risk, and value of the system. The proposed method was applied to a global electronics manufacturing company in Taiwan, and the application results showed positive outputs in terms of CO2 emission, power consumption, water consumption, and waste water recovery. Based on the evidence, academic and industrial implications are discussed. </jats:p>"

Within these complex supply chain systems, shipping organizations, port authorities, and import-export firms collaborate and cooperate with each other in the broader management context of maritime logistics. Meanwhile, increasing environmental concerns have forced global maritime organizations to implement sustainability in their operation. MGSCM is a recent focus within the sustainable supply chain body of literature with ample room for understanding its challenges and opportunities. With that in mind, the objective of this chapter is to review the literature on the development of GSCM and conceptualizing the notion of MGSCM concept in maritime context derived from GSCM, respectively. This chapter is unique because it addresses the complex dimension of sustainability in maritime supply chain and tries to define it in line with the existing GSCM context. The findings of this chapter show that GSCM can be extended into the maritime perspective to define MGSCM. </jats:p>"

The authors show the differentiation in availability of energy supply services for consumers, explained by the geographical contrasts and existing system of settlement. There are two sources of energy supply in Krai: “Far Eastern Generating Company” (AO “DGK”) and objects of public energetics. The population pays for only a part of actual producers’ costs for energy supply services; the remaining part is compensated by the state through budgetary means. There are two ways to compensate high tariffs on energy supply for population: subsidies and privileges for consumers and subsidies for producers. The population that gets its energy from AO “DGK” pays for energy supply services almost entirely, while population that uses the services of public energetics pays only partially, with the state taking the burden upon itself to compensate the producers’ costs. In case of transitioning to full compensation, the scale of social budgetary support will increase significantly, which contradicts the logic of institutional transformation, aimed at lowering the financial burden of the state.</jats:p>"

Most past research has examined the effect of ERPs on logistics performance in production processes other than job shops, which seems to suggest that in small-scale production processes the cost of ERPs makes it irrelevant. Are manufacturing job shop production processes the exception that proves the rule? Using both a t-test two sample for means and a Kolmogorov-Simonov (KS) test, this study tested whether or not ERPs can improve supply chain logistics performance in job shop manufacturing processes.

The upper model (UM) determines the number and locations of parking lots in a CBD with the objective of minimizing the average impedance of all car trips. The lower model (LM) is a modal split and assignment combination model for calculating the traffic flow under various parking supply schemes. In addition to the bilevel model, a gravity model (GM) is proposed to calculate the car trips that are induced by the added parking lots. The interaction between car traveling and parking can be simulated by the feedbacks between the UM and LM. A case study is performed with real data from Dalian City. The results show that there is a negative correlation between parking supply increments and the average traveling impedance when the number of parking spaces is lower than the optimal value; however, the average traveling impedance will start to increase with the increase in parking supply when the number of parking spaces is higher than the optimal value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Simulation and modeling have become more common in forest biomass studies. Dynamic simulation has been used to study the supply chain of forest biomass with numerous different models. A robust predictive multi-year model requires biomass availability data, where annual variation is included spatially and temporally. This can be done by using data from enterprises, but in some cases relevant data is not accessible. Another option is to use forest inventory data to estimate biomass availability, but this data must be processed in the correct form to be utilized in the model. This study developed a method for preparing forest inventory data for a multi-year simulation supply model using the theoretical availability of feedstock. Methods for estimating quality changes during roadside storage are also presented, including a possible parameter estimation to decrease the amount of data needed. The methods were tested case by case using the inventory database âBiomass Atlasâ and weather data from a weather station in Mikkeli, Finland. The data processing method for biomass allocation produced a reasonable quantity of stands and feedstock, having a realistic annual supply with variation for the demand point. The results of the study indicate that it is possible to estimate moisture content changes using weather data. The estimations decreased the accuracy of the model and, therefore, estimations should be kept minimal. The presented data preparation method can generate a supply of forest biomass for the simulation model, but the validity of the data must be ensured for correct model behavior.</ja:p>"

Supply chains involve complex relationships between different variables. Hence, it is necessary to simulate related non-normal distributions to simulate these systems. The simulation of related normal distributions is relatively easy and can be found in most simulation texts. However, when the marginal distributions under investigation do not have a normal distribution, it becomes very difficult to generate values from these related distributions. In this study, the authors illustrate a method based on copulas that allows for the generation of related distributions with arbitrary marginals. The procedure suggested in this study is simple and easy to implement. Using this procedure will enable researchers in supply chain management to more effectively simulate complex real-world scenarios resulting in better analysis and understanding of supply chains. </jats:p>"

Research in the field of energy saving is mainly focused on finding methods of energy saving by power consumers and individual power industry facilities. At the same time, collaboration of different energy networks as a unified power supply system of the city and a feasibility study of the energy load redistribution between different energy networks in the process of territorial development remains a poorly studied problem. The aim of the study is to develop a method that allows comparing the use of different power supply sources and types of individual buildings based on a single criterion of changing the total cost of transmission, conversion and consumption of energy in the city. The study employed methods of development and analysis of energy balances of a territory, methods for calculating gas, heat and electricity consumption of residential buildings, methods of power network losses calculation and methods of network and overlay analysis in GIS, materials of power providers’ and public utilities’ databases. A method has been proposed and implemented in the software package form for automating the calculation of the city’s housing sector energy balance for various placement options, power equipment deployment and connection of new or reconstructed buildings to the energy networks. The method is based on the use of an urban area energy balance spatial model in a GIS environment. The article presents an example of calculating the influence of different power supply options of one of the buildings in the city of Ivanovo on the energy balance of the city. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of a comparative analysis of the options of connecting buildings to various energy network types based on a single criterion of minimizing municipal energy costs. The developed method and its implementation can be used to create decision-making information systems for regional and city governments.</jats:p>"

Integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources need to deal with different data models, database schema, and query languages. This chapter presents a semantic web technology-based data integration framework that uses relational databases and XML data with the help of ontology. To model different source schemas, this chapter proposes a method based on the resource description framework (RDF) graph patterns and query rewriting techniques. The semantic translation between the source schema and RDF ontology is described using query and transformational language SPARQL. </jats:p>"

Work to develop such systems is carried out in the USA, South Korea, Germany, Israel, the Russian Federation. The VIESH researchers have developed and patented experimental models of a car and a tramway of the future without accumulators, which receive energy from external energy system through air gap from a single wire cable laid under the surface of road pavement. Noncontact systems for electric power supply to transport are developed at VIESH on the basis of resonant methods of electric power supply through a single-wire cable. This is a basic difference of the technology under consideration from similar ones. This technology makes it possible to realize at the new technological level the need for electric roads with minimal costs. Given that all the world's automakers are working on the production of an electric vehicle for mass production, the need for creating a motorway in the city and on inter-urban autobahns is even more topical. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nContext\nFeral pigs (Sus scrofa) are highly fecund, and populations can increase rapidly under favourable conditions. Population size can also fluctuate widely, driven largely by changes in juvenile mortality in response to food availability, but these relationships have only been explored on a limited number of sites and over short periods.\nAims\nThe present study aimed to investigate and quantify the numerical response of feral pig populations to changes in their food supply in north-eastern Australia.\nMethods\nPig population densities were determined from aerial surveys conducted over a 21-year period on 10 regional blocks (~2000–6000 km2) throughout the Queensland rangelands. Densities were used to calculate annual exponential rates of increase (r), which were then corrected for anthropogenic mortality (baiting and commercial harvesting). Six proxy measures of annual food supply, including rainfall, pasture biomass and pasture growth (using the AussieGRASS model), were calculated for each survey block, and assessed as predictors of corrected r. The rates of increase predicted from the first half of the data series were then applied to initial population densities to estimate successive pig densities during the second period in each bioregion.\nKey results\nThe most parsimonious model of the numerical response had parameters common to three bioregions, with rainfall in the 12 months between surveys being the best predictor variable. Modelled densities for each bioregion were a good fit to actual, observed densities. Relationships between r and each measure of food supply at the individual block level were inconsistent.\nConclusions\nUsing rainfall as a measure of food supply, the numerical response relationship provides a method for predicting the dynamics of feral pig populations at the bioregional scale. Predicting population dynamics at any one site using this relationship is less precise, suggesting that differences in landscape composition affect utilisation of resources supporting population growth.\nImplications\nThe results from the present study could be used to predict feral pig population changes at the bioregional level, supplementing or reducing the need for more frequent, expensive population surveys. This improved ability to predict fluctuations in regional feral pig populations can help guide future management actions.\n</jats:p>"

The riverbank filtration site was designed to have eleven horizontal collector wells in order to supply 280,000 m3/day. This field study provided more insight into the fate of the dissolved organic matter’s characteristics during soil passage. The vertical production wells (PWs) were located in different aquifer materials (PW-Sand and PW-Gravel) in order to determine the depth of the laterals for the horizontal collector wells. The turbidity of the riverbank filtrates from the PW-Sand (0.9 NTU) and PW-Gravel (0.7 NTU) was less than 1 NTU, which was the target turbidity of the riverbank filtrate in this study. The iron concentrations were 18.1 ± 0.8 and 25.9 ± 1.3 mg/L for PW-Sand and PW-Gravel respectively, and were higher than those of the land-side groundwater. The biodegradable organic matter-determined biochemical oxygen demand in the river water was reduced by more than 40% during soil passage, indicating that less microbial growth in the riverbank filtrate could be possible. Moreover, the influence of the pumping rates of the vertical wells on the removal of dissolved organic matter and the turbidity was not significant.</jats:p>"

A total of 20 purposively selected participants drawn from 20 3PL organisations with headquarters located in Gauteng province participated in semi-structured interviews.Main findings: The findings indicate a juxtaposition regarding South African 3PL supply chain practitioners’ understanding of SCRM compared to literature, as the participants were found to only identify certain tenets of SCRM with no single participant comprehensively describing SCRM according to the literature. External disruptions, namely customer- and supply-side disruptions within the South African 3PL industry were found to be the primary sources of supply chain disruptions. The findings further indicate that supply chain vulnerabilities emanate predominantly from labour strikes and cyberattacks.Practical/managerial implications: The implementation of SCRM is constrained by the high costs of implementation, the unwillingness of supply chain partners to buy into SCRM, power imbalances in supply chain relationships and other uncontrollable factors between different supply chain members.Contribution/value-add: Supply chain practitioners in the 3PL industry should realise the significance of effective SCRM practices, as well as the positive impact proactive SCRM practices could have on their organisations as well as on supply chain partners.</jats:p>"

This study explores the factors that determine the different perceptions of the welfare impact of supplying reclaimed water to different, and competitive, ecosystems in the Segura River Basin (southern Spain): specifically, an agroecosystem (agricultural irrigation) and a river (higher river flow). The results of a contingent valuation exercise with the population of the Murcia Region show four different groups of respondents, depending on their willingness to pay (WTP) preferences. The factors that identify differences among welfare impacts are the age, the gender, the education level, the monthly income, the nearness of the household to the river, and, above all, the degree of satisfaction with funding of water reclamation. This study broadens our knowledge of individuals' heterogeneous preferences in water reuse options, which is crucial for policy makers in the development of socially accepted and sustainable water resource management strategies.</jats:p>",

As more business is performed via the internet, e-SCs are becoming an integral part of supply chain management (SCM). With business via the internet requiring different fulfillment approaches, traditional drivers of regular supply chains are no longer adequate for explaining how e-SC performance is driven. The task of SC professionals is more complicated than ever. This situation often leads to unsatisfied customers, which can force companies to close their doors. Therefore, understanding e-SCM performance drivers and their integration with ERP becomes a necessity. Little attention has been devoted to SCM performance driver evaluation. This chapter discusses the performance drivers of e-SCs and their integration with ERPs. SCM is among the most important factors to organizational success. Effective SCM can enhance competitiveness and increase profitability. Nevertheless, SCM professionals and other actors must understand the factors that undergird driver performance. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The processes of market integration and globalization are increasingly transforming enterprises into a network or structure of a macro-logical system or supply chain. The scale and scope of activities of such companies require their division into several groups by functions, regions, divisions and so on. At the same time, each group is responsible for the management assigned to it by part of the business. Therefore, there is a need to use a comprehensive or integrated planning of logistics activities, which will not only see the future prospects, but also to show the entire chain of the business process of the organization as a whole, to distribute responsibilities and improve the efficiency of its functioning in the market. This explains the relevance of the research topic. The purpose of the study is to analyze approaches to assessing the effectiveness of integrated planning and determine the most appropriate. Objectives of the study: to analyze approaches to assessing the effectiveness (multifactorial, sectoral, integrated), to determine the approach used to evaluate the effectiveness in practice, and to determine the criterion of effectiveness as an integral indicator, the value of which can be judged on the extent to which the goals of the integrated plan are implemented. Since the efficiency of this mechanism is a multidimensional concept, it is usually impossible to obtain the efficiency criterion in the form of a scalar function. In this case, it is possible to use the multicomponent criterion obtained as a result of the study, the components of which are independent, relatively independent from each other by the criteria of micro, meso and macro efficiency.</jats:p>"

This article studies measures relating to technology and management that can increase energy efficiency in the supply chains of five aluminium products made in Sweden. Additionally, energy efficiency potentials related to the flows of material, energy, and knowledge between the actors in the supply chains are studied. Empirical data was collected using focus group interviews and one focus group per product was completed. The results show that there are several areas for potential energy efficiency improvement; for example, product design, communication and collaboration, transportation, and reduced material waste. Demands from other actors that can have direct or indirect effects on energy use in the supply chains were identified. Despite the fact that companies can save money through improved energy efficiency, demands from customers and the authorities would provide the additional incentives needed for companies to work harder to improve energy efficiency.</jats:p>"

Building water systems may provide conditions (such as low flow, water hardness, low disinfectant residual levels and optimal temperature) that accelerate Legionella growth to levels that may result in an increased risk to public health. The standard disinfection of water systems (periodic overheating of water and chlorination) in the interest of prevention of Legionnaires' disease have often proved to be inefficient. It is therefore necessary to develop new approaches for removing Legionella from water systems. One of the new methods is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which includes the combined activity of a photosensitizer (PS), molecular oxygen and visible light of appropriate wavelength to create singlet oxygen (1O2) and other oxygen reactive species (ROS) leading to the oxidation of numerous cellular components and cell death. In this study, a newly synthesized cationic, amphiphilic porphyrin TMPyP3-C17H35, was tested against Legionella in tap water. The minimal effective concentration (MEC) of PS photoinactivation test and PS uptake assay in sterile tap water were explored to determine the anti-Legionella activity. The complete inactivation of Legionella in sterile tap water was achieved with 0.024 μM of the PS. Also, the tested PS was found to be very effective in reducing Legionella growth in the sterile tap water and photoinactivation was dose-dependent. The tested PS binds well to the bacterial cell, after only 10 minutes of incubation in the dark. In conclusion, these studies indicate that TMPyP3-C17H35 is highly efficient in aPDT which leads to reducing Legionella growth in sterile tap water, and these results suggest that cationic amphiphilic photosensitizers may have a broader application in the photoinactivation of bacterial cells implicated in water disinfection.</jats:p>",

To understand the microeconomic determinants of women's work in Sri Lanka's growing economy, this paper estimates a binary‐choice model of married women's labor supply using household survey data spanning a 23‐year period. Decomposition and cohort analysis reveal that women have been drawn into the workforce through falling fertility rates, rising tertiary education, and declining income effects among younger generations, but other factors have undermined this positive trend. Educational attainment reduces married women's labor supply except at the tertiary level, consistent with social stigmas associated with married women in non‐white‐collar employment. The strict sectoral segregation of married women by education level supports this hypothesis. In addition, growth has been concentrated in low‐skilled sectors with self‐employment more prevalent, reducing employment prospects of educated women and prompting their labor force withdrawal. This suggests it is the structure of economic development, rather than speed, that matters for women's labor force activity.</jats:p>",

This paper addresses the gap and adds to this body of knowledge by providing new data and original insights and by showcasing emerging, contemporary trends and themes. Over a period of 4 months we downloaded tweets that contained the #supplychain and/or the #logistics hashtags. After cleaning the data and filtering tweets in English we analysed 76,378 posts, using different analytical techniques. Our work shows the key trends emerging where various supply chain management technologies play a dominant role. Blockchain is the leading technology followed by artificial intelligence. The increased role of last mile logistics is also shown which can be related to e-commerce and customer service. Supply chain technologies are also clustered and interlinked in a related dendrogram and, automation is linked to robots and robotics, analytics is linked to data, artificial intelligence is linked to IoT and machine learning. Similar interlinkages are illustrated for other trends impacting contemporary supply chains. This research provides direction to supply chain managers for the key trends and themes emerging in their profession, and a new graph-based measure to understand the topology of the social media mindset landscape. In turn, such trends can offer valuable insights as to how the industry is developing and help proactively identify areas of potential investment.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study it in detail and analyze possible ways to improve supply activities. Methodology. In the process of research, methods of comparison, scientific search, analysis and synthesis were used to study the supply and sales activities of an industrial enterprise. Findings. The article discusses the main logistic principles and the scope of their application on the example of the supply activities of an industrial enterprise for the production of upholstered furniture. For this purpose, several potential suppliers of material resources were assessed and a methodology for justifying the optimal choice of supplier was introduced. An industrial enterprise whose main activity is the production of upholstered furniture has been chosen as an object of consideration. Some of its main suppliers for similar types of products - perforated paper are considered. A comparative assessment of them was made according to the main influencing parameters - location, quality and assortment of the proposed material resources. In this case, the method of expert evaluation was used. Using the method of substantiating the optimal choice of supplier based on the basic principles of logistics from the proposed options, based on the results of the calculations, an optimal variant of the supply of materials for production is selected and the supplier is selected, the work with which is most beneficial for the enterprise in question. Options for obtaining discounts from a regular supplier and its impact on cost reduction were also considered. Originality. Based on the study of methodological sources and scientific developments in the field of logistics, the ways of optimizing the supply and marketing activities of the particular enterprise have been proposed. Practical value. Results of the study can be used for the evaluation of several potential suppliers of material resources for a particular enterprise and justification of the optimal choice of the best of them based on the use of logistic principles. This will reduce the cost of the enterprise associated with the organization of supplies necessary for the production of material resources. This opens up ways for an enterprise to increase its overall efficiency by optimizing work with suppliers.</jats:p>"

In this method, a perforated tube was placed along the bend on the bed and water and air were separately injected into the bend flow from both ends of the tube. The goal was to make a water and air screen to block secondary flows and prevent them from reaching the outer bank. The air jet and water jet injection modes changed the location of maximum scour depth from the outer wall to the middle of the bend, which increased the navigable width. Increasing the spacing between tube ports decreased the maximum scour depth. A port spacing of 5 cm was determined to be the optimal amount. At a bend section of 90°, the decrease in maximum scour depth was estimated to be 85% and 91% under air jet injection (qa/Q = 2.74) and water jet injection (qw/Q = 0.17), respectively. At 170°, the decrease in maximum scour depth was 79% and 86% for the air jet and water jet, respectively. The results show that the optimal effect was obtained by water jet injection.</jats:p>",

For public entities, good governance results in scientifically motivated policy development, an increase in accountability and transparency and finally the involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process. For non-governmental organizations, governance results in better allocation of resources, finding new opportunities for collaboration, and better cooperation with governmental bodies.

In contrast to previous research on pricing strategies based on the full rationality of members, we focus on the impact of retailers′ fairness concerns on pricing strategies. In this study, the hybrid dual‐channel supply chain consists of one manufacturer with a direct channel who acts as the leader and a retailer who acts as the follower. First, we use the Stackelberg game approach to determine the equilibrium pricing strategy for a fair caring retailer. Simultaneously, we consider a centralized dual‐channel supply chain as the benchmark for a comparative analysis of the efficiency of a decentralized supply chain. Furthermore, we study pricing strategies when the retailer has fairness concerns and determine the complete equilibrium solutions for different ranges of the parameters representing cross‐price sensitivity and fairness. Finally, through numerical experiments, the pricing strategies, the profit and utility of the manufacturer and retailer, and the channel efficiency of the supply chain are compared and analysed for two scenarios. We find that fairness concerns reduce the manufacturer′s profits, while for the most part, the retailers’ profit can be improved; however, the supply chain cannot achieve complete coordination.</jats:p>",

RFID is an important technology used by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This technology enables communication between the main devices used in RFID system, the reader, and the tags. The tags share a common communication channel. Therefore, if more than one tag tries to send information at the same time, the reader will be incapable of differentiating these signals in the case of radio signals interference. This phenomenon is known as tag collision problem. The problem of tag collision is one of the major disadvantages for fast tagged-object identification in supply chain management. This chapter describes four different types of binary search algorithms for avoidance of tag collision, and then presents a performance measurement mechanism for RFID application system. Finally, simulation-based experimental results on the performance of these algorithms are presented. </jats:p>"

Governments' role was trade facilitating, that is reducing delays and costs at border‐crossing points, rather than investing in hard infrastructure. Service providers responded by linking European and Asian value chains (e.g., in automobiles and electronic goods) and reducing costs for traders shipping between China and Europe. The Eurasian Landbridge provides a case study of servicification as a component of increased trade in the twenty‐first century.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s competitive business environment, with a continuously increasing diversity in customer demand, a high level of supply chain responsiveness is an imperative requisite for companies’ survival. As a consequence, enhanced agility is requested for the supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants that influence the position of the ‘decoupling points’ along the value chain, as according to the reviewed literature these represent the separation point between leanness and agility in a hybrid supply chain. It has been found that by applying different technical solutions along the chain, including breaking down the complete production process in modular sequences and outsourcing specific ones, considering reshaping the supply chain, the decoupling points’ location can be moved, allowing greater agility. The chosen methodology is a case study of a FMCG company, aiming to illustrate how increased agility is achieved by outsourcing labour-intensive and time consuming activities, while shortening the downstream to customer. The selected firm is since several years under Lean and Agile strategies implementation. The study shows that understanding both, material and information decoupling points, certain lean processes can be moved upstream, leveraging more agile processes close to the end customer. This way, supply chains can be redesigned towards increasing market responsiveness.</jats:p>"

One may even say that this leads to a cognitive dissonance, i.e. the discomfort which ensues if one holds two contradictory values, with respect to the externalisation of the Union’s energy and sustainable development policy. On the one hand, the EU aims to become a global frontrunner in the field of promoting renewable energy and sustainable development. This expresses itself through the inclusion of specific chapters on Trade and Sustainable Development in the EU’s Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) (standard since the 2011 EU-South Korea FTA). On the other, the EU realises that it is imperative to secure the Union’s security of energy supply, still largely guaranteed by fossil fuels. Therefore, the Union in parallel attempts to eliminate discriminatory practices in international fossil fuel trade in its bilateral agreements (e.g. in the EU-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement). This paper will explore the root causes of this cognitive dissonance and research what elements could contribute to ensuring more coherence in EU external energy policy. The objectives of sustainable development and security of supply are not necessarily contradictory per se. However, clearer delineations between the two objectives are necessary in EU external relations in general, and in the Union’s FTAs more specifically. This also applies to relations between Member States and the Union in this area, as well as to the interactions between the relevant EU institutions tasked with energy, sustainable development and the environment.</jats:p>"

This article contributes to the literature of supply chain contracts by highlighting the importance of a cooperative investment in improving quality in presence of uncertainty. When the delivery of a high-quality product is uncertain and costly, the supplier may choose to deliver a less costly standard product, delivery of which is not uncertain, and hence the buyer needs to incentivize the supplier to take the risk. Using a principal-agent set-up, this article shows that incentivizing the supplier to choose the risky action of attempting delivery of the high-quality product is easier for the buyer in presence of shared cooperative investment that reduces epistemic quality uncertainty. However, the supplier passes the entire burden of investment on the buyer. The optimal investment for the buyer depends on parameters that determine effectiveness of the investment in reducing quality uncertainty.</p>",

These mismatches can be particularly disruptive in coastal and marine areas, where multiple social and ecological systems are multi-layered. Scotland’s Western Isles have a history of local resource exploitation to meet extra-regional, larger-scale demands, which has resulted in a long process of socio-demographic decline. Salmon aquaculture is a major and expanding industry in the area, often linked to “Blue Growth”. The expansion of this industry operates within and contributes to create several scale mismatches. Combining a systems approach across nested scales with a classification of scale mismatches, this work analyses the characteristics of the Western Isles salmon aquaculture industry, and it explores effects on social–ecological resilience. An extent scale mismatch between the global stocks offish-meal species and the local capacity to respond to fluctuations is identified. The implications for this mismatch for the Western Isles are discussed. Some potential policy arrangements for incorporating matched spatial scales are considered.</jats:p>",

This allows for a reduction in the cell area required for producing a given amount of power. The goal is to significantly reduce the cost of electricity generated by replacing expensive PV converter area with less expensive optical material. In this chapter, the authors talk about concentrators in solar energy, especially about modules based on holographic films. Holographic solar panels (HSP) in recent decades have appeared in large-scale production and been actively used in solar energy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To determine, for the purposes of the Value-added Tax Act (‘VAT Act’)1 whether a supply consists of a composite supply or several distinct supplies is paramount. Amongst other reasons, it impacts on how the entire supply should be treated under the VAT Act (i.e. standard, exempt or zero-rated). The treatment of the supply not only affects the applicable tax rate, but it also impacts the value added tax (‘VAT’) claimable or payable when acquiring or selling the supplies. The incorrect treatment of the supply puts the taxpayer at risk since the tax authority may raise reassessments and impose penalties. Therefore, where a supply entails the supply of goods or services or both, it is essential for a vendor to correctly treat the transaction to avoid these repercussions. The aim of this paper is to illustrate that the South African (SA) approach to determining whether a separate part is made is not in line with the international approach. The domestic approach appears to ignore essential elements that are widely accepted when deciding if a supply is single or composite. This paper argues that this approach may in some cases yield unfavourable results in term of VAT. The paper is structured as follows; Part I, briefly discusses the meaning of the composite supply; Part II, provides the South African approach to composite supply; Part III, outlines how the EU and CAN jurisdiction’s VAT systems treat the composite supply; Part IV, points out the shortcomings of the South African approach to the treatment of the composite supply; Part V, outlines the recommendations may be implemented so to align the South African approach with the international perspective.</jats:p>"

This SC includes mainly three players: Tea leaves growers, manufacturers of made tea and tea leaves agents. This study identifies the three types of TLSCs existing in Assam: TLSC1, TLSC2 and TLSC3.

This up-gradation of TLSC2 and TLSC3 to TLSC4 may enable a group of STGs to work in a manner similar to a Tea Estate.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>To the best of authors’ knowledge this is one of the first studies to classify the TLSC in Assam.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

This paper studies policy effects by comparing equilibrium results under different supply chain network structures, and we use the concept of consumer environmental awareness to capture a product’s substitutability. Results indicate that: (1) Both increases in the permit price and the rise of the quota obligation reduces the aggregate profits of the supply chain, but the former rather than the latter increases the profits of the renewable power generating company; (2) the differential pricing improves the retailer’s flexibility in the charged price when confronting increases in the permit price and the quota obligation; (3) higher consumer environmental awareness makes the supply chain less profitable and increases the costs of ET suffered by the consumer; (4) the cooperation between the thermal power generating company and the retailer significantly increases the aggregated profits of the supply chain, although the cooperative profit is sensitive to environmental awareness. Moreover, the consumer suffers the highest costs that the retailer passes on them, and may prefer to feel that the emission cost and compliance cost are less affordable. In contrast, the cooperation between power generating companies removes the influence of environmental awareness, but the aggregated profits of the supply chain are smaller than in the decentralized decision scenario.</jats:p>"

The analysis of required disinfectant dosage changes and disinfectant usage was conducted in a time period starting 6 months before introducing adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC) into the treatment system, and continuing for 6 months after adsorption introduction. During the analyzed time period, both chlorine and chlorine dioxide were used. They were dosed separately and rapidly mixed into a pipeline before the clean water tank. Both short-term and long-term disinfectant consumption was studied. This is due to the different reaction rates of the disinfecting agents used. Introducing GAC adsorption contributed significantly to limiting organic substances in water undergoing disinfection, which resulted in average reductions of 51% for both disinfectants. During the first month after introducing adsorption only a small increase in disinfectant demand was found, connected with an increase in 22 °C cultivated bacteria count in water to be disinfected. The increase in organic substances removal achieved by the use of adsorption did not result in a reduction of analyzed trihalomethanes (THM), whose concentrations were low for both cases and amounted to 2.1–7.9 μg/dm3 and 1.6–5.2 μg/dm3 with and without adsorption respectively.</jats:p>",

Agricultural CC adaptation has become an integrated part of agricultural development policy throughout the EU and further. Without the timely implementation of appropriate measures, the vulnerability of highly exposed and sensitive agricultural landscapes with low adaptive capacity will increase. This paper focuses on the Vipava Valley, a sub-Mediterranean agricultural area highly vulnerable to CC, describing the stakeholder landscape approach undertaken to define stakeholder responsibility level in terms of implementing adaptation measures; and it identifies the key challenges facing stakeholder networks at individual measure levels. The strategy for agricultural CC adaptation follows the structure proposed by the European Commission and clearly defines the necessary stakeholder landscape for implementing agricultural CC adaptation measures and indicators for adaptation strategy monitoring and evaluation. The challenges identified in relation to stakeholder interaction cannot be solved by strategy alone; a facilitated approach to policy implementation is necessary, its success being dependent on the ability of the social landscape to develop a firm implementation of a monitoring programme for adaptation to CC at the local municipality level.</jats:p>",

This business model allows firms to use a variety of channels to interact with their customers and fulfill their orders. Customers can order online and pick up later in the store, or they can choose to have the products delivered from a nearby store. Due to the complexity of fulfilling customer orders via omnichannel models, positioning inventory is a key challenge in supporting this type of business model. This article presents a framework for assisting companies in deciding under what condition to centralize or decentralize their inventory to fulfill customer orders without disrupting the shopping experience.</jats:p>",

It proposes a bold, transnational initiative that aims to promote a global living wage and regulate supply chains. The chapter puts forward three interrelated regulatory pathways out of informality. First, the promotion of Global Living Wages through a multilateral instrument such as an International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention or United Nations treaty, which would also establish an International Living Wage disputes mechanism for enforcement of these minima; second, the setting up of National Living Wage Tribunals empowered to hear disputes concerning non-payment of living wages due to supply chain dynamics and to hold parties in the supply chain responsible for non-payment; third, the fostering of local pathways out of informality.</jats:p>",

Based on this requirement, examination of the effect of outsourcing, one of the crucial instruments for businesses in gaining competitive advantage, on sustainable supply chain performance and business performance, is of importance in terms of bringing a point of view on the dimensions of the ongoing competition in sectoral sense and enabling the businesses to assess their own structures. In this context, the effect of outsourcing by businesses operating in food industry in the province of Konya on sustainable supply chain performance and business performance was examined in this study. Structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze the correlation between the variables. While no statistically significant correlation could be determined between outsourcing and sustainable supply chain perforrmance, it was found out that a statistically significant correlation existed between sustainable supply chain performance and business performance as well as between the outsourcing and business performance. </jats:p>"

As the State Council reports, small and medium-sized enterprises' finance troubles were highlighted at the State Council's executive meeting and suggested China should enrich the fundraising channels for small and medium-sized enterprises. Based on the unique finance service features, supply chain finance has the potential of satisfying the large finance demand to become an effective fundraising and other finance service channel for small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, it is vital to explore the operation process of supply chain finance in a deeper level.</jats:p>"

The method used was an exploratory analysis of research studying the CRM concept and usage data generated from IoT devices. Through a literature review process, various preliminary information constructs on IoT and CRM system with digital enablers are evaluated. References from research papers, journals, internet sites, statistical data sites and books were used to collate the relevant content on the subject. The study of all the relevant scenarios and impact assessment on all the relevant stakeholders was undertaken. Further primary data was gathered from the customer sample and was evaluated to substantiate the importance of connected customer for an organization and its linkage to customer satisfaction. It was found that customer demands are continuously evolving, and it is very relevant for all the organizations to align and keep pace with the change. Connected customers help organizations maintain a complete customer profile, needs, and ability to customize for the individual customer. With this, customers become active participants in the whole ecosystem. The usage of real time data becomes a reality with IoT data transmitted over the internet and analyzed by the CRM system. It gives a better understanding of the customer relationship aspect, helping organizations to operate within healthy financial margins. It also resolves the softer issues arising out of such strategic alliances such as trust and ensures that the organization remains competitive.</jats:p>",

A critical need faced by decisionmakers is to prioritize investment in security mitigations to maximally reduce risks in IT supply chains. We extend existing stochastic expected budgeted maximum multiple coverage models that identify “good” solutions on average that may be unacceptable in certain circumstances. We propose three alternative models that consider different robustness methods that hedge against worst‐case risks, including models that maximize the worst‐case coverage, minimize the worst‐case regret, and maximize the average coverage in the  worst cases (conditional value at risk). We illustrate the solutions to the robust methods with a case study and discuss the insights their solutions provide into mitigation selection compared to an expected‐value maximizer. Our study provides valuable tools and insights for decisionmakers with different risk attitudes to manage cybersecurity risks under uncertainty.</jats:p>",

Several studies in the recent past have shown that small-scale inclined magnetic field elements channel copious energetic low-frequency acoustic waves, which are normally trapped below the photosphere. These magnetoacoustic waves are expected to shock at chromospheric heights, contributing to chromospheric heating. In this work, exploiting simultaneous observations of photospheric vector magnetic field, Doppler, continuum, and line-core intensity (of Fe <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 6173 Å) from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and lower-atmospheric UV emission maps in the 1700 and 1600 Å channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, both on board the <jats:italic>Solar Dynamics Observatory</jats:italic> of NASA, we revisit the relationships between magnetic field properties (inclination and strength) and the propagation of acoustic waves (phase travel time). We find that the flux of acoustic energy, in the 2–5 mHz frequency range, between the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere is in the range of 2.25–2.6 kW m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, which is about twice the previous estimates. We identify that the relatively less inclined magnetic field elements in the quiet Sun channel a significant amount of waves of frequency lower than the theoretical minimum acoustic cutoff frequency due to magnetic inclination. We also derive indications that these waves steepen and start to dissipate within the height ranges probed, while those let out due to inclined magnetic fields pass through. We explore connections with existing theoretical and numerical results that could explain the origin of these waves.</jats:p>",

Information technology in the form of point-of-sale data, materials requirement planning software, and enterprise-wide systems have often been leveraged to assist with this. However, with the proliferation of data, storing, managing, and analyzing data on a large scale is a challenge. Blockchains provide numerous benefits such as data transparency, immutability, and traceability that are so critical in building a cohesive cyberinfrastructure that facilitates cooperation and collaboration among supply chain partners.

This is where the stakeholders have the same goals in ensuring that the end-to-end process of supply chain is achieved. The 1MSC can be considered as an umbrella that governs the whole supply chain process. The driving force behind the realization of this concept is the strong foundation of its supply chain which integrates different parties as one.

In this research, using the difference-in-difference (DID) model, the effect of participation in water management on residents' subjective QOL or happiness is empirically researched based on data from China. The results show that the positive effect of participatory water management on residents' happiness is quite significant and the extra effect of participation behavior on the participant's happiness is outstanding with the coefficients 0.073 and 0.036 respectively which pass the significance test. In addition, according to the regression coefficients of controlled variables, four demographic variables, namely the age, health, education and income, also produce significant effects on residents' happiness. It is concluded that both the result and procedure of participatory water management can really improve the participants' happiness. Extensive participation should be enhanced actively so as to increase residents' happiness.</jats:p>",

Problems often arise in the field of supply chain risk which link to commodities in Indonesia: price fluctuation, the scarcity of the commodity, supply and demand are not balanced, distribution and production costs are expensive, raw material commodities that are imported, and natural disasters. Companies that engage in agricultural business have high risk of failure.

However, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has also played an important role in the performance of these companies. Therefore, this chapter analyzes three latent variables in order to know the importance of ICT in both supply chain agility and the performance of human resources. Information was obtained from a questionnaire administered in the maquiladora industry in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. A structural equation model is generated to understand the relationships among latent variables, and three hypotheses are raised based on such interactions. Finally, results indicate that supply chain agility and the performance of human resources are directly linked to the use of information and communication technologies. </jats:p>"

The aim of this research was to verify if the adoption of green initiatives in the packaging supply chain affects the environmental, economic and operational outcomes of companies participating in this chain, according to the perception of professionals who work in these companies. The study was conducted by means of a survey directed to professionals of various hierarchical levels working in Brazilian industries of the packaging supply chain. It is a quantitative study, and responses were analyzed through statistical techniques. The results have pointed out that only the environmental outcomes of companies in this supply chain were influenced by the adoption of green initiatives.</jats:p>"

Fluorescent angiography with indocyanine green provides an opportunity to objectively evaluate conduit perfusion and, potentially, reduce the number of leaks.\nMaterial and methods. We analyzed short-term outcomes of 26 esophagectomies performed with laser fluorescent evaluation of conduit perfusion. All patients had esophagogastic anastomosis, 14 in the neck, 12 in the pleural cavity. Conduit perfusion was assessed 30 sec after intravenous bolus injection of 6 mg of indocya-nine green with SPY2000 laser technology. The results were compared with short-term outcomes of 35 esophagectomies performed without fluorescent assessment of gastric tube perfusion.\nResults. There were 6 leaks or conduit necrosis in control group while in the ICG group there were only 2 leaks on the neck: 1 in a patient with a massive intraoperative bleeding and shock, 1 in a patient with severely compromised blood supply of the gastric tube tip according to ICG imaging. No cases of conduit necrosis were found, which led to significantly lower number of severe (grade III-V Dindo-Clavien) complications, p=0,033. Conclusion Laser fluorescent angiography with indocyanine green is a useful tool which affords an objective evaluation of gastric tube perfusion and, potentially, reduces the number of severe postoperative complications after esophagectomy.</jats:p>"

The upper model (UM) determines the number and locations of parking lots in a CBD with the objective of minimizing the average impedance of all car trips. The lower model (LM) is a modal split and assignment combination model for calculating the traffic flow under various parking supply schemes. In addition to the bilevel model, a gravity model (GM) is proposed to calculate the car trips that are induced by the added parking lots. The interaction between car traveling and parking can be simulated by the feedbacks between the UM and LM. A case study is performed with real data from Dalian City. The results show that there is a negative correlation between parking supply increments and the average traveling impedance when the number of parking spaces is lower than the optimal value; however, the average traveling impedance will start to increase with the increase in parking supply when the number of parking spaces is higher than the optimal value.</jats:p>"

An economic sub-sector base model for the Indian tribal communities has been calibrated and used for simulation analysis as a reference case-study. Conclusion &amp; Results: It has been established through the simulation results that the success of short-term relief work lies in the long-term capacity building and, is critical to the performance of both current and future humanitarian operations and programs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In closed-loop supply chain systems for power battery remanufacturing, recycling and dismantling tasks will be relegated to third-party recyclers. This has significant disadvantages, inasmuch as the asymmetric exchange of information regarding the level of recycling capacity and effort after signing a contract fiscal risks to the manufacturers. The purpose of this paper is to study the “adverse selection” of recyclers and “moral hazards” hidden in their purported effort levels, based on Information Screening Models in the principal-agent theory. Our information screening model for revenue sharing will be presented, and subsequently verified using numerical simulation to demonstrate the impact of the screening contract on the expected returns of both parties. Our results show that the sharing coefficient of the remanufacturing revenue for low-capability recyclers is distorted downwards, and only truthful reporting can retain profits. High-capacity recyclers will obtain additional information while retaining profit. At the same time, as the proportion of high-capacity recyclers in the market increases, the expected return of the entrusting party increases. One critical area where this will impact the Chinese economy is in the area of new energy vehicles. We investigate a case study of our approach in new energy vehicles, which are being used to reduced CO     2     emissions, but have environmentally hazardous batteries that must be recycled safely and economically.</jats:p>"

Informed by the relational view, we identify <jats:italic>governance</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>resource sharing</jats:italic> as key mechanisms to create relationship benefits in supply chain relationships. We draw on the ambidexterity perspective to suggest that long‐term relationships require <jats:italic>governance ambidexterity</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>resource‐sharing ambidexterity</jats:italic> to handle new problems emerging in the future while successfully managing current problems, or to have a duality of short‐ and long‐term orientation. We also draw on the alignment perspective to suggest that governance ambidexterity mechanisms and resource‐sharing ambidexterity mechanisms need to be aligned. We develop a research model that explains the influence of (1) alignment/misalignment of two governance ambidexterity mechanisms (incentives and goals) on one resource‐sharing ambidexterity mechanism (knowledge sharing) and (2) alignment/misalignment of each of these governance ambidexterity mechanisms (incentives and goals) with resource sharing (knowledge sharing) ambidexterity on relationship benefits. The data for our empirical study were collected from 238 customers of a leading logistics vendor firm. A polynomial regression and response surface approach was employed to test our model. The results were supportive of our model and suggest that establishing and aligning governance ambidexterity mechanisms and resource‐sharing ambidexterity mechanisms enable firms to generate relationship benefits from supply chain relationships.</jats:p>",

The adoption of low flow showerheads in large and complex plumbing systems will not only contribute to a great reduction of shower water use in the whole water system, but also further influence the water supply system design. Hence, it is necessary to justify the redesign of existing water supply systems (such as the pipe size, storage tank volume, pumping arrangement etc.) in terms of the use of low flow showerheads. This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the design flow rate for a typical high-rise roof tank water supply system in Hong Kong with the installation of low flow showerheads. The simulation results indicate that a full installation of low flow showerheads can decrease the design flow rate by 15%, corresponding to an energy efficiency improvement of 1.5%. The potential for water savings and associated energy savings can be significantly higher when all installed appliances in homes are water efficient (e.g., showerheads, water taps, washing machines). Further work is required to evaluate the redesign of existing water supply systems for a sustainable future.</jats:p>"

But which contingency variables should managers focus on when developing a supply chain strategy? On the one hand, if important variables are omitted, the selected strategy may fail to fulfill the needs of the business environment. On the other hand, considering irrelevant variables unnecessarily complicates the strategy formation process, hence preventing well‐suited strategies from being found. As a first step toward resolving this trade‐off, our study analyzes the effects hypothesized to be underlying a set of frequently cited contingency variables referred to as “DWV3” (product lifecycle Duration, delivery time Window, demand Variability, demand Volume, product Variety) as well as contribution margins. We test the hypotheses on archival data from a leading chemical manufacturer using multilevel regression. Our findings indicate that demand variability, the delivery time window, and contribution margins are important for strategy development because they indicate to what extent companies should invest in market mediation. Volume, variety, and lifecycle duration are less important for this purpose, but may instead be used for analyzing the causes of demand variability.</jats:p>",

To improve the quality of education to meet industry and society needs requires a holistic management of the curriculum design and development process. This empirical research in Thailand proposes a knowledge supply chain (KSC) approach as a potential solution, which integrates theories and practices of KM and SCM to design an e-tourism curriculum to meet the industry and society needs in the context of the Greater Mekong sub-region (GMS).</jats:p>"

A questionnaire survey captured residents' perceptions of water quantity and quality. Results showed that 71% of respondents find the water pumped from the public system to be insufficient, and 40.9% find that water laws and regulations are implemented ineffectively. The study also showed that 85% of respondents are dependent upon groundwater wells, and 42.5% of respondents have suffered water contamination. Water quality is degraded due to pollution caused by solid waste and liquids, and salinity is increased due to the over-pumping and depletion of groundwater resources. The study recommends that the government incentivize residents to harvest water to deal with water shortages, religious motivations be explored in water conservation efforts, and water authorities should repair or replace old pipelines.</jats:p>",

Unlike the Mathadi Boards examined in Chapter 4, a great deal has been written about efforts to improve working standards in the Cambodian garment industry. The Chapter makes two important interventions in the already abundant literature on Better Factories Cambodia. Firstly, it focuses on the role of the trade agreement that led to the establishment of Better Factories Cambodia, as preferential treatment in trade played a critical part in encouraging investment in formal enterprises. It argues that trade incentives were just as important as the BFC in improving the labour standards of participating enterprises. Secondly, it examines the initiative in the context of Cambodia’s political economy showing how the Hun Sen government has used the initiative to its advantage and avoided investing in its own labour inspectorate. For this reason, the chapter asks whether Better Factories Cambodia has become a functional rival to the state labour inspectorate.</jats:p>",

The aim of the present study is to assess the distribution of contaminants in groundwater at a spatial level by using a geostatistical method, namely ordinary kriging. For this, a physico-chemical parameter data set at 14 sampling locations for a period over 25 years was assessed. Three semi-variogram models, namely exponential, Gaussian and spherical, fitted well for the data set and were cross-validated using predictive statistics. Based on nugget/sill ratio, which characterizes the overall spatial dependence of water quality parameters, it was observed that, apart from nitrate, all the other parameters showed moderate to weak spatial dependence (i.e. total hardness), indicating significant influence of urbanization, fertilization and industrialization. Spatial distribution maps of all the parameters were generated. Concentration of most of the parameters reported high values in the northern region, while silicon dioxide and potassium recorded high values in the southern and central regions of the study area respectively. The study highlighted the depleting groundwater resources in various regions of the study area, indicating that the groundwater quality is in a declining state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Contracts in grocery supply chains based on Scan‐Based Trading (SBT) have recently emerged as alternatives to contracts based on Vendor‐Managed Inventory (VMI) as governance mechanisms between retailers and vendors. In contrast to VMI, vendors under SBT remain the owners of inventory delivered to retailers until it is sold to consumers. While SBT contracts offer clear benefits to retailers and suppliers, they also carry unique inventory risks which result from retailers marketing and selling supplier‐owned inventory without bearing all the cost of mismanagement. Further risks in both of these arrangements arise from vendors’ contracting out store deliveries to third party logistics (3PL) providers as opposed to taking on the responsibility for deliveries themselves. This paper examines the effect of SBT on inventory shrink relative to VMI using data from a supplier delivering directly to stores using a combination of 3PL and supplier employees. We find that shrink levels tend to be higher under SBT relative to VMI. We also observe that supplier decisions to contract store deliveries out to 3PL providers yield higher shrink levels under SBT and VMI contracts. Based on average inventory replenishment amounts at retail stores, SBT contracts account for 10.20% in shrink relative to VMI contracts. In addition, 3PL contracts account for 2.92% in shrink relative to the amounts observed when the vendor bears responsibility for store deliveries. Our findings highlight potential losses in efficiency in grocery supply chains reflected in higher shrink under SBT and 3PL contracts that may undercut the promised benefits from these arrangements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Significant amounts of biomass residues were generated in Indonesia. While untreated, residues emit greenhouse gases during the decomposition process. On the other hand, if efficiently utilized, these residues could be used to produce value-added products. This study investigates opportunities for harnessing the full potential of palm oil residues (i.e., empty fruit bunches, kernel shells, fiber, and mill effluent). As far as we are aware, the study is the first attempt to model the palm oil supply chain in a geographically explicit way while considering regional infrastructures in Sumatra Island, Indonesia. The BeWhere model, a mixed integer linear programming model for energy system optimization, was used to assess the costs and benefits of optimizing the regional palm oil supply chain. Different scenarios were investigated, considering current policies and new practices leading to improved yields in small-scale plantations and power grid connectivity. The study shows that a more efficient palm oil supply chain can pave the way for the country to meet up to 50% of its national bioenergy targets by 2025, and emission reductions of up to 40 MtCO2eq/year. As much as 50% of the electricity demand in Sumatra could be met if residues are efficiently used and grid connections are available. We recommend that system improvements be done in stages. In the short to medium term, improving the smallholder plantation yield is the most optimal way to maximize regional economic gains from the palm oil industry. In the medium to long term, improving electricity grid connection to palm oil mills could bring higher economic value as excess electricity is commercialized.</jats:p>"

The aim was to achieve the lowest acceptable costs in an operation. The options with the supply temperature at the area starting point set to 80/60, then 60/40, and eventually 50/30 (low temperature, 4<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> generation district heating) were tested. The balance between the savings due to lower heat losses and the electricity consumption of pumps could be performed to assess the economic viability of the solution. This means that if the electricity price is sufficiently high, the model will always choose to minimize electricity consumption and thereby, maximise the profit from high temperature difference. Results concerning heat losses consider both experiences of proper insulation of pipes with variety of design outdoor temperatures (DOTs) and long term measurements from a pump station for district heating (DH) network in Canberra, Australia. We also noted that the heat energy tariffs and purchase price of electricity affect a lot optimal configuration of a DH system. For the best scenario, solutions are obtained that reach over 12% of the available saving potential after calculating 11 equations. Knowing that the policy is updated on a case study base, this is considered a promising result.</jats:p>"

In the water and sanitation (WatSan) sector, inadequate access of the urban poor to formal and public drinking water supply and sanitation services (WSS) calls for more inclusive policies. Inclusive development (ID) has social, environmental and relational dimensions. However, there is little research on operationalising ID dimensions in WatSan policy discourse analysis. Hence, this paper addresses: How can we elaborate on indicators for inclusive WatSan policies? How can these be applied to assess the design of Brazilian WatSan policies? It examines the literature on ID and WatSan, develops and applies an analytical framework with six indicators to assess ID in WSS through policy analysis: access to minimum WSS; access to WSS even if the urban poor do not have formal housing; domestic wastewater collection/treatment; water availability; participation; and WSS subsidies for low-income people. Comparison between two Brazilian WatSan policies shows that the current WatSan law scores higher on ID than the previous law but neglects key aspects of social, environmental and relational ID dimensions. The selected indicators were useful to operationalise ID in WatSan policy discourse analysis and can boost policy design assessment elsewhere.</jats:p>",

Mobile and wireless technologies are putting an extra layer of data source in this technology-enriched supply chain operation. This environment also needs to provide access to data anywhere, anytime to its end-users. This new type of data set originating from the global retail supply chain is commonly known as big data because of its huge volume, resulting from the velocity with which it arrives in the global retail business environment. Such environments empower and necessitate decision makers to act or react quicker to all decision tasks. Academics and practitioners are researching and building the next generation of big-data-based application software systems. This new generation of software applications is based on complex data analysis algorithms (i.e., on data that does not adhere to standard relational data models). The traditional software testing methods are insufficient for big-data-based applications. Testing big-data-based applications is one of the biggest challenges faced by modern software design and development communities because of lack of knowledge on what to test and how much data to test. Big-data-based applications developers have been facing a daunting task in defining the best strategies for structured and unstructured data validation, setting up an optimal test environment, and working with non-relational databases testing approaches. This chapter focuses on big-data-based software testing and quality-assurance-related issues in the context of Hadoop, an open source framework. It includes discussion about several challenges with respect to massively parallel data generation from multiple sources, testing methods for validation of pre-Hadoop processing, software application quality factors, and some of the software testing mechanisms for this new breed of applications</jats:p>"

The capacity of the adapter is optimized for the average power demand rather than the maximum power demand to reduce the size and weight of the adapter. Such a reduced capacity adapter may cause the battery to age even when the device is operated with the power adapter while under higher power demand, which is different from the expectation of most users. A recent study proposed a supercapacitor assist architecture to reduce the battery aging when the battery is powered by the adapter. However, the previous work only shows the potential of the architecture. In this work, we propose a design methodology to find the optimal setup for the supercapacitor hybrid architecture considering supercapacitor array structure and power conversion efficiency. The results show that a supercapacitor having 17.5 mF capacity and 20 V withstand voltage is enough to supply the deficient energy of a reduced capacity power adapter.</jats:p>"

The appetite for safe and efficient collection of data is a changing face of safety cultures and how teams and individuals apply airmanship principles, and how inspection crew and UAS crew interact. UAS are no longer viewed as novelty or useful addition to the inspectors' “toolbox,” but as an integrated part of safety critical system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research shows that the accelerated economic movement towards a more intelligent model of development and rapid dissemination of knowledge contributes to the emergence of new modern logistics technologies and approaches to managing global supply chains. The dominant feature of the sustainable development of transport services is the invariant concept of management, the basis of which is the socioecological and economic model. Indicators of the transport sector show a decline in volumes of transportation, but the positive dynamics of growth is demonstrated by the agrarian sector, which produces half of all export volumes and provides one third of the currency revenues of the state.Factors that inhibit the effective functioning of the logistics chain are revealed. In particular, the technological orientation of railways, mainly on route transportation, highlighted the problem of uneven development of ports at ports and railway ports, as well as inconsistencies in grain volumes in Stevedoring companies’ deals with real port facilities. In fact, there is a schedule of seasonal fluctuations in the transportation of cereals, in particular, their absence for 3-4 months per year.The rational model of management and intellectualization of grain supply logistic chain, which takes into account the indicators of artificial neural network forecasting and seasonal grain transportation parameter, is proposed.</jats:p>"

The status of Polish literature concerning the problem of failure frequency of water supply networks is also presented, and attention is paid to the absence of studies within the area of the Podlaskie voivodeship. The research part of the article presents the results of calculations of failure frequency indexes for water supply networks in the Podlaskie voivodeship. Materials from the Central Statistical Office for the period of 2015–2017 served as the basis for studies. Damage intensity indexes throughout the entire Podlaskie voivodeship were analyzed. The status of failure frequency of water supply networks was assessed in poviats of the Podlaskie voivodeship during the years 2015–2017. The mean level of failure frequency of water supply networks was also compared between the Podlaskie voivodeship, other voviodeships and the national average. As a result of calculations that were carried out, reference material was obtained for current and future studies concerning failure frequency of water supply networks in the Podlaskie voivodeship as well as other voivodeships of northern Poland.</jats:p>"

The results of the simulation showed that using SLS for the chosen part is superior to the conventional one in terms of total variable costs as well as for carbon footprint. Compared to the conventional supply chain, for the AM supply chain, the costs of the supplier reduces by 46%, that of the railways company reduces by 71%, while the overall supply chain costs reduce by 61.9%.

It was found that losses can be caused by a human factor and caused by technical errors in a system, for example, network faults. Based on the study of scientific works on water losses of internal water supply systems, as well as on analysis of various water loss options there is a new well grounded method presented aimed to achieve sustainable water saving directly in a building in the process of water consumptions. There were conclusions drawn saying that: design of an internal water supply system of a residential building should follow the scheme of reducing water consumption on the lower floors of buildings by zoning the entire system; it is advisable to use a system with water tanks; to achieve indirect saving of electric energy, it is necessary to use pumping units with an adjustable drive.</jats:p>"

The authors discuss the invention of containerization and give the historical context for US chassis provision. The chapter outlines the chassis logistical difficulties of US truckers. An overview of attempts to solve this by chassis pooling is provided. The chapter then addresses differences between chassis in the US and the rest of the world. Key chassis regulations are covered, followed by a discussion of the relation of chassis to sustainability. Antitrust issues concerning the main chassis providers and the three recently created ocean carrier alliances are covered. The authors conclude with three recommendations for improving US chassis access. </jats:p>"

Expert Consultation and Focus Group Discussion were done for primary source of data whereas reports. Journals, project reports, similar studies, books, websites and audit reports were reviewed for secondary source of data. Comparative performance of both the projects were analyzed based on technical, financial and institutional indicators along with the causes of project performance deficiency Worsening functionality, Worsening water quality and lost information were the weakness of water supply system lack of standard process, open defecation and financial issues were the main considerations to be taken by users committee to enhance their capacity for well-functioning of the system. For effective management Transfer of the system minimizing of these short comings, the system should be calibrated and should be sterilized. Project completion document should be handed over to WUSC. WUSC's WOS (Water Operators Standard) document and Business plan should be developed by WUSC in close consultation with the experts and trained WUSC about it. Access to and use of sanitary toilet by all in project area should be promoted. Ensuring these 6 indicators would be a good initiation towards the smooth management transfer.</jats:p>"

We especially focus on the procurement stage and connect the stakeholders in (near) real-time via standardized data models, interfaces and services, as well as using open-source software only. For the communication strategy, we use a new approach that incorporates the user’s roles and tasks to create role-tailored views on the dashboard showing specific task-oriented web maps. Hence, the first research question aims at identifying the roles and tasks in Austrian forestry. We identified four major roles (site managers &amp; foresters, forest workers, truck drivers, customers) and six tasks during group discussions. The second research question deals with the effects of a role-tailored map dashboard. Therefore, we evaluated the prototype in a two-week test phase that concludes with a field study with five experts. The results are twofold: qualitative using the results from field interviews and quantitative based on a now vs. then comparison with regard to the number of media disruptions. This comparison reveals that up to 80% of the media disruption in our use case scenario could be removed by using the role-tailored map dashboard.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of El-Rahawy wastewater on the water quality of the Rosetta branch of the River Nile (Rosetta River Nile) through detection of astrovirus (AstV) and norovirus (NoV) in the water and sediments of both sites. For this purpose, we collected 72 wastewater and 12 sediment samples from El-Rahawy drain, and 12 river water and 12 sediment samples from Rosetta River Nile before and after mixing with El-Rahawy wastewater between April 2017 and March 2018. AstVs and NoVs were identified in wastewater (40.2% versus 25%), El-Rahawy sediment (41.6% versus 20.8%), river water after mixing with wastewater (25% versus 16.6%), river water before mixing with wastewater (8.3% versus 0%), river sediment after mixing with wastewater (16.6% versus 8.3%), and no viruses were found in river sediments before mixing with wastewater. AstV genogroup B and NoV genogroup GI were the most frequently detected genotypes in the analyzed samples, with a peak incidence in the winter months. Increasing detection rates of both viruses in El-Rahawy drain samples and river water taken from the Rosetta branch after receiving El-Rahawy wastewater reflect the impact of this drain on the water quality of this stretch of the River Nile.</jats:p>",

Data were collected from a sample of 192 mango growers and 191 red pepper growers. Both descriptive statistics and econometric analysis applied for analyzing the collected data. The multiple linear regression model was applied to identify the factors determining mango and red pepper market supply. The result of the descriptive analysis showed that level of mangoes and red peppers production has been raised owing to high intervention and follow up of the regional government on the sector through increasing level of accountability and building competitive sprite among agricultural extension workers. 53.6% of the sample mango growers and 27.6% of the sample red pepper growers sold their produces to retailers. The result of the estimated parameter also indicated that level of mango production, sex of the household head, household family size, access to credit and total land size were the factors that determine marketable supply of mangoes by smallholder growers. Similarly, distance to nearest market, access to market information, total land size, cooperative membership and selling price were found to be determinants of the market supply of red peppers. Finally, the study recommended intervention in appropriate distribution of inputs, improvement in rural infrastructure, promoting and expanding mango and red pepper production for export and ensuring fair trade. The current market oriented agricultural system has to be supported by mechanisms of gathering and distributing market information, appropriate crop pricing and market linkages, which enhance market supply and improve the economic and social bargaining power of growers.\nKeywords: determinant, market supply, production, smallholder growers.</jats:p>"

This paper considers a dynamic supply chain, which is composed of a manufacturer and a retailer, in the presence of the cap‐and‐trade regulation and the consumers’ reference emission effects. To investigate the manufacturer’s behavior choice and its impacts on the emission reduction and pricing strategies together with the profits of both the channel members, we develop a Stackelberg differential game model in which the manufacturer acts in both myopic and farsighted manners. By comparing the equilibrium strategies, it can be found that the farsighted manufacturer always prefers to keep a lower level of emission reduction. When the emission permit price is relatively high, the wholesale/retail price is lower if the manufacturer is myopic and hence benefits consumers. In addition, there exists a dilemma that the manufacturer is willing to act in a farsighted manner but the retailer looks forward to a partnership with the myopic manufacturer. For a relatively high price of emission permit, adopting myopic strategies results in a better performance of the whole supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nStatistical data from the years 1998–2005 were used to investigate the capacity of the grain industry in eastern Australia to supply the grain necessary for inclusion of 10% ethanol in petrol (E10), in addition to the demands of grain for feedlot cattle. Evidence is provided that the variations in grain yields and grain consumption by cattle in these years are representative of the on-going situation and that interpretations and conclusions have continuing relevance. During 1998–2005, annual production of cereal grains in eastern Australia varied between 10 and 25 million tonnes. Similar fluctuations (11 and 27 million tonnes) in annual grain yields were observed between 2006 and 2014. The Australian potential requirement for E10 ethanol is ~2500 ML annually, with a grain usage of 6.1–7.6 million tonnes depending on the grain sources used. Established national grain demand for ruminant and monogastric livestock, human consumption and other domestic uses is ~7.5 million tonnes per year. In years of average or higher grain yields in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the combined grain surpluses are more than sufficient for E10 ethanol to be produced domestically. In the years of the lowest grain yields, the surplus over more traditional usages is sufficient to satisfy only 50% of potential demand for E10. The greatest densities of feedlot cattle are in south-eastern Queensland, northern New South Wales and in the Murrumbidgee region of southern New South Wales. On a regional basis, the grain surplus to feedlot demand in most years in south-eastern Queensland is not sufficient to satisfy requirement for ethanol production without competition for grain. In years of highest yields, the grain surplus was sufficient for a 240-ML ethanol plant. Northern New South Wales could support at least two 400-ML plants in years of average and above yields, once established grain demands are met. The grain shortfall in years of lowest yield for one 400-ML plant is about half a million tonnes. Grain surpluses in average years in the Murrumbidgee region are sufficient to support at least one 400-ML plant. In years of lowest yield, only a 160-ML plant could be supported without competition for grain.\n</jats:p>"

The research aims to determine wastewater release volumes over time, instead of focusing only on spatial distributions. Another aim is to identify the main determinants potentially affecting water quality in rivers flowing across the city of Sopot. The study area consists of six small river catchments located in the city of Sopot, each with an open flow channel, which lies along the bay. Studies were conducted 12 times per year in the period from March 2014 to February 2015. Laboratory analyses were performed to determine the concentration of both total nitrogen and total phosphorus. In order to calculate pollutant loads, discharge was also measured in each of studied rivers. Conducted research has shown that all analyzed streams were characterized by low total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations. The mean annual values ranged from 0.60 to 1.28 mg·dm-3 in case of total nitrogen and from 0.066 to 0.100 mg·dm-3 in case of total phosphorus. In 2012, the total nitrogen load from Poland to the Baltic Sea was 210.768.000 kg N while the total phosphorus load was 15.269.000 kg P, which means that streams analyzed in this paper supplied barely 0.002 % of the biogenic load supplied to the Baltic Sea by Poland as a whole.</jats:p>",

Per results of the survey conducted online, it can be concluded that Turkish people have some awareness (64%) of the concept of CE. However, 61.2% believe CE focuses on recycling whereas 48.2% believe it is about saving. Of the respondents, 25.9% are entirely unaware of the benefits of CE; 95.7% of consumers are not open to buy second hand, hire or reuse as an alternative to traditional ownership.

Taking such conditions as factors of economic expediency and ecological safety into account, it is more reasonable to use wind stations in order to provide consumers with energy and water. The use of conventional wind and electrical stations is an easy and reliable solution. However, annual wind velocity on most settled territories does not exceed 6 m/s or even 4 m/s. It makes the efficient use of wind electrical stations more complicated. One of the solutions can probably be the use of wind and electrical stations on the basis of slow speed non-transmission arc-shaped-stator inductor-type generators with an integrated radial and ring-shaped rotor. Another efficient solution to provide areas with water and electrical energy is to use a combined wind station with a crank-and-rod mechanism and the rod of the driving mechanism of the back-and-forth motion of the core of a magnetic and electrical linear generator and the piston of a plunger pump. </jats:p>"

Thus, three hypotheses are proposed to relate these latent variables. To validate such hypotheses, a survey is administered to 253 middle and senior managers from the manufacturing industry of Ciudad Juárez. Similarly, a descriptive analysis of the sample and the items is carried out. Results show direct and positive effects among the analyzed variables.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We argue that modern approaches to teaching Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) rely heavily on abstract descriptions of poorly framed problems. Such problems often point to a reality that does not favour the development of CSR. Instead it creates a level of abstraction between “business” and “social responsibility” because there is no real experience of the challenges of integrating CSR into business practice. The number one challenge of making CSR work is integrating it into culture and business practices. To assist in helping the future leaders of tomorrow understand their studies, we propose that a deeper integration between theory and practice is important. In this paper it is argued that this deeper integration can be achieved using small simulations in which students attempt to integrate CSR into real world situations and reflect on this experience. The reflection enables them to capture insights that are often absent from abstractions such as case studies. We offer an action research study to demonstrate how this reflective cycle works in two separate courses where this approach was applied. From this, these lessons are developed into a discussion where future directions are discussed.</jats:p>"

Customer awareness has urged the manufacturers and suppliers to produce and supply more environmentally friendly products. Social responsibility is the firms' obligation to ensure that their operation activities could reduce environmental impacts that can be harmful to the society. Environmental concern is the awareness of environmental preservation and conservation. Governmental legislation has been implemented to ensure the firms adhere to the government policies to attain greener industrial practices. Waste management refers to the waste disposal system in order to reduce waste treatment costs, pollution, and landfill issues. Therefore, the drivers are important elements in carrying out the closed loop supply chain in the Malaysian automotive industry. </jats:p>"

Based on the economic and technical analysis, through changing the better window, energy-saving ratio can be arrived to 10.4%-16.8% and economic recovery period is 4.4-10.4 years.

Therefore, it is particularly important to arrange pressure monitoring points in appropriate places in the pipeline networks. The pressure monitoring point layout is often based on similar degree of the node pressure data in the current stage. A method of optimal pressure monitoring point location in the urban water distribution networks was proposed in this paper. Since the above method did not consider spatial properties of network node. The original feature matrix data is constructed by acquiring the spatial attributes of the pressure monitoring nodes and calculating the non-spatial attributes of the nodes. The original feature matrix data will be normalized. Then the Optics clustering algorithm is used to cluster the normalized node feature matrix data to determine the location and number of pressure monitoring points in monitoring area of urban water distribution networks. Experimental results show that the method effectively ensures that the pressure monitoring points can grasp the pressure information of the whole water supply network more comprehensively and rationally, improves the economy of the pressure monitoring points layout, and provides good guidance for the actual layout of pressure monitoring points in municipal water distribution networks.</jats:p>"

Nakuru Municipality was observed to be the fastest growing urban area in East and Central Africa. Research on patterns and trends of urban and population increase and their implication on water service provision and sanitation in urban Nakuru is very scanty. This paper presents findings from an assessment of the effects of population growth between 1999 and 2017 on urban extent and supply of water and sewage reticulation in Nakuru municipality and surrounding peri-urban areas. Data was collected through remote sensing and administration of questionnaires to urban Nakuru residents and key informants from NAWASSCO respectively to elicit information on the water supply network and sewerage reticulation in Nakuru municipality for the period 1989-2014. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to analyze the data on time series. The results indicate that the population of Nakuru municipality and surrounding peri-urban areas has increased by 56.8% whereas that of built-up area has increased by 182.5% in the same period through densification of the urban core and expansion to the peri-urban areas characterized by urban sprawl. The water supply network and sewerage reticulation increased by 236km and 89km respectively within Nakuru municipality. The analysis of the maps shows that water supply network and sewerage reticulation are concentrated in the area around the urban core with very little spread. This means that the residents on the outskirts of Nakuru Municipality are not well served by the water supply network and sewerage reticulation. The study recommends involvement of all stakeholders in urban planning and in the water sector in order to increase water supply network and sewerage reticulation coverage both in the urban and peri-urban areas. </jats:p>"

Different from the traditional finance service, SCF focuses on the trading process rather than the bank credit. Depending on the large trading data and process gathered by core enterprises, SCF is able to effectively integrate the flows of information, logistics, and funds, which transforms the numerous risks of many single enterprises into the controllable risks of the entire supply chain. Therefore, SCF is capable of providing comprehensive finance service regardless of companies' size with the minimum risk level, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprises which have difficulties in receiving finance service from traditional finance institutions. The emergence of SCF has established an accessible channel to help small and medium-sized enterprises obtain effective finance service.

Methods of risk assessment (quantitative microbial and chemical risk assessment) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are used to characterize the risk associated with the use of reclaimed water for IPR, but also the environmental benefits compared with other options for additional drinking water supply. The LCA results show that IPR is competitive with other options of water supply in its energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Pathogens as the main health hazard are controlled effectively by existing and planned preventive measures. For chemicals the number of potentially relevant substances could be reduced substantially by the assessment. A demonstrator phase should now be implemented to validate the outcomes of this prospective assessment by improving data quality of the initial state and by monitoring effective impacts in an operating mode.</jats:p>",

This study assessed the mechanical damage levels of bananas in 300 cartons from pack houses to retail stores in Australia. The damage across the SC were shown to be progressive across the SC. Bruising and neck damage levels in bananas increased from the distribution centre (DC) to the retail stores. Mechanical damage in unripe bananas was influenced by the package location in the stacked-pallet, and the transport and handling of packages within the last-mile of the SC (DC to retail) further exacerbated the damage. This study further characterized the damage development by subjecting packaged bananas to simulated vibration, top-load compression and drop impact. It was revealed that the exposure to vibration resulted in rubbing; top-load package compression contributed to bruising and, the drop impact caused severe neck injuries in bananas. The knowledge of the damage incidences across the SC and causes of damage may contribute to the development of interventions targeted at improving the quality of bananas in the post-harvest SC in Australia.</jats:p>"

Both transmission and distribution electric power network are adapted for presently occurred typical conditions of electric energy demand and realization of internal tasks in normal conditions, but can create potential threat for electric energy supply security. In the context of forecasted increase of electric energy demand, inadequate power in National Electric Power System (NEPS) in domestic sources and available through intersystem connections, uneven location of sources and consumers at shortage of proper network transmission capacities, necessity of improvement of quality and electric energy supply reliability to final consumers and intensive development of renewable energy sources, present network infrastructure in area of transmission and distribution will be insufficient. Development of 400 and 220 kV transmission network, 110 kV distribution network especially in area of cities, MV distribution network especially in rural areas and realization of investments for improvement of export-import possibilities of NEPS will be necessary.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Within the context of energy efficiency and environmental safety, the creation of energy and water supply systems integrated with the units for utilization of combustible waste, low-pressure gases and industrial wastewater are of high priority for oil and gas enterprises. A method for the synthesis of these rational systems and a two-dimensional model for evaluating performance indicators are proposed. We have developed alternative structures based on the block-modular principle of equipment composition formation, which allows structurally parametric integration of energy and utilization modules with technological productions; performed pre-project evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative options for the energy and water supply system with the utilization of low-pressure gases, thermal neutralization of industrial wastewater for methanol recovery plants and designed a multipurpose oil and gas condensate processing enterprise. Integration of utilization, energy and technological installations in energyand water supply systems allows reducing the consumption of heat and electric energy from external sources by 56–100%, and water consumption by 40–50%. Accordingly, the cost of wastewater reducing by an average of 76–93% for oil and gas condensate processing facilities. Almost complete utilization of low-pressure hydrocarbon gases is achieved (the volume of flared emissions is reduced by 90–98%).</jats:p>"

Using a large database of 1,205 firms from three emerging countries in Europe—Poland, Russia and Turkey—for the time period between 2000 and 2016. The authors provide evidence that financial flexibility, achieved through conservative leverage policies, enhances companies' investments and positively contribute to corporate sustainability. Moreover, as the number of years of low leverage kept by firms increase so does the impact of financial flexibility on corporate investment. Besides financial flexibility, internal cash generation capacity of firms, and sales growth also improve the investment capability of firms, improving corporate sustainability. The results support the hypothesis that financial flexibility enhances companies' investment capability, which is an extremely essential tool for firms to have in their businesses. </jats:p>"

Thus, to explore the investment decision‐making problems of BDI and its effects on the coordination and pricing rules of book supply chain, a three‐stage book supply chain with one book publisher, one retailer, and one Data Company was chosen. Meanwhile, four benefit models about BDI investment were proposed and analyzed in the environments of symmetry information and asymmetric information. A revenue sharing contract was used to achieve book supply chain coordination. Findings: whether the book publisher and the retailer were suitable to invest in BDI, it was influenced by the cost improvement coefficient. With the ascent of the cost improvement coefficient, benefits of supply chain members will reduce, and, in different investment models, their prices show different change trends with the cost improvement coefficient.</jats:p>",

Considering this, pre-sowing microwave (MW) soil treatment has potential to reduce weed pressure in no-till farming systems. However, the effects of this transient heat disturbance on the soil nutrient profile and on the uptake and accumulation of nutrients in plant biomass warrant further study. In this study, we examined the effect of MW soil treatment on the recovery and accumulation of nitrogen (N) in wheat dry biomass using a <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N pool dilution technique over two years. Further, temporal changes in wheat yields were assessed by running sequential residual trials. The pre-sowing MW treatment achieved a temperature of 75°C to 85°C. MW soil heating increased the dry biomass and grain yields of the wheat crop over two years of study regardless of the initial N application. Furthermore, MW soil treatment did not significantly increase the N derived from fertilizer (N<jats:sub>dff</jats:sub>, %). The maximum N<jats:sub>dff</jats:sub> achieved for the untreated control soils at the higher N dose was 13%, while it was only 8% for the MW-treated soil. Despite this, the total N accumulation in the dry biomass increased by 17% because of MW soil heating, compared to the untreated control soils, revealing the uptake of N from indigenous sources. Consequently, the grain yield supported by indigenous soil N was significantly higher with MW soil treatment at 160, 440, and 740 days after heating. In summary, MW soil treatment appeared to be effective for sustaining the soil fertility over the long term, regardless of initial labeled N application.

The analysis was based on exploitation data obtained from the water-supply company for the period 2012–2016. For the analysis of seasonality a method based on average homogeneous sub-periods was used, with a relative seasonality index and the absolute levels of seasonal fluctuations being determined. Water losses from the analysed CWSS are also characterised using unit water-volume indicators within the water supply network. Over the research period, the volume of water produced and sold was found to decline, even as the number of inhabitants using the network increased. On the other hand, there is a growing demand for water used for own purposes by company, as related directly to their development. Water losses and values determined for the water-loss volume indicator both show a downward trend for the analysed CWSS. It is further observed that, in January, March and May, the loss of water is above average, while the volume of water lost in the other months is below average.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, 21 food and beverage companies listed in Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST) are employed to measure the performance of green supply chain processes. It is concluded that low pollution is the most important criterion whereas alternatives has the least weight. Reverse logistic is also second most significant criterion which means that these companies give importance to reduce their costs. It is also found out that there is not a certain correlation between green supply chain management performances with the profitability of the firms. However, it can be seen that bigger firms have higher green supply chain management performance than the smaller firms. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Lease legal relations, widespread in the field of heat supply, have a pronounced sectoral coloring, arising both from the characteristics of the property being leased, which is necessary to provide warm energy, and from the subject composition of the existing legal relations. The costs of the heat supplying organization related to the lease of heat supply facilities used in the core business are included in the heat energy tariff, and accordingly, they are ultimately reimbursed from the “consumers pocket”. In practice, there is an increasing application to norms of unjust enrichment that are developing in the sphere of heat supply, which, at the same time, must be fair, i.e. proportionate to the consequences of violations. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to study and conduct an analysis of law enforcement practice regarding obligations arising from rental legal relations in the field of heat supply due to unjust enrichment. These conclusions, in turn, will make it possible to study in more detail from the perspective of industry legislation the institution of condicion obligations, to make suggestions for improving general legal and industry standards. Methodology. Achieving this goal was ensured through the use of general scientific and particular scientific research methods: dialectical, formal logical, system-structural, comparative legal, technical and legal, scientific analysis method. Results. An analysis of the provisions of the current legislation, the mechanisms for the interaction of general civil and industry norms in lease relations allows us to conclude that the application of the provisions on unjust enrichment to relations developing in the field of heat supply, in order to rationally use energy resources, should be clearly argued. An important role in this process is played by judicial practice, clarifications from higher courts on controversial issues, which make it possible to concretize and in some particularly unfair cases the correct use of protective mechanisms in the socially significant sphere of heat supply. The authors have summarized the current latest judicial practice regarding the application of the rules on unjust enrichment to rental legal relations in this area. Conclusion. Obligations due to unjust enrichment, despite the ongoing discussions in the scientific literature regarding their place in the system of civil remedies, often fulfill a significant restorative function on the side of both the lessee and the lessor in the field of heat supply. At the same time, due to the specific rules on the lease agreement contained in the Heat Supply Law, courts often allow incorrect qualification of disputed legal relations (in particular, if the lease is invalidated, the rules on the distribution of the burden of repairs between the tenant and the lessor should be applied cannot, the rules on unjust enrichment are directly applied). The conclusions made in the article, specifying cases and conditions for the application of the rules on unjust enrichment in rental legal relations in the field of heat supply, allow us to generalize the model of legal regulation of these legal relations, including from the point of view of justice and the social benefit of heat supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article examines the international legal aspect of the EU's cooperation with Norway regarding the supply of natural gas. It was investigated that this cooperation is regulated by legal acts related to different legal order. These are: 1. Bilateral and multilateral international treaties concluded by the EU and the member states with Norway; 2. Agreements concluded by the EU with Norway; 3. Acts of EU law and joint bodies with the participation of the EU and Norway; 4. Norwegian legislation and EU member states; 5. Private gas contracts concluded between the legal entities of Norway and the EU member states. The key in this sense is the Norwegian legislation, the obligations of the parties under the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) and the rules of secondary and primary law of the EU. As part of its commitment to the SES, Norway has adopted most of the EU primary energy law rules for energy in 1994, but Norway's renewal of legislation in line with the further liberalization of the European energy market is slow. So far, Norway has only included in its legislation the norms from the acts of the Second EU energy package (2003), but the latest trends in the EU energy law - from the Third Energy Package (2009) - have not yet been implemented.</jats:p>"

This study quantified the influence of macrolevel determinants to the inbound and outbound average distance per visitor from a panel data of 152 countries using spatial econometric analysis. Results confirmed that national development and transport capacity assisted the spatial expansion of outbound travel, while tourism competitiveness, geographic attributes, and institutional arrangements regarding people’s mobility facilitate inbound visits from distant source markets. A high level of heterogeneity was found across five continents where the distance friction effect through geographic barrier, transport accessibility, and the freedom of people’s movement exhibited a different level of influences. To manage the spatial expansion of international travels for a sustainable transport future, a strong geopolitical integration system across countries within the region and adjustments to the aviation capacity to disfavor long-haul flights have been proposed. </jats:p>",

However, in Mexico, the lack of efficient institutions that ensure the appropriation of profits for investment in research within the industry is not perceived; this situation leads us to the next question, What are the dynamics of collaboration between pharmaceutical companies in Mexico? To answer this question, a database was created that identifies the alliances of the companies belonging to the Canifarma. Finally, a comparison of the number of registrations and patent applications between eight of these companies is made to measure the results of this situation. </jats:p>"

The concept of reduction of resource use and waste generation is not limited to the manufacturing processes of a focal company, but it can be embraced into product design that benefits the end users as well as stakeholders. Companies can build competitive advantages by integrating ecological performance into business value stream mapping. Reduction of resources and energy use can help companies to be cost effective and thus able to survive a market price war. Companies can enhance product quality through eco-design and sustainable manufacturing to preempt competitors. Companies can build green images to gain customer loyalty. Waste reduction can help companies to save capacity and be more flexible in shipment delivery and support customer dynamic needs. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main objectives of the development of modern industry in Russia, along with an increase in the absolute volumes of electric power (EP) production, is to strengthen control over its more rational use. Saving EP and reducing the cost of its transmission along power distribution networks is of great importance for the country's energy sector. In terms of their physical nature, in terms of production, transmission and consumption, EP losses are no different from EP served to consumers. Therefore, the assessment of power losses in electrical networks is based on the same economic principles as the assessment of energy served to consumers. EP losses have a significant impact on the technical and economic parameters of the network, since the cost of losses is included in the estimated cost (reduced costs) and cost price (annual operating costs) of EP transmission. The cost component of losses in the cost of EP transmission has a large proportion. The article presents the results of research on the possibility of application of fuzzy regression analysis for problems of assessment and prediction of electric power losses in intrafactory networks. Initial information on the network is uncertain to some extent, which complicates application of traditional methods. The calculation is presented for conventional and fuzzy regression models, along with estimation of error of these models. The relevance of application of fuzzy regression analysis methods is determined by the difficulty of obtaining reliable information about the circuit and regime parameters of intrafactory networks, the probabilistic nature of change of the modes, as well as a whole complex of affecting factors, which are generally challenging for quantitative assessment. Advantages of application of fuzzy regression analysis consist in obtaining confidence intervals of required variables (value of electric power losses) for schemes of networks with uncertain initial information on their parameters, which is characteristic of intrafactory power supply systems, and enables to consider dynamics of their variation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the improvement of social environmental awareness, the dual‐channel green product sales mode has been widely used by many manufacturing firms. In this paper, we consider a dual‐channel green supply chain where one manufacturer produces a green product and sells it through one retail channel and its own direct channel. Consumers in the two channels have different perceptions of the product energy efficiency level due to different purchasing experiences. The product energy efficiency level evolves over time and is characterized as a dynamic variable. By developing and solving the Stackelberg differential game problems under the dynamic and static wholesale pricing strategies, respectively, we obtain the main results in this paper. First, the manufacturer has more incentives to invest in green innovation when more consumers buy the green product through the direct channel. Second, the manufacturer prefers to adopt the dynamic wholesale pricing strategy in most cases and prefers the static one only when the consumers in both channels have relatively high energy efficiency perceptions. By introducing the transfer payment contract, we show that the static wholesale pricing strategy may be the better choice, which leads to a win‐win outcome for both members. Finally, sensitivity analysis further provides some managerial insights and verifies the robustness of the results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the supply chain (SC), cost reduction always becomes the main aspect for the success of the competitive market. Minimizing costs in SC can be obtained through various methods. One of the methods is to coordinate decisions among members in SC. In the recent competitive, cost reduction is not only the main objective but also carbon emission reduction has become serious problems in SC. To achieve that, coordination in SC should cover both performances to achieve green SC. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for developing a green coordinated decision model (GCDM) under costs and carbon emissions consideration. The model considers the decision-making process for solving inventory replenishment problem in SC to solve the economic and environmental problem. The developed framework is based on reviewing the past literature on the SC decision model. There are four major steps of the proposed framework: 1) defining actors and operations involved in supply chain, 2) defining parameters, variables, and performance of the model, 3) defining the modeling process, and 4) verification and validation of the model. This framework contributes to the knowledge where the modeler can provide an insight in generating an accurate decision model and its solution to improve the environmental performance.Â Â Â </jats:p>"

According to the similarity between state change of management system and that of the thermodynamics system, the revelation of the microscopic mechanism of entropy essence by statistical physical entropy, and the foundation that information entropy is regarded as the generalization of entropy by scholars, it is concluded that management entropy exists and has the same properties as thermodynamic entropy. For instance, it becomes a measure of the degree of chaos and disorder of a system and the time vector of the management system. A knowledge innovation sharing model of supply chain enterprises is constructed based on the thermodynamic entropy theory, the process of knowledge sharing in supply chain is analyzed, and the possibility of knowledge sharing among supply chain enterprises from the point of view of game theory is discussed. The principal-agent theory is used to analyze the incentive strategy to promote knowledge sharing in supply chain, and the model of knowledge sharing in supply chain is established.</jats:p>"

The growth of deterioration of the water supply network and its influence on the increase in the share of leaks in the total volume of water supplied to the network is shown. The state of plumbing is estimated as a crisis. The number of accidents in the water supply system after 2005 is decreasing, but still 2–3 times higher than European figures. Water withdrawal from groundwater sources for domestic water supply averages around 47% of the total water used for this purpose in Russia. Water intakes from surface water bodies do not have the necessary complex of sewage treatment plants and do not provide complete disinfection and water treatment. The average daily water consumption of urban and rural residents as a result of the introduction of a complex of water-saving measures decreased by 110 liters or 43%. For the years 2000–2017 the proportion of unsatisfactory samples for sanitary-chemical indicators in reservoirs of the first category decreased by only 2 percentage points, and for microbiological indicators – by 5.5. The main reason for the poor health of sources of centralized water supply is the lack of sanitary protection zones.</jats:p>"

Findings revealed interesting results. First among many was that e-government is viewed by the government as a panacea to a plethora of socio-economic problems facing the country. It was further revealed that e-government initiatives at the municipality level are quite instrumental in driving the e-government agenda in South Africa. Of note, municipalities have rolled out various e-government programs. As a result, the country's overall e-government rankings were observed to have significantly improved in the recent past. The chapter concludes by highlighting several opportunities through which e-government could be further strengthened.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the gradual slowdown of economic growth in China, the Chinese government proposed the task of supply-side reform. As a vital part of China’s economy, supply-side reform in the real estate market is particularly important. Using 29 provinces (divided into seven regions) in China as examples, this paper empirically studies the supply-side efficiency of China’s real estate market using data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the period of 2012–2016. The results showed that (1) the main problem of low supply-side efficiency in the Chinese real estate market is the low land-use efficiency, with a redundancy rate of 60.59% in China’s land space pending development; and (2) China’s southeastern coastal region, with the highest supply-side efficiency in the real estate market, reached a level of decreasing returns, and it is no longer appropriate to increase the supply-side efficiency by expanding the market scale. However, the southwestern region and the Yangtze River’s middle region, which both have lower supply-side efficiency, can improve the land utilization ratio and technology investment to change the current situations. The study results suggest (1) improving the construction land development efficiency by adjusting the input and output of the market according to the specific conditions of each city, and (2) promoting the supply-side reform of China’s real estate market and sustainable urbanization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The overall scale of China’s logistics industry is growing rapidly, and the environment and conditions for its development are constantly improving, which lays a solid foundation for further accelerating the development of the logistics industry. However, logistics services are characterized by subordination, immediacy, demand volatility, and substitutability. Low-level integrated management of logistics services seriously hinders the development of the logistics service supply chain (LSSC) for sustainable performance. Many studies have been limited to the performance evaluation of LSSCs, and the factors affecting LSSC performance have generally been ignored. This study focuses on integrated LSSCs by using an integrator’s opportunistic behavior as the entry point of research and investigates the factors that affect the sustainability of LSSC performance. On the basis of relevant theories, a model for a hypothesis is constructed and eight hypotheses are subsequently proposed. Moreover, 271 survey responses from functional logistics service providers (research object) are utilized to develop a structural equation model for empirical research. Findings show that integrators with opportunistic behavior inhibit the information-sharing behavior of supply chain members. Consequently, the integration capability and agility of LSSCs are reduced, which affects the overall performance of LSSCs. The findings of this study can provide management insights into the behaviors of supply chain members and governments.</jats:p>"

Our results showed that RW had the highest concentration of some valuable agronomic nutrients such as N, but also of phytotoxic elements (Na and Cl−). Na leaf concentration on RW treatments reached toxic levels, especially under RDI, and toxicity symptoms were shown. Regarding tree growth, cumulate trunk diameter on RW-RDI was significantly lower than on the control treatment and shoot growth was reduced from the beginning of the irrigation season in RW treatments. Maximum yield was reached on RW-FI, 18% higher than the control treatment. However, RDI strategies influenced negatively on yield, being 23% less in RW and 7% less in DW although water productivity was not significantly reduced by water stress. These findings manifest that the combination of RW and RDI can be a promising future practice for almond irrigation, but long-term studies to establish suitable management practices must be developed.</jats:p>",

The innovative design solutions for extraction of low-grade heat energy of water and systems for its transformation into energy convenient for consumption were offered. It was established that use of renewable low-grade energy of soil is widely used in environmentally safe and economically sound power systems. At the same time hydropower potential is not widely used in hydrothermal heat pump systems. It was proved that existing hydrothermal systems are not always adjusted to actual operating conditions and object location. The evidence was provided that the scientific approach to development of appropriate configuration of hydrothermal collector, to methodology of their optimal mounting and to efficiency determination depending on operating conditions is quite topical issue. The scientific novelty of the new process approach is use of special design of water collector that has modular configuration and consists of several functionally related water sondes. The efficiency of hydrothermal system was scientifically proved. The paper describes the results of experimental research of efficiency of hydrothermal heat pump system where the low-grade heat energy of water is used as a renewable primary heating energy source for functioning of the heat pump. The authors have developed experimental hydrothermal and geothermal heat pump systems to conduct the research. Both collector and ground section of the system have mounted sensors of temperature, pressure and coolant flow velocity. The software for archiving and visualization of obtained data was developed. The research procedure was developed. As part of study, observation data were received and performance efficiency of geothermal and hydrothermal systems was calculated. The comparative analysis of energy systems depending on used renewable energy source was carried out. The conclusion was made that use of hydrothermal heat pump systems is environmentally safe. The data obtained as part of study have great scientific and applied significance for engineering of heat pump energy systems using hydropower potential of the small rivers.</jats:p>"

Missisquoi Bay is a portion of Lake Champlain (USA–Canada) that is highly eutrophic and prone to cyanobacteria blooms and cyanotoxins. This study assessed the spatial–temporal influence of nutrients, turbidity and temperature in cyanobacteria distributions during a bloom event in the summer of 2006. Correlations, generalized linear models (GLMs), geostatistics and local indications of spatial association (LISA) autocorrelation analysis tested the influence of nutrient and non-nutrient explanatory variables in cyanobacteria biovolume. Total phosphorus exhibited a high direct correlation with cyanobacteria biovolume. The best performing GLMs included total phosphorus, total nitrogen, Secchi depth (as turbidity) and temperature as explanatory variables of cyanobacteria biovolume. Variogram analysis of those variables resulted in a better understanding of the underlying spatial variation process of the cyanobacteria bloom event. The LISA test revealed a moderate but stable autocorrelation between cyanobacteria biovolume and total phosphorus from 180 to 1,000 m of weight distance, suggesting the possibility of up-scaling the current results to coarse-resolution satellite imagery for more frequent monitoring of bloom events. The LISA test also revealed the spatial–temporal dynamic (movement of cyanobacteria scums) of high cyanobacteria blooms with high total phosphorus concentration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nPlant nutrition can affect the allocation of resources to plant chemical defences, yet little is known about how phosphorus (P) supply, and relative nitrogen (N) and P supply, affect chemical defences, especially in species with intrinsically conservative nutrient use adapted to P-impoverished soils. Waratah (Telopea speciosissima (Sm.) R.Br.), like other Proteaceae, is adapted nutrient-poor soils. It was identified as having cyanogenic glycosides (CNglycs) throughout the plant. T. speciosissima seedlings were grown for 15 weeks under two N and P concentrations. CNglycs (N-based defence) and nutrients were quantified in above- and below-ground organs; foliar carbon (C)-based phenolics and tannins were also quantified. CNglyc concentrations in roots were on average 51-fold higher than in above-ground tissues and were affected by both N and P supply, whereas foliar CNglyc concentrations only responded to N supply. Leaves had high concentrations of C-based defences, which increased under low N, and were not correlated with N-based defences. Greater root chemical defence against herbivores and pathogens may be important in a non-mycorrhizal species that relies on basal resprouting following disturbance. The differing responses of secondary chemistry in above- and below-ground organs to P and N demonstrate the importance of broadening the predominantly foliar focus of plant defence studies.\n</jats:p>"

In order to evaluate the morphological manifestations, the early harvest and the total yield under the influence of different irrigation and nutritional regimes, a tomatoes variety \"Vitelio\" was used. The irrigation is done with a drip irrigation system. Against the background of the same fertilizing rates in the variants with different irrigation norms there is a decrease in the early stage with an increase of the irrigation norms. A high correlation between plant height and total yield, with correlation coefficient (r = 0.899) and between sheet count and total yield r = 0.824 was found. \nThere was a negative correlation between the first and third harvests and the total yield, respectively with correlation coefficients r = -0.724 and r = -0.704. The nature of the linear relationship between plant height and total yield is determined by the coefficient R2 = 0.8. Based on a two-factor analysis, it was found that irrigation regime had a dominant influence on the two parameters considered: height and yield, which was statistically proven with a very high degree of confidence (p ≤ 0.001).</jats:p>"

Leaf analyses (LA) were used for fertilization management as early as the 1950s. Leaf contents are compared to optimum references, making it possible to adjust the fertilizer rates applied in each block. Another approach, based on the nutrient balance (NB), is to evaluate and replace nutrients that are exported from the field, or immobilized by the plant. Plantations must adopt environmentally friendly practices; in particular, fertilizer inputs must be estimated with sufficient precision to achieve the highest possible yields, without applying excessive amounts of nutrients in relation to plant demand and the storage capacity of soils. We questioned the relevance of each method for achieving these objectives. We did so using some long-term fertilization trials to compare the optimum N and K rates recommended by each method in the adult phase. It appeared that LA led to moderate rates compared to NB. It also appeared that calculating a precise nutrient balance on a field scale was hampered by a lack of precise information (i) about the biomasses produced and their composition and (ii) about the highly variable outputs of the environmental losses. On the other hand, LA provided a simple indicator of the ability for each block to achieve its potential yield. We believe that this perfectible method is more protective of the environment, without the risk of a significant decrease in yields or a decrease in soil mineral reserves.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s diverse world, one of the most urgent tasks is environmental protection, rational use and reproduction of natural resources, conservation of biological diversity. The problem of clean water is one of the most important places in the solution of this problem because surface waters are the most sensitive natural environment link. Without careful monitoring of the state indicated by the latter, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of adverse environmental situations, maintain the health of the nation and ensure the quality of life. Based on the results of the analysis of indicators of the quality of the water source, the required volumes of water for the consumer and the requirements of the consumer for the produced water, a decision is made on the technology for purifying the required water. Special climatic conditions (sharply continental climate, high summer temperatures, low water levels, etc.) negatively affect the quality indicators of the water source. The article presents the results of a study of surface water by microbiological indicators and phytoplankton. Water was investigated in the area of the channel-type surface water intake structure located in the Astrakhan region on the Volga. It is revealed that the river belongs to the category of dirty. Moreover, there is a positive trend in the development of this process. Applied water treatment technologies are not able to fulfill the tasks to ensure a safe drinking regime. It is known that chlorination of water during water treatment does not affect the removal of metabolites secreted by massively developing species of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The authors made recommendations for improving water treatment facilities.</jats:p>"

Various problems that can lead to a breakdown of the electric power supply to the construction site can arise during its active operation. The basis of the activity is the decision of the person. Activity is based on the model. The dependence of human activity on electrical energy has formed the need to ensure uninterrupted electric power supply. To solve the complex problem of electric power supply, it is necessary to develop a theory. A properly constructed theory has three levels, three components: methodology, methods, technology. The decision maker (DM) perceives the world around him and carries out his activities through processes. A process is an object in action at a fixed purpose. A constructive methodology should form the condition for the existence of a process with which the DM works. The goal of research is to select and justify the conditions for the existence of the electric power supply process in the interests of guaranteed achievement of the goal of the industrial safety.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the effectiveness of biological treatment for water softening as opposed to the conventional method with chemical reagents. The water softening effect of biological treatment, which was prepared by circulating well water in a plastic container containing water tank pebbles for 3 months, was evaluated by introducing sample water containing a high hardness under various light irradiation conditions (continuous light irradiation, continuous shading, and intermittent light irradiation). Water hardness was decreased by 82% following 72 h of light exposure. Additionally, when exposed to intermittent light irradiation, water hardness was decreased markedly only during the light irradiation. The grown algae in the biological treatment tank were identified as Aphanochaete magnum, which inhabit widespread freshwater areas, by using 18S rRNA sequencing. Our data demonstrate that raw water can be softened using a biological treatment under various lightning conditions. It shows that the photosynthesis of naturally occurring algae plays a major role in the water softening effect. Our data suggest that biological treatment could be a novel method to soften water rather than the conventional chemical treatment.</jats:p>",

Efficient nitrogen (N) nutrition may moderate the negative effects of drought stress on plants through retention of metabolic activities. The present study was conducted to investigate the biochemical responses of two millet species, foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P.Beauv.) and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), under two irrigation regimes (based on 55% and 85% soil-water depletion) and two N fertiliser levels (0 and 112.5 kg N ha–1) at four sowing dates (22 June and 6 July 2015, 14 and 30 June 2016). Drought stress increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and other aldehyde contents of the plants, ultimately leading to 52% and 55% reductions in grain yield in foxtail millet and proso millet, respectively. Antioxidant activities showed significant increases under drought stress. Nitrogen application decreased H2O2, MDA and other aldehyde contents and activities of antioxidant enzymes, whereas it increased chlorophyll, carotenoid, phenolic compound and proline contents as well as grain yield. Higher grain yields were obtained with early planting dates under sufficient water supply, whereas superior yields were obtained with delayed planting dates under water stress owing to lower temperatures and evaporation rates. The results suggest that N application could mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress on millet plants by promoting osmoregulation, alleviating lipid peroxidation, and improving plant physiological traits. Foxtail millet had higher antioxidant potential than proso millet, resulting in greater capacity to inhibit production of free oxygen radicals and making it the more drought-tolerant species.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Colistin is the last drug choice for dealing with the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria; hence, this drug is very crucial to human health. The discovery of a plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant gene, the mobilized colistin resistance-1 (mcr-1), signals a significant global health threat. Colistin sulfate is an antimicrobial agent which has been approved for use in broilers in Indonesia. Thus, this study aimed to measure the prevalence of colistin-resistant E. coli and to detect the mcr-1 colistin-resistant gene in E. coli, and E. coli O157:H7 in the entire supply chain of broilers in Bogor Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia. Samples were taken from 47 flocks that used colistin sulfate (47 samples of cloacal swabs, 47 samples of drinking water, and 47 samples of litters), seventy fresh meat samples and seven samples plucker swabs from seven small-scale poultry slaughterhouses, seventy fresh meat samples from seven traditional markets, and seventy cooked meat samples from seven small restaurants. The isolation of E. coli was done on each of the 358 samples, and 493 isolates were obtained. All the E. coli isolates were then tested for their susceptibility to colistin sulfate by using the agar dilution method. The detection of the mcr-1 gene from the colistin-resistant isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration &gt; 2 Âµg/mL) was conducted using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence value of colistin-resistant E. coli in all the isolates was at 11.76% (CI 95%; CL 9.21â€“14.91%), and the prevalence of mcr-1 gene was at 10.55% CI 95%; CL 8.13â€“13.57%). Â A very good agreement correlation existed between the colistin-resistant phenotype and the mcr-1 gene (Ä¸ = 0.939). The mcr-1 gene was found in 89.66% colistin-resistant E. coli isolates. The two colistin-resistant and mcr-1 carrying gene isolates were identified as E. coli O157:H7 serotype. This research was the first study attempt on the mcr-1 gene in Indonesia, covering the entire supply chain of broiler meat from farms to consumers. The results indicated the necessity to reduce the use of colistin sulfate in broiler management and to improve biosecurity measures, not only in farms but also in the entire supply chain of broiler meat production.</jats:p>"

One of its categories is traffic problem. The paper discusses the formulation of various types of transport optimization problems used in the design of the most efficient power supply systems in the real sector of economy. The construction of arithmetic models of problems is carried out. Their optimality criterion is cost minimization for the design of electrical network diagrams consisting of power lines connecting sources and consumers. Examples of designing optimization power layout in mathematical problems considering the transmission capacity of power lines is given. The paper also touches upon a mathematical problem considering possible transit of capacities. The task is to build a mathematical model and solve problems that ensure minimization of process losses and losses of power when designing electrical networks. The results of solving problems are presented in the form of power supply circuits corresponding to the most optimal linking of source and consumer nodes. The work is of a scientific and practical significance as it considers the problem of optimizing economic costs when designing electric power network schemes. Moreover it is based on a qualitatively different level of use of the traffic problem algorithm. The algorithm for solving the minimization problem obtained in this paper allows developing the necessary computing operations as well as quickly obtaining the results of solving the cost optimization problem in the designed electric power network.</jats:p>"

Waste water requires treatment to become a safe water resource for irrigation. This paper presents an analytical study on the use of RW for irrigation in the southeast of Spain, identifying its strengths and current limitations. It includes official data from 13 waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) belonging to two coastal irrigation districts in the Region of Murcia. The content of essential nutrients in some RWs might allow them to supply a large fraction of the fertilizers required by the crops, thus saving energy and reducing the cost of fertilization. However, the accumulation of chloride, sodium, and boron could damage soils and cause phytotoxicity to crops in the mid-term, reducing yields. Microbiological pollutants in the RW could also endanger human health and hence waste water treatment is required. In the selected WWTPs, all effluents met the minimum requirements established in Water Quality 2.3 by the Royal Decree 1620/2007 and also with the European Classes B and C proposed by COM[2018] 337. Blending RW and other water resources of better quality is recommended for the sustainable use of RW for irrigation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Neutralization methods (including composting) are widely used in the technologies of chemical and biothermal oxidation of organic matter. A promising method of waste management is their biothermal composting using controlled gas flows. The methods of process intensification are described: the introduction of inoculating additives, increasing the homogeneity of the mixture, recycling of composts, natural and forced low-pressure and high-pressure aeration, and several others. One example of the implementation of these technologies is the disposal of oil-contaminated soils. Materials and methods. The description of the implemented complexes of biothermal composting of oil-contaminated soils: functional zoning, design solutions. The main functional zones are shown: input control section, intermediate placement area, continuous forced aeration zone (inoculation), periodic forced aeration zone (stacked cavalier biodegradation), and natural aeration zone without mixing (ripening zone). The main element of the complex is the combined aeration system (forced from blower devices and natural mechanical mixing). The expediency of using high-pressure forced aeration to intensify the composting process is shown. Results. The developed mode of operation of the aeration system of the composted mass is described: the initial process of incomplete oxidation of organic matter in stacks of inoculation with a constant air flow and the final decomposition of organic matter with a periodic air flow. The constructive design of the high-pressure forced aeration system used to intensify the composting process is given. Aerobic biothermal composting is performed in aerated piles, which are formed on sites with a waterproof coating. Aeration, necessary to accelerate the decomposition of organic matter in the composts, is carried out in natural (mixing with a ladle) and artificial (purging) conditions. For purging use a system of perforated pipes and blower station. Describes measures to protect pipelines (ducts) from aggressive environmental exposure and increase their service life, to ensure the efficiency of the aeration system in an emergency. Conclusions. The possibility of practical implementation of gas flow control technology in the design, construction and operation of biothermal treatment of waste is shown. The implementation of the projects described in the article showed the need to create a generalized mathematical model that would describe in general terms the behavior of gas flows in heterophase wastes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, two noncooperative dynamic pricing strategies are used in a supply chain. Two dynamic Stackelberg game models have been built involving both a manufacturer and a retailer assumed to be the leader in order. In the two models, the manufacturer sells national‐brand (NB) product to an independent retailer or directly to consumers through a direct channel. The retailers sell a store‐brand (SB) product when they sell the NB product coming from the manufacturer. Thus, there is competition both in different channels and in products with different brands. To analyze the complexity of the model, parameter bifurcation diagrams and strange attractor diagrams have been therefore plotted. The results show that the game leader has advantages when the market is stable, but it turns disadvantageous if the state falls into unstable as the game follower can quickly adjust the strategy to seize the market. The wholesale price and the direct selling price are high that they incur larger profits if the manufacturer is dominant, but it gets worse when the adjustment speed increases. While in the model where the retailer plays a dominant role, the increase in the adjustment speed is unfavorable to retailer. By controlling the total cost of the direct channel and increasing channel competition strength and brand competition strength, the manufacturers can increase their profits in the game dominated by the retailer. In addition, the stable region within the system will be narrow since the market is sensitive to the channel competition, brand competition, and advertising indifference.</jats:p>",

Here, the authors propose an improved multistage converter topology intended for single phase solar roof top applications with battery storage. It works in six modes depending on solar‐load‐battery‐grid profiles. The whole strategy is implemented in a battery intervention power supply (BIPS) that uses energy storage integrated with the solar generator that helps in smoothing of power, load shifting, load dispatch, and load angle control. Notably, load dispatch decision is arrived based on several independent parameters that take different values at a time. A Boolean equation is derived relating the different parameters so as to arrive at a single decision. This is achieved by a variable entity k‐map. A voltage control is also implemented which is done by load angle control of the inverter current. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 570–583, 2019</jats:p>",

Municipalities are divided in three equally sized groups according to the extent of supply constraints present in each municipality. Our results suggest that income shocks lead to significantly larger increases in house prices in municipalities that are relatively more supply constrained.

One of the major steps is the identification the factors that affect using of renewable energy sources. These factors can contribute to impeding the development of green energy. The simple taxonomy of these factors is proposed. The second important step is to aggregate estimations of the factors. As a result, the authors propose the aggregation method based on Bayes rule. Compared to other methods, this approach allows us to obtain two estimates: probabilities of positive and negative hypotheses. The methods discussed are at the heart of the information system supporting the development of renewable energy sources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. </jats:p>"

Buscou-se, por meio de múltiplos casos, a caracterização de um padrão lógico de adoção de práticas de GSCM inerentes a cada nível de maturidade em gestão ambiental. Com base no estudo de cinco casos de empresas inseridas em cadeias produtivas de alto impacto ambiental (setor de suprimentos de defensivos agrícolas, setor de pilhas e baterias e setor de reciclagem de chumbo, buscou-se identificar o relacionamento entre práticas de Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) e níveis de maturidade em gestão ambiental. Para o alcance do objetivo, foi realizada uma sistematização junto à literatura que versa sobre maturidade de gestão ambiental e tipologia das práticas de GSCM. Os principais resultados apontam que: no primeiro nível de maturidade em gestão ambiental, o reativo, as organizações adotam práticas de GSCM específicas relacionadas à imposição da legislação; no nível preventivo de maturidade em gestão ambiental, as organizações adotam práticas de GSCM relacionadas ao retorno de investimentos e à redução de custos operacionais; e no nível proativo de maturidade em gestão ambiental, as organizações tendem a adotar práticas relacionadas à inovação de produtos e processos e práticas comunicacionais ambientais, visando obter vantagens competitivas baseadas em gestão ambiental. Até o momento, este artigo trata da primeira pesquisa a relacionar níveis de maturidade de gestão ambiental a práticas de GSCM, aplicada a cinco casos com alto impacto ambiental do Brasil.</jats:p>"

Ukraine is characterized by a high level of logistical com-ponent in transportation of agricultural products, which actualizes the issue of managed transformations in this field.  \nThe arguments and counterarguments on the viability of the strategy of using piggyback in the practice of build-ing a supply chain in the context of the agrarian market are analyzed. The basis of the formation of the author's vision is based on the criterion of economic feasibility. Attention was paid to the potential of piggyback in mitigating the situa-tion in the organization of agricultural supply chains by reducing: the need for storage capacities, expanding the range of exporting entities, smoothing the situation of shortages of hopper wagons. At the same time, the actual updating of the piggyback mechanism is connected with the change of the structure of Ukrainian agro-export, in the transition from the practice of raw material appendage to the strategy of creation of production chains with high added value.  It is noted that the key feature of agro-logistics is the objective need to form highly specialized segments within it. Each group of a wide range of agricultural products requires an individual, non-uniform approach in the logistics of intermodal trans-portation. Piggyback is recognized as a promising direction for the development of the logistics services market in Ukraine. However, their implementation in the practice of organizing agricultural supply chains has objective limita-tions. The segment agricultural group where piggyback is economically viable includes high-value elite agricultural products with a small average export batch, as well as high value-added agro-industrial products.\nKey words: world market, piggyback, supply chains, international logistics, agricultural products, exports.</jats:p>"

Application of asymmetric distributed traction power system with the use of distributed generation allows to increase electric energy efficiency of the feed system of rolling stock, reduce its material capacity and increase the reliability of the functioning of the railway system as a whole. The proposed structure of the hybrid electric traction system involves the creation of a new paradigm aimed at ensuring high demands on the voltage and specific power in the traction network, which will allow to improve the quality and safety of the transportation process when increasing the energy performance indicators. This paradigm will allow to form a new philosophy of building traction power systems. The key elements of this philosophy are decentralization of generation and consumption of electric energy, the use of intelligent electric equipment, distributed power supply management in a single information space of the energy process during transportation. The peculiarity of the proposed work is the optimal combination of technological processes of transmission, consumption of electric energy and transportation, taking into account the specific conditions of functioning of the electrified section: points of connection of power sources and their type, profile of the track, schedule of trains, types of rolling stock and equipment. Conceptually, the hybrid traction power system is an electric hub, in which the inputs are generating points, and the output is the power supply system of the rolling stock. The internal structure of the electric power objects of the hub is determined by the type of transformation and accumulation of electric energy and ways of managing these objects in real time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phosphate-(P)-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) are important drivers of P cycling in natural and agro-ecosystems. Their use as plant inoculants to improve P acquisition of crops has been investigated for decades. However, limited reproducibility of the expected effects, particularly under field conditions, remains a major challenge. This study demonstrates that the form of nitrogen fertilization has a significant impact on the performance of various fungal and bacterial PSM inoculants in maize grown on neutral to alkaline soils with limited P availability. Under these conditions, a high soil pH-buffering capacity frequently limits the efficiency of nutrient mobilization, mediated by plant roots and microorganisms via rhizosphere acidification. In a soil pH range between 7.0 and 8.0, nitrate fertilization promoting rhizosphere alkalinisation further aggravates this problem. Accordingly, in greenhouse experiments, six strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Streptomyces, and Penicillium with proven P-solubilizing potential, completely failed to promote P acquisition in maize grown on a calcareous Loess sub-soil pH 7.6 with nitrate fertilization and rock phosphate (Rock-P) as a sparingly soluble P source. However, after replacement of nitrate fertilization by ammonium, stabilized with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-phosphate (DMPP), five out of seven investigated PSM inoculants (comprising 12 fungal and bacterial PSM strains) exerted beneficial effects on plant growth and reached up to 88% of the shoot biomass production of a control supplied with soluble triple-superphosphate (TSP). Stabilized ammonium combined with PSM-inoculants improved P acquisition (Trichoderma harzianum T22, Pseudomonas sp. DMSZ 13134), while other strains particularly stimulated root growth (T. harzianum OMG16, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42), which promoted the acquisition also of other mineral nutrients, such as N, K, and Mn. A similar effect was recorded under field conditions on an alkaline clay-loam soil pH 8.6. The combination of stabilized ammonium with a range of consortium products based on T. harzianum OMG16, B. amyloliquefaciens, micronutrients, and humic acids completely compensated the effect of a TSP fertilization on field establishment, nutrient acquisition, and yield formation in maize, while non-stabilized urea-di-ammonium phosphate fertilization was largely ineffective. These findings suggest that the efficiency of PSM-plant interactions can be influenced by the form of N fertilization, offering promising perspectives for synergistic effects with stabilized ammonium fertilizers.</jats:p>"

The construction industry is one of the major industries influencing sustainable and social development. The construction industry and the built environment, however, have important environmental footprints. Therefore, the demand and supply sides in the construction industry must be transformed into more sustainable ones. Furthermore, the principles and emerging concepts of sustainable and innovative economy need to be adopted by the construction industry. Based on an in-depth literature review, this chapter focuses on the integration and impacts of the emerging concepts for the sustainable and innovative economy in the construction industry. This chapter is expected to be useful for academics, graduate and undergraduate students, researchers, policymakers, and construction industry professionals. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nMany Australian native plants from regions with ancient, highly weathered soils have specialised adaptations for acquiring phosphorus (P) and can exhibit negative effects of excess P supply on growth and survival. Despite this, fertiliser (including P) is routinely applied in post-mining and other restoration schemes. In this study we investigated the effect of a range of applied P on the growth and tissue P concentrations for six woody species from the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) of Western Australia – a region that it not only biodiverse, but that has experienced significant levels of mining related activities. Our data from a pot-based experiment show that all six species exhibited greater growth with increased P application up to 15 mg kg sand–1. However, at P concentrations in excess of 15 mg kg–1, dry mass accumulation did not increase further for three of the species tested. For the other three species, dry mass accumulation declined as the P concentration increased above 15 mg kg–1. For all of the study species, root and shoot P concentrations increased as the concentration of applied P increased. The internal shoot P concentration, at which dry matter accumulation either plateaued or started to decline, was in the range 1.95 to 3.2 mg P g–1 dry matter. This was ~2–4 times the concentration found in natural vegetation. These data suggest that in a restoration context, there is a potential risk that, excess P application may decrease plant growth rates for some species. Consequently, the addition of fertiliser to restored sites may have unpredictable impacts on the plant community by directly reducing the growth of some species but increasing the growth of others. We suggest that careful consideration should be given to designing appropriate fertiliser regimes for land restoration schemes in ancient P deplete landscapes to avoid the risk that fertiliser addition has the unwanted outcome of decreasing growth and survival of the target native species and increasing the abundance of unwanted weeds or aggressive pioneer species.\n</jats:p>"

As the world still faces huge environmental changes and climate problems, energy remains the major issue for both economic and ecological sustainability. Low carbon energy strategy is the main target for EU circular economy enforcing renewable energy sources which are healthy, clean, and cheap. In this chapter, circular energy act and its development in Turkey are explored and questioned. The study emphasizes the great potential of renewables in Turkey and shows that there is still much to be done to transform the energy market in order to adopt circular economy in the future. Barriers of economic risks and lack of cultural awareness strongly challenge the progress of Turkey in energy solutions. And more than that, those problems trigger the financial concerns limiting the future energy projects. </jats:p>"

In order for the blue economy to be a driving force for sustainable growth, public-private partnerships emerge as a recipe for opportunities. In addition, the growth of the blue economy can be stimulated by conventional financial instruments (such as taxes and subsidies). Since the blue economy is at an intersection of environmental health and economic benefits, positive externalities that environmental health can have on generations should not be overlooked. </jats:p>"

Despite the fact that cotton value chain has strategic importance in Pakistan in terms of its contributions towards GDP, employment, export earnings, poverty alleviation, and empowerment of women, its real value has not yet been realized. One area that has an effect on income of farmers and that has not received attention is the role of middleman in the agricultural marketing. The aims of this study were to address the skill gap of the commission agents and to develop techniques to bridge those gaps. Random sampling technique was used to determine sample size. The total sample size of the study was 50 respondents. SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was employed to analyze the collected data. Results show that most of the respondents were in their productive ages to make effective decisions and understand features of doing business. Of the total respondents 6% had no education while 94% had education of varied level. Respondents were experienced in doing business of cotton marketing. Most of the commission agents were having awareness gap regarding quality characteristics of cotton. Commission agents had moderate skills level in management of various marketing costs. Mostly the commission agents were not considering fiber fineness, fiber length, fiber strength, fiber maturity and contamination due to hair as factors towards low prices and poor quality of cotton. Weak capacity of institutional infrastructure and lack of marketing system was the major constraint in marketing of cotton. Commission agents should be equipped with training regarding maintenance of quality attributes, management of marketing costs and controlling of various factors affecting price and quality of cotton.  </jats:p>"

The chapter is aimed to develop a framework for evaluating the performance of production operations in dairy industry. An optimum production model is developed through factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) methods applied to the responses collected from different dairy industries. The hypotheses testing suggests that all five factors positively affect the production operations of dairy supply chain. The outcome of the study reveals that the dairy industry needs significant improvement in their production operations to attain competitiveness. Further, this study is helpful for the dairy industry in handling the demand fluctuation, execution of effective production and information systems, improved product quality, process flexibility, etc.</jats:p>"

With the fourth generation industrial revolution, decisional aspects in make to order flow shop environment needs to be decentralized and autonomous. One of the aspects is to consider a real-time or dynamic production environment where customers place orders into the system dynamically and the decision maker has to decide whether the order can be accepted considering the available production capacity and how to schedule the jobs of an accepted order. To answer these research questions, in this chapter, the authors introduce a new decision-making, real-time strategy intended to yield flexible and efficient flow shop production schedules with and without setup conditions, Numerical experiments based on realistic problem scenarios show the superiority of the proposed real-time approach over traditional right shifting approaches. </jats:p>"

During this period and after its approval, pro-environmental factors led to the right to transform and create protocols, agreements, and new companies in the sense of a reverse logistics or of a reversibility in the environmental effects of the supply chain. This chapter has aimed to present aspects of the Brazilian business reality in the process of implementation of the PNRS as a reflection on the perspective of product recycling and solid waste control and reverse logistics. The PNRS is in the phase of corporate expansion, taking stock of eight years since the creation of the law (2010). As some branches of Brazilian business activity have not yet had reverse logistics regulated, in the coming years there should be a much higher demand for this type of reverse business. </jats:p>"

Nevertheless, this field of research is still in its early stages, in particular with reference to short food supply chains (SFSCs). This research analyzed producers’ and consumers’ perception of the economic, social and environmental sustainability of two SFSCs of a specific quality of cheese (Parmigiano Reggiano PDO) placed in two different contexts: the first is a rural area in the Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park mountains and the second is a peri-urban area in Parma surroundings, both in Italy. The case study also analyzed the carbon emissions of shopping for Parmigiano Reggiano at dairy shops. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were employed to achieve the aims of the present study. For producers in both areas, the SFSC is a successful strategy to sell a part of their output in their own outlets, gain reputation, reduce costs and at the same time increase their levels of self-esteem. Product quality is the biggest factor attracting consumers to the outlet; moreover, it is associated with trust in the producers and the idea of combining “leisure with pleasure”. However, the environmental impact of the consumers’ purchase activities is a drawback.</jats:p>"

In the National vaccination calendar of Ukraine, vaccination against rotavirus infection (RVI) is classified as recommended, with the expected goal of reducing the number of severe RVI cases among under five-year-old children. Nevertheless, despite the positive epidemiological and clinical effects of vaccination against RVI, it remains unclear how appropriate the introduction of rotavirus vaccines is in terms of potential costs and benefits, as well as determining the optimal level of subsidy required to cover part of the costs of voluntary vaccination of the population. The aim: Study of optimal subsidy level of rotavirus vaccine in Ukraine using epidemiological and pharmacoeconomic modeling. Materials and methods: The retrospective epidemiological data of the monthly RVI incidence in Ukraine as well as the population number from 2010 to 2016 formed the information basis for determining the transmission parameter of the viral agent. The scenario of RVI epidemic process as an acute intestinal infection from the point of view of mathematical epidemiology is best described by developed mathematical model. Cost-benefit of rotavirus vaccination was studied with the use of developed pharmacoeconomic criteria. Results and conclusions: Prediction of possible implications of RVI vaccination and finding optimal level of vaccine supply involves a comprehensive study of the epidemic process peculiarities of this infection with development of an adequate epidemiological model. We have proposed a model of RVI epidemiological process in Ukraine, determining its main parameters with the use of available retrospective data of anual number of RVI cases for the period from 2010 to 2016. The developed model was used as an analytical tool for analyzing influence of different levels of vaccine supply on vaccination cost-benefit. The results of research showed that the use of epidemiological modeling in pharmacoeconomic analysis of rotavirus vaccination made it possible to determine analytically optimal level of vaccination subsidy level.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it presents a theoretical concept to identify the degree of problematization of resource related issues in the media and works out regularities of environmental discourses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDesign: The presented data of a quantitative as well as qualitative media content analysis (Nvivo) of newspaper articles (n = 1745) published in Central Europe (Italy, Slovenia, Austria and Germany) focuses on the arguments and frames used in relation to the issue of water supply. Based on a theoretical model of public debates and discourses on CSR, sustainability and environmental issues (Bourdieu, 1991; May et al., 2007; Weder, 2012a, 2012b; Castello et al., 2013; Weder, 2015a), the underlying assumption is that only a high degree of problematization (variety and counter activeness of arguments) in the media represents a public discourse. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFindings: The results show that the main water supply related sub issues debated in the media are water privatization and management. Media discourses about water as a natural resource are dominated by economic frames, in particular arguments of corporations (particularly in Italy) and political actors (particularly in Austria). Accordingly, the lack of controversy and counterarguments as well as the homogeneity of frames show that the issue of water allocation and the risk of scarcity is not problematized in the media. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImplications: Working with the theoretical assumption of a high degree of problematization as condition for public discourses, the qualitative evaluation shows a non-existence of an environmental discourse on resources and sustainable ways of water allocation and usage. This puts the phenomenon of politicization, when environmental discourses are drawn to and used by another (i.e. the political) field, up for discussion with an &amp;ldquo;abuse&amp;rdquo; of environmental claims for specific political and economic interests as worst-case scenario.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's complex environment, a high responding ability represents a core for each organization to survive in a competitive environment. To grip your position in intense competition market, the organization must design high efficiency inventory system that has the ability to respond to changes in demand and at the same time reduce holding cost of accommodation to the lowest possible value by controlling inventory drivers such as safety stock level (SS). The traditional approaches of safety stock are limited to deal with dynamic behavior of market. Advanced approaches based on soft computing allow the dynamic updating of SS level. In this paper, a highly advanced dynamic fuzzy logic (DFL) has been suggested as an innovation step to identify safety stock level in dairy industries with objective of minimizing total cost and meet with customer requirements. The proposed approach consists of three main steps firstly, identifying demand uncertainty conditions by applying fuzzy logic steps embedded by identifying dynamic (N) factor which represents the increasing level in demand in period time. Secondly, identifying of raw material availability conditions by applying fuzzy logic steps, and finally, identification of  inventory on hand conditions by applying fuzzy logic steps. It is necessary to identify the level of SS dynamically in fuzzy logic as an output embedded with identifying of period specification concept which describes states of demand in a specific period in which the demand is high, medium, or low which leads to identify maximum values of universe of discourse of output (safety stock). Here Matlab program was used. The provided solution demonstrates the proposed model validity. There has been a significant reduction in safety stock level ranging from (7-98)% depending on product type and period specification with a reduction also in holding cost, while keeping the requirements fulfillment of customers demand</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wind and solar PV have become the lowest-cost renewable alternatives and are expected to dominate the power supply matrix in many countries worldwide. However, wind and solar are inherently variable renewable energy sources (vRES) and their characteristics pose new challenges for power systems and for the transition to a renewable energy-based power supply. Using new options for the integration of high shares of vRES is therefore crucial. In order to assess these options, we model the expansion pathways of wind power and solar photovoltaics (solar PV) capacities and their impact on the renewable share in a case study for Germany. Therefore, a numerical optimization approach is applied on temporally resolved generation and consumption time series data to identify the most efficient and fastest capacity expansion pathways. In addition to conventional layouts of wind and solar PV, our model includes advanced, system-friendly technology layouts in combination with electric energy storage from existing pumped hydro storage as promising integration options. The results provide policy makers with useful insights for technology-specific capacity expansion as we identified potentials to reduce costs and infrastructural requirements in the form of power grids and electric energy storage, and to accelerate the transition to a fully renewable power sector.</jats:p>"

In this study, nucleic acid testing (NAT) for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV RNA was performed in asymptomatic blood donor samples in the city of Campinas, located in the southeast region of Brazil (1962 in 2015 and 1775 in 2016). The prevalence of reactive NAT was 0.15% in 2015 and 0.62% in 2016 for dengue, 0.05% in 2015 and 0.17% in 2016 for Zika, and 0% in both years for chikungunya. These results demonstrate the weakness of the clinical interview in screening these blood donors. Furthermore, positivity for ZIKV was detected in March 2015, 1 year before the first reported cases in the region. These data attest the feasibility of using donor samples held in library as a tool for retrospective epidemiological evaluation, which is particularly interesting considering emerging pathogens, for which data on their spread and penetrance are initially scarce.</jats:p>",

There are several disruption risks associated in supply chains, of which few can argue that the disruption of communication, especially product identification and data capture, is the most important potential bottleneck. It is important in a lean environment to identify potentially disruptive supply chain events for each node in the network.

The main motive is to optimize the whole process and achieve higher efficiency. There are a lot of things which a thermal power plant looks into before finalizing a deal, such as the price, quality of goods, etc. Thus, it is very important for the raw material providers to understand each and every aspect of the demands of the thermal power plant.

In this paper, a decoupling method was used to simulate freezing process of food products at different locations. Firstly, the internal airflow distribution model of the freezing chamber was established to simulate the airflow field in freezing chamber under different velocities of air supply. The mainstream air flow rate around each food product was then calculated as the ambient air velocity at which the food freezes. Then, a validated lumped parameter model was used to simulate the freezing process of individual food product, and the effects of freezing conditions on freezing process at different locations were studied. The results showed that there were large differences in the freezing conditions of foods at different locations in freezing chamber, which were mainly reflected by the difference in ambient air velocity. Compared to air velocity, air temperature was distributed rather uniformly in freezing chamber. With the increase of supply air velocity of air coolers, the ambient air velocity around food products in freezing chamber increased almost linearly.</jats:p>"

Pursuing energy transition through supply-side constraints would have major geopolitical and economic consequences. Depending on the criteria and instruments applied, supply cuts for fossil fuels could drastically reduce and reorient major financial flows and reshape the spatiality of energy production and consumption. Building on debates about just transitions and supply constraints, we provide a survey of emerging interventions targeting the supply of, rather than the demand for, fossil fuels. We articulate four theories of justice and criteria to prioritize cuts among fossil fuel producers, including with regard to carbon intensity, production costs, affordability, developmental efficiency and support for climate change action. We then examine seven major supply constraint instruments, their effectiveness and possible pathways to supply cuts in the coal, oil and gas sectors. We suggest that supply cuts both reflect and offer purposeful political spaces of interventions towards a ‘just’ transition away from fossil fuel production. </jats:p>",

The aquifer is currently overexploited with an exploitation rate of 163%, which led to a generalized drop in the piezometric level in the order of 20 cm/year. This study applied conventional techniques such as hydrochemical compositions, multivariate statistical methods and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). To better identify the processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater quality of Triassic aquifer and its suitability for drinking uses, 14 well water samples from the Triassic aquifer were analysed for physical character and chemical composition. In the groundwater, the respective order of cation and anion concentration was Na&gt;Ca&gt;Mg&gt;K and SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>&gt;Cl&gt;HCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. The chemical data of water samples from the study area presented by plotting on a Piper diagram reveals the predominance of two hydrochemical types: a Na-Ca-Mg-SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> facies and a Na-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> facies. Analytical results demonstrate that the chemical composition of groundwater in Triassic aquifer is strongly influenced by residence time and flow path. Water quality deteriorates going from southwest to northeast across the region, coincident with the appearance a clay layer limiting the infiltration of rainwater. The majority of ions are above the maximum desirable limits recommended for drinking water by WHO guidelines and Tunisian Standards (NT.09.14). Based on the Water Quality Index (WQI), 36% of water samples of the Triassic aquifer are classified as \"poor water\" and they cannot be used for drinking purposes without prior treatment.</jats:p>"

To achieve high solar fractions in heat supply of single family houses, the necessary integration of big water volumes is challenging. To evaluate its functionality, a system model of a solar thermal combisystem for space heating and domestic hot water supply for dynamic system simulation was built. The key component is a PCM volume for long term heat storage. While conventional heat storage concepts with SAT release the latent heat a few degrees below the melting temperature, with the concept of stable supercooling latent heat can be stored for long periods of time at ambient temperature. This allows the design of a partly loss-free storage. Solar fractions were evaluated for simulation runs with two building variations. Annual specific space heating demands of 15 and 30 kWh/(m2a) and a domestic hot water demand of a typical single family house were considered. A sensitivity analysis on solar fractions of domestic heat supply was performed by variation of the collector field and the PCM volume. While the increase of the PCM volume from 4.5 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to 9 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> shows moderate effects in all simulation runs, an increase of the collector area has substantial effects on the share of solar heat on the total energy demand of the building.</jats:p>"

In an interview-study with enterprise and industry representatives, we analyzed whether WHP as one aspect of CSR is already realized within the supply chain and how interactions within the supply chain and networks can be described in terms of WHP. The results showed that issues of occupational safety are relevant within business relationships, but WHP in general is found to be less so. Networks outside the supply chain are often used to support WHP. The most-mentioned practice to ensure occupational health in supply chains is the control of suppliers (e.g., through audits). Collaborations (e.g., joint projects) were somewhat less stated. In conclusion, enterprises need to establish internal structures to conduct successful WHP within their supply chain. Future research should investigate factors that foster or hinder the process of establishing WHP within supply chains. </p>"

To solve these limitations, this chapter proposes a methodology for the design of traceability systems in FAP which allows increasing supply chain visibility, coordination between deliveries and social conditions, and therefore, possible impacts on public policy implications. A qualitative and quantitative comparison of the conventional frameworks is carried out and contrast with the needs of the programmes studied. Also, new criteria are also added to adapt the design to the technological infrastructure and the socio-demographic conditions of the territory. The methodological proposal is applied to the Bienestarina nutritional programme in Colombia, where the technologies and tools to subsequently design the traceability system are proposed. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prediction models have become essential for the improvement of decision‐making processes in public management and, particularly, for water supply utilities. Accurate estimation often needs to solve multimeasurement, mixed‐mode, and space‐time problems, typical of many engineering applications. As a result, accurate estimation of real world variables is still one of the major problems in mathematical approximation. Several individual techniques have shown very good estimation abilities. However, none of them are free from drawbacks. This paper faces the challenge of creating accurate water demand predictive models at urban scale by using so‐called committee machines, which are ensemble frameworks of single machine learning models. The proposal is able to combine models of varied nature. Specifically, this paper analyzes combinations of such techniques as multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines, extreme learning machines, random forests, adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems, and the group method for data handling. Analyses are checked on two water demand datasets from Franca (Brazil). As an ensemble tool, the combined response of a committee machine outperforms any single constituent model.</jats:p>",

The primary contribution of this paper is to construct an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the overall cost of transportation cost and slow charging cost by considering the optimal driving route of EV, the selection of power supply mode and the slow discharging or charging management in the depot. The transportation cost is consisted of fast charging cost, battery swapping cost, battery life loss cost and vehicle loss cost. The secondary contribution of this paper is to improve a novel optimization algorithm called natural aggregation algorithm (NAA) as integer version to solve effectively the proposed model. Taking 33-node logistics distribution system as an example to carry out numerical simulation, the impacts of power supply mode planning on transportation cost and slow dis/charging cost are analyzed, the impacts of slow dis/charging strategy on the total cost are analyzed, and the effectiveness of proposed model in 13-node, 64-node, 112-node logistics distribution system are comparatively analyzed. The simulation results have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Precast concrete has typically long lead time, starting from order placement, production stage, to delivery to project site, all of which requires good supply chain management. As a consequence, the risks of its supply chains are inevitable and must be anticipated to ensure the success of a project. The aim of this research is to assess the risks of the supply chain of precast concrete from production to delivery to projects. WKB, a government-owned company that produces precast concrete, has been used as the case study. Activities along the supply chain were mapped based on five dimensions of Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR), i.e. Plan – Source – Make – Deliver – Return, upon which risks were identified. Data was collected through in-depth interview and questionnaire survey to key persons of WKB. A 1-5 Likert scale was used to quantify the occurrence and severity of risks along the supply chain. The identified risks were classified into four levels based on the multiplication of the occurrence and the severity, i.e. critical, major, moderate, and minor. A total of nine critical risks were found along the supply chain, i.e. sales forecast and planning for production (Plan); production capacity of natural material vendors (Source); sudden change of production, shortage of skilled workers, additional cost for land stockyard rental, and renewal for industrial land lease license (Make); risk of non-standard transportation (Deliver); defective and failed products (Return). This research provides a valuable understanding of the risks of the precast concrete supply chain and the mitigation strategies.</jats:p>"

The literature review showed the importance of supply chains and the use of strategic criteria in managing relationships with suppliers. Based on the model proposed by Oflac, the authors studied a local subsidiary of a global company of components for the automotive industry. Through this case study, it was possible to understand how a firm establishes strategies and performs in the practice its supply relationship management activities. Results suggest that the existence of strong and continuous relationships creates advantages for companies, allowing them to remain competitive in the markets. The strategies of selection, evaluation, and development of suppliers enable companies to filter the best partners and develop their capabilities to achieve greater profits. </jats:p>"

Through sensitivity analysis of model parameters, the influence of inequity aversion characteristics of retailers on contract parameters is analyzed by a numerical example. The result reveals that the cooperative system based on buy‐back contract can coordinate such supply chains.

The study examines cut-flowers systems from raw material extraction to final product commercialization for two markets (London and Miami) and analyzes two agroecosystems: one certified system and one uncertified system. The transport phase to London resulted in more significant environmental impacts than the transport phase to Miami, and climate change (GWP100) category was significant in both cities, generating values of 9.10E+00 and 2.51E+00 kg CO2-eq*FU for London and Miami, respectively. Furthermore, when exclusively considering pre-export phases, the uncertified system was found to have a greater impact than the certified system with respect to fertilizer use (certified 1,448E-02 kg*FU, uncertified 2.23E-01 kg*FU) and pesticide use (certified 1.24 E-04 kg*FU, uncertified 2.24E-03 kg*FU). With respect to the crop management, eutrophication (EP) and acidification (AP) processes imposed the greatest level of environmental impact. Strategies that would significantly reduce the environmental impact of this supply chain are considered, including the use of shipping and a 50% reduction in fertilizer use.</jats:p>"

Bullet trains can generate energy feedback when they brake, which should not be neglected. In this study, the effects of energy feedback on the unbalance issue are analysed, under different operating conditions of the trains. A collaborative unbalance compensation method (CUCM) for the high‐speed railway is proposed in this work to lower the compensation capacity of the expensive power electronics compensation devices. To ensure that the CUCM works well, a further analysis of the two compensation principles, the railway power conditioner principle and Steinmetz principle, was carried out. The analysis results showed that the two compensation principles have different implementation methods and compensation current expressions, but the compensation essences were the same. According to the principle analysis results, a collaborative strategy was used. A capacity analysis of the CUCM, based on the actual operating situations of the bullet trains, was also completely done in this study. The simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed CUCM could adequately compensate the unbalance current of the high‐speed railway power systems well with a low cost, in both traction and energy feedback situations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On behalf of VRRSP Consultants, LLC, and Central Texas Regional Water Supply Corporation (CTRWSC), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA), conducted further intensive cultural resources investigations of the Vista Ridge Regional Water Supply (Vista Ridge) Project in Burleson, Lee, Bastrop, Caldwell, Guadalupe, Comal, and Bexar Counties. The project will involve installation of a 140.2-mile-long, 60-inch-diameter water pipeline from Deanville, Burleson County, Texas, to north-central San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The area of potential effects (APE) will consist of the proposed centerline alignment and an 85-foot-wide corridor for temporary and permanent construction easements; however, SWCA surveyed a 100-foot-wide corridor to allow for minor shifts in the alignment. This addendum report details the findings of additional cultural resources investigations between 2016 and 2018, on the alignment. The Vista Ridge Project is subject to review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 USC 306108) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800), in anticipation of a Nationwide Permit 12 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the work is subject to compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit No. 7295, as the Vista Ridge Project ultimately will be owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Furthermore, all human burials in the state of Texas are protected by law, as per the Texas Health and Safety Code Section 711 General Provisions Relating to Cemeteries and the Texas Administrative Code Title 13, THC, Chapter 22 Cemeteries, Sections 22.1 through 22.6. If human burials are encountered in the Project Area and the remains are determined to be Native American, they will be handled in accordance with procedures established through coordination with the THC; work in the affected area would only resume per THC authorization. Between 2016 and 2018, SWCA investigated approximately 29.5 miles of the current 140.2-mile-long project corridor and the proposed 6.9-mile-long wellfield pipeline that was not previously surveyed during the prior 2015 investigations (Acuña et al. 2016). Investigations consisted of intensive pedestrian survey augmented with shovel testing and hand-excavated auger probes and/or mechanical backhoe trenching in select areas. In addition, SWCA investigated the 25.82-acre terminus site slated for the construction of an integration system (Atwood and Ward 2017). SWCA also surveyed additional mileage, which included rerouted areas that are no longer part of the currently proposed alignment. SWCA excavated 967 shovel tests, 96 auger probes, and 85 backhoe trenches during these additional investigations. SWCA documented or further investigated 28 cultural resources within the Vista Ridge Project during the 2016 to 2018 investigations. Of the 28 resources, seven were isolated finds that did not warrant formal site recording or require additional investigations. The remaining 21 cultural resources include 15 prehistoric sites, three historic sites, and three multi-component sites with both prehistoric and historic cultural materials. Of the 21 sites, two (i.e., 41BP960 and 41BP961) are currently UNDETERMINED regarding eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), and one site (i.e., 41GU177) was determined to be ELIGIBLE for listing on the NRHP and for designation as a SAL. SWCA conducted testing and data recovery excavations at site 41GU177 and the results of testing investigations conducted under Permit No. 7295 are presented as an appendix to this report (Rodriguez et al. 2017); the data recovery investigations of site 41GU177 were completed under Permit No. 8231 and will be a separate report. Additionally, sites 41BP960 and 41BP961 have been avoided by design alignment changes and will not be impacted by the Vista Ridge Project. The remaining 18 cultural resources sites are considered NOT ELIGIBLE for nomination to the NRHP or for designation as SALs and no further cultural resources investigations or avoidance are recommended. In addition, SWCA documented two cemeteries (the Hill Cemetery and the Hoffman Cemetery) during the 2016 to 2018 investigations. Due to subsequent reroutes, the Hill Cemetery (located within the boundaries of site 41BP818) is now avoided and will not be impacted by the project. Mechanical scraping was conducted adjacent to the Hoffman Cemetery in compliance with the Texas Health and Safety Code; no evidence of interments was identified within the project area. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4 and the ACT, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources within the project area. Two sites (i.e., 41BP960 and 41BP961) are recommended as having UNDETERMINED eligibility for listing on the NRHP or for SAL designation and one site (41GU177) is recommended as ELIGIBLE. The remaining 18 are recommended as NOT ELIGIBLE for listing on the NRHP or for SAL designation. Site 41GU177 has been mitigated and the results will be presented in a stand-alone report (Nielsen et al. 2019). The two sites (41BP960 and 41BP961) of UNDETERMINED eligibility have been avoided by design alignment changes and will not be impacted by the project. No further work or avoidance strategy is recommended for the remaining 18 archaeological sites identified during the Vista Ridge Project.</jats:p>"

At the same time, they are integrating their SC activities in such a way so as to reduce system cost while satisfying the needs of their consumers. Thus, organizations collaborate with the efficient suppliers in order tomeet the quality level and customers requirements in terms of economic and environmental aspect. In this study, an optimization mathematical model is formulated for selecting suppliers with respect to interrelated criteria while taking care of ecological feature. An application is illustrated on an Indian manufacturing company of microwave oven. We propose an integrated supplier selection approach that consists of three stages. In the first stage, a dimension reduction method is utilized to group the variables as per interrelated criteria. An integrated methodology of mean and standard deviation along with Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed in the second stage for assessing the performance of suppliers in quantitative terms. The final stage comprises of a bi-objective mathematical model. The model is formulated to minimize the system cost while simultaneously minimizing carbon emission. The model helps in efficient identification of the procurement amount of products and the appropriate distribution center (DC), which is based on customers demand and the DC capacity to deliver goods to the Retail Stores (RSs). A fuzzy goal programming approach is utilized further to create a trade-off between two contradictory goals of the optimization model. The results suggest that integrating environmental with economical aspect can improve the performance of the SC network.</jats:p>"

Process innovation (PI) has also been applied through cleaner production, environmental management system, ecodesign, and so on to address both customers' needs and legislations by policymakers. Although prior studies reveal the effect of sustainable practices, LP, and PI on sustainable performance separately, less is known on the integrated effect of them on sustainability performance. Moreover, studies on mediating effect of LP and PI on sustainability performance are scant. This is significant as LP and PI are considered to be the enablers for achieving sustainability performance. This research addresses this knowledge gap. The research first theorises a model integrating these four major constructs (sustainability practices, LP, PI, and sustainability performance) through hypotheses development. Subsequently, using structural equation modelling, it is tested whether each of sustainability practices, LP, and PI effect sustainability performances. Additionally, mediating effect of LP and PI between sustainability practices and performances is derived. The study uses data from 119 SMEs within manufacturing industries in the Midlands, United Kingdom. Further, a few case studies have been undertaken to validate the findings from quantitative analysis. The overall results show that although sustainability practices, LP, and PI help achieve sustainability performance of SMEs supply chain through efficiency and responsiveness respectively, the mediating effect LP is more compared with PI. Moreover, SMEs adopt LP when they are economy focused and implement PI when they are pressurised by customers and/or policymakers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For ecologic and economic reasons tailings, waste rock and water management become progressively important factors in the mining industry. The European Union funded project ‘Integrated mineral technologies for more sustainable raw material supply’ (ITERAMS) aims to (1) close the water cycle of the mineral processing plant (i.e. minimizing the release of wastewater to the adjacent environment), and (2) to use tailings (and waste rock) as raw materials for geopolymers. This will (1) enable significantly more efficient water recycling at the mining sites, (2) deliver cost savings and added income due to the valorisation of solid waste residues, and (3) minimize the overall environmental footprint of the mining industry and will therefore help improving its performance and as a consequence its social position. The developed solutions influence the total lifecycle of the mining operation, as they provide input to project planning and operational phases as well as to the closure and recultivation. In this paper, the valorisation of the tailings and the waste rock is discussed. The main applications of the geopolymer products are (1) backfill material to fill open cavities from the mining operation and (2) a cover for surface deposits of tailings to store them environmentally safe – i.e. seal them off from surface water streams and oxidising conditions.</jats:p>"

Therefore, obtaining on-line information about the occurrence of emergency operating conditions, and, therefore, minimizing the time for making operational decisions on their elimination, is an urgent task. Known methods and technical control means are complex, expensive and not effective enough. At the same time, they have both advantages and disadvantages. In this respect, it is very important to work out efficient technical means of remote control of power line sectionalizing circuit-breakers of the agro-industrial complex on the basis of innovative methods of monitoring. The proposed control method is implemented in a device for remote control of the overhead line circuit-breaker operation based on an analog-to-digital converter, with subsequent software-based processing of the received data on a computer.

Accordingly, waste management is a subject of environmental economics, at which point public policies come into play particularly at the level of local governments and gain importance. However, this is not only a matter of public policies but also requires the active involvement of the private sector and social participation.

To address this model, we consider a shortage product produced and sold within a single period in the stochastic market. The model allows the system efficiency to be achieved as well as it will improve the profits of all supply chain members by tuning the contract parameters. We used the expected utility function to describe the loss‐aversion member’s influence coefficient. The decisions of chain members under different conditions are studied by simulation analyses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the traditional double closed-loop control strategy for VSC-HVDC transmission system that supply power to passive networks, the control structure is complex, the PI parameters are more difficult, the tuning is slow, and the response speed is slow. Rectifier-side direct power control based on model prediction and direct AC voltage control strategy on inverter side are proposed. Based on the discrete mathematical model of the converter, the system output under all switching function combinations is calculated by the ergodic method, and the switching function that minimizes the objective function is selected to act on the inverter. The utility model has the advantages of simple structure, no complicated PI parameter setting, fast dynamic response, high voltage quality electric energy to the passive network, good steady state performance and dynamic performance. The simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The cancer incidence burden is expected to rise to over 85% in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> This alarming trend underscores the need to develop evidence-based interventions that can effectively handle this volatile epidemic. The evidence generation entails the collection of adequate information on burden, pattern, and prevalence of cancer relative to capacity to promote effective decision-making. Accordingly, this study documents the prevalence and types of cancer in Kenya (demand side) and to determine the diagnostic and treatment capacity of the various health facilities to handle cancer cases (supply side). To investigate demand and supply factors for cancer control, the study surveyed 7 of the 47 counties in Kenya during 2013 to 2014. It sampled 1048 patients with cancer records and 12 health-care facilities. The study found that the most frequent age for female patients was at age 52, while for men was at age 62. The most prevalent cancer in women was breast cancer and cancer of the cervix, while for men was cancer of the esophagus and prostate. It was also found that children and rural populations were more vulnerable than it was thought, hence defying the local perception that cancer inflicts only adults and those in urban areas. Accessing cancer screening and treatment was one of the major hurdles as most cancer care services in Kenya were concentrated within a 5-km radius of each other in Nairobi. The limited capacity with respect to diagnosis and treatment has implications to issues of access, proximity, and availability. It is critical that policy makers and practitioners closely review the current public and individual perceptions about the cancer problems and mitigation strategies. </jats:p>",

In the analysis process, fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to weight these dimensions and criteria and the performance of the energy companies are ranked by using fuzzy MOORA approach. The findings show that feedback is the most significant dimension and data security and physical security are the most important criteria. Another important conclusion is that the companies, which have high profitability, have better performance regarding service quality. Thus, it is recommended that the companies should mainly focus on the ways of getting necessary feedback from their customers, such as conducting a survey.</jats:p>"

At the aggregate level, studies have modelled the simultaneity of demand and supply, and different methods have been used. This study proposes an alternative framework for modelling utilisation, which yet separates demand and supply factors, the disequilibrium theory of demand and supply. This theory is useful in modelling data that reflect that not all health care demand is met by health care providers and not all health care supply is taken by consumers. Such disequilibrium arises due to rigid prices and quantity rationing. We use the theory to model maternal health care utilisation and user fee exemption at mission health care facilities in Malawi. The study uses switching regression methods and data from the Malawi Health Management Information System. Results show that user fee exemption is associated with increased utilisation of maternal health care. Demand and supply regime classification shows that many of the health facilities met much of the demand, whereas the rest only provided as much maternal care as their maximum capacity. In the latter case, intended maternal health care utilisation targets may not have been met.</jats:p>",

Thus, the South Korean government requires information about the economic value of improving residential NG supply reliability for planning NG supply. This article aims to measure the value using a specific case of South Korean residential consumers. The choice experiment (CE) approach was adopted for this purpose. The selected four attributes are the duration of interruption, the season of interruption, the time of day, and the day of the week. The value trade-off works among the four attributes and price attribute were sought and completed in a nationwide CE survey of 1000 households. The respondents revealed statistically significant willingness to pay for a decrease in the duration of interruption, avoiding interruption during winter rather than non-winter, and preventing interruption during off-daytime (18:00 to 09:00) rather than daytime (09:00 to 18:00). For example, they accepted a 0.10% increase in the residential NG bill for a one-minute reduction in interruption during NG supply interruption, a 5.16% increase in residential NG bill for avoiding interruption during winter rather than non-winter, and a 2.94% increase in residential NG bill for preventing interruption during off-daytime rather than daytime. However, they placed no importance on the day of the week. These results can be useful for policy-making and decision-making to improve residential NG supply reliability. It is necessary to conduct a study at regular intervals on the value of NG supply reliability because regarding NG supply reliability, it is difficult to maintain a specific value.</jats:p>"

Many countries of the world with developed irrigation systems face problems of lack or inadequacy of financial resources to maintain these systems in an efficient state. There is the necessity to find effective financial and organizational mechanisms to address these problems. The purpose of this article is to summarize and analyse the experience of setting fees for the supply of water for irrigation in various socio-economic conditions and to find out possibilities of improving systems of payment collection for the provision of irrigation services and in particular, for irrigation water supply. The analysis is based on a wide range of conditions specific for both developing and developed countries. In addition, the article attempts to assess the experience of using the amount of payment for irrigation water as an incentive for cost recovery to achieve financial sustainability and demand management for the efficient use of water resources. Quotas, water markets, subsidies, as well as information/educational problems have been considered as incentives of water resources demand management. We have considered special features of the tariffs formation in the Central Asia countries. The study has demonstrated that the two-stake tariff implementation will enable to compensate the irrigation services expenses at the level acceptable for water users in case of cultivation of crops generating an adequate income for the tariff’s financing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Annurca is the most cultivated apple variety in the Campania region (Italy). It is an Italian protected geographical indication product and its management must follow a strict product specification which requires a typical postharvest treatment: the fruit must be subjected to a reddening process in air (‘melaio’) that improves the red colour and the flavour of the fruit but is very expensive and time consuming. For this reason there is sometimes a tendency to skip the ‘melaio’ process, but in this case the fruit cannot be labelled as ‘Melannurca Campana PGI’. The purpose of this work was to discriminate ‘melaio’ treated fruit from untreated fruit using near infrared spectroscopy. A further objective of the work was the non-destructive evaluation of the apple storage conditions which can affect the product quality. Fruit of Annurca ‘Rossa del Sud’ subjected or not subjected to the reddening treatment in ‘melaio’ were stored at 0.5℃ in air (Air) or in controlled atmosphere (1%O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, 0.7% CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) for eight-month duration. Following storage, fruit were analysed for standard maturity indices (flesh firmness, soluble solids, acidity) and the near infrared spectrum of each fruit was collected. The spectral data, subjected to various pre-treatments, were used to calculate a calibration model by applying partial least squares-discriminant analysis. The best model allowed discrimination of fruit immediately after storage under different conditions, but with 0 days of shelf life, to be classified with a 93.3% correct classification rate for the prediction set. However, after seven days of shelf life at 20℃, post-storage, correct classification rate dropped to 70%, but it was always possible to discriminate the two treatments (96.6% correct classification rate). The results of this preliminary work suggest a possible use of the portable near infrared instrument in the monitoring of the Annurca (protected geographical indication) supply chain. </jats:p>",

Methods It is a cross-sectional study with 27 families of farmers (n=91). The socioeconomic, anthropometric, biochemical, food availability and perception of food insecurity indicators of the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale, as well as the time of supply and annual income originating from the program, were evaluated. Results Food insecurity, as measured by the scale, was present in 25.9% (n=7) of the families. Food insecurity was associated with socioeconomic factors such as per capita income, the presence of children at home and the number of residents. Food and nutritional insecurity caused by a low caloric availability (&lt;2500kcal/day) occurred in 11.0% (n=3) of the families. Presence of dystrophies such as overweight, low weight and short stature individuals occurred in 89.0% (n=24) of the families. Conclusion The study reinforces the existence of variables associated with food insecurity. Social and nutritional factors should be monitored, worked on, and improved in order to achieve food and nutritional security.</jats:p>"

The prospect of further scientific developments of this problematic is assumed in the description of the content of lectures-visualizations of such courses as: «Speech culture and expressive reading», «Methods of organizing artistic and speech activity of children in pre-school educational institutions», «Preschool linguodidactics», «Methods of teaching Ukrainian language of children preschool age», «Methods of familiarizing children with Ukrainian folk studies in preschool education institutions».</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main task of energy-efficient heat supply is to ensure full compliance between the produced and consumed thermal power, subject to a minimum of reduced costs. To achieve this goal, various methods of central and local regulation are applied. Analysis of the thermal schemes of some cities in Russia showed that most of the heat sources of centralized heat supply systems are not able to support the design hightemperature graphs with central regulation. Therefore, the area of centralized qualitative method of regulation of heat load has decreased substantially. A perspective direction for the further development of heat supply systems is to appeal to the experience of foreign countries, i.e. the use of qualitative-quantitative and quantitative methods of central regulation and low-temperature heat supply. There is also an acute problem of the complete use of heat by consumers, since overstating of the temperature of the return water substantially reduces the efficiency of heat sources. A new formula has been obtained which makes it possible to predict the temperature of the return network water in variable operating modes of heating points. The resulting formula can be used to set up programmable regulators and will allow correcting irrational modes of operation of heat supply systems.</jats:p>"

In recent years, the use of metaheuristics for parameter extraction of PV models gains more and more attentions thanks to their efficacy in solving highly nonlinear multimodal optimization problems. This work addresses a novel application of supply‐demand‐based optimization (SDO) to extract accurate and reliable parameters for PV models. SDO is a very young and efficient metaheuristic inspired by the supply and demand mechanism in economics. Its exploration and exploitation are balanced well by incorporating different dynamic modes of the cobweb model organically. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of SDO, four PV models with diverse characteristics including RTC France silicon solar cell, PVM 752 GaAs thin film cell, STM6‐40/36 monocrystalline module, and STP6‐120/36 polycrystalline module are employed. The experimental results comparing with ten state‐of‐the‐art algorithms demonstrate that SDO performs better or highly competitively in terms of accuracy, robustness, and convergence. In addition, the sensitivity of SDO to variation of population size is empirically investigated. The results indicate that SDO with a relatively small population size can extract accurate and reliable parameters for PV models.</jats:p>",

Therefore we respectively construct inventory optimization models under the two situations: customer shift and inventory transshipment. Specifically, unilateral customer shift and inventory transshipment are considered, and a one-for-one replenishment strategy is applied. We first solve the equilibrium state probability of on-hand inventory through Markov chain theory, then optimize performance measure (<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic>, the total costs) to obtain the optimal basic inventory level. Finally, we analyze the impact of customer shift rate and inventory transshipment rate on the inventory strategies through numerical simulation, and further compare the differences in inventory decisions between the above two situations, which prove that inventory cooperation brought by inventory transshipment is not necessarily better than inventory competition brought by customer shift. In addition, we discuss several insights that are evident from the parametric analysis of the model.</jats:p>",

The use of smartphone applications can support monitoring of the system and enhance local engagement and empowerment. In this paper the scope for mobile crowd participation as a research and monitoring tool for piped water supply systems in Bihar, India and in Khulna and Chittagong, Bangladesh is investigated. In these areas, the use of smartphones and internet access are growing rapidly and smartphone applications would enable real-time water quality monitoring, payment of water bills, awareness creation, and a dialogue between the end-user and the water supplier. To identify the relevance and acceptability of piped water supply and smartphone monitoring, four surveys with potential end-users were conducted. Based on these surveys we conclude that in the investigated areas there is a desire for piped water systems, that households already own smartphones with internet access, and that there is an interest in smartphone monitoring. The enabling environment to deploy mobile crowd participation for piped water system monitoring stimulates further research towards an investigation of potential functionalities and the actual development of such an application.</jats:p>",

However, many factors can influence the result, such as noisy concentration data and incomplete concentration data. Thus, this paper is aimed at studying the difference between using the observation data before and after denoising and interpolating for solving GPSI problems. Four kinds of noise level and 20 groups of missing data were designed to test the performance of wavelet denoising and cubic spline interpolation, respectively. The results show that the denoising process can improve the estimated result for the GPSI problem, and the higher the noise level, the stronger this effect. In terms of interpolation, more accurate results can be made after interpolating if the missing data belong to the period after the source releases the pollutant. If the missing data are from when the pollution source is active, interpolation cannot help increase the estimated performance.</jats:p>",

The two financing strategies are the noncollaborative financing (finance from a bank separately (FBS)) and the collaborative financing (finance from a bank uniformly (FBU)). It derives the production order formula of the supply chain enterprises under financial constraints. Under the complete information, according to this formula, it analyzes how the bank prices the loan interest rates and finds the optimal decisions under the two financing strategies. The following results are found: (1) The manufacturer’s planned output is negatively correlated with the bank’s loan interest rate. The increased interest rates do not necessarily lead to the increased bank’s loan profits. (2) The bank’s loan profit is higher, when the supply chain enterprises choose the FBS strategy. (3) The FBU strategy does not necessarily make the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer better. It is affirmative only if some parameters in the supply chain meet certain conditions. The above‐mentioned conclusions supply a policy guiding the supply chain enterprises with financial constraints to make a choice of the financing strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To addresses the design and operations of resilient supply chains under uncertain disruptions, a general framework is proposed for resilient supply chain optimization, including a quantitative measure of resilience and a holistic biobjective two‐stage adaptive robust fractional programming model with decision‐dependent uncertainty set for simultaneously optimizing both the economic objective and the resilience objective of supply chains. The decision‐dependent uncertainty set ensures that the uncertain parameters (e.g., the remaining production capacities of facilities after disruptions) are dependent on first‐stage decisions, including facility location decisions and production capacity decisions. A data‐driven method is used to construct the uncertainty set to fully extract information from historical data. Moreover, the proposed model takes the time delay between disruptions and recovery into consideration. To tackle the computational challenge of solving the resulting multilevel optimization problem, two solution strategies are proposed. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated through applications on a location‐transportation problem and on a spatially‐explicit biofuel supply chain optimization problem. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 65: 1006–1021, 2019</jats:p>",

Transcriptome changes associated with senescence in spring oilseed rape grown under optimal nitrogen supply or mild nitrogen deficiency revealed differences in senescence and nutrient mobilization in old lower canopy leaves and younger higher canopy leaves. Having a closer look at this transcriptome analyses, we identified the major classes of seed storage proteins (SSP) to be expressed in vegetative tissue, namely leaf and stem tissue. Expression of SSPs was not only dependent on the nitrogen supply but transcripts appeared to correlate with intracellular H2O2 contents, which functions as well-known signaling molecule in developmental senescence. The abundance of SSPs in leaf material transiently progressed from the oldest leaves to the youngest. Moreover, stems also exhibited short-term production of SSPs, which hints at an interim storage function. In order to decipher whether hydrogen peroxide also functions as a signaling molecule in nitrogen deficiency-induced senescence, we analyzed hydrogen peroxide contents after complete nitrogen depletion in oilseed rape and Arabidopsis plants. In both cases, hydrogen peroxide contents were lower in nitrogen deficient plants, indicating that at least parts of the developmental senescence program appear to be suppressed under nitrogen deficiency.</jats:p>"

This study aims to analyze the influence of the productive performance of some Brazilian exported commodities over the demand for regional passenger air transportation on the regions where those commodities are produced. In order to do so, this study used the linear regression method, checking what the relations are, if any exist, between the productive performance of those areas and the supply and demand for passenger seats in airports located in areas producing those commodities. The mathematical model used was validated with a control model that, in its turn, examined the correlation between macroeconomic and population aggregates and the global domestic demand for passenger air travel. The results show ambiguous relations between explicative and dependent variables, because in some localities the correlation was significantly higher than in others. The main contribution is to analyze how the regional aviation market is exposed to the productive performance on markets with high level of economic specialization.</jats:p>"

The product’s demand is a random variable influenced by the green level and the retail price. The problem is modeled in three different structures, a centralized and two decentralized models, in which the upstream manufacturer and the downstream retailer act as the channel leader, respectively. This paper presents the optimal decisions for all supply chain members, analyzes the effects of green degree and risk‐averse coefficient on the supply chain members’ decision‐making and their profits, and performs the numerical analysis. The results show that the green degree and the whole supply chain’s expected profits are highest in the centralized scenario, followed by the retailer‐led scenario, and lowest under the manufacturer‐led scenario; the green degree and the manufacturer’s expected profit increase with the risk‐averse coefficient, no matter who dominates the channel; however, the risk‐averse coefficient’s effects on the retailer’s expected utility and the retail price depends on who dominates the channel and on the greening investment parameter.</jats:p>",

Firstly, both a decentralized and a centralized supply chain decision models are built in a single-cycle newsvendor random demand situation. Then, through revenue sharing contract the study designs a brand-new supply chain coordination model which is Del trust, decentralized, and traded anonymously. Furthermore, the numerical comparative analysis on the optimal decision and supply chain coordination are conducted. It is found that the whole supply chain revenue can achieve and even beyond the performance level of the centralized supply chain with effectively expanding sales market and reducing supply chain risk. When the retail price is stable and supply chain is coordinated with revenue sharing mechanism, decentralized supply chain can achieve minimum optimal revenue. Coordination results have effect on short-term revenues of block chain members only. Implications and suggestions for future research in supply chain coordination are provided.</jats:p>",

It assesses the situation and the options for renovation in a sample of 151 buildings in the city of Zaragoza (Spain), estimating the savings in electric power and the possible financial returns that could be obtained. The results show that in half the buildings, the installations are inadequate and lead to inefficient energy use, which could be avoided by renovation. However, they also show that in many cases, this type of retrofitting would not be profitable for the building owners, meaning that technically viable solutions may not necessarily be financially viable. To mitigate or avoid the energy inefficiency in question, the public sector could step in by informing and financing support for building owners and regulating in the areas of town planning and construction.</jats:p>"

For foul sewer systems, the inflow of stormwater and infiltration of groundwater affects the management of both sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants. Monitoring of flows represents a critical task within approaches for control of either water losses in distribution systems and infiltration and rain-induced inflows in foul systems. Implementation of monitoring typically involves the following steps: (i) system information updating and digital mapping; (ii) system zoning; and (iii) system flow monitoring. Costs for monitoring are essential for utilities to estimate more accurately the costs of control of water losses, infiltration and inflow and to support more robust decision-making. Costs and infrastructure data were collected from 20 Portuguese water and wastewater utilities. Multiple linear regression analysis is used to obtain cost functions for meter chambers as a function of the volume and for purchase and installation of flow meters as a function of nominal diameter in water supply systems. For the steps of system information updating, digital mapping and system zoning single unit costs are estimated.</jats:p>",

From a few expert reviews and research works, eight crucial factors were taken into account and were analyzed. The eight factors are consumer, water resources, smart transportation, smart factory, smart grid, smart mining, smart home, and renewable energy. The analysis has been made using the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) method. The model distinctly demonstrates the influence of the principles of Industry 4.0 over coal industries. This chapter also aims to pave the way for future research and tries to contribute towards the sustainable extraction and usage of coal in energy industries.

The revolutionary temperature level (50–55/25°C) will improve the efficiency of heat sources, thermal storages, and distribution systems, meanwhile, bring huge potentials to renewable energies. One challenge of transition to the future DH is the compatibility of current customer installations and the future temperature level. The aim of this study was to find the temperature potential of Norwegian residential buildings for the future DH system. A reference apartment was created, and typical space heating (SH) system was designed. A detailed building and SH system model were built in Modelica® language, and simulation was conducted via Dymola environment. Different operation strategies: PI control of the supply temperature, weather compensated control of the supply temperature, and PI control of the return temperature were tested. The results of the study showed the average supply temperature could be as low as 56~58°C, and only limited time the temperature was above 60 °C, when the controlled supply temperature strategies were applied. For the case with controlled return temperature strategies, the average return temperature were 30 and 37°C, while the average required supply temperature could be 72 and 94°C. The conclusion was that the low supply temperature could be achieved through optimized operation strategies. Whereas, the low return temperature was not able to be achieved only by improving the operation strategy.</jats:p>"

In Romania, these losses can reach critical levels so highlighting them becomes a crucial aspect in assessing the system's efficiency. This paper presents a scheme that combines energy audit and water balance techniques that can become a tool for both energy auditors and managers, by allowing the quantification of embedded energy of water losses.

The article also provides recommendations for arranging the State Water Registry in the form of a map, combining the resources of automated information systems “State Water Registry” and “State Monitoring of Water Objects” and establishing a public service “Public Water Registry”. In addition, a new form of the state water register “1.9-gvr M – Water objects explored” has been developed; Using the example of the Mzymta River, a model of a new state water registry has been developed.</jats:p>"

Their location determines the type of goods movements that will be performed in the city area. Knowing their location is essential to define public policies applied to urban freight transport, city livability and economic development. In the search to make a better diagnosis of its area, the Belo Horizonte City Hall developed the urban quality-of-life index (UQLI) and the local supply index (LSI). This article used linear regression to identify the correlation amongst the UQLI, the LSI and the location of the logistics warehouses in urban areas. The best model obtained from the econometric analysis is the one that correlates warehouses with supermarkets, bookstores and stationery, residential area, quality of the house, bank and gas station. The results obtained were confirmed with spatial analysis. This result allows concluding that the warehouses are influenced by the favourable zoning, low land cost, proximity of regional and main streets of the city and high population and retailer density.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to identify the best regions for allocation of a forestry outgrower scheme, and the most efficient transportation system, using a mathematical programming model to minimize the wood supply costs in three Brazilian states. The forest outgrower scheme is a partnership between producers and forest companies, without land acquisition by the companies. Forest producers are recognized as an important source of growth for forest production. In order to achieve successful partnerships, the company needs to plan its hiring. In this study, the partnerships are made through formal contracts and the model does not allow breach of contract. Six scenarios were modeled and evaluated based on the total cost of the objective function, average wood cost (USD/m3), average transport distance (km) and processing time. The mathematical model showed its efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility in generating scenarios to support company managers in the decision-making and to avoid breach of contract. Hiring planning benefits both sides as it ensures the company’s production and provides financial security to forest producers. In addition, the model suggests alternatives such as the differential pricing of wood according to the location of the regions and the formation of homogeneous blocks of contracting/renewal of outgrower schemes around the pulp mill.</jats:p>"

Sampling in the quantitative content analysis is carried out to achieve the objective. Property Market Status Report in the NAPIC website provide a series data for total housing demand and supply for any house type of terrace, detached, cluster and townhouse in the price range between RM50,000 to RM300,000. All data provided cover from the first quarter until the fourth quarter across the year 2006 to 2015 specifically in Peninsular Malaysia only. Each level of the house price has a different equilibrium price so that developers can use it as an indicator based on the housing type. This research will promote ways to achieve the sustainabiliy in construction output overall so that the scholars can improve the equilibrium price model proposed in order to make the Malaysian housing become an affordable.</jats:p>"

The structure of the product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR). Then the scale inhibition efficiency of 1-sulfobutyl-3-vinylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate-acrylic acid (SVIS-AA) copolymer against CaCO3 and CaSO4 was determined. The results indicated that SVIS-AA copolymer showed better scale inhibition efficiency than poly (acrylic acid) (PAA). After that, the effects of temperature and Ca2+ concentration on the scale inhibition efficiency against CaCO3 were studied. Results showed that when the temperature reached 90 °C, the scale inhibition efficiency could still remain 91% at a concentration of 18 mg L−1. When the concentration of Ca2+ reached 1,200 mg L−1, the scale inhibition efficiency could remain 70% at a concentration of 20 mg L−1. At last, the effect of SVIS-AA copolymer on the morphologies of CaCO3 and CaSO4 scale was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).</jats:p>",

It overcomes many drawbacks and inadequacies of various previous AASs, and it has successfully been implanted in vivo for almost 3 weeks. During in vivo testing, PAAS shows its ability to retain continence with low risk of ischemia necrosis, and somehow truly helps to remodel rectal perception. However, there are still many defects that influence the long‐term implantation of PAAS, especially in the power supply system (PSS). This article presents a new designed PSS which includes a new transcutaneous energy transfer (TET) system, a heat reduction system, and a safety usage system. The new PSS reduces the total size of PAAS by at least 30%. Newly designed TET system can satisfy the Qi standard, and render a power of 3W to fulfill the requirement of fast charging and normal use of PAAS at the distance of 15.5 mm when frequency of TET system is 110 kHz, which previous TET systems can hardly achieve. Heat reduction system helps to reduce the heat generated during TET charging. It can reduce heat by 40% during the same period of time of TET charging. Safety usage system helps the user control PAAS more properly which can reduce the rate of failure of PAAS system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An inductive wireless power transfer system is proposed as a power supply for an on-line monitoring system for an overhead catenary. Because of the high voltage (25 kVrms) applied to the catenary, galvanic isolation was required to supply power to the attached monitoring system. The proposed wireless power system was able to transmit 50 W over a distance of 60 cm at 6.78 MHz. Design methodologies for the transmitter and the receiver coils, 6.78-MHz GaN-based full-bridge inverter, and rectifier are proposed in this paper. Pareto optimality, a multi-objective optimization technique, was used to determine optimal solutions in terms of efficiency and copper usage. A 100-W, 6.78-MHz full-bridge inverter was developed using 100 V, 35 A, E-HEMT GaN MOSFETs. Because of the high operating frequency, two factors were considered in the design of the full-bridge inverter, (1) close placement of the gate driver and the switch to minimize parasitic inductance and the resulting fluctuation of the drive signal and (2) effective heat dissipation from the switches and gate drivers for a high power rating. In addition, a full-wave rectifier was built using Schottky barrier diodes with a reverse recovery time of a few tens of nano-seconds. The developed wireless power system was experimentally evaluated. The measured coil-to-coil efficiency was 77%, and the measured efficiencies of the inverter and the rectifier were 92% and 93%, respectively. The overall system efficiency was 57% for a transfer of 47 W. Finally, the dependences of the efficiency on the distance, operating frequency, and load were evaluated.</jats:p>"

Methods to assess fuel treatment effects and prioritise their placement are needed to guide risk mitigation efforts. We present a fuel treatment optimisation model to minimise risk to multiple water supplies based on constraints for treatment feasibility and cost. Risk is quantified as the expected sediment impact costs to water supplies by combining measures of fire likelihood and behaviour, erosion, sediment transport and water supply vulnerability. We demonstrate the model’s utility for prioritising fuel treatments in two large watersheds in Colorado, USA, that are critical for municipal water supply. Our results indicate that wildfire risk to water supplies can be substantially reduced by treating a small portion of the watersheds that have dense, fire-prone forests on steep slopes that drain to water supply infrastructure. Our results also show that the cost of fuel treatments outweighs the expected cost savings from reduced sediment inputs owing to the low probability of fuel treatments encountering wildfire and the high cost of thinning forests. This highlights the need to expand use of more cost-effective treatments, like prescribed fire, and to identify fuel treatment projects that benefit multiple resources.</jats:p>"

This challenge is very different between patients with type 1 diabetes and those with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, it is more difficult to finetune a basal insulin dosage with intensified conventional insulin therapy (ICT), due to delayed insulin delivery, compared to insulin pump therapy, which provides continuous delivery of small doses of exclusively short-acting insulin.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article proposes an approach to determining the hierarchical network model of information provision representation of the submitted domain. The hierarchical network model represents the interconnection of information objects by subordination levels. One of the key issues in the development of information provision is the choice of the content delivery model in such a way as to ensure the most effective work with it as a user and developer. There are two main approaches - empirical and theoretical. The first is based on the study of the organization principles of human memory and the simulation of solving human problems mechanisms. The second approach can be defined as theoretically substantiated, which guarantees the correctness of the solutions, and the corresponding models - formal models of presentation of knowledge. The sequence of application of materials is included in the model, since the effectiveness of the perception of the material depends, among other things, on how much the person is \"ready\" to perceive the proposed information, that is, has a rather basic knowledge. Depending on the type of input data, possible ways of forming hierarchical network models of information support are proposed. If the input data is represented by a plurality of information elements, the number of which is relatively small and possible for the application of expert methods, the algorithm for constructing a hierarchical network two-level model of information provision is proposed. If the input data is represented by the \"Tree of Knowledge\", that is, the hierarchical model of information support, the algorithm for constructing a hierarchical network model is proposed. The hierarchical network model of information support, designed to manage the processes of acquisition and use of knowledge, which allows you to take into account the usefulness of information elements and didactic connections between them. The method of information support formation  is proposed for the hierarchical network representation of the subject area, which allows to structure the information content and reference and other systems, which differ from the known of selection interrelated stages, clustering and content  streamlining. The obtained results can be used to support decision-making in the acquisition and application of knowledge: in developing programs of individual advanced training courses; informational support of electronic learning systems; when forming distant education programs; in the development and subsequent adjustment of curricula; the formation of educational, reference materials, lecture courses for individual disciplines.</jats:p>"

Then we establish a bargaining game model to study how they allocate the profit they earned. We obtain the optimal policies through theoretic and experimental analysis, and we use Apple iPhone case to illustrate the models and conclusions of this paper. It is found that if the aim of the supply chain is only to maximize its total profit, it should only develop the high‐grade product and make its price half of its intrinsic value; if the aim of the supply chain is to maximizing profit while increasing the sales and market shares of the serial products, it should at least develop the high‐grade and low‐grade product; the ratio of price between the higher grade and the lower grade should be greater than the corresponding ratio of the intrinsic value, while the difference of price between higher grade and the lower grade should be less than the corresponding difference of the intrinsic value.</jats:p>",

This integrated analysis led to prioritise the potential risks that generate downtime and financially impact of the supply chain.

The objective is to increase the contribution of the PV part of a photo-diesel electrical system operating in parallel with a diesel power plant to a stand-alone distribution network of DC compared to parallel PV and diesel stations operating on AC; quality improvement and voltage stabilization in the electrical network; cost reduction of generated electricity. Optimization of the characteristics of a stand-alone power supply system at a DC is a difficult task, due to the impossibility of conducting tests in a real electric power system, and the use of physical modeling because of its extreme complexity. Given this fact, the task is to design software and hardware tools for optimizing the parameters of a DC photo-diesel power system. The developed models use MS Excel, MatLab/Simulink software packages, as well as weather data bases. A software tool has been developed that allows for simulation modeling of operating modes of photo-diesel power supply systems, generation, consumption and insolation level of a decentralized consumer, as well as determining rational technical and economic parameters; criteria of expediency and efficiency of constructing photo-diesel electric systems with DC have been identified. As a result, the level of voltage drop is reduced compared to the AC power supply system, the cost of 1 kWh of electrical energy is lower than in the AC power supply system, and the negative environmental impact is reduced.</jats:p>"

However, the challenge of maintaining high cell‐specific productivities remains. In this study, glucose limitation was applied to two perfusion steady states and compared with a third steady state without any detectable limitation. The metabolic phenotype was enhanced under glucose limitation with a decrease of 30% in glucose uptake and 75% in lactate formation. Cell‐specific productivities were substantially improved by 50%. Remarkably, the productivities showed a strong correlation to respiratory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply. As less reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) remained in the cytosol, the ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation was increased by almost 30%. Consequently, the efficiency of carbon metabolism and the resulting respiratory ATP supply was crucial for maintaining the highly productive cellular state. This study highlights that glucose limitation can be used for process intensification in perfusion cultures as ATP generation via respiration is significantly increased, leading to elevated productivities.</jats:p>",

However, a widely used control strategy for supply water temperature in substation is weather- compensated control. It is a feedforward control without any dynamic information about buildings, which can lead to higher or lower supply water temperature. This paper presents model predictive controller (MPC) applied to the supply water temperature control for substations in district heating systems. MPC is an advanced control technique, which can make full use of dynamic information of buildings to determine the optimal supply water temperature of substations. In this paper, a multiple inputs and single output dynamic model was identified by subspace methods. Two different MPC controllers were designed in Simulink. The MPC controller 1 focused on keeping indoor air temperature at reference values. The MPC controller 2 focused on both keeping indoor air temperature at reference values and tracking the minimum supply water temperature in order to find the temperature potential for the future DH systems. Both of the MPC controllers proved to have a better tracking effect for indoor air temperature and lower average supply temperatures compared to weather- compensated. The MPC controller 2 could further lower supply water temperature compared to the MPC controller 1 by tracking minimum supply water temperature in its objective function. The average supply water temperatures for the weather- compensated, the MPC controller1, and the MPC controller 2 were 52°C, 51°C and 50°C, respectively. The results showed that MPC has a great potential in the area of supply water temperature control of the district heating systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Auto‐transformer (AT) power traction networks with a parallel connection are the unique mode on high‐speed electric railways in China. The up line and down line of power traction networks are connected at substation (SS), AT post (ATP) and sectioning post (SP) through busbars, circuit breakers and disconnectors. Currently, when a fault occurs on power traction networks, the feeder line protection devices at the up line and down line in SS trip simultaneously. After that, the nonfault line and instantaneous fault line recover by means of autoreclosing. This tripping mode enlarges the power supply‐interrupted region. Based on the analysis of circuit networks of power traction networks on high‐speed electric railways, the interrelations of currents in SS and ATP and in SS and SP are derived. When a fault occurs on one side of the power traction networks, the feeder currents in ATP and SP flow from the nonfault side to the fault side. The relation between feeder currents in SS and ATP and between feeder currents in SS and SP reflect this characteristic. A criterion for discriminating the fault side and selective‐tripping scheme of breakers is proposed based on the correlation analysis of feeder current fault components in multisite. The simulation results show that this scheme can discriminate fault side and make a selective trip rapidly and correctly. © 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Along with the poverty, individuals experience health problems, and educational and income levels of individuals may also be low. Countries are generally able to fight against poverty by increasing public expenditures and making some economic progresses. For that reason, analyzing the effect of health and education expenditures with a significant place in public expenditures and economic growth on poverty is highly important. In this chapter, the effect of health and education expenditures and economic growth on poverty in 2005 and 2016 period in eight Central and Eastern European countries has been analyzed using panel data analysis. As a result of the study, it has been determined that health and education expenditures and economic growth have a negative effect on poverty. In addition, a one-way causality from health and education expenditures to poverty and a two-way causality between economic growth and poverty have been detected.</jats:p>"

The ability of blockchain systems to pinpoint the origin of data makes them particularly suitable for pharmaceutical supply chain applications. The data stored in the blockchain distributed register on the identification of drugs produced by the plant, as well as records of their movements throughout the supply chain, can accurately determine the authenticity of pharmaceutical products lying on the shelves of pharmacies. The development and implementation of such a system can be a big step towards winning the exhausting fight against the easy availability of counterfeit drugs and medical products. In the first part of this work, the main characteristics and features of the functioning of blockchain systems will be studied.

An additional enhancement of longifolene production (up to 2.64 mg/L) was achieved by introducing an exogenous mevalonate pathway. Under fed-batch conditions, the best-performing strain was able to produce 382 mg/L of longifolene in a 5 L bioreactor. These results demonstrated the feasibility of producing longifolene by microbial fermentation and could serve as the basis for the construction of more robust strains in the future.</jats:p>"

Biojet fuel is expected to make an essential contribution to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. Brazil is seen as a key player in developing sustainable aviation biofuels owing to its long‐standing experience with biofuels. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of what policies may be conducive to the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain is lacking. We extended a spatially explicit agent‐based model to explore the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain from the existing sugarcane–ethanol supply chain. The model accounts for new policies (feed‐in tariff and capital investment subsidy) and new considerations into the decision making about production and investment in processing capacity. We found that in a tax‐free gasoline regime, a feed‐in tariff above 3 R$/L stimulates the production of biojet fuel. At higher levels of gasoline taxation (i.e., 2.46 R$/L), however, any feed‐in tariff is insufficient to ensure the production of biojet fuel. Thus, at these levels of gasoline taxation, it is needed to introduce regulations on the production of biojet fuel to ensure its production. Given the current debate about the future direction of the biofuel policy in Brazil, we recommend further research into the effect of market mechanisms based on greenhouse gas emissions on the emergence of a Brazilian biojet fuel supply chain.</jats:p>",

The supply and demand scheme satisfying these requirements is reduced into fuzzy relation inequalities (FRIs) with min‐product composition. Due to the difference between the min‐product composition and the classical max‐t‐norm one, we first study the resolution of such min‐product FRI system. For optimization management in the supply chain system, we further investigate a maximin programming problem subject to the min‐product FRIs. An algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution based on the quasi‐maximal matrix and corresponding index set. To illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we provide a simple numerical example. The obtained optimal solution reflects an optimal pricing scheme, which maximizes the minimum prices of the commodity from the suppliers.</jats:p>",

The lower level represents the model of functioning of the energy supply system during the period under review. The second level is a model of the energy supply reliability analysis. This analysis is based on multiple simulations of functioning of the energy supply system in randomly formed conditions. The energy sources demand and supply, as well as the amount of carryover reserves of energy in storage, are assumed to be random values. To simulate functioning, the values of energy demand and production are formed using the Monto-Carlo method following their laws of probability. The random value of the carryover reserves is formed using the algorithm that generates the Markov sequence of these reserves. The upper level is represented by the model for selecting the optimal composition of the means ensuring reliability, i.e. energy reserves in the energy production and storage capacity. It was revealed that the algorithm for generating the random value of the energy sources carryover reserves yields the homogenous Markov sequence. Sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the stationary state were determined. Based on the experimental calculations, we estimated the number of iterations required to reach the stationary ergodic state.</jats:p>"

From January 2013 to December 2016, staff interviewed participants who administered naloxone in response to 1072 overdoses. We calculated frequencies, percentages, and conducted a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Despite increases in fentanyl-contributed deaths, there were no statistically significant differences between any of the 4 years (2013–2016) on average number of naloxone doses used by participants to reverse an overdose ( F = 0.88; P = .449). Conclusion: Even though IMF is more potent than heroin and is a rapidly increasing contributor to drug overdose deaths in Allegheny County, the average dose of naloxone administered has not changed. Our findings differ from studies in different areas also experiencing increasing IMF prevalence. Additional investigations are needed to clarify the amount of naloxone needed to reverse opioid overdoses in the community caused by new synthetic opioids. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We take the supply chain with a supplier and a retailer as the research objects and study the contagion and spillover effect of the associated credit risk in the supply chain under the scenario of the buy‐back guarantee contract. The associated credit risk in the supply chain refers to the phenomenon that the credit default of the retailer causes the credit default of the supplier or increases the probability of default. The buy‐back guarantee in the supply chain refers to the assumption by the retailer of the supplier’s buy‐back contract as a financing mechanism. At present, the buy‐back guarantee has become a new channel of contagion for the associated credit risk in the supply chain. Under the dual Stackelberg game analysis framework of the lending institutions, suppliers, and retailers, this paper clarifies the contagion mechanism of associated credit risk in the supply chain under the condition of the buy‐back guarantee and constructs mathematical models to explore the contagion and spillover effect of the associated credit risk in the supply chain. The results show that, under the condition of the buy‐back guarantee, the contagion effect of the associated credit risk in the supply chain has trigger thresholds, and the probability of triggering the contagion effect is related to the retailer’s order quantity, supplier’s wholesale price, and product’s market price. The contagion effect is positively affected by the buy‐back rate, production costs, and loan interest rates and negatively affected by the product’s market price. In contrast, the degree of buy‐back guarantee aggravates the negative spillover effect of the associated credit risk and raises the risk level of lending institutions.</jats:p>",

The identified problems are divided into two groups: problems that can be solved at the design stage and problems that can be solved at the operation stage. Within each group, the authors consider various problems and propose possible solutions. It is noted that as a result of the solution of formulated problems it is possible to form the problem of developing an intelligent coal mines EPS. To solve this problem it is necessary to use modern technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and BIG DATA. In prospective it will allow to create a unified cyber-physical system uniting the virtual and real worlds within the framework of the coal mining technological process and ensuring the rational management of the coal mine EPS by the criterion of minimizing the energy consumption for extracting one ton of coal. As a conclusion, the authors note the necessity of solving the formulated problems for the implementation of the “Industry 4.0” concept, which has great importance for the Russian coal industry.</jats:p>"

Continuously changing raw water conditions, flood and extreme rainfall events, anthropogenic pollution, and lacking electricity supply in developing regions require new and adapted solutions to treat and render water safe for distribution. This paper presents the findings of a pilot test conducted in Uttarakhand, India, where a river bank filtration (RBF) well was combined with a solar-driven and online-monitored electro-chlorination system, treating fecal-contaminated Ganga River water. While the RBF well provided nearly turbidity- and pathogen-free water as well as buffered fluctuations in source water qualities, the electro-chlorination system provided disinfection based on the inline conversion of chloride to hypochlorous acid. The conducted sampling campaigns provided complete disinfection (&gt;6.7 log) and the adequate supply of residual disinfectant (0.27 ± 0.17 mg/L). The system could be further optimized to local conditions and allows the supply of microbial-safe water for river bound communities, even during monsoon periods and under the low natural chloride regimes typical for this region.</jats:p>"

However, their global supply from all the traditional sources of these nutrients is insufficient to satisfy human nutritional requirements. For two decades there has been considerable research carried out into all possible alternatives to the main sources of n-3 LC-PUFA, marine fish oil and fishmeal, driven largely by the aquaculture sector, as both the major user and provider of EPA and DHA. In the last few years these efforts have focused increasingly on the development of entirely new supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA produced de novo. Recently, this has resulted in various new sources of EPA and/or DHA that are already available or likely to available in the near future. In this short review, we briefly summaries the current gap between supply and demand of EPA and DHA for human requirements, the role of aquaculture in providing n-3 LC-PUFA to human consumers, the range of potential novel sources, and suggest how these new products could be used effectively. We conclude that all the new sources have potentially important roles to play in increasing the supply of n-3 LC-PUFA so that they are available more widely and in higher concentrations providing more options and opportunities for human consumers to obtain sufficient EPA and DHA to support more healthy, balanced diets.</jats:p>"

There are several types of topologies for these converters. However, from the point of view of high‐quality AC output voltage, multilevel inverters are considered the most adequate. Under this context, this study proposes a new structure for the three‐phase DC−AC conversion stage for a grid‐connected PV system. It consists of two four‐leg two‐level voltage source inverters that are connected to two PV generators. These inverters are associated with two Scott transformers. The secondary windings of the transformer are connected in a way that allows a series connection. Due to this, a multilevel operation will be achieved. The performance of the proposed power conditioning system will be verified through simulation and experimental results.</jats:p>",

Hence, there was a need to seek another opportunity to have access for the water for mitigating the peat fires from local shallow aquifer water resources. Various pumping tests have been conducted to explore the potential and characteristics of the shallow aquifer water for mitigating the peat fires in Riau, Indonesia. The groundwater transmission and storage (storativity) were tested using pump tests. The Cooper Jacob (a straight line) method had been applied to analyze the field data. This study has yielded the following results; the water transmissivity (T) was 1145.98 m2/day, water storage (S) coefficient was 1.09 x 10-3, and the deep depth of the shallow aquifer water (from the ground surface) was approximately 10 meter. Hence, this research identified that the potential shallow aquifer water produced from every single well in the surveyed area in Riau may reach 433.4 m3/day. The amount of this water was considered more than enough to extinguish 4 ha of peat fire occurrences.</jats:p>"

When selecting agents in new markets, a principal often faces the problem of identifying the promotional ability of agents. This paper aims to study the dynamic incentive of supply chain under information asymmetry for the information screening in long‐term supply chain cooperation. Also, it pioneers the rhythm of information disclosure in the extant literature. By establishing three two‐stage supply chain models, this paper analyzes the impact of agents’ information disclosure speed on the brand. We find that it is better to separate agents earlier out of the brand perspective; the semiseparated contract is beneficial for the brand to control information disclosure speed more flexibly and get more profits from the retailer. But, from the perspective of the supply chain, it is also possible to prefer the mixed contract. Under certain conditions, the pooling contract could also increase the profits of supply chain and improve the allocation efficiency of supply chain.</jats:p>",

The authors focus on the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for three different types of precoding, zero‐forcing (ZF), general beamforming method and conjugate‐beamforming. For ZF precoding, they apply fractional programming and reform the optimization problem to a convex one. An iterative algorithm to deal with the fractional objective function is presented. Whereas the problem is non‐convex for general beamforming with user interference, they take maximum ratio transmission as an example and adopt a set of transformation and approximation based on the difference of convex (DC) programming. Furthermore, for conjugate‐beamforming, they first transform the quadratic signal to interference plus noise power ratio into a trackable form and then DC programming is applied. A two‐loop algorithm for the general beamforming and conjugate‐beamforming is presented with fractional programming in the inner loop and DC programming in the outer loop. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm improved EE significantly and indicate that energy cooperation can contribute to a higher EE. It also reveals that ZF achieves better EE with small noise variance while conjugate beamforming in high noise circumstance.</jats:p>",

Results: The urban population of the region is 18.7% provided with piped drinking water, the rest of the population of the region (81.3%) uses water from various sources of hazardous epidemiological relations (rivers, springs, aryks, houses, wells, etc.). To address water-related problems, over the past seven years (2010-2017), a number of projects on the provision of drinking water to the population were adopted at the regional and district levels by Khukumat.  Conclusion: In the MBAD, the provision of safe drinking water to the population is still low, especially in rural localities. Positive changes in the provision of drinking water to the population will create satisfactory social and sanitary, epidemiological conditions and improve the quality of life population.  Keywords: Drinking water, provision of the water supply to population, water pipes, water sources. \t</jats:p>"

Nor are there much of other specific guidelines. The new, product-neutral and free online calculation tool <jats:italic>Comfort IAQ</jats:italic> helps to understand the mechanisms behind IAQ and gives a good indication on what would be the impact on indoor air quality (IAQ) due to air exchange, outdoor air environment, air filter selection and building envelope characteristics. <jats:italic>Comfort IAQ</jats:italic> allows to simulate the concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) in a specific ventilated room, depending on the chosen supply air filter quality. To model the room and the supply air conditions in a realistic way, <jats:italic>Comfort IAQ</jats:italic> allows to define besides outdoor air conditions (ODA) also the room dimensions, the air changes, the recirculation air rate as well as the supply air filter quality (based on ISO 16890, EN779 or ASHRAE 52.2). Based on these values, the <jats:italic>Comfort IAQ</jats:italic> tool provides an estimation of the indoor particle concentration and gives engineers and planers a good tool to optimize the Indoor Air Quality, by choosing the best combinations of supply air filter qualities and ventilation rates for a specific application. The algorithms in the online tool <jats:italic>Comfort IAQ</jats:italic> have been developed by Lars Ekberg, (Docent-installallationsteknik, Chalmers Tekniska Högskola) and the accuracy of the calculations was verified by comparing them with measurements in a full-scale test chamber.</jats:p>"

The main drawback of DFIG is its complicated protection systems. In the chapter, several strategies for DFIG protection are reviewed, and the authors provide a conclusion about their advantages. Penetration of renewable energy sources (in particular, wind power) have a huge impact on power systems; thus, wind turbines should be considered as conventional generation units in terms of frequency and voltage regulation. Modern grid codes require WT stay connected during grid fault and be capable to provide appropriate grid support. Therefore, it is important to implement a DFIG protection system that could meet grid code requirements. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dual‐channel supply chain is widely adopted by main manufacturers, potentially incurring channel conflicts between the traditional retail channel which is owned by the independent retailer and the online channel which is directly managed by the manufacturer. The purpose of this paper is to deal with the scenario where channel conflicts may arise under production capacity uncertainty, when the manufacturer tends to privilege the direct selling channel over the retail selling channel. To achieve the goal, this paper establishes a Stackelberg game model consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, studies the scenario where the manufacturer satisfies the direct selling channel first in the presence of capacity uncertainty, employs the decision optimization and the backward induction method to find the optimal inventory decision in the direct selling channel and the optimal order quantity decision making in the retail selling channel, and designs a compensation mechanism aiming to coordinate the channel conflict in the decentralized decision‐making process. Results show that the optimal decisions aiming to maximize the expected profit of each supply chain member are not able to maximize the expected profit of entire dual‐channel supply chain. However, when the manufacturer compensates the retailer’s profit loss based on the unsatisfied order and, in the meantime, adjusts the wholesale price to prevent the retailer which obtains the compensation from increasing order significantly, the compensation mechanism can coordinate the decision of each supply chain member, mitigate the channel conflict, maximize the expected profit of entire dual‐channel supply chain, and achieve the Pareto improvement of supply chain members’ expected profit in the decentralized decision‐making process.</jats:p>",

This paper develops an analytical framework to value option contracts in hedging the risks in a supply chain consisting of a component supplier with random yield and a manufacturer facing stochastic demand for end products. The manufacturer can obtain the components from the supplier through firm order contracts and option contracts. Apart from the contract market, there is a spot market in which both the manufacturer and the supplier can buy or sell the components. Analytical expressions for the optimal ordering and production policies are derived. Our study shows that the manufacturer and the supplier can effectively deal with the risks they involve by adopting option contracts. However, we find that the supply chain cannot be coordinated by the traditional option contract. To coordinate such system, we propose a protocol to be combined with the option contract. Finally, the explicit condition for coordination under the proposed contracts is identified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demand forecasting is one of the main issues of supply chains. It aimed to optimize stocks, reduce costs, and increase sales, profit, and customer loyalty. For this purpose, historical data can be analyzed to improve demand forecasting by using various methods like machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and deep learning models. In this work, an intelligent demand forecasting system is developed. This improved model is based on the analysis and interpretation of the historical data by using different forecasting methods which include time series analysis techniques, support vector regression algorithm, and deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to blend the deep learning methodology, support vector regression algorithm, and different time series analysis models by a novel decision integration strategy for demand forecasting approach. The other novelty of this work is the adaptation of boosting ensemble strategy to demand forecasting system by implementing a novel decision integration model. The developed system is applied and tested on real life data obtained from SOK Market in Turkey which operates as a fast‐growing company with 6700 stores, 1500 products, and 23 distribution centers. A wide range of comparative and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed demand forecasting system exhibits noteworthy results compared to the state‐of‐art studies. Unlike the state‐of‐art studies, inclusion of support vector regression, deep learning model, and a novel integration strategy to the proposed forecasting system ensures significant accuracy improvement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current technological infrastructure in the electricity, heat, cold, and gas supply, as a rule, is formed and controlled separately by local systems and tasks. The traditionally considered energy systems unite large energy sources, such as hydroelectric power station, combined heat and power plants, boiler plants, and electric and pipeline networks distributed over a large area. New trends in the energy sector necessitate a revision of the principles of construction of energy systems and the creation of integrated energy supply systems. Combining separate different types of systems of different levels into a single integrated system with many coordinated elements can contribute to the implementation of new functionality, the use of more advanced technologies in operation and the active participation of consumers with distributed generation in the energy supply process. For the study of integrated energy supply systems it is proposed to use a multiagent approach, which is one of the promising areas of research for complex systems. This approach is used in many subject areas to study systems that include many elements with complex behavior. Such systems include integrated energy supply systems. The solution of the problem on the basis of the agent approach is developed by a multitude of interrelated agents.</jats:p>"

To improve the performance of the range hood and prevent the dispersion of PM, a supply of make-up air equivalent to the airflow rate of the range hood should be provided. In this regard, we place an auxiliary supply system as a make-up supply to solve such problems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the make-up air supply system and the range hood. To evaluate this system, several case studies were performed involving CFD simulations. The auxiliary supply system is optimized through three types of variables (size of diffuser, distance from the source, and flow angle). An increase in the length of the diffuser causes PM dispersion to decrease. The installation of the diffuser at a certain distance from the emission source is effective in preventing dispersion of cooking-generated PM. In the building analyzed in this study, supplying the make-up air at an angle of 10° was observed to be most effective.</jats:p>"

The object of the study is the Northeast Asian gas market. The model of the excessive gas supply system in Northeast Asia is described. The primal problem of the model is to minimize the sum of gas production and transportation costs under the infrastructure constraints. The solutions to the primal problem are the volumes of gas produced in each production point and transported via each route. The solutions to the dual problem (dual variables or shadow prices) are node prices in the points of gas supply system, the producers’ rent and the transporters’ rent. It is highlighted that the dual analysis plays an important role. It allows evaluating price relations between the points of gas supply system, identifying export routs characterized by the highest rent, evaluating the competitiveness of suppliers in the different scenarios of technological development, energy policy and market environment. The analytical capacities of the dual analysis are illustrated by the study of the impact of “unconventional” gas development in the importing countries on the Northeast Asian gas market environment. When the costs of unconventional gas production rise, gas trade patterns change, more competitive players enter the market, and gas prices in all consumption points as well as producers’ rents increase. It is concluded that if importers seek to lower import dependency while keeping the same price level, they have to lower the costs of unconventional gas production by technological development and/or to subsidize the industry to make it more competitive.</jats:p>"

This paper presents an integrated geographic information systems (GIS) method based on transport optimization to design and compare the performance of a decentralized versus a centralized biorefinery supply system. The method determines the suitable locations, allocations, sizing, and number of depots according to different demand location scenarios. The method is exemplified by a real case study in southern Quebec. In the design, the biomass depot generates raw sugar, shipped to the biorefinery, and co‐products that are used on site without transportation as animal feed and bioenergy. This diversification strategy provided by a joint production permits savings amounting to two‐thirds of the tonnage on the second transportation arc. The results present the average travel time performance in minutes in different scenarios. In the centralized configuration, the optimized stand‐alone biorefinery location scenario is 45% (59 min) and 58% (100 min) more efficient in terms of transportation than the two biorefineries located in existing industrial parks. However, the latter have a decentralized configuration that is more efficient than their centralized equivalents. In the decentralized configuration, depending on farmer participation, the biorefineries located in the existing industrial park have a transportation performance 16–42% (27–55 min) that is more efficient than their respective centralized configuration. Smaller depots and the use of numerous depots tend to reduce the average impedance as biomass availability increases. This is due to the economies of transportation related to a denser and more meshed network. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

The majority of Merbau Island is covered by peat and lowlands; hence the rainwater that falls on the land surface is generally contaminated with peat water, which tends to be more acidic. Frequent rainfall at the location produces an abundant volume of water that is sufficient enough to meet the collective household daily demand for clean water. However, the community is not able to provide a large rainwater harvesting facility that can minimize the loss of rainwater into the rivers or seas. This study aimed to obtain data on the field conditions used as the basis for planning RWH systems for domestic needs so as to meet the need for sustainable clean water on Merbau Island. The results show that the highest rainfall recorded in 2013 was 3,164.3 mm. Such an amount of rainwater can fulfill the daily clean water requirements for each household on Merbau Island. The population of poor people on the island is approximately 44%, which results in around 73% of people not having an adequate rainwater harvesting system. The average roof area data, the number of family members and the type of roof, being 213 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, 6 people and zinc (0.9) respectively, using the Rain Cycle v2 software, obtained the result that a 12 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> tank is needed to meet the need for clean water throughout the year.</jats:p>"

And moral hazard may aggravate the default risk. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of moral hazard in trade credit and explore incentive contract under uncertain demand and asymmetric information. We consider a two‐echelon supply chain consisting of a risk‐neutral retailer ordering a single product from a risk‐neutral manufacturer. Market demand is stochastic and is influenced by retailer’s sales effort which is his private information. Incentive theory is used to develop the principal‐agent model and get the incentive contract from the manufacturer’s perspective. Results show that the retailer will reduce his effort level to get more profit and the manufacturer’s profit will be reduced, in the case of asymmetric information. Facing this result, the manufacturer will reduce the order quantity in incentive contract to lessen his losses. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate all these theoretical results and to draw managerial insights.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, due to the country's energy conservation policies in cities and towns, there has been a steady decline in the specific water consumption. Many industrial enterprises switched to water-saving technologies and circulating water supply systems. Such a policy favorably affects the environmental safety of territories by reducing wastewater discharges into water bodies and saves energy for pumping water and wastewater. At the same time, due to a decrease in the speed of water movement, its quality indicators deteriorate and stagnant zones appear, and due to the reduction of water consumption, pumping stations began to operate in low efficiency modes. The article proposes to solve this problem by decommissioning certain sections of the network and facilities, which improve the speed of other pipelines and provide pumping stations with the highest efficiency. For this purpose, a technique has been developed to optimize flows in existing water supply systems and its implementation in the Trace – BK software package. A new method of optimizing operating costs for water supply systems in the face of decreasing water consumption is proposed. This technique makes it possible to identify inefficient sections of network and take them out of operation while improving the operation speed of other pipeline and bring the operation of pumping stations to the mode with the highest efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The International Space Station (ISS) crew health and safety depend on ventilation system performance. The ISS ventilation system comprises of numerous air supply diffusers. For each ISS module design of the ventilation system and, in particular, supply diffuser distribution and configuration, is based on the assumption that the cabin aisle way is clear of any objects. However, on-orbit operations could lead to short- or long-term blockage of the area near the air supply diffuser due to some items or stowed bags necessary for the station operation. Partial blockage of the diffuser could disrupt the free jet airflow or change its intended direction. The current contribution is devoted to examination of the ISS research module – the U.S. Laboratory – ventilation system performance in case of partial inlet diffuser blockage with objects, such as Cargo Transfer Bag. The goal of the study is to assess the localized effects when the blockage occurs in the module interior for a possible stagnant zones formation. The paper presents detailed analysis of the diffuser blockage effects on airflow characteristics in various zones in the ISS habitat.</jats:p>"

However, there was a consensus that it may become a problem in the future due to demographic changes. The perceived obstacles to recruit and retain migrant donors were difficulties in determining how many migrant donors are needed and recruiting them, excluding potentially rare donors prior to donation, limited use of extended phenotyping and high blood typing and frozen storage costs. The possible solutions to increase blood pool diversity lay in registering donor ethnicity, specialised information provision for donors, reconsidering eligibility criteria and optimising blood typing strategies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Whilst recruitment of migrant blood donors is perceived by staff as difficult, various organisational policies and guidelines seem to hinder retention.

Our evaluation considered different DC-powered appliances under different energy price conditions and made projections based on present, 2030s, and 2050s scenarios. Initial cost reductions were also considered based on assumed near-future technological developments. Our case study results show that the simple payback period is likely to be shortest in cases where DC power is only used for low-voltage appliances under present price conditions, when supplying DC power to cover interior space heating under the 2030s energy price scenario, and when covering all DC-powered appliances (including water heating) under the 2050s scenario. Taken together, these results indicate that it is desirable to set the introductory targets while projecting future energy price fluctuations and anticipating the cost reductions that will result from ongoing technological developments.</jats:p>"

First, the authors mentioned the need for intelligent systems in the decision-making processes, where they are necessary due to the limitations associated with conventional human decision-making processes. Among them, human experience is very scarce, and humans get tired of the burden of physical or mental work. In addition, human beings forget the crucial details of a problem, and many of the times are inconsistent in their daily decisions. </jats:p>"

Given is a brief review of the reliability assessment methods, existing models for reliability assessment of the main pipelines, and their implementation. Special attention is paid to such reliability-specific properties as failure-free operation and maintainability of the elements constituting the gas distribution systems (linear sections and booster stations). These properties depend on the failure and recovery rates. Consideration is given to potentials of studying the impact of failure and recovery rates on integral indicators of gas distribution systems reliability. For that purpose mathematical models are proposed to be used for gas distribution systems reliability assessment using the analytical method of a ‘loss multiplication’ scheme. Reliability assessment of a conventional gas distribution system was taken as an example.</jats:p>"

However, this phenomenon is not taken into account in the SP 31.13330.2012, therefore the values of specific water consumption do not correspond to the modern level of sanitary equipment of the buildings and water consumption, which can not be the same for all cities and towns in Russia. Using the standard values of the design loads indicated in this code can lead to a significant increase in the cost of the project and operating costs. Their correction is necessary taking into account the assessment and forecast of the actual values of specific water consumption. This requires appropriate research and updating of specific water consumption standards for the design and reconstruction water supply and sewerage systems. The article describes the parameter justification method for the designed water supply systems under uncertainty of the prospective values of specific water consumption. The technique is based on the fuzzy sets theory and decision-making methodology under uncertainty of the initial information. This technique allows you to make decisions based on the minimum values of investment risks.</jats:p>"

One of the efforts to meet the needs of raw water for drinking water, among others, by the development of a potable water supply system infrastructure. Based on the facts, it is necessary to design Water Supply System (SPAM) in Titab and Telaga Village with Titab Reservoir spring with 350 l/dt of debit which is expected to give standard of quantity, quality, continuity of service for Titab and Telaga Village which is 5 km from the dam. In order to maximize the service to the community in Titab and Telaga Village, it is necessary to know the use of drinking water for each household. The next analysis is the calculation of projected drinking water needs over the next 20 years. Planning and calculation of water distribution using WaterCad i8 Software. From the result of projection analysis, the drinking water requirement in Titab and Telaga Village based on the fact of household drinking water usage in 2037 is 5,568 lt/sec. While the effort to maximize water supply network services is by projecting drinking water needs in Titab and Telaga Village based on the fact of household drinking water usage. With the help of WaterNet Software, it will simplify the distribution network planning of drinking water in order to produce integrated drinking water network system to meet the needs of clean water in Titab and Telaga Village.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article focuses on the level of supply chain emission reduction, taking into account consumers’ low‐carbon preferences, stochastic market demand, and carbon tax policy. By introducing the emission reduction penalty mechanism and adopting reverse derivation method, it derives the revenue model of the retailer and the manufacturer in decentralized and centralized supply chain when the supply chain reduces emissions or is not under stochastic market demand. The research results are as follows. (i) The optimal retailer’s revenue is strictly monotonous increasing with respect to the consumers’ low‐carbon preferences in the decentralized supply chain. However, in the centralized supply chain, the optimal revenue of the retailer and the manufacturer are strictly monotonously decreasing of the consumers’ low‐carbon preferences respectively. (ii) The retailer’s revenue is a concave function of the order quantity, and there exists a unique order quantity that can maximize retailer’s revenue. The manufacturer’s revenue is a concave function of the wholesale price, and there exists a unique wholesale price that can maximize manufacturer’s revenue. (iii) When consumers’ low‐carbon preferences are given, there is an optimal emission reduction level that maximizes the overall revenue of the supply chain. Furthermore, as the carbon tax increases, the optimal emission reduction level gradually rises. (iv) As the level of emission reduction in the supply chain increases, the range of the revenue sharing coefficient becomes larger, and it is easier for supply chain members to reach a revenue sharing contract. However, when consumers’ low‐carbon preferences and carbon tax increase, the opposite is true.</jats:p>",

Under unirrigated conditions, the plant’s height, diameter, and weight of ears per plants, as well as total carotenoid content of kernels, decreased, SPAD values of leaves, normalized vegetation differential index (NDVI) and LAI were low. The difference in SPAD and LAI was higher between the hybrids during the silking than the tasseling period under water deficiency. Under unirrigated dry conditions, no correlation was found between SPAD, NDVI, and yield. Using deficit irrigation, SPAD measured during tasseling correlated closely with the individual husked ear and the final yields as well as the sugar and carotene contents of kernels. Under this condition, NDVI did not correlate with the yield, but LAI was correlated with the yield and its carotene content. Under deficit irrigated conditions, the 46 to 49 range of SPAD measured during tasseling predicted 23.5 to 26.7 t ha−1 depending on the hybrid, but this range predicted a yield lower by 6.4 to 10.1% during silking.</jats:p>"

They have multiple levels of voltages and different types of loads. New electrical equipment usually works alongside with the equipment that is obsolete and worn-out. Power supply systems of industrial areas of Vietnam where coal is mined are characterized by the low power quality. In Vietnam the indices which characterize the distortion of both voltage and current waveforms have standard values. The article presents the findings upon the analysis of a power supply system of a coal open-cut in Vietnam and the electrical equipment of the coal sorting plant along with the results of the experimental studies of power quality indices and the non-sinusoidal mode parameters. The measurement analysis has shown that the indices of the 5-th and 7-th harmonics of voltage were over the limits. There are interharmonics in voltages and currents. The article analyzes the characteristics of active filters. It is possible to improve the power quality by using an active filter which generates both reactive power to increase the load power factor and harmonic and interharmonic currents to reduce the degree of voltage and current waveform distortion.</jats:p>"

In this study, we assessed the perceived effects of elephants’ presence on ES supply in the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in West Africa. A total of 112 respondents, including riparian communities and reserve officials, were interviewed. First, we used ranking techniques based on stakeholders’ perceptions to evaluate differences in perceived importance of ES. Second, we assessed the perceived impact of elephants on ES supply from both direction and intensity perspective. Third, we assessed the economic importance of threatened ESs and elephants’ damages related economic losses incurred by households. Twenty-seven ES were enumerated, 13 provisioning ES, 12 cultural ES, and two from the regulating and maintenance ES category. Provisioning ES were perceived as the most important although not significantly different from other categories. PES were also found to be most affected negatively by elephants’ impacts. However, elephants’ presence increased supply of cultural ES. The average cost of the losses due to elephants’ negative impacts ranged from $174.80 to $586.05 per year and per victim household. These results were discussed in relation to management actions necessary to facilitate coexistence between elephant and local populations. </jats:p>",

The Preissmann box scheme is usually used to model a wide range of subcritical and supercritical flows. However, care must be taken over the modelling of transcritical flows since, unless the correct internal boundary conditions are imposed, the scheme becomes unstable. In this paper, using the scheme in conjunction with the reduced momentum equation and applying boundary condition structure inherent to subcritical flow to all regimes, is an approach that enables efficient numerical simulation of transcritical flows in pipe networks. The approach includes three steps. First, a unified mathematical model which is based on the Preissmann slot model is derived. Second, the Preissmann box scheme is used to solve the set of equations, by analyzing and discussing the origin of the invalidity of applying the scheme, and a numerical model suitable for transcritical flow is proposed by the method of changing the convection acceleration term. Third, the numerical model is assessed by comparison with analytical, experimental and numerical results. The proposed models verified that this method can make the Preissmann box scheme applicable to the computation of transcritical flow in pipes.</jats:p>",

In\n   Serbia, legally binding documents, VOS (2002) and PPRS (2010), provide the\n   concept for the water supply of the population and industry by regional\n   systems for which water is provided by building high dams and formation of\n   reservoirs. With this concept, it is often not possible to meet the needs of\n   local communities in mountainous areas. In order to contribute to solving\n   the water supply problems of these mostly poor villages, research was\n   conducted on the possibility of using check dam aggradation groundwater for\n   this purpose. Field investigations and analysis of project documentation for\n   numerous check dams and aggradations in Serbia were carried out. Potential\n   quantities and quality of groundwater in the aggradations were analyzed as a\n   resource for the water supply of the population. The results of the research\n   indicate very favorable possibilities of the aggradations for the\n   accumulation of groundwater in the form of unconfined or phreatic aquifer\n   with a free water table, in quantities that can be used for water supply. It\n   was stated that: 1) under favorable conditions, with check dams on\n   watercourses with constant flow and large-scale aggradations, there is a\n   possibility of accumulating sufficient quantities of groundwater as a\n   resource for water supply, 2) improving the quality of infiltrated waters by\n   the process of filtration through intergranular porous media of the\n   aggradation, and reaching the level of water supply quality, and 3)\n   favorable economic parameters for opening the source at the aggradation,\n   compared to other types of water sources. The possibility that check dams,\n   in addition to their traditional role, could be used for local water supply\n   facilities was also highlighted.</jats:p>"

A manufacturer‐dominated product and service supply chain game‐theoretic model on the Stackelberg model is developed to analyse how the level of vertical competition in extended warranty service and the intensity of a retailer’s fairness concerns influence the optimal pricing of products and extended warranties for the manufacturer and retailer. This study finds the following: (i) Two parties of the supply chain employ differential pricing strategies for extended warranties when the retailer has fairness concerns. (ii) Compared to the same pricing strategies for extended warranty service when the retailer has no fairness concerns, the increase of competition intensity of vertical extended warranty service will enlarge the price difference of extended warranty service. Meanwhile, it is the intensity of fairness concerns that determines the influences of retailer’s fairness concerns on the price difference of extended warranties. (iii) If no fairness concerns are raised, an increase in the level of vertical competition in extended warranty service would benefit both supply chain parties, rather than hurting their profit. If the retailer is fair‐minded, its fairness utility increases when the intensity of the fairness concerns rises in a reasonable range and decreases when the intensity exceeds the reasonable range, but for the manufacturer, its profits will be damaged as long as the retailer raises fairness concerns.</jats:p>",

A numerical analysis illustrates the following: First, the contagion intensity, which measures trade credit’s impact on the banks’ risk exposure, positively relates to the uncertainty of demand. Second, the retailer’s characteristics have a significant, moderating effect on this positive relationship between the banks’ risk exposure and the uncertainty demand. Finally, suppliers can reduce the contagion intensity by screening different types of retailers, which consequently decreases the banks’ risk exposure. </jats:p>",

This has become a troublesome problem for drinking water plants. For successful control of naidid contamination risk, it is necessary to determine the population dynamics under different environmental conditions within drinking water plants, with special emphasis on BAC filters. In this study, field studies of naidid distribution in a drinking water plant were conducted, and the effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) on naidid population dynamics were investigated using the life table method. The results indicated that naidid pollution in the water plant occurred seasonally and was induced by the excessive propagation of naidids in the BAC filters. Increased temperature and DO increased the naidid intrinsic rate of natural increase and decreased the naidid population doubling time. The life table method was also used to acquire the reproductive parameters of naidids in BAC filters based on simulative experiments. These results indicated that naidids can reproduce asexually in BAC filters, and the population doubling time was 12.60 days.</jats:p>",

This approach differs from the prevalent approach, according to which only those service providers having the necessary funds take responsibility for the technical condition and modernisation of public water systems. To implement the idea, a methodology was proposed for assessing the readiness of partnership participants to these relations, considering not only the availability of technical, economic and social com-ponents, but also the trust and mutual responsibility of the parties that are not comprehensively considered in traditional approaches. The practical implementation of the author’s methodology for assessing the readi-ness of municipal water supply enterprises to a public-private partnership and the author’salgorithm for con-cluding PPP projects in the municipal water supply sector, considering the participants ’readiness for part-nership, is implemented using the example of Vodokanal LLC in Iskitim (Novosibirsk region) demonstrating cost reduction and cost, which contributes to revenue growth.

At the same time, one of the four measures proposed by the International Energy Agency for improving energy efficiency in the countries of the world is increasing the use of renewable energy sources in the total electricity production, including not the last role given to dispersed generation. Meanwhile, the consequence of the natural decrease in the levels of iron ore extraction in our country, at depths exceeding 1000-1500 m, that is, towards the projected ones, which already increases the energy intensity of its extraction and the decline of the con-capita ability on the world market. Target setting. The main purpose of this work is to synthesize the features of the electric power supply of iron ore enterprises, provided that they are introduced into the system of their electricity supply of distributed generation sources and analysis of the specifics of their operation. Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. Thus, the actual scientific-practical task is to study the peculiarities of the operation of systems of electricity supply of iron ore enterprises with the use of sources of dispersed generation in their distribution networks. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. Previously, it was proposed to install power plants at the crosscutting overheads, on dumps of quarries and other possible places of installation in the conditions of iron ore enterprises. However, the principles of the implementation of intelligent power supply management systems for the enterprises under consideration, especially when reconfiguring these systems, are not yet definitively defined. The research objective. The purpose of this work is to synthesize the features of the electricity supply of iron ore enterprises, provided that the sources of distributed generation are introduced into their electricity supply system. The statement of basic materials. In a number of previous studies, the authors justify the positive effect of the introduction of dispersed generation into the structure of the power supply systems of enterprises. The application of artificial neural networks in control systems and determination of electrical energy parameters of power supply systems of iron ore enterprises is proposed, which will allow multifactorial management and analysis of energy parameters in the implementation of distributed generation sources. The proposed approach for the implementation of artificial neural networks for modeling the reliability of the power supply system of iron ore enterprises with the introduction of dispersed generation can be presented with the help of artificial neural networks, which will improve predictability of generated electricity by dispersed generation in time. Conclusions. The model of reliability of the power supply system of the field-view enterprises in the implementation of dispersed generation can be represented using artificial neural networks, which will improve predictability of generated electricity by dispersed generation in time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Apart from private traffic, the evacuation of transit-dependent population is also an essential component of emergency preparedness, especially under no-notice evacuation scenarios with limit evacuation horizon. In literature, most bus-based evacuation models for no-notice evacuation are established under implicit assumptions of uniform evacuation horizon among different pick-up locations or fixed bus fleet in the evacuation area. These constraints will distance their models from real-world situations, where evacuation horizon is various due to spatial distribution of pick-up locations and fleet size of bus available for allocation will increase over time in no-notice evacuation. This research presents a risk-based bus schedule model which is differentiated from the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and bus evacuation problem (BEP) in literature, including the objective and the time-dependent parameters. A quantified definition of evacuation risk for pick-up location with concerns of disaster dynamics and time-varying supply-demand conditions is proposed in this paper as a criterion for bus allocation, also acting as a reflection of social equity to some extent. A notion of time-evolving disadvantageous evacuation units (DEU) is introduced to represent the pick-up locations selected for bus allocation with limited resource. The binary integer linear programming (BILP) named risk-based bus schedule model incorporated with DEU notion can provide a reference for resource allocation in stage of both evacuation planning and operation for transit-dependent population. The proposed model structure can effectively capture the changes of evacuation risk among pick-up locations over time to realize real-time bus schedule. Numerical experiments are conducted using the transportation network of the city of Xi’an, China, to test the performance of the model. The applicability and comparison of different bus evacuation models are also discussed in this paper. This research provides insights into dealing with disaster dynamics and time-varying supply conditions in realistic bus-based no-notice evacuation operations.</jats:p>",

To overcome these limitations, tumor‐targeting, redox‐activatable, and oxygen self‐enriched theranostic nanoparticles are developed by synthesizing chlorin e6 (Ce6) conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) with reducible disulfide bonds (HSC) and encapsulating perfluorohexane (PFH) within the nanoparticles (PFH@HSC). The fluorescence and phototoxicity of PFH@HSC nanoparticles are greatly inhibited by a self‐quenching effect in an aqueous environment. However, after accumulating in tumors through passive and active tumor‐targeting, PFH@HSC appear to be activated from “OFF” to “ON” in photoactivity by the redox‐responsive destruction of the vehicle's structure. In addition, PFH@HSC can load oxygen within lungs during blood circulation, and the oxygen dissolved in PFH is slowly released and diffuses over the entire tumor, finally resulting in remarkable tumor hypoxia relief and enhancement of PDT efficacy by generating more singlet oxygen. Taking advantage of the excellent imaging performance of Ce6, the tumor accumulation of PFH@HSC can be monitored by fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging after intravenous administration into tumor‐bearing mice. This PFH@HSC nanoparticle might have good potential for dual imaging‐guided PDT in hypoxic solid tumor treatment.</jats:p>",

Expression of pntAB exhibited significant effects on NADPH supply and l-arginine synthesis. Furthermore, argR and farR, encoding arginine repressor ArgR and transcriptional regulator FarR, respectively, were removed from the genome of C. glutamicum. The competitive branch pathway gene ldh was also deleted. Eventually, an engineered C. glutamicum JML07 was obtained for l-arginine production. Fed-batch fermentation in 5-L bioreactor employing strain JML07 allowed production of 67.01 g L−1  l-arginine with productivity of 0.89 g L−1 h−1 and yield of 0.35 g g−1 glucose.

For this purpose, grounding grids serve as an underground wire loop, and the measuring points are arranged on the ground. At each measuring point, a receiving loop is employed to detect the electromagnetic response generated by transmitting the current of the transmitting loop. Conductor breaks can be diagnosed by analyzing the slices of the electromagnetic response. We study the effect of loop size and height difference through the simulation of an intact 2×2 grounding grid, confirming that it is easier to obtain the topological structure using a small transmitting loop and a small height difference. Furthermore, simulations of an intact 4×4 grounding grid and grids with different locations of conductor breaks are also conducted with a small transmitting loop. It is easy to distinguish the topological structure of the grounding grid and the locations of conductor breaks. Finally, the detection method is applied experimentally. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is an effective technique for conductor break diagnosis.</jats:p>",

Emergency field investigations found that paddy fields, dry land, residential buildings and roads suffered different degrees of impact from the debris flow. This paper reveals the formation process of the debris flow by analyzing the characteristics of rainfall precipitation and sediment supply conditions in the study area and it approaches the practical application of hazard prevention and mitigation constructions. Doppler weather radar analysis indicates that a very high intensity rainfall occurred in the middle and upper zones of the basin, illustrating the importance of enhancing rainfall monitoring in high-altitude areas. The abundant supply of deposits in gully channels is among the significant causes of a transformation from mountain floods to large-scale debris flows. It was also found that the two culverts played an important role in the movement affecting the processes of debris flows which has substantially aggravated the destructive outcome. The excessive supply of solid material and local blockage with outburst along a gully must receive significant attention for the prediction of future debris flows, hazard prevention and mitigation measures.</jats:p>"

Although outcomes after SLT and whole liver transplantation (WLT) are similar on average among pediatric recipients, we hypothesized that the relationship between graft type and outcomes may vary depending on patient, donor, and surgical characteristics. We evaluated graft survival among pediatric (&lt;18 years) deceased donor, liver‐only transplant recipients from March 2002 until December 2015 using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Graft survival was assessed in a Cox proportional hazards model, with and without effect modification between graft type and donor, recipient, and surgical characteristics, to identify conditions where the risk of graft loss for SLT and WLT were similar. In a traditional multivariable model, characteristics associated with graft loss included donor age &gt;50 years, recipient weight &lt;10 kg, acute hepatic necrosis, autoimmune diseases, tumor, public insurance, and cold ischemia time (CIT) &gt;8 hours. In an analysis that explored whether these characteristics modified the relationship between graft type and graft loss, many characteristics associated with loss actually had similar outcomes regardless of graft type, including weight &lt;10 kg, acute hepatic necrosis, autoimmune diseases, and tumor. In contrast, several subgroups had worse outcomes when SLT was used, including recipient weight 10‐35 kg, non–biliary atresia cholestasis, and metabolic disease. Allocation score, share type, or CIT did not modify risk of graft type and graft failure. Although one might anticipate that individuals with higher rates of graft loss would be worse candidates for SLT, data suggest that these patients actually have similar rates of graft loss. These findings can guide surgical decision making and may support policy changes that promote the increased use of SLT for specific pediatric recipients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of the Internet, many traditional retailers have built their online channels. The fairness concern may play an important role in a dual‐channel supply chain with a multichannel retailer. This paper establishes a Stackelberg game model in which a manufacturer produces and sells products through direct online channel and a retailer sells directly to consumers through online and offline channels. The manufacturer’s fairness concern (advantageous inequity) and the retailer’s fairness concern (disadvantageous inequity) are considered. Four scenarios are investigated: no fairness concern (NF), the retailer fairness concern (RF), the manufacturer fairness concern (MF), and both the manufacturer and the retailer fairness concern (MRF). The theoretical analysis shows that if the manufacturer’s advantageous inequity concern is low, the profit of the whole supply chain in the MRF scenario is the greatest. Otherwise, the supply chain profit in the NF or RF scenario is the greatest. That is, the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s fairness concern may increase the profit of the supply chain. This study also finds that the manufacturer’s advantageous inequity concern can increase the social welfare. The retailer should not concern about fairness if the manufacturer has high fairness concern. Besides, this paper shows that the manufacturer’s selling price cannot be affected by the fairness concern. Adjusting the wholesale price is the only thing that the manufacturer can do to reduce disadvantageous or advantageous inequity. In the RF scenario, the role of the retailer’s disadvantageous inequity concern is to reallocate the supply chain profit. Our findings provide some managerial insights on the pricing decision when the multichannel retailer and the manufacturer consider the fairness.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the fluctuation mode is considered suitable for long-duration use.

The latter are often considered superior in terms of climate change mitigation potential. Uncertainty remains over their availability as feedstocks for biomass provision and the net greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) during crop production. Our objective was to assess the optimal land allocation to wheat and <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> in a specific case study located in England, to increase biomass availability, improve the carbon balance (and reduce the consequent GHG emissions), and minimally constrain grain production losses from wheat. Using soil and climate variables for a catchment in east England, biomass yields and direct nitrogen emissions were simulated with validated process‐based models. A ‘Field to up‐stream factory gate’ life‐cycle assessment was conducted to estimate indirect management‐related GHG emissions. Results show that feedstock supply from wheat straw can be supplemented beneficially with LCB from <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> grown on selected low‐quality soils. In our study, 8% of the less productive arable land area was dedicated to <jats:italic>Miscanthus,</jats:italic> increasing total LCB provision by about 150%, with a 52% reduction in GHG emission per ton LCB delivered and only a minor effect on wheat grain production (−3%). In conclusion, even without considering the likely carbon sequestration in impoverished soils, agriculture should embrace the opportunities to provide the bioeconomy with LCB from dedicated, perennial crops. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

The traditional process to produce a custom‐made foot orthotic device is to use manual casting of foot shape and physical moulding of orthoses materials. Parts of this process can be undertaken using digital tools rather than manual processes with potential advantages. The aim of this trial was to provide the first comparison of a traditional orthoses supply chain to a digital supply chain over a 6 month period. The trial used plantar pressure, health status, and health service time and cost data to compare the two supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Fifty‐seven participants with diabetes were randomly allocated to each supply chain. Plantar pressure data and health status (EQ5D, ICECAP) was assessed at point of supply and at six‐months. The costs for orthoses and clinical services accessed by participants were assessed over the 6 months of the trial. Primary outcomes were: reduction in peak plantar pressure at the site of highest pressure, assessed for non‐inferiority to current care. Secondary outcomes were: reduction in plantar pressure at foot regions identified as at risk (&gt; 200 kPa), cost‐consequence analysis (supply chain, clinician time, service use) and health status.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>At point of supply pressure reduction for the digital supply chain was non‐inferior to a predefined margin and superior (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.1) to the traditional supply chain, but both supply chains were inferior to the margin after 6 months. Custom‐made orthoses significantly reduced pressure for at risk regions compared to a flat control (traditional − 13.85%, digital − 20.52%). The digital supply chain was more expensive (+£13.17) and required more clinician time (+ 35 min).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper integrates carbon emission reduction via technological innovation with consumer channel preferences in both single- and dual-channel supply chains selling low-carbon products. Linear demand functions which simultaneously reflect the consumers’ channel preferences and low-carbon sensitivity are developed by considering the consumers’ segmentation. On this basis, we present two Stackelberg game models: one for each of the single- and dual-channel supply chains. In the first, the manufacturer sells low-carbon products through a traditional retailer who has a physical store, while in the second the manufacturer opens an online direct channel to compete with the traditional retailer. For the two models developed, the optimal pricing decisions, carbon emission reduction level, and profits are derived and discussed. Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed models and solutions. The results show that supply chain members’ profits are affected by system parameters such as the carbon price, consumers’ low-carbon sensitivity, channel preference, etc. Furthermore, although the aforementioned parameters stimulate the manufacturer to reduce carbon emission, this does not always benefit the retailer. Comparison of the two models indicates that dual-channel selling is only the better choice for both the manufacturer and the retailer under certain conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western women. Tumor neoangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, may be used as a prognostic marker for cancer progression. Clinical practice uses dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to detect cancers based on increased blood flow and capillary permeability. However, DCE-MRI requires repeated injections of contrast media. Therefore we explored the use of noninvasive time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography for serial studies of mouse mammary glands to measure the number and size of arteries feeding mammary glands with and without cancer. Virgin female C3(1) SV40 TAg mice (n=9), aged 18-20 weeks, were imaged on a 9.4 Tesla small animal scanner. Multislice T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-weighted (T2W) images and TOF-MRI angiograms were acquired over inguinal mouse mammary glands. The data were analyzed to determine tumor burden in each mammary gland and the volume of arteries feeding each mammary gland. After<jats:italic> in vivo</jats:italic> MRI, inguinal mammary glands were excised and fixed in formalin for histology. TOF angiography detected arteries with a diameter as small as 0.1 mm feeding the mammary glands. A significant correlation (r=0.79; p&lt; 0.0001) was found between tumor volume and the arterial blood volume measured in mammary glands. Mammary arterial blood volumes ranging from 0.08 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to 3.81 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> were measured. Tumors and blood vessels found on<jats:italic> in vivo</jats:italic> T2W and TOF images, respectively, were confirmed with<jats:italic> ex vivo</jats:italic> histological images. These results demonstrate increased recruitment of arteries to mammary glands with cancer, likely associated with neoangiogenesis. Neoangiogenesis may be detected by TOF angiography without injection of contrast agents. This would be very useful in mouse models where repeat placement of I.V. lines is challenging. In addition, analogous methods could be tested in humans to evaluate the vasculature of suspicious lesions without using contrast agents.</jats:p>",

Out of\n583 samples, 418 were found to be adulterated with more\nthan 8% water, and 224 had fat content below the standard of\n3.5%, with various other adulterants including glucose in 106\nsamples, formaldehyde in 17 samples, sucrose in 92 samples,\nsalts in 24 samples, maltodextrin in 34 samples, and melamine\nin one sample. 488 samples had lower than standard solidnot-fat (SNF) levels. Besides, 17 samples were identified\nas chemically constituted milk, and only 42 samples met\nminimum standards. Out of the 87 samples tested from the\nmilk tankers, 79 samples failed to meet the quality standards,\n67 samples were found to have added water, 7 samples had\na fat content of less than 3.5%, 17 samples were found with\nadded glucose, 15 samples were found with added sucrose, 5\nsamples tested positive for formaldehyde addition, 76 samples\nhad low SNF (Solid-Not-Fat) levels. It can be summarized from\nthe results that quality of raw milk in the province is not up to\nthe standards and posing public health issue in the region due\nto adulteration and needs drastic reforms in improving supply\nchain management, enforcement mechanism and awareness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The concept of overall hydrological alteration degree in the traditional range of variability approach is no longer suitable for the requirements of the current changing environment. First, by introducing the analytic hierarchy process and including the concept of deviation in the range of variability approach, the traditional range of variability approach is improved. Second, by using the daily flow data from the Guide gauging station in the lower reaches of Longyangxia reservoir from 1954 to 2017 and by combining the concept of connection degree in set pair analysis, a more comprehensive overall hydrological alteration degree is obtained. Finally, based on the results of overall hydrological alteration degree in each period, a dynamic evaluation model of overall hydrological alteration degree is established based on a set pair analysis–Markov chain method. The results show that the overall hydrological alteration degree of the Longyangxia reservoir in the postimpact period is at the second level; its average is −0.43, but its identity tends to increase. Furthermore, the dynamic evaluation model shows that the overall hydrological alteration degree of its stable state will be 0.1726, its impact flow changes and its stable state will be at the third level. This is a positive developing trend.</jats:p>",
