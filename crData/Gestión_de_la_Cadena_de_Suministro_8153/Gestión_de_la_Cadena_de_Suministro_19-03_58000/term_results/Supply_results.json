The supply curve tells us about the sellers. Supply depends on factors such as the price, costs, the number of producers, and the resources available. The supply curve is usually upward-sloping, this assumes that to produce more, the extra costs will increase, which means that a higher price is needed by producers to be able to produce. The price elasticity of supply measures how sensitive the quantity supplied is to changes in price.</p>",

In fact, the increasing level of connectivity is transforming supply chains, and it creates new opportunities but also new risks in the cyber space. Hence, cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM) is emerging as a new management construct. The ultimate aim is to help organizations in understanding and improving the CSCRM process and cyber resilience in their supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This research relied on a qualitative approach based on a comparative case study analysis involving five large multinational companies with headquarters, or branches, in the UK.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Results highlight the importance for CSCRM to shift the viewpoint from the traditional focus on companies’ internal information technology (IT) infrastructure, able to “firewall themselves” only, to the whole supply chain with a cross-functional approach; initiatives for CSCRM are mainly adopted to “respond” and “recover” without a well-rounded approach to supply chain resilience for a long-term capacity to adapt to changes according to an evolutionary approach.

It provides an analysis and classification of cyber and information risks, sources of risks and initiatives to managing them according to a supply chain perspective, along with an investigation of their adoption across the supply chain. It also studies how the concept of resilience has been deployed in the CSCRM process by companies. By laying the first empirical foundations of the subject, this study stimulates further research on the challenges and drivers of initiatives and coordination mechanisms for CSCRM at a supply chain network level.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Results invite companies to break the “silos” of their activities in CSCRM, embracing the whole supply chain network for better resilience. The adoption of IT security initiatives should be combined with organisational ones and extended beyond the dyad. Where applicable, initiatives should be bi-directional to involve supply chain partners, remove the typical isolation in the CSCRM process and leverage the value of information. Decisions on investments in CSCRM should involve also supply chain managers according to a holistic approach.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>A supply chain perspective in the existing scientific contributions is missing in the management of cyber and information risk. This is one of the first empirical studies dealing with this interdisciplinary subject, focusing on risks that are now very high in the companies’ agenda, but still overlooked. It contributes to theory on information risk because it addresses cyber and information risks in massively connected supply chains through a holistic approach that includes technology, people and processes at an extended level that goes beyond the dyad.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Some of these villages are currently without electricity from the national grid and public piped water supply. In this study, a solar-powered ultrafiltration membrane water treatment system was installed at a rural village in Perak, Malaysia, to identify its feasibility. The ultrafiltration system was evaluated and compared with a conventional sand/media filtration water treatment system at the same location. Various aspects of both systems such as operational parameters, life-cycle cost and carbon emissions have been analyzed under this study. The distinct advantages of the ultrafiltration system include better filtrate turbidity quality (below 0.4 NTU), and lower operational cost and carbon emission. By utilizing a cross-flow filtration operation mode, the UF system does not require a daily intermittent backwash sequence, unlike the conventional system, to further simplify the daily operational routine. Accessibility of clean water supply for all has been heavily emphasized by the United Nations General Assembly (under sustainable development goal number 6) to ensure public health. This comprehensive study highlights the feasibilities of solar-powered ultrafiltration membrane water treatment systems for rural villages in Malaysia.</jats:p>",

At present, the supply risk events caused by the CSR violations of service providers in the service supply chain are frequent, which highlight the importance of formulating appropriate contracts to constrain the CSR level of providers. In the context of asymmetric CSR cost information, this paper analyzes the optimal contract parameters of integrators when providing screening contracts or pooling contracts and compares their impact on profits and the CSR level. The information asymmetry belongs to classic principal-agent problem, and we will use the revelation principle to design the contracts and solve this problem. The results that different contracts have different effects on the CSR level of different types of providers. A low-cost provider’s CSR level is the highest when a screening contract is provided, while a high-cost provider’s CSR level reaches the peak under a pooling contract. If pursuing profit maximization, the integrator should choose to provide a screening contract. When the integrator needs to ensure a higher average level of social responsibility, a pooling contract should be chosen. The findings also show that service cost is an important factor affecting the CSR level of the provider, and only when the providers’ service cost is low, will providers actively fulfill their social responsibility.</jats:p>"

The cell manufacturing market is dominated by a few large players from Asia, with China getting more important. Cell costs will level out around €75 kWh−1 in the second half of the next decade. Increased volumetric energy density is the main cost reduction lever, but manufacturing processes will also provide further cost reduction opportunities. In that context, for solid state technology to be successful in automotive application, it must fulfil all important performance requirements such as fast charging capabilities, long cycle life and safety, while being significantly cheaper. Process technology development will scale volume of cathode active material processing units, causing a severe cost disadvantage risk to small sized players. Overall, demand for (battery-grade) nickel, cobalt and lithium will increase significantly. Therefore price risks due to high concentration levels for raw and refined materials and political country risks need to be mitigated, but supply shortages are unlikely. As a consequence recycling is getting increasingly important—from a cost perspective, as well as from the perspective of securing raw material supply.</jats:p>",

There is a potential to relieve this pressure through integration of a dry port, as a seaport’s inland interface, in the supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to explain how a supply chain can benefit or enhance its outcomes of cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation, by the integration of a dry port. The data for this case study is collected through interviews and site visits from the privately owned Skaraborg dry port, Sweden; and the study is limited to the actors of the transport system involved in the development and operations of the dry port integrated setup. The results show that the six supply chain outcomes (cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation) are perceived by the actors as being desirable, and can be enhanced by the integration of a dry port in the supply chains. In particular, the enhancement of the supply chain outcomes can be achieved due to intermodality and reliability of rail transportation and customization of services associated with the dry port integrated setup, and by increasing the capacity of transportation system.</jats:p>"

Also, the possibilities of digital transformation in supply chain management are analyzed, and the feasibility of a transition to a network approach in supply chain management that makes it possible to obtain a more flexible, transparent and reliable supply chain is substantiated. Possible digital technologies such as machine learning, cloud technologies, Internet of Things, blockchain, advanced analytics are identified and structured. On this basis, a model is developed and proposed on the basis of a scorerating evaluation method, which allows the company to identify at an early stage a priority digital solution for implementation. The proposed model was tested by the author for one of the supply chain management areas  warehousing. Key processes were identified and possible digital alternatives were considered in each of the selected processes. In conclusion, the author emphasized the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed model and the prospects for further research on this topic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when micro-organisms develop the ability to counteract antimicrobial drugs through previous exposure. The past decade has seen an increased prevalence of AMR bacteria due to widespread antimicrobial use (AMU). A substantial share of antimicrobial consumption is attributed to animal production, particularly within the pig industry as it is recognised to be a high user of antimicrobials. Considerable research has focused on the scientific mechanisms of AMR; however, limited literature exists regarding the perceptions of food producers towards AMR. Four databases; Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google were used to search keywords; ‘UK,’ ‘pork,’ ‘supply’ and ‘chain’ to identify relevant papers. Each paper was inspected to ensure that a pork supply chain was illustrated. Interviews were conducted respectively with professionals working in the pork sector to verify the chain and uncover perceptions towards AMU and AMR. Results verified the accurate mapping of the pork chain, enabling professionals to highlight areas of AMU. Stakeholders perceived antimicrobials as useful for the treatment of diseases however, opinions varied regarding the transfer of AMR to humans and the effects this may have on health. To combat the problem of AMR and high use of antimicrobials within the pig industry, it is necessary to identify the key stages of AMU and to uncover stakeholder perceptions along the pork chain. Results will be verified using surveys and an intervention will be designed to enhance knowledge and understanding of AMR to influence a change in behaviour and thus, positively impact farmers on-farm practices.</jats:p>",

Establishing standards for environmental practices and working conditions for suppliers through codes of conduct, and then monitoring their performance with audits, is the common method used by MNEs. However, this approach has proven deficient in many cases as the suppliers are often not capable or unwilling to make the changes necessary to assure long-term sustainability of their operations. Audits often are insufficient in uncovering practices that do not meet the codes of conduct, and in any case, do not usually reveal if the firm is on a path to continue to improve their sustainability practices. Drawing upon the experiences of firms that have implemented productivity and quality improvement programs in their global supply chains, some implications for how to implement successful sustainability programs can be found. The challenges that MNEs and their suppliers must overcome to achieve this are discussed and suggestions made on how to achieve real sustainability in global supply chains.</jats:p>"

Big producers opt for a strategy of outsourcing logistic services, especially storage, delivery, and distribution services to end-customers. Commitment to the strategy of outsourcing, at the same time, is the strategy of focus on the core business. Small producers, especially manufacturers of agricultural food products, have recently opted to avoid intermediaries in the transport and distribution of the product to the end customer. All in order to increase the quality of their own products and increase the competitiveness by eliminating the costs of intermediaries in transport and distribution. This is achieved by merging and shortening the supply chain. The EU has established an institutional framework regulating the operations of producers through a short supply chain. The market situation requires further optimization by producers due to lack of labour and the need to increase competitiveness and leads to the emergence of a reversible supply chain phenomenon. In the paper, the author, by applying general and special scientific methods of cognition, explores the advantages and shortcomings of the short and reversible supply chain, derived from the traditional and modern supply chain model.</jats:p>",

The integration of technologies has improved business processes, increased production speed, and reduced distribution costs. However, the increased interdependencies among various supply chain stakeholders have brought many challenges including lack of third party audit mechanisms and cascading cyber threats. This has led to attacks such as the manipulation of the design specifications, alterations, and manipulation during distribution. The aim of this paper is to investigate and understand supply chain threats. In particular, the paper contributes towards modeling and analyzing CSC attacks and cyber threat reporting among supply chain stakeholders. We consider concepts such as goal, actor, attack, TTP, and threat actor relevant to the supply chain, threat model, and requirements domain, and modeled the attack using the widely known STIX threat model. The proposed model was analyzed using a running example of a smart grid case study and an algorithm to model the attack. A discrete probability method for calculating the conditional probabilities was used to determine the attack propagation and cascading effects, and the results showed that our approach effectively analyzed the threats. We have recommended a list of CSC controls to improve the overall security of the studied organization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In conventional reliability analysis, the duration of interruptions relied on the input parameter of mean time to repair (MTTR) values in the network components. For certain criteria without network automation, reconfiguration functionalities and/or energy regulator requirements to protect customers from long excessive duration of interruptions, the use of MTTR input seems reasonable. Since modern distribution networks are shifting towards smart grid, some factors must be considered in the reliability assessment process. For networks that apply reconfiguration functionalities and/or network automation, the duration of interruptions experienced by a customer due to faulty network components should be addressed with an automation switch or manual action time that does not exceed the regulator supply restoration time. Hence, this paper introduces a comprehensive methodology of substituting MTTR with maximum action time required to replace/repair a network component and to restore customer duration of interruption with maximum network reconfiguration time based on energy regulator supply requirements. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique was applied to medium voltage (MV) suburban networks to estimate system-related reliability indices. In this analysis, the purposed method substitutes all MTTR values with time to supply (TTS), which correspond with the UK Guaranteed Standard of Performance (GSP-UK), by the condition of the MTTR value being higher than TTS value. It is nearly impossible for all components to have a quick repairing time, only components on the main feeder were selected for time substitution. Various scenarios were analysed, and the outcomes reflected the applicability of reconfiguration and the replace/repair time of network component. Theoretically, the network reconfiguration (option 1) and component replacement (option 2) with the same amount of repair time should produce exactly the same outputs. However, in simulation, these two options yield different outputs in terms of number and duration of interruptions. Each scenario has its advantages and disadvantages, in which the distribution network operators (DNOs) were selected based on their operating conditions and requirements. The regulator reliability-based network operation is more applicable than power loss-based network operation in counties that employed energy regulator requirements (e.g., GSP-UK) or areas with many factories that required a reliable continuous supply.</jats:p>"

The tracer substance 1,2,3-benzotriazole allowed estimation of the maximal concentration of pharmaceuticals and the evolution profile for tramadol and sotalol. After pre-ozonation of raw water, most pharmaceuticals were completely removed, except levetiracetam and irbesartan, confirming the efficiency of this advanced oxidation process. Irbesartan and levetiracetam were completely removed by granular activated carbon filtration. Levetiracetam was the most reluctant compound. A conventional multi-barrier treatment combining ozone and activated carbon, already used for several decades before implementation in wastewater treatment, can completely remove most pharmaceuticals. Therefore, drinking water without any significant health-related amount of these pharmaceuticals can be produced from surface water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The vapor compression heat pumps are very popular solutions regarding heat supply systems of modern, low energy buildings. It is partly due to the fact that they are treated as a sustainable heat supply. The question arises: Can a vapor compression heat pump be treated as a sustainable heat supply? To answer this question; the exergy model of a heat pump system operation has been proposed. The proposed model has been employed for evaluation of exergy efficiency of an existing heat supply system equipped with two heat pumps installed in an educational building located on the campus of Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland. The analysis shows that the system exergy efficiency decreases with an increase in outdoor temperature and its values are in the range of 10.9% to 42.0%. The primary exergy efficiency, which considers the conversion of fossil fuel into electricity, is on average 3.2 times lower than the system exergy efficiency for the outdoor temperature range of −9 °C to 11 °C. The performed analysis allowed for the identification of a set of solutions that may increase the exergy and primary exergy efficiency of the system. The first solution is to cover a part of the electricity demand by a renewable energy source. The second proposition is to apply a low-temperature emission system for heating. The third idea is to apply a district heating network as the heat supply instead of the heat pump. The conclusion is that the exergy performance of systems with heat pumps is rather poor because they generate low-quality heat from high-quality electricity. The best way to improve the primary exergy efficiency of a heat pump system is to power the system by electricity generated from a renewable energy source.</jats:p>"

Since the SCSC is in the developing stage, it needs to be supported by governments to encourage cooperation among the members of SCSC. One of the most common governmental supports for domestic suppliers is the assignment of subsidy to improve the SCSC's performance and its profit. This paper explores a two-echelon SCSC where three scenarios—including the presence of a domestic supplier in a monopoly market, the presence of a foreign rival in a competitive market, and government intervention in a competitive market—are investigated. In addition, the scenario considering the government intervention is analyzed under the non-cooperative Nash behavior (decentralized), centralized, and collaboration circumstances, the optimal values of which are discussed. SCSC members cooperate with each other through the collaboration condition. The objective function related to the government's role is defined as the main objective in order to calculate the optimal government tariffs, while the supply chain components obtain a profit more than the decentralized situation. This study has been examined using numerical examples, whose results show that the government intervention affects the price, efficiency, and members' profit. Finally, managerial insights are proposed and discussed to enhance the efficiency of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

In order to study the prospects of and readiness of small enterprises for cooperation within network structures an express questionnaire online survey of the representatives of small companies in different sectors of Lviv and Lviv region (Ukraine) was conducted. The sample included 134 respondents.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> Calculation and statistical analysis of empirical material collected within the survey has not confirmed the assumption made by the authors about presupposed that the overwhelming majority of the representatives of small and micro enterprises would be open to (ready for) cooperation in the supply chains, ready for close interaction in the field of IC, business process integration with the supply network or chain participants/partners, etc. Only 7.6% are ready to be active participants of network structures, 84.6% are not yet clear about that, while 7.8% object to such cooperation. Less than 40% are ready to integrate their ICs with the ICs of network participants, and the same is the number of those who are not yet clear about that. The largest number of negative answers was given to the question about the readiness to share competences, expertise with network participants – 38.5% and 30.7% are not clear about that. Commodity (service) certification procedure is the direction where the representatives of SMEs showed the strongest readiness for cooperation (69.2%)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Value Added:</jats:bold> The article suggests a model of the mechanism of strategic development of small and medium-sized family businesses in the supply chain. This model involves, primarily, combination of strategies specific to the micro level and integrated systems, and secondly, delineation of typifying of strategic decisions in such areas as the basic strategies of competitive behaviour, strategies of supply chain development, strategies of supply system planning, relationship institutionalization strategies and specialization strategies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Recommendations:</jats:bold> Modern supply networks and chains must possess a considerable elasticity potential that will enable them to successful adjust to the turbulent environment. Such elasticity potential should be developed via involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises with a relatively narrow specialization. Such process must take place in the context of well-grounded decisions of out/insourcing in the distribution system and towards construction of network structures in the strategic dimension. Involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises will contribute to increased elasticity of network structures’ means.</jats:p>",

Effects of the coating numbers and temperature on flux and ion rejection were evaluated. The number of coating processes increased the thicknesses of the membranes. The ion rejection and water flux decreased with the increasing coating process. Dissolved ions were retained with a rejection of &amp;gt;99.5%. The highest rejections of 99.99% and 99.98% were obtained for sodium and magnesium ions. The coated PVA membranes showed a superior heavy-metal removal greater than 88%. The highest rejection improvements were obtained for zinc (Zn), lithium (Li), and copper (Cu) metals. The zinc, copper, and lithium rejections increased from 89.1%, 88.3%, and 85.1% to 95.3%, 98.46% and 94.4% due to the PEBA coating process, respectively. The influence of PVA thickness on the flux and rejection was also investigated. Increasing the thickness of PVA decreased the flux. The highest flux of 2.34 kg/m2.h was obtained with the membrane having a thickness of 90 µm.</jats:p>",

This characteristic of the early neoclassical theories is analysed through comparison with the modern neo‐Walrasian models of stationary equilibrium, where the stock of capital is not among the givens. It is shown here that the attempt to present capital as a factor of production on a par with labour and land led the early neoclassical authors to write the zero‐net‐accumulation condition, which was required by the stationarity of relative prices, in the form of a market‐clearing condition for the supply of and demand for capital. The rate of interest was therefore understood as the price determined by this market. As is known, however, the view of capital as a factor of production and the rate of interest as the price for its use failed to work and involved several problems, some of which are discussed here.</jats:p>",

Considering the service negative spillover effect, this paper investigates the horizontal Stackelberg competition and optimal service decision in two competing manufacturer-led supply chains. Four competitive structure models are constructed and the corresponding equilibrium solutions are obtained. By comparing the equilibrium results of four different structures, it is found that the service negative spillover effect and competition between supply chains have negative incentive effect on service providers and their supply chains. However, the chain-to-chain competition will benefit the supply chain that does not provide services from free-riding effect, which will be intensified with the intensification of competition. In addition, from the perspective of supply chain network and externality, we find that when the structure of one supply chain remains fixed and the other changes from centralized to decentralized, there will be a “double marginalization” effect. At the same time, the structural change from centralized to decentralized has certain “altruism”, that is, positive network externality, so as to improve the rival’s performance significantly.</jats:p>"

Warehouses are a basic part of the supply chain; they are used to store products and manage the inventory level. A sound warehouse management system can lead to cost reduction and also can improve customer satisfaction. Traditional warehouse management models have become less efficient and unsuitable for today’s increasing market requirements. For the past decades, information and communication technology has been used for warehouse management. This paper presents a new approach for warehouse management by utilizing one of the main pillars of Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things. This new technology enables the connection of several objects through collecting real-time data and sharing them; the resulting information can then be used to support automated decision-making. The architecture of this application is illustrated and its potential benefits are overviewed. A framework is proposed to implement this approach in warehousing management, which can help in providing real-time visibility of everything in the warehouse, increasing speed and efficiency, and preventing inventory shortage and counterfeiting. This proposal gives an effective roadmap for enterprises to improve their warehouses by using the Internet of Things.</jats:p>"

The buyer sources a product from a supplier and then inspects and sells it on the market, subject to quality standards such as regulations about chemical content. Suppliers decide how much effort to exert to ensure compliance with quality standards. Buyers are assumed to comply with contracts because they are based in countries with strong legal systems. We assume that legal enforcement of the supplier’s contractual obligations is not possible. We model the interaction between buyer and supplier as a repeated game in which the partnership can be terminated by the buyer if the supplier refuses to pay penalties for quality violations. After termination, the buyer and supplier each search for a new business partner. We model the interaction between buyer and supplier using relational contacts in which penalties for quality failures are set so that the supplier voluntarily pays them. We show that optimal relational contracts have dynamic form in this setting because the value of the outside option available to the parties, if the relationship is terminated, is determined by the contract terms. We characterize the properties of the optimal dynamic equilibria and analyze the use of third-party quality certifications within this framework. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2990 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management. </jats:p>",

To support a broad range of restoration practices, a consolidated supply chain able to represent regional plant diversity is essential. This study investigated the restoration species pool in native plant nurseries in São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil and evaluated their geographic distribution, similarity of their plant stocks and the proportion of species represented from regional floras. Despite the lack of technical assistance and the large presence of non-native species (126 species, average 7.5 species/nursery), we found still more impressive native species richness in plant nurseries (561 species, average 86.4 species/nursery) from both the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado domains, representing 38 to 44% of regional floras. There was a huge bias toward tree and shrub species (96.6%) and absence or underrepresentation of other growth forms, as well as of savanna specialists, animal-dispersed and threatened species. The great dissimilarity of species offered in the nurseries surveyed underscores the importance of regional seed collection practices. Effective assistance and capacitation are essential to address issues related to misidentification of species, underrepresentation of most functional plant groups, and the presence of non-native species, as well as to support the supply chain, currently undergoing market downturn.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Author contributions</jats:title><jats:p>‘CYV and RRR conceived and designed the research.

This recent outbreak is one of 24 drinking-waterborne disease outbreaks in affluent nations that have been reported in the scientific literature since the infamous Walkerton, Ontario, Canada fatal outbreak (2,300 cases, seven fatalities) in May 2000. These disasters were all eminently preventable given the economic and intellectual resources existing in the countries where they occurred. These outbreaks are analysed according to major recurring themes, including: complacency, naiveté and ignorance, failure to learn from experience and chemophobia. Lessons that can be learned to improve preventive approaches for ensuring safe drinking water are based on an extensive and authentic body of evidence in support of meaningful improvements. Philosopher George Santayana captured this need with his famous quote: ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’</jats:p>",

The study employed a supply chain analysis approach, which focused on the functions and risks that occur along the fresh produce chain. The results highlight the risks that impede the participation of smallholder farmers in formal, high-value chains. At the production level, risk is prominent from input procurement through to the post-harvest stage of the chains. At the retail and consumption level, risks are linked to the adherence to quality and quantity standards, including prescribed packaging, grading, labelling and traceability and transport requirements. As a result of these risks across the formal chain, smallholder farmers often resort to distributing their products in low-value informal markets. The consequence is that smallholder farmers tend to remain trapped in poverty, in part, because of their risk appetites and their ability to bear risk. 8Further research is required in the areas pertaining to smallholder farmersâ€™ risk appetite and risk-bearing ability and mechanisms to deal with the particular risks in the value chain that impede their all-round ability to escape the â€œsmallholder dilemmaâ€.</jats:p>"

Qualitative analysis yields nine elements of integration that emerge from the large number of integrative practices. In doing so, the paper maps out the structure of the broad SCI construct and discusses the theoretical repercussions of this new approach. New theoretical insights and research directions are identified based on this new micro-level activity-based view of SCI. This paper shifts the focus from where integration is done (customer vs. supplier integration) to what integration entails. SCI has become a very broad construct over time. This paper is a significant and systematic step in unraveling the structure of this broad conceptual domain.

There are extensive networks of underground facilities to fulfil the demand, such as water supply pipelines, sewage pipelines, metro structures, etc. Hence, a method to regularly assesses the risk of the underground facility failures is needed to decrease the chance of accidental loss of service or accidents that endanger people and facilities. In the proposed work, a cohesive hierarchical fuzzy inference system (CHFIS) was developed. A novel method is proposed for membership function (MF) determination called the heuristic based membership functions determination (HBMFD) method to determine an appropriate MF set for each fuzzy logic method in CHFIS. The proposed model was developed to decrease the number of rules for the full structure fuzzy inference system with all rule implementation. Four very crucial parameters were considered in the proposed work that are inputs to the proposed CHFIS model in order to calculate the risk of water supply pipelines. In order to fully implement the proposed CHFIS just 85 rules are needed while using the traditional Mamdani fuzzy inference system, 900 rules are required. The novel method greatly reduces implementation time and rule design sets that are extremely time consuming to develop and difficult to maintain.</jats:p>"

The data have been sourced from CBN Statistical Bulletin 2017 edition and CBN Annual Reports while Ordinary Least Squares method is used to carry out the analysis with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The results of the study indicate that Federal Government Independent Revenue (FGIR) and State government Independent Revenue (SGIR) influence money supply positively and significantly.

Most importantly, the study finds evidence that independent generated revenue of local government councils in Nigeria does not have positive influence on money supply in the country. Therefore, the study suggests that monetary policies in the country should incorporate local government optimal management of revenue to avoid unfavorable economic situations such as inflation which is prompted by too much money circulating in an economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This study aims to provide a better understanding of SSC in emerging economies and proposes a generic framework to improve the decision‐making process. Based on a review of the literature, a decision framework for sustainability is proposed. A green sustainable decision concept is also discussed in the SSC literature.

Conversion to 4th generation district heating (4GDH) is an effective method for reducing the need for large investments in the electricity grid, while simultaneously improving the energy efficiency of district heating systems. This article evaluates the possibility of reducing the supply temperature in existing Norwegian apartment blocks by improving the thermal envelope and reducing the temperature levels for the heating system. The analysis is based on simulations in IDA ICE (IDA Indoor Climate and Energy) focusing on whether the reduced supply temperature guarantees thermal comfort in the building, considering the coldest room with a heating setpoint of 22 °C. Based on a recommended minimum acceptable indoor temperature of 19 °C from the Norwegian building regulations (TEK), it should be possible to lower the radiator supply temperature from 80 to 60 °C for apartment blocks newer than 1971. For older buildings, an “intermediate” renovation is necessary to maintain temperatures above 19 °C, however, a “standard” renovation is recommended to ensure thermal comfort and improve the energy efficiency of the building stock.</jats:p>"

Empirical analysis largely confirms predictions derived from a theoretical model calibrated to WIOD data for 2000 and 2011. Barriers to trade in manufacturing and services are both found to have a cross‐border impact on jobs in their own sector and spill‐over effects in other sectors, the latter becoming stronger over time. This article shows the labour market consequences of the increased interconnectedness of countries and sectors through global supply chains, which suggests that trade policy can have significant external effects on foreign labour markets.</jats:p>",

The study employs data from 2009 to 2018 and uses Ordinary Least Squares regression technique for analysis of the data. The findings reveal that broad money supply (M2) has an insignificant negative influence on RGDP in Nigeria, but in Ghana the impact is significant and positive. Broad money supply (M3) exerts insignificant positive influence on RGDP in Nigeria, but significant negative impact on RGDP in Ghana while credit to private sectors (CPS) has insignificant positive influence on RGDP in both Nigeria and Ghana. The study among others suggests that the Monetary Authorities in the two countries should come up with monetary policy strategies that will help drive the economy better and such policies should consider M2 and CPS more as their contributions are necessary for economic expansion that lead to more output and employment.</jats:p>"

However, little is known about this vital ATP transport process across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-antagonized mechanism, or<jats:italic>CaATiER</jats:italic>(<jats:bold>Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>-A</jats:bold>ntagonized<jats:bold>T</jats:bold>ransport into<jats:bold>ER</jats:bold>) mechanism for brevity. Significantly, we observed that a Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER. Therefore Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>signaling in the cytosol is inevitably coupled with ATP supply to the ER. We propose that under physiological conditions, cytosolic Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>inhibits ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors, and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP trafficking from mitochondria into the ER.

The study reviewed both theoretical and empirical literature and then proposed the research methodology that addressed the gaps identified in literature as well as to validate the statistical hypotheses. The study preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. The target population was all the 187 state corporations in Kenya. Questionnaires were administered to collect qualitative and quantitative data from a sample of 127 heads of procurement, who were selected using simple random sampling, from the four strata. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analyses was used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Results: The response rate of the study was 82%. The findings of the study indicated that administration strategy, monitoring and evaluation, stakeholder management and conflict management have a positive relationship with performance of state corporations in Kenya.Conclusion: Based on the study findings, the study concludes that performance of state corporations can be improved by administration strategy, monitoring and evaluation, stakeholder management and conflict management. First, in regard to administration strategy, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence on performance of state corporations.Policy recommendation: the study recommended that public institutions should embrace contract management practices so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

To investigate the model we have to collect data from seven locations of three districts in Bangladesh. Also, a numerical example presented this study, which objectives illustrate the models. From the sensitivity of the production, if the raw material cost, labour cost and fertilizer cost increase is about 5%, then decrease the profit by MILP model have 0.004%, 1.6% and 1.2% respectively. Labour cost is a significant factor in profit, which changes the profit more than the raw material cost and fertilizer cost of the product.

The quality of credit therefore is closely related to bank management and the security of social resources. Logistics industry, presenting critical status in national economy, connects thousands of businesses and maintains national economy. However, financing difficulty has been a bottleneck for the development. The frequent financing difficulty becomes a restriction against the development of logistics industry.

The paper stresses that the NOM rests on a complex network of contracts resulting in a layer of contractualised governance that obscures its architecture and decision-making processes. It maps the changes that the NOM introduces in the operation and governance of the NHS supply chain and identifies key challenges in ensuring that the NOM is subjected to adequate oversight and accountability mechanisms, in particular from the perspective of public procurement and competition law.

This trend is found to be rather limited in the case of food products. The main objective of this article is to deal with consumer’s perceptions towards the potential use of social media to create online short supply chains for food. Projective techniques (Sentence completion tasks) have been used in this study. As, they allow researchers to uncover motivations, emotions and beliefs that drive consumer’s perception and behavior which may not be detected by straightforward questioning. The findings of this study have allowed to obtain insight into those aspects that consumers regard as opportunities or barriers of such potential short food chains. The main aspect is to put food enterprises in the picture about what is going on in consumer’s mind. This might open new possibilities for food businesses to develop a new short food chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The selection and design of renewable electricity support instruments is an important part of European Union (EU) energy policy and central to the governance of the Energy Union. In 2014, the European Commission published updated guidelines for state aid that effectively mandate the EU-wide implementation of auctions for allocating revenue support to commercial scale renewable electricity generation. This article argues that the RES auction’s rapid ascent towards dominance is explained by a coincidence of an activist interpretation of EU state aid law creating demand for knowledge about the instrument and the emergence of a ready source of supply from a burgeoning community of a RES auction specialists and experts. Knowledge gained through EU-wide implementation of auctions further adds to supply of auctions expertise among the community. The implications of positive feedback between instrument demand and the growing supply of knowledge about an instrument reinforces the importance of critical engagement between policymakers and policy experts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the impact of multidimensional bargaining and the location of inventory risk on the performance of a two-stage supply chain. We conduct a controlled human subjects experiment where a retailer and supplier either interact through ultimatum offers or dynamically bargain over contract terms, including a wholesale price and, potentially, an order quantity. We also manipulate whether the risk associated with unsold inventory lies with the retailer or the supplier or is endogenously determined in the bargaining process. One key insight is that supply chain efficiency is significantly higher when the order quantity is included in the negotiation and that, contrary to the normative theory, this leads to a Pareto improvement whereby both the supplier and retailer earn higher profits. A second important result, also counter to the normative theory, is that the party incurring the cost of unsold inventory always earns a lower profit than its counterpart, regardless of the bargaining environment or inventory risk location. To explain these data, we posit that retailers and suppliers are affected by an anchoring bias and demonstrate that it can explain many of our results. </jats:p><jats:p> Data and the online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2985 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Gad Allon, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;The proponents of national culture have a strong belief that national culture has an impact on the performance of a firm. They also believe that national culture influences team work and the ability to innovate. They consider the impact of national culture on behavior and relationships to be longer lasting than cultural  influences that tend to diminish as a company changes. On the other hand, the supporters of organizational culture have a strong conviction that well-defined and widely used organizational practices throughout the organization will help an organization become excellent and capable of achieving high levels of performance. Both the partisans of organizational culture and the supporters of national culture have their own reasons as to why each side is more impactful when compared to the other. This paper attempts to answer which side has a stronger impact by reviewing the literature on the effect of national culture or organizational culture on the supply chain operations of MNCs in Japan and the US. It appears that national culture is more impactful than organizational culture when it comes to supply chain operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAHASA INDONESIA ABSTRAK:&lt;/strong&gt; Para pendukung budaya nasional memiliki keyakinan kuat bahwa budaya nasional berdampak pada kinerja perusahaan, mereka juga percaya bahwa budaya nasional mempengaruhi kerja tim, kemampuan untuk berinovasi dan mereka mempertimbangkan dampak budaya nasional terhadap perilaku, hubungan yang berkelanjutan setidaknya itu akan bertahan lebih lama dibandingkan dengan pengaruh budaya organisasi yang cenderung berkurang seiring perubahan perusahaan. Di sisi lain, para pendukung budaya organisasi memiliki keyakinan yang kuat bahwa melalui praktik organisasi yang didefinisikan dengan baik dan banyak digunakan di seluruh organisasi akan membantu organisasi untuk menjadi organisasi yang sangat baik yang mampu mencapai kinerja organisasi yang sangat baik. Baik pendukung budaya organisasi maupun pendukung budaya nasional memiliki alasan sendiri mengapa masing-masing pihak lebih berdampak dibandingkan dengan pihak lain. Makalah ini mencoba untuk menjawab sisi mana yang memang memiliki dampak yang lebih kuat dengan meninjau beberapa literatur tentang pengaruh budaya nasional atau budaya organisasi pada operasi rantai pasokan MNC di Jepang dan AS. Tampaknya budaya nasional lebih berdampak dibandingkan dengan budaya organisasi ketika datang ke operasi rantai pasokan.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The study reviewed both theoretical and empirical literature and then proposed the research methodology that addressed the gaps identified in literature as well as to validate the statistical hypotheses. The study preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. The target population was all the 187 state corporations in Kenya. Questionnaires were administered to collect qualitative and quantitative data from a sample of 127 heads of procurement, who were selected using simple random sampling, from the four strata. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analyses was used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Results: The response rate of the study was 82%. The findings of the study indicated that administration strategy, monitoring and evaluation, stakeholder management and conflict management have a positive relationship with performance of state corporations in Kenya.Conclusion: Based on the study findings, the study concludes that performance of state corporations can be improved by administration strategy, monitoring and evaluation, stakeholder management and conflict management. First, in regard to administration strategy, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence on performance of state corporations.Policy recommendation: the study recommended that public institutions should embrace contract management practices so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

However, our understanding of such networks is still limited due to the lack of network‐wide empirical data as well as the complexity and nonlinearity of supply networks. Herein, we introduce a network formation model to extend and generalize the prior empirical studies that have revealed variable hierarchy topologies and firm‐level transaction specificities across the supply networks for automobiles and electronics. We call it the “ hierarchy‐niche model.” With tuning the parameters for transaction specificity and transaction breadth, the model can generate a wide spectrum of stochastic networks that comply with the production hierarchy to varied degrees. Our simulation analyses show that the model‐generated stochastic networks capture hierarchical and cyclic topologies of real‐world automobile and electronics supply networks. The model, which relates firm‐level transaction patterns to network‐wide emergent topologies, can be further utilized to inform and guide firms’ transaction strategies concerning the overall supply network. </jats:p>",

We synthesized and extensively characterized HA nano-rods (HA-NR), Al/Mg-HA nanocomposites and amorphous aluminum hydroxide, and optimized their efficient defluoridation. The kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption were further evaluated to establish the mechanistic rationale and its spontaneity. We report the optimized ideal adsorbents for the near-total removal of fluoride that demonstrated 99.99% and 99.98% efficiency with adsorption capacities of 83.3 and 81.3mg/g respectively. The adsorbent composites were (Mg-HA)-Al(OH)3 and (HA-NR)-Al(OH)3 in 1:1 ratio. The optimal conditions for defluoridation were 25mg of adsorbent in 25ml (10mg/L) fluoride solution at room temperature agitated for 10h in the pH range of 4.88–7.20.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the current practice in the use of resources is not sustainable. The production companies have to focus not only on cost-effective and profitable operation, but at the same time environmentally friendly and sustainable production in order to increase competitiveness. New innovative technologies are required, improving the efficiency of the processes and the optimization of global supply chains (GSC) in order to establish sustainability in environmental, social, and economic aspects. The aim of the study is the GSCs’ optimization, which means forming the optimal combination of the chain members (suppliers, final assemblers, service providers) to achieve cost-effective, time-effective, and sustainable operation. This study introduces an elaborated single- and multi-objective optimization method, including the objective functions (cost, lead time) and design constraints (production and service capacities; volume of inventories; flexibility and sustainability of the chain members). Based on the elaborated method, software has been developed for the optimization of sustainable GSCs. The significance and novelty of the developed method and software is that the chain members have been required to fulfill the sustainability design constraint built into the software. A real case study is introduced, for the optimal design of a sustainable GSC, to confirm that our developed optimization method and software can be applied effectively in practice for the optimization of both profitable and sustainable GSCs.</jats:p>"

This paper is devoted to the analysis of a commodity-supply system that serves as a standard gold example of a non-repairable multi-state k-out-of-n: G system with independent non-identical components. We express each instance of the multi-state system output as an explicit function of the multi-valued inputs of the system. The ultimate outcome of our analysis is a Multi-Valued Karnaugh Map (MVKM), which serves as a natural, unique, and complete representation of the multi-state system. To construct this MVKM, we use “binary” entities to relate each of the instances of the output to the multi-valued inputs. These binary entities are represented via an eight-variable Conventional Karnaugh Map (CKM) that is adapted to a map representing four variables that are four-valued each. Despite the relatively large size of the maps used, they are still very convenient, thanks to their regular structure. No attempt was made to draw loops on the maps or to seek minimal formulas. The maps just served as handy tools for combinatorial representation and for collectively implementing the operations of ANDing, ORing, and complementation. The MVKM obtained serves as a means for symbolic analysis yielding results that agree numerically with those obtained earlier. The map is a useful tool for visualizing many system properties, and is a valuable resource for computing a plethora of Importance Measures for the components of the system.</jats:p>"

The supplier could face a disruption at its end which could effectively reduce its yield in case of disruption, thereby resulting in supply yield uncertainty. The retailer can finance the supplier using advance selling that can help mitigate the impact of disruption. We model this problem as a Stackelberg game, where the supplier as the leader announces the wholesale price and the retailer responds by deciding its optimal order quantity given stochastic demand and an exogenous fixed retail price. The supplier then commences production and a disruption can happen with a known probability. We assume that under disruption the quantity delivered is a fraction of the initial quantity ordered by the retailer. The retailer loses any unmet demand. We analyze three different scenarios of the Stackelberg game, namely no advance selling with disruption, advance selling without disruption, and advance selling with disruption. Our results indicate that advance selling can be used to mitigate the impact of supply disruption and at the same time could lead to an increase in the overall SC profit.</jats:p>",

Each supplier faces an uncertain production capacity such that only the lesser of the planned production quantity and the realized capacity can be delivered to the assembler. We assume that the suppliers' random capacities and the random demand follow an arbitrary continuous multivariate distribution. We formulate the problem as a two‐stage Stackelberg game. In the base model, the assembler and the suppliers adopt a so‐called vendor‐managed‐consigned‐inventory (VMCI) contract. We analytically characterize the equilibrium of this game, based on which we obtain several managerial insights. Particularly, we show that a reduction in one supplier's production cost or capacity uncertainty, or an increase in the component salvage value, might sometimes hurt this particular supplier's profitability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the suppliers' capacities become more positively correlated, the assembler is always better off, but the suppliers might be better or worse off. Later, in the article, we also solve the game under a wholesale price contract. We find that the assembler always prefers the VMCI contract, and the suppliers always prefer the wholesale price contract. In addition, we illustrate that the VMCI contract is more efficient than the wholesale price contract for this decentralized assembly supply chain.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers have two distribution channel structure strategies: integrated channel and decentralized channel. The channel structure strategy can be influenced by price and service, two key competitive dimensions that affect both customer demand and firm profitability. The authors develop game-theoretic models to explore channel structure strategies for two manufacturers competing on price and service and examine how service provisions affect these strategies. Here, service can be provided by either producers (i.e., manufacturers) or sellers. When manufacturers provide service, this study reveals that symmetric decentralization (i.e., both manufacturers choosing a decentralized channel) is an equilibrium only when price elasticity, service cost, and service competition are low. When service is provided by sellers, symmetric decentralization is an equilibrium only when the retailer’s service cost is high and that of the manufacturer is low; otherwise, an asymmetric equilibrium may exist. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing tendency for suppliers to encroach on the retailers’ market has forced the retailers, being independent entities, to distort shared information to maintain their information superiority. Previous studies on asymmetric information assumed that retailers share information truthfully or that demand satisfies a two-point distribution, which does not always conform to the reality of the dual-channel supply chain. Considering the potential information leakage problem, this paper studied the optimal strategies of the participants and focused on the strategic information management of the dual-channel supply chain. By introducing the retailers’ adverse selection behavior, a sequential game model under general uncertain demand was established, which replaced the classic high-low demand model. The perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium was characterized, which depended on stochastic demand disturbance, product heterogeneity, supply chain structure, and market investigation cost. The results showed that asymmetric information made the supply chain management inefficient. When the demand disturbance was within the threshold, the retailer distorted order quantity to maintain the information advantage under potential information leakage, and information acquisition was not always good for the retailer—in some cases due to adverse selection problems. A numerical example and a sensitivity analysis were done to validate the model. Our work provides participants in the dual-channel supply chain with decision-making support and direction for improving information management.</jats:p>"

To promote further development of green supply chains, a two-echelon green supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer is considered, where the manufacturer is loss-averse and the retailer is risk-neutral. We use a Stackelberg game to investigate the impacts of loss aversion and green efficiency coefficient on retail price, wholesale price, green degree, profits of members, and profit of the green supply chain under the assumption that manufacturer’s reference point of loss aversion is equal to the subgame perfect equilibrium partition. It is shown that, in the centralized decision-making setting (CDS), green degree and profit of the green supply chain are higher than those in the decentralized decision-making setting (DDS), while in the decentralized decision-making setting with a loss-averse manufacturer (DDS-LAM) loss aversion of manufacturer further decreases green degree and profit of green supply chain. It is also found that profits of the manufacturer and the retailer decrease with levels of loss aversion of manufacturer. Furthermore, it is also shown that wholesale price and retail price in the three decision-making settings depend on the green efficiency coefficient. Wholesale price and retail price in DDS-LAM are always the lowest (highest) if the green efficiency coefficient is sufficiently high (low). Finally, executing a greening cost-sharing contract can improve chain members’ profits if the retailer shares an appropriate proportion with the loss-averse manufacturer.</jats:p>"

Between March 2016 and June 2017, we examined water quality within the distribution system in the camps, testing 520 samples in Aida Camp and 198 samples in Alazzah Camp for total coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, and residual chlorine. We observed deterioration in water quality in both camps, but the deterioration was more pronounced in Aida Camp where 2.5% of community-tank samples, 5.0% of network samples, and 10% of rooftop-tank samples contained one or more colonies (per 100 mL) of total coliform bacteria. In Alazzah Camp, 3.7% of community-tank samples, 2.5% of network samples, and 5% rooftop-tank samples contained one or more colonies (per 100 mL) of total coliform bacteria. E. coli was detected in two samples from Aida Camp and one sample from Alazzah Camp. In both camps, average residual chlorine concentrations were higher in the community tanks than in rooftop tanks. The main factor influencing water quality deterioration in rooftop tanks in Aida Camp appears to be air temperature.

The bicipital groove including the LHBT and its intact sheath was cut en-bloc, fixated, sliced in 7 μm sections, Azan stained and the vascular anatomy analyzed under light microscopy. Each sideward branch deriving from the main ascending branches of the anterior humeral circumflex artery (ACHA) in the mesotenon of the LHBT was identified and followed through multiple sections to identify its direction and area of supply. Per specimen, a mean of 2.71±1.85 branches could be identified running through the soft tissue of the mesotenon towards the osseous walls of the groove. Of the total 65 arterial branches in all specimens, 22 (33.8%) were running into the medial wall of the groove and 40 (61.5%) into the lateral wall (P&lt;0.01). The results indicate that branches of the ACHA in the mesotenon of the LHBT provide blood supply not only to the tendon but to the osseous bicipital groove as well and here significantly more to the lateral than to the medial osseous wall. In addition, Pacini-like mechanoreceptors could be identified in the mesotenon in 9 (37.5%) of the specimens which has not been described up to now.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The pancreatic surgery field has evolved greatly over the previous years. Nevertheless, the vascularization of the pancreas remains a difficult subject and requires further attention. The study was conducted using macroscopical dissection and corrosion cast methods. The total number of organ blocks was 72 (50 for dissection and 22 for corrosion cast). Based on the data obtained by dissection, we can distinguish three major types of vascularization of the distal pancreas. In type one, the pancreas was vascularized only by the short branches of the splenic artery and was encountered in 18 cases (36%). In type two, the pancreas was vascularized by the long and short branches of the splenic artery and was encountered in 20 cases (40%). In type three, the pancreas was vascularized only by the long branches of the splenic artery in 12 cases (24%). Compared to that, the corrosion cast method demonstrated type 1 in 8 cases (36.36%), type 2 in 10 cases (45.46%), and type 3 in 4 cases (18.18%). During the dissection, there were no arteries to the tail of the pancreas in 13 (26%) cases, one artery in 15 (30%) cases, two arteries in 19 (38%), and three arteries in three (6%) cases. The 22 corrosion cast specimens were also evaluated based on the classification of Roman Ramos and coworkers. Type I (small arcades) was in 9 (40.90%) cases, type II (small and large arcades) was in 7 (31.82%) cases, type III (large arcades) was in 5 (22.73%) cases, and type IV (straight branches) was in 1 (4.55%) case. The corrosion cast method allowed us to determine no arteries to the tail in 4 (18.18%) cases, one artery in 6 (27.27%) cases, two arteries in 10 (45.46%) cases and three arteries in two (9.09%) cases. The vascularization of the distal part of the pancreas is highly variable and should be taken into consideration during surgery.</jats:p>",

Our position is that the level of interfirm learning is a determinant of the formations and mastery mechanisms evolving in a green SC. Therefore, this study discusses the environmental sustainability of the learning processes of firms’ alliances during the life cycle of the alliances. This is done in order to encourage firms to follow green innovation and green SCs through enhancing their environmental performance and increasing their competitive advantage in the global market. In addition, this study develops a research structure and test hypotheses on the basis of survey data from 342 Taiwanese firms listed on the stock market. The results indicate that green knowledge acquisition plays a prominent role in the performance of firms’ alliances, especially when implemented in a green SC management (SCM) context. Moreover, according to one of the main findings, as companies evolve through the different phases of the alliance life cycle, their situation shows high potential for creating knowledge sharing through their exploration capabilities. Finally, when firms focus their internal organizations on learning and environmental requirements, they become better able to expand their learning capacity as well as to build and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

Yet, there are a number of research issues that arise when academic researchers test middle‐range and practice‐level theory, both in measuring constructs and in testing theoretical relationships between constructs. Concerning the measurement of constructs, this paper recommends that academic researchers pay more attention to content validity and undertake rigorous processes to ensure content validity. In addition, academic researchers need to more explicitly define constructs as either reflective or formative. If the construct is defined as formative, then the traditional statistical approaches to validate these measurement scales are not recommended. The appropriate use of employing single‐item measures for concrete constructs is discussed. In regard to conducting hypothesis tests, research issues associated with multicollinearity and omitted variable bias are discussed. Relative weight analysis is ideal for testing theoretical models and research hypotheses when survey data are obtained, multicollinearity is present, and there are a large number of independent variables predicting a dependent variable. Thus, relative weight analysis is ideal for testing research hypotheses in logistics and supply chain management.</jats:p>",

However, it is far from understood by which mechanisms it is ensured that energy and redox supply by photosynthesis matches the demand of the downstream processes. Here, we deliver a theoretical analysis to quantitatively study the supply–demand regulation in photosynthesis. For this, we connect two previously developed models, one describing the PETC, originally developed to study non‐photochemical quenching, and one providing a dynamic description of the photosynthetic carbon fixation in C3 plants, the CBB Cycle. The merged model explains how a tight regulation of supply and demand reactions leads to efficient carbon fixation. The model further illustrates that a stand‐by mode is necessary in the dark to ensure that the carbon fixation cycle can be restarted after dark–light transitions, and it supports hypotheses, which reactions are responsible to generate such mode in vivo.</jats:p>",

This research aim to understand these innovations following four types proposed by Tidd, Bessant and Pavitt (2008): innovation of product, process, position and paradigm. Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews with ten key actors in this production chain. These interviews were analyzed using content analysis whereas the secondary data were analyzed qualitatively by means of the document analysis technique. Results showed that several innovations occurred in the bovine sector over the past two decades, essentially based on incremental focus, and directed to improving product quality and achieving production efficiency gains. Despite this progress, quality is still a challenge in the sector, in part by limiting access to some markets. In this sense, the action of some agents seems essential to overcome the main barriers of this sector.</jats:p>"

By building small island grids after a blackout, renewable energies can be integrated into the grid restoration process. Bioenergy‐based power plants have some importance for the supply of such island grids because of their high degree of reliability and controllability. Modern bioenergy plants have electrical loads within a specific kW range, which can be partially used in demand‐side management. A concept for the control structure of off‐grid energy systems with a demand‐side management using a microgrid of a farm supplied by a biogas plant as an example is presented. For the integrability of electrical loads of the biogas plant into the energy management system of the microgrid, an off‐grid control procedure has been designed.</jats:p>",

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from the 197 heads of procurement departments because it was a census. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Quantitative data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.Results: R square value of 0.647 means that 64.7% of the corresponding variation in performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya can be explained or predicted by (reverse logistics, outsourcing, strategic alliances and vendor managed inventory) which indicated that the model fitted the study data.Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that reverse logistics, outsourcing, strategic alliances and vendor managed inventory have a positive relationship with performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. Policy recommendation: Finally, the study recommended that food and beverage manufacturing firms should embrace procurement best practices so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other sectors to find out if the same results can be obtained</jats:p>"

In this study, novel developments of artificial neural network (ANN) models, emotional ANN (EANN) and hybrid wavelet-EANN (WEANN), are employed to estimate the daily and monthly SSL of two rivers (Upper Rio Grande and Lighvanchai) with different hydro-geomorphological conditions. The overall results obtained via autoregressive models, the ANN and EANN, specify the supremacy of EANN (with a few hormonal parameters) against ANN due to the EANN better training the model versus extreme conditions. Also, the obtained results exhibit that the WEANN model could improve the SSL modeling up to 42% and 14% for daily modeling and up to 141% and 87% for monthly modeling in the Upper Rio Grande and Lighvanchai Rivers, respectively.</jats:p>",

The control objective is to regulate the supply manifold pressure on cathode side to maintain oxygen excess ratio of the PEM fuel cell. The higher order PEM fuel cell model is approximated to First order plus time delay (FOPTD) model for controller design and analysis. The proposed FOPID controller is designed based on minimization of Integral Absolute Error (IAE) with pre specified maximum sensitivity (M<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) as a constraint. Uncertainty and measurement noise analysis is carried out to verify the robustness of the designed controller. The simulation results of proposed FOPID controller is compared with other designing methods. Based on minimization of IAE value, the SP 1.4 FOPID controller produces IAE value of 0.255 where as AMIGO 1.4 tuning method and ZN based FOPID tuning methods produces 0.263 and 3.817 respectively for perfect case. Based on maximum sensitivity M<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>is 1.4, the SP 1.4 FOPID controller produces M<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>of 1.4 where as AMIGO 1.4 PID and ZN based FOPID tuning methods produces Ms of 1.5 and 1.25 respectively for perfect case, which indicates that the proposed SP 1.4 FOPID controller is robust. The proposed SP 1.4 FOPID provides better values (rise time of 0.331 sec, settling time of 0.692 sec and percentage of peak overshoot of 0.797 for perfect case) when compared with other methods. From simulation results, for the control of supply manifold pressure of PEM fuel cell, the proposed fractional-order PID controllers improves the closed loop performance in terms of rise time, settling time and percentage of peak overshoot when compared to the integer-order PID controllers.</jats:p>",

To assess the basin’s water resources supply and demand, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model was applied to the Administrative Management Units existing in the basin, taking into consideration the water availability and the granted water rights. The application of the organizational and governance model to various scenarios referring to 2030 show that by reordering allocations and water use criteria, implementing a better farm irrigation water management, improving capacity building of existing human resources, and adopting more adequate hard- and software for dams and canal management, it will be possible to accommodate demand in 2030 better than at present despite climate change impacts on demand and supply. In addition, users’ participation will be enhanced.</jats:p>"

First, to explore and classify factors influencing traceability implementation, and second, to cluster essential traceability-related information that demands recording and sharing with businesses and customers, in the context of the textile and clothing supply chain. A Delphi study is conducted with 23 experts (including research practitioners and industry experts) to explore, validate, and classify traceability factors and related information using distribution analyses and hierarchal clustering. As a result, 14 factors and 19 information sets are identified and classified with a moderately high agreement among the experts. Among these, risk management, product authentication, and visibility are the highest ranked and the most important factors influencing traceability implementation in the textile and clothing supply chain. While origin, composition, and sustainability-related information are crucial for sharing with customers, the information vital to businesses includes manufacturer/supplier details, product specifications, and composition. It is noteworthy that this research is among the few that classifies traceability factors and information through expert perspectives, and it creates decisive knowledge of traceability for the textile and clothing supply chain. It further provides insights on the extent to which this information can be shared among supply chain actors. Outcomes of this study can be helpful for the development of an information traceability framework. Policymakers can use the results to draft traceability guidelines/regulations, whilst top management can develop traceability-related strategies.</jats:p>"

In the last decades, interdependence was evident in the increase of coproduction plants and the cross-sectoral resource use footprints. In light of increasing integration due to growing scarcities, the construction of mega projects for coproduction, and the use of renewables across sectors, the security notion can be revisited. This paper proposes a view of the resource supply security based on the systems’ characteristics under change and their ability to deal with risks and shocks (resilience). It introduces internal and external risk factors for the water, energy and food supply systems in the Gulf region and highlights recent knowledge on such risks. Further, the paper explains the vulnerability of supply systems to planning risks like scale, integration intensity and level of service provisions together with risks related to growth, technology, market and climate. In light of such insecurities, we stress the importance of investing in risk management and resilience policies in infrastructure planning. Response measures to future risks can focus on options like storage, knowledge, diversification and, importantly, promoting regional cooperation and synergies from common infrastructure planning between countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</jats:p>"

Based on Stackelberg game theory and considering consumers’ low-carbon and remanufactured product preferences, this paper aims to explore the decision-making efficiency of closed-loop supply chains with warranty services. The results of the study show that consumers’ confidence in purchasing remanufactured products has increased the demand for new products and remanufactured products, in turn also increasing the interest of the member companies of the supply chain, and stimulating the realization of the potential value of remanufacturing, which is conducive to green growth. When a remanufactured product warranty period meets certain conditions, the member companies of the supply chain can obtain optimal profit. The optimal warranty entity selection of a closed-loop supply chain with a warranty service depends on the warranty efficiency of each entity, thus making it necessary to examine the products of each warranty party.</jats:p>"

The study examined factors affecting households’ access to water supply in three residential areas in parts of Lagos metropolis, Nigeria. A random sampling technique was employed to administer questionnaires to 200 households. The study area was delineated into residential types using the grid method. The result shows the dominance of improved water sources in the high/medium-income residential areas. Households in the medium-income area recorded the highest access in terms of distance to, and safety of water supply. The factor analysis explains 77.41% of the variance with three components, namely: water access, demographic and economic attributes. The results of the analysis of variance reveal three significant variables, namely: main water source, income and cost, which is significant at p&lt;0.01. The regression equation model obtained is given as Y = 2.059 + 0.307MWS + 0.286INM + 0.164CST. The study concluded that main water source, income and cost are the factors affecting access to water supply in the study area. The study recommends investment in water infrastructure, giving a higher priority to low-income residential areas for improved healthy living and sustainable socio-economic development.</jats:p>",

The highest THMs and HANs were 584 μg/L and 30 μg/L, respectively. Chloroform was the dominant species of the THM pool and trichloroacetonitriles were the dominant species for HANs. Water treatment plants using free chlorine (Thapra and Kota) formed more THMs than the plant using ClO2 (KKU). In the summer season, more brominate THMs were observed. In many locations, total THM concentrations were found to be higher than the drinking water standard of the Provincial Water Authority of Thailand. The concentration of THMs tended to increase with greater distance from the water plants (as water aged), while HAN concentrations decreased with distance, potentially because they were undergoing hydrolysis in the pipeline.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this  multiple  case  study  was  to  identify  the  strategic  role  of  finance, banks, and foreign exchange in mitigating petroleum shortages  in  the  petroleum  supply  chain  and  to  sustain  business   development   in   Nigeria.   The   study   participants   include  ten  senior  leaders  from  two  private-sector  Nigerian  downstream petroleum supply companies located in the Niger Delta region, who had successfully implemented strategies for petroleum supply. The resource based view theory served as the  conceptual  framework  for  the  study.  Data  were  collected  through semi structured face-to-face interviews and review of operational   and   policy   documents   from   the   supply   or   marketing  companies.  Data  were  transcribed,  analyzed,  and  validated  through  member  checking  and  triangulation.  The  findings  indicate that  petroleum  leaders  must  engage  with  efficient banks to obtain loans or letter of credit, liquidate letter of  credit  on  time,  obtain  foreign  exchange  at  best  rates,  and  avoid   documentation   hitches   and   delays   on   international   transactions.Findings  may  be  used  by  petroleum  business  leaders and investors to create effective and efficient financial resource management strategies in the supply chain, leading to  product  availability,  sustainability,  poverty  reduction,  and  economic development.</jats:p>",

This is attributed to the complex nature of IASPS and the continued lack of a holistic view towards most of the interventions into the systems. To make sense of issues that affect IASPS, it is important to recognise that most issues within these systems do not exist in isolation, but are imbedded within complex interrelationships. This research developed and demonstrated a systematic diagnostic model that could be used to locate high leverage intervention points within IASPS and to make predictions about the systems behaviour. A meta-analysis was conducted to test the evidence of the interlinkages between IASPS domains and to compare the strength of these relationships. The model revealed that the collaboration, structure and information sharing domains had a higher direct leverage over the other IASPS domains as these were associated with a larger number of interlinkages. Additionally, collaboration and structure provided dynamic leverage as these domains were part of feedback loops. In terms of the potency, collaboration was highly correlated to culture compared to the other domains, viz., information sharing, coercive power and transaction costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply of the islands is a global challenge, especially in the countries which have highly indented coastlines with numerous islands. The island of Mljet in Croatia was investigated due to its unique source of water supply: desalination of water from brackish lakes—<jats:italic>blatinas</jats:italic>—fed by groundwater and connected to the sea by karst conduits. Water sampling and chemical analyses were performed during hydrological minimum and maximum with regard to groundwater levels in 2005/2006 and minimum in 2016. A total of 13 samples were analysed within the study: 10 samples were taken from blatinas, 1 from pit well, and 2 from borehole wells. All waters sampled from the lakes are of Na-Cl type. The seawater percentage in the lakes used to extract feed water for desalination plants, calculated by conservative mixing approach, is relatively low (0.7-9.8%) and varies in correlation with hydrological seasons. Low proportion of seawater is an essential factor of cost minimisation in desalination by the installed reverse osmosis (RO) plants. Daily monitoring of total dissolved solids in the feed water was introduced in May 2016, and its results were analysed in the context of precipitation—a sole source of island aquifer recharge. Maximum concentrations were observed during September and interpreted to be caused by a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressure during the summer tourist season. Minimum concentrations were expected after the rainy season in the cold part of the year but were observed in June instead. Due to a short observation period and untypical distribution of precipitation in the same time interval, the data can only be considered indicative. An unusual pattern of sulphate anion concentrations, which cannot be attributed solely to fresh- and seawater mixing, was observed in one of the blatinas, but its origin could not be determined based on available data. Taking into account all the presented data on groundwater quality, climate change predictions, the connection of water supply system to the mainland and problems with the effluent treatment, it is clear that the main future challenge will be the creation of an island-wide sustainable water management plan followed by continuous monitoring and research.</jats:p>",

While eight out of the 11 RO concentrate samples were successfully treated by the photobiological treatment, the other three samples obtained from the facilities where non-nitrified effluent was used as a source water were unsuitable for the treatment due to high levels of ammonia-N in these samples. As low as 16 mg · L−1 of ammonia-N was found to be inhibitory. Lower pH was found to be undesirable because of lower calcium removal efficiency. Ozone pre-treatment and the presence of antiscalant appeared to have no impact on the photobiological process. This study demonstrated a wider applicability of this photobiological process for the treatment of RO concentrate from potable reuse facilities with different process schemes.</jats:p>",

Six cases were surveyed (Apple, Samsung, LG, Huawei, Nokia, and ZTE). The main source of data was sustainability reports, which were retrieved from the Global Reporting Initiative database. A special data analysis technique called rank analysis was adopted. The results revealed that the effective practices to reduce GHG 1 emissions were related to production process and business travel; those that were effective for reducing GHG 2 emissions were related to facilities accreditation and energy saving; and those effective in reducing GHG 3 emissions were related to logistics and customer practices. No effective actions related to the management of relationships with suppliers were identified by this study. Indicative models for the relationship between actions and GHG emissions were developed, as was a value‐stream map. The previous studies reporting the effective practices in other industries reported results for reducing GHG 1 or GHG 3, or overall GHG emissions, without discriminating among the actions taken to reduce such emissions, although some limited actions were reported. This study describes the effective practices along the whole supply chain—both upstream and downstream—and it also lists the actions related to addressing all the emissions, whether GHG 1, 2, or 3.</jats:p>",

Digital subtraction angiography was used to evaluate the blood perfusion of osteonecrosis of the femoral head of 81 patients (81 hips). Necrotic hips were grouped according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous staging classification. Five parameters were assessed to evaluate the intraosseous blood supply of the necrotic femoral heads. The authors chose the most effective images retrospectively and measured the following parameters: the blood vessel diameter ratio between the medial circumflex femoral artery (MCFA) and the deep femoral artery (DFA) (MCFA/DFA); the blood vessel diameter ratio between the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) and the DFA (LCFA/DFA); the ratio between the MCFA extending length and the width of the femoral neck (A); the number of vessels that reach or exceed line I (a, horizontal line through the junction of the upper femoral head and neck); and the number of vessels that reach or exceed line II (b, the boundary between the femoral head and neck). Significantly negative correlation with Association Research Circulation Osseous stage II to IV necrosis was found for A, a, and b. These parameters were significant (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;.05). Compared with the length and distribution of the vessels, differences in width (MCFA/DFA and LCFA/DFA) were not statistically significant in patients with Association Research Circulation Osseous stage II to IV necrosis. The relative length of the MCFA and the number of vessels above line I and line II are related to the severity of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, as revealed by DSA. Evaluation of blood supply by DSA can be used as one element to predict the fate of precollapsed femoral head.

Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are the busiest cities and the hubs of railway and aviation transportation in China. Obtaining their supply configuration patterns can help identify defects in planning. To achieve that, supply level is proposed, which is a weighted supply traffic volume that takes population and distance factors into account. Then supply configuration can be expressed as the distribution of supply level over time periods with different railway stations, airports, and city categories. Furthermore, nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is applied to pattern recognition by introducing CP (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) decomposition and the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for the selected data set. Numerical experiments show that the designed method has good performance in terms of computation speed and solution quality. Recognition results indicate the significant pattern characteristics of rail–air transport for Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are extracted, which can provide some theoretical references for practical policymakers.</jats:p>"

As a result, many works and evolutions have been carried out, which lead to improvements of topologies and control strategies. Newly introduced topologies can generate output voltage with maximum level number, minimum switching components and power supplies. This study introduces a multilevel inverter with minimum number of DC power supply and optimum number of semiconductors based on the switched‐capacitor method. One of the best features of the proposed topology is its voltage generation with boost capability without any need for H‐bridge. Moreover, the proposed topology has modular extension capability in order to increase the number of output levels. The comparison between the proposed converter and some previous topologies shows that it has better conditions with respect to the used semiconductor count, switches and capacitors losses. The operation and performance of the proposed multilevel converter have been ascertained through simulations and verified experimentally for a single‐phase 17‐level inverter. All results are illustrated to show the proposed converter's ability in smooth sinusoidal output voltage generation with boosting the input voltage without any transformer.</jats:p>",

In contrast to traditional injection locking, where the injection is applied to the signal pin of the oscillator, the locking behaviour introduced is caused by the injection in the supply.

The current study evaluates the use of biogas without its prior upgrading to biomethane as fuel for tractor engines. The following tests were carried out: biochemical methane potential tests, dynamometer engine tests, and field tests with the use of a tractor. The average methane content in biogas obtained from vegetable wastes exceeded 60%. The tests performed on the engine dynamometer showed that the engine powered by dual fuel worked stably when diesel was replaced by 40% biogas (containing 50% of CO2) or 30% methane. Dual fuel supplying of the engine caused an increase in the concentration of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases and a decrease or no effect in the concentration of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. It did not significantly affect the dynamics of the vehicle and its useful properties. Biogas that contains a maximum of 50% CO2 and from which H2S, moisture, and siloxanes have been largely removed, is suitable as a fuel for tractors. Such biogas can be obtained in biogas plants from different substrates, e.g., vegetable or agriculture wastes as well as biodegradable municipal wastes.</jats:p>"

In this study the supercapacitor as energy storage, as opposed to batteries, has widely researched in recent years. Supercapacitors act like other capacitors, but their advantage is having enormous power storage capabilities. Maximum charging voltage and capacitance are two variables of storage in the supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is used as energy storage to charge a low power device wirelessly and act as a power supply. The solar energy is used as a backup power supply if there is no electricity in the remote or isolated area to charge the supercapacitor. The time taken to charge the supercapacitor depend on the amount of current rating of the solar panel. The higher the current, the shorter the time taken to charges the supercapacitor. Power supply using supercapacitor can store up to 30 Vdc using a DC-DC boost converter.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Practical application issues of calculation procedure for the integrated assessment of drinking water from centralized water supply by chemical safety indices, as exemplified by Vsevolozhsk communities (Leningrad region) water supply from the Lake Ladoga and the Neva River as water sources, are discussed. Results of quality monitoring of water from centralized domestic supply system at the stage of water intake, at the output of water treatment, and in the distributing system, accomplished by Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing administration and Center of hygiene and epidemiology in the Leningrad region were used as study materials. The following study techniques were used: descriptive statistics, comparative analysis, risk assessment, generalization. Microsoft Excel program was used for analysis and statistical treatment. Integral water quality index appears to be quite an informative integrated index of the efficacy of the water treatment, however, the same index value can be derived by various combinations of risk values of reflex-olfactory, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects. Therefore, during the calculations, a “risk index of the effects of chronic exposure” was introduced with a view to distinguishing them from effects caused by the adverse organoleptic properties of water (reflex-olfactory effects). For the population these properties are the main reason for refusal from the use drinking water, and at the same time they are physiological, lying outside the pathology. The risk of effects of chronic exposure, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic, expresses the probability of the development of pathology in time, but not the likelihood of an immediate refusal to use drinking water due to its unsatisfactory organoleptic qualities.</jats:p>"

However, humic substances are known to quench the fluorescence of amino acids and proteins. To date, none of the EEM-based models for predicting THM formation potential (THMFP) have explicitly accounted for these quenching effects. Thus, we investigated the importance of correcting for fluorescence quenching during THMFP prediction. Fluorescence titration experiments revealed that the correction improved the accuracy of THM prediction. EEM-based models using the corrected fluorescence intensity displayed the highest accuracy (R2 &amp;gt; 0.99; mean absolute error 8.1 μg/L and 13.9 μg/L for chloroform and bromoform, respectively) among models using individual parameters of EEM intensity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), specific UV254 (SUVA254) and differential ultraviolet absorbance at 272 nm (ΔUV272). Thus, EEM-based models require both the fluorescence intensity of a humic-like component and the corrected fluorescence intensity of a protein-like component for accurate THMFP prediction, for both chlorination and bromination processes. We also found it to be unnecessary to combine DOC with EEM intensity in terms of prediction accuracy, as long as the fluorescence quenching correction is applied.</jats:p>",

Power grid premium decreases as the price sensitivity coefficient of demand increases, but rises as the installed capacity of renewable energy generator increases. When there is a shortage of power, if the installed capacity of renewable energy is relatively small and price sensitivity coefficient of demand is relatively large, the grid purchases the power from power spot market and shares cost with renewable energy generators, leading to higher expected profits of the renewable energy generators. On the contrary, the renewable energy generators prefer to make up power shortage themselves. For the power grid, purchasing the power by the renewable energy generators when there is a power shortage can bring more utility to the power grid when the installed capacity of renewable energy is lower and the demand price sensitivity coefficient is higher. When the installed capacity of renewable energy is high and the price sensitivity coefficient of demand is moderate, or the installed capacity of renewable energy is moderate and the demand price sensitivity coefficient is high, a generator that simultaneously possesses two kinds of energy source will bring more utility to the power grid. If the installed capacity of renewable energy and the demand price sensitivity coefficient both are small or the installed capacity of renewable energy and the price sensitivity coefficient of demand both are large, the power grid prefers to purchase the power by itself when there is a power shortage.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The goal of our paper analysis is to explore the implications of the theoretical model and address the series of research questions regarding the impact of the renewable energy on the power supply chain.

This study considers three of these drivers, namely buyer-supplier trust, commitment and supply chain relationship durability. A numerical approach was implemented in which a survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 429 managers and staff members from food retailing firms in the Gauteng province. The study used a non-probability convenience sampling technique to select respondents. Information were analysed through two software packages, namely the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 24.0) and the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS version 24.0). The main goal of this research is to see if the data fits the model. A confirmatory factor analysis was applied in examining and testing the relationships between observed constructs and their causal latent constructs while structural equation modelling helped in testing the hypothesised relationships among variables. The results of the investigation made known that buyer and supplier trust, commitment and supply chain relationship endurance absolutely and meaningfully impact supply chain performance. This investigation concludes that to achieve greater supply chain performance, food retailers should expedite the levels of trust, commitment and length of relationships with their providers. The outcomes of this study offer valuable understandings on how companies in the food retail industry could profit from trust, commitment and relationship longevity along with on how to develop supply chain performance. The results of this study add to the current body of knowledge by generating new information on buyer-supplier relationships. Therefore, the study is useful to buyers and suppliers in the food retail industry who wish to enhance supply chain performance and develop better relationships.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increased production of Brazilian beef has been associated with negative impacts in the Amazon region. Supply chain interventions are increasingly common to avoid social and environmental consequences in the area, but evidence about how companies have managed these efforts is scarce. The present study identified the main sources of reputational risks in Brazilian Amazon beef supply chains and the actions taken by slaughterhouses to manage these types of risk. A multiple case study was developed in Brazilian beef supply chains that have suffered consequences to their operations from consecutive actions of stakeholders that link meat production with deforestation and the worst practices of production in the Amazon region. Public agreements with stakeholders and the development of supplier management were used to identify reputational risks. The present study also describes the types of risk and how they are mitigated. Based on the results, the authors propose a set of risk management practices in the supply chains to manage risks through stakeholder engagement, use of government open data sources, and sharing information with direct suppliers.</jats:p>",

An optimal model is established to describe how the transfer price affects the performance of the global supply chain. Through the numerical analysis, we find that the network of global supply chain positively affects the total performance of MNEs and transfer price strategy as a kind of coordinate method which impacts the total profit of the global supply chain. </jats:p>",

As we know that the demand for electricity is increasing every day and frequent power cuts is causing many problems in various areas like industries, hospitals, offices and houses which are necessary to be prevented. An alternative arrangement for power source must be used. This project uses four switches to demonstrate the respective failure of that source of supply. A microcontroller of ATmega328 family is used. The output of the microcontroller is given to the relay driver IC, which switches appropriate relay to maintain an uninterrupted supply to the load. When any of the switches is pressed it shows the absence of that particular source. Switches are connected to microcontroller as input signals. The output is observed using a lamp drawing power supply from mains initially. On failure of the mains supply (which is actuated by pressing the appropriate switch) the load gets supply from the next available source, say an inverter. If the inverter also fails it switches over to the next available source and so on. The current status, as to which source supplies to the load is also displayed on an LCD. As it is not feasible to provide all 4 different sources of supply, one source with alternate switches are provided to get the same function.</jats:p>",

In light of the parties’ shared objectives to strengthen and enhance the UK, the Confidence and Supply Agreement, sets out how the DUP would support the minority Conservative government in specific areas, including finance Bills and matters pertaining to the exit from the European Union. This article examines the nature and operation of this Agreement and assesses the extent to which it may be seen to have breached established conventions, rules and principles around devolved funding and the principle of political impartiality enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. It is argued that the Confidence and Supply Agreement has contributed to the perceived shortcomings of the Barnett Formula as a robust, fair, financial methodology. The distribution of money to the devolved administrations should be modernised and based on need, accountability and transparency. It is also concluded that being locked into a parliamentary deal undermines the UK Government’s ability to be impartial between the competing interests in Northern Ireland.</jats:p>",

Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a real‐world supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent‐based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first‐tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies.</jats:p>",

As such, long-term management strategies need to improve the resilience of water supply systems and account for the sustainability of water withdrawals. In this context, metabolic modelling may provide a support to decision-making in the medium-long term, based on sustainability criteria. This approach enables mimicking a water supply network (WSN) based on a set of material and energy fluxes that interact and influence each other. By analyzing these fluxes, a suite of key performance indicators (KPIs) is evaluated in order to identify which kind of interventions may be applied to increase the sustainability of the system. Here, we apply a metabolic model, WaterMet2, to a WSN in the Reggio Emilia Province (Italy), combined with hydraulic simulations conducted with EPANET. Different alternative strategies are compared, including a reduction of water withdrawals from the main well field due to a possible future decrease in water availability. Based on KPIs, sustainable long-term strategies are evaluated in order to identify the most suitable solution for dynamic sustainable management of the water supply system.</jats:p>"

Here, an integrated production scheduling and distribution problem in a multisite supply chain is investigated from the three‐agent perspective of the manufacturer, distributor, and customer. Due to the complexity of the problem, a novel evolutionary‐based reference point determination of the third version of the non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm (ERNSGA‐III) is proposed. In this algorithm, some modifications to the classic version of NSGA‐III have been made and a novel reference point determination method based on Bees algorithm is used in the selection operation. Some statistical tests are performed to compare the proposed algorithm with three other algorithms in the literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than other algorithms.</jats:p>",

We consider producers operating under oligopoly and analyze their optimal decisions with the aid of real options. We contextualize this study in the energy supply chain, where revenue is heavily influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). It is optimal to divest from a production if certain values pass below the liquidation cost. The optimal time to divest is, then, the optimal time to exercise a perpetual American put option on the total value of the project, where the strike price is the liquidation value and expenses. The OPEC oligpolistic power is modeled with the aid of a hidden market in a Hidden Markov Model, since the state of the Markov chain is not directly visible to the production manager. The reported results can be used by supply chain managers in decision making on production network redesign in the oligopolistic environment considering present value of plants and cash flows in the supply chain. The advantage of the modeling approach proposed is its analytical tractability, especially for project valuation and real‐option problems.</jats:p>",

These problems leading to the high temperature are more revealed under non‐rating operating conditions such as unbalanced supply voltage. The aim of the present study is thermal analysis of such supply and obtaining its temperature distribution. Existing thermal analysis methods through thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) have some drawbacks; in these models, thermal parameters of different regions of transformer such as core, tank, metallic parts and winding are not defined. On the other hand, those models are not applicable for thermal analysis of transformer with unbalanced supply voltage. Here, a novel TEC model is proposed which is able to define temperatures of different components of oil‐immersed power transformers individually under unbalanced supply voltage. The merit of the introduced model is that losses of different parts of transformer are considered as heat generating sources which are used as the inputs of thermal model. At this end, a three‐dimensional finite‐element method is suggested which is able to estimate the losses of different parts of power transformer. Finally, the results of applying the TEC to the transformer are compared with the temperature distribution of finite‐element modelling and high accuracy of the TEC model in estimation of the temperatures of different regions are emphasised.</jats:p>",

The competition Crude Palm Oil (CPO) company do not only happen in manufacturing companies but also among supply chain components. Due to the increase of fierce competition, it is necessary to improve companies’ value chain that may increase productivity and reduce costs. The purpose of this study was to analyze the supply chain and value chain of CPO in some companies. Data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative analysis within descriptive research.  This research was started by conducting a supply chain analysis and followed by a value chain analysis and ended with an improvement of the value chain. The qualitative analysis describes supply chain and value chain while the quantitative analysis is used to find out value-added values and establishment of the value chain. Based on the analysis, the value chain of CPO in the company consists of four main participants: suppliers of raw materials (plantation), processing plant, distributor, and customer. In this research, the analysis was focused on two participants: palm oil plantation and palm oil processing plant. The oil palm plantation activities include nurseries, planting, plant maintenance, harvesting, and shipping while the processing plant consists of reception, sterilizing, threshing, pressing, and classification. The company's value-added actual condition in oil palm plantation was 72.42% and palm oil processing plant was 10.13%. A low-cost strategy had been applied, resulting in the value-added increasing of oil palm plantations by 1.08% and at processing plants by 11.73%. The increase in value-added has been able to reduce the company’s costs. However, this study still has limitations because the analysis only covers plantation and processing plant value chain; the company’s distribution and consumers of CPO products for maximizing the value-added of a CPO value chain have not yet been studied.</jats:p>"

A high‐level model for the overall SCM process has been set up. Information and operation interfacing between critical tasks (CTs) belonging to adjacent steps of the high‐level models are expressed and analyzed using the DSM. The interface values (IVs), which represent the extent of risk exposure of the interfaces, are computed. The IVs associated with DSM cells are used to identify high‐impact cross‐functional areas of the system. The gray areas, which present opportunities for improvements in the system performance, are found after an in‐depth gap analysis of the identified high‐impact areas. Finally, the measures that can address the gaps in the gray areas and improve the system process are developed. The results and insights obtained from a process improvement case study on SCM of the Boeing Company are discussed.</jats:p>",

The immensity of the search space poses a significant challenge for modern multiobjective optimization tools. This study introduces two approaches that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of evolutionary multiobjective optimization tools when solving monitoring design problems. We show how a careful mathematical representation of the monitoring design search space and reductions of possible monitoring‐well positions enhance the solution and attainment of decision‐relevant multiobjective trade‐offs in monitoring quality. We demonstrate the value of our improved representation and reduction techniques on a three‐objective monitoring network design problem focused on urban source water protection (termed the <jats:italic>U_Protect</jats:italic> benchmarking problem). U_Protect abstracts a real‐world case study within an urban drinking‐water well catchment, including inaccessible and restricted areas for monitoring‐well installation, and random heterogeneities in the conductivity field. Our representation and reduction methods significantly enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the optimization. Our proposed framework shifts focus to the most impactful monitoring design decisions while also enhancing decision makers understanding of key performance trade‐offs. In combination, our proposed representation and reduction techniques have significant promise for enhancing the size and the scope of combinatorial monitoring problems that can be explored.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conventional reservoir operation rule curves are based on the assumption of hydrological stationarity. The aggravating non-stationarity under the changing environment rocked this foundation. The hedging theory is one of the options for adaptive operation based on hydrological forecasts, which can provide a practical tool for optimal reservoir operation under a changing environment. However, the connections between hedging theory and rule curves are not clear. This paper establishes the linkage of rule curves and hedging theory by analyzing three fundamental problems surrounding the design of conventional rule curves, namely the law and design of water supply rule curves, the determination of flood control storage, and the division of refill and drawdown circle. The general interpretation of the conventional water supply rule curves with hedging theory is conducted. Both the theoretical analyses and the Danjiangkou Reservoir case study reveal that, based on the historical records, the rule curves can be interpreted as a specific expression of hedging theory. This intrinsic linkage allows us to propose a more general and scientific method of updating rule curves in the context of non-stationarity. On this basis, the rule-curve-based climate adaptation strategies are figured out using hedging theory. This research is helpful for practical adaptive operation of reservoirs in the changing environment.</jats:p>"

Its functionality, however, has proven to be a major challenge once the stakeholders responsible for maintaining the service fail to provide the technical, financial, and social resources necessary to secure its sustainability. A number of fragilities are associated with a lack of political recognition of community organizations. In some cases, community organizations have been able to maintain strong recognition in decision-making processes through the establishment of associations involving several community organizations, representing a second organizational level. A third organizational level is achieved once these associations reach an extensive area of a territory. This article conducted four case-studies in Latin America. The study revealed that the emblematic examples according to scientific literature presented the second and, in one case, the third organizational level, while the others, where several weaknesses are noticed, only presented the first level. Although difficulties still exist in every scenario analyzed, our study supports that the presence of the second and third organizational levels are factors that positively contribute to better outcomes from the community management model.</jats:p>"

Due to globalization and changing consumption patterns, agri-food industries have undergone a transformation, and the sustainability of agri-food supply chains has also received greater attention. However, the issues of SSCM at the upstream level of the supply chain in agri-food industries have not been adequately empirically studied. This paper aims to list key issues or constraints in the production and marketing through farmers’ group discussions, supplemented by the literature, and empirically identifies key constraints to SSCM of the citrus industry in Pakistan. The paper used cross-sectional data from 300 farmers involved in the production and marketing of citrus in Punjab, Pakistan. Farmers were asked to answer on a Likert scale data about potential constraints identified from the literature and farmers’ group discussions. Kendell’s coefficient of concordance and the mean ranking technique was used to rank and to identify the critical constraints in the production and marketing of citrus. In addition, factor analysis (principal component analysis) was used for the grouping of these constraints. In production constraints, factors, such as fertilizer, pesticide, and seed quality, climate change, high production cost, and agricultural labor performance, are important. These constraints are aligned with some key marketing factors, such as packaging, grading, and storage facilities. The findings convey messages for policymakers to solve these issues and challenges at the upstream level of the SSCM chain in the citrus and related agri-food industries.</jats:p>"

In this article, we explore how institutional systems have operated and impacted native seed supply in Brazil. Native seed supply for restoration is essentially a community‐based activity which faces broad barriers to operating within regulations because of requirements for excessive and costly technical documentation, scarcity of seed laboratories, and lack of instructions for native seed quality testing. Although decentralized seed networks have stimulated arrangements for local organizations to promote seed supply, policies constrain the development of local capacities and the ongoing sustainability of these organizations. These conditions have resulted in a vast network of informal collectors and producers who are largely “invisible” and unknown to the regulatory authorities. Policies have decentralized responsibilities from the state without devolving decision‐making power to the multiple stakeholders engaged in policy elaboration. The policies maintain the centralized regulation of native seed supply. After examining Brazilian seed networks' experiences and conducting discussions with stakeholders and experts, we suggest adapting the current regulations to more local level contexts, encompassing the following strategies: (1) ensuring native seed origin and identity; (2) relaxation of the laboratory accreditation process for native seed quality assurance; (3) fostering seed markets for restoration; (4) research to provide technological innovation; (5) supporting local, diverse, and small seed‐based businesses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Oversizing has been seldom concerning in Thailand. However, oversizing causes short-term operations of an air-conditioning (AC) unit and excessive power consumptions. In addition, multiple operations of oversized AC units can be faulty operations when they are used to serve in an open space area because interaction among AC units are not considered before installations. This paper collects data operations of the multiple supply duct split-type air-conditioning (SAC) units used in an open space from additional sensors installed in zone and return temperature. Significant wireless sensors are added for measuring temperature effect among a interaction area between two SAC units. To measure the system variation caused by system interaction, runtime fraction (RTF) is used to quantify the compressor runtime ratio which equals to a stage-on time operation over the cycle time at an AC design condition. The results show that one of the four SAC units performs under-sizing instead of oversizing performance because it runs continuously without off cycling. To diagnose this issue, interactions between zone and return temperature are quantified in terms of correlation coefficient, which demonstrates that this SAC results in higher oversizing of the rest SAC units. This interaction analysis can be further used to design a soft-repair algorithm to reduce oversizing effect of the multiple SAC operations.</jats:p>",

However, previous assessments have not focused on the leanness of the supply chain in a health-care setting. This paper aims to introduce a method for assessing the successful implementation of lean principles and tools in a supply chain. Furthermore, this paper validates the method in a health-care organization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This paper starts with an extensive literature review on assessing leanness and using multi-grade fuzzy logic. Then, a conceptual model was developed to measure leanness. The conceptual model was validated by discussing the initial version with select academic experts, especially those who deal with leanness in health-care organizations. After responding to the experts’ valuable comments, the health-care organization that is the focus of this case study was chosen based on two criteria. The first criterion was the organization’s ability to participate in the study, and the second was the organization’s commitment to implementing lean principles. These criteria were important to ensure the organization had the necessary foundation for implementing change initiatives such as lean process improvements. Next, a multi-grade (multi-attributes) fuzzy logic was used for leanness measurement. A leanness index was calculated, and the results were validated using experts from the case study organization. Finally, the weaker areas of the organization’s processes were identified to point the way for further improvements.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The assessment indicated that the case study organization is not lean.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past two years, Americans in nearly every state have suffered adverse effects from counterfeit medications, many of whom have died. The main culprit is Fentanyl-tainted counterfeit opiates which often lead to fatal overdoses. The increasing epidemic of counterfeit prescription medications extends beyond social classes, gender, race, and age. For instance, pop star Prince recently overdosed on counterfeit Hydrocodone containing synthetic Fentanyl. Shockingly, one in ten medications sold in developing countries are counterfeit; either containing incorrect doses of active ingredients or containing toxic contaminants retained from the production process. The popularity of counterfeit medications stems from cheaper costs, but also because of the ease with which these counterfeit products can be purchased. While the blockchain has gained its fame from Bitcoin, its potential implications are far reaching. In this paper, I propose the use of QR code and the IoT (Internet of Things) sensor devices leveraging the blockchain for increased transparency of the pharmaceutical supply chain and manufacturing process. The data collected from the devices would then be transferred to the blockchain, enabling consumers to use an app to verify the provenance of their medication.</jats:p>"

In this context, the research about the potential reutilization of non-conventional water sources becomes highly relevant, principally in arid and semi-arid areas. On many occasions, these new water resources involve water with a moderate concentration of salt, making it necessary to improve plant growth under moderate saline conditions. Besides plant breeding techniques, the use of molecules able to improve plant adaptation to saline conditions has great interest. Between these molecules, humic substances (HS) have proven to be efficient as stress-protectors under specific conditions of stress intensity and moment of application. The HS are main components of the soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter resulting from the biotic and abiotic transformation of fresh organic matter in natural ecosystems. Although knowledge about their structure is still under open debate, HS contain aromatic and aliphatic domains presenting O-, N- and S- containing functional groups with high biological and chemical activities. The aim of this presentation is to summarize the main effects of humic acids (HA) applied either on the root or on the shoot, on the metabolism and hormonal balance of plants cultivated under normal and stressing conditions, from studies carried out for our group and collaborations during the last years. Summarizing, all these results show HA as a promising tool for improving crop adaptation to irrigation using moderate saline water sources.</jats:p>",

Regarding this crucial issue, their studies on the implementation of supply chain issues and bottlenecks have observed the enormous and direct impact on company’s financial performance and improve it systemically. In this paper, a well-known mixed integer nonlinear programming by multi-objective function is proposed to decide on reliable results for supply, production, and distribution system problems. The proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming model for multi-objective supply, production, and distribution problems is used to minimize the total cost for incurred sections and terms by decision makers. The obtained optimum solution and result are fulfilled by investigators and producers for planning how to adjust the investment and gain more accurate performances and implementations. Numerical results in plots and throughputs from MATLAB, using MINLP, showed that integrating the supply chain and mitigating the bottlenecks led to improve the system and decrease the total cost approximately (19.73%), while running without negative effects of supply chain disturbances on total cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lately, we have witnessed how European Institutions have directed many efforts at improving the effectiveness of food quality schemes (FQS) to address the increasing complexity that has affected all elements of the operating structure of agrifood supply chains worldwide, especially prices. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of the price transmission process in the dairy sector between farm and retail markets within the protected designation of origin (PDO) framework and its non-protected counterpart in Italy. This paper considers a unique dataset for the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and for a non-protected counterpart in Italy covering a recent period after the price crises that took place nearly a decade ago. A multivariate error correction type approach was estimated together with the corresponding impulse response functions to provide useful insights for understanding the differences in the performance of the price transmission process between protected and non-protected food products. Contrary to most of the previous literature, our results support the hypothesis of symmetric price dynamics along the PDO cheese supply chain. The fewer number of farmers reduces the market power at the retail level generating more efficient price transmission dynamics. Short-run dynamics suggest that in the PDO cheese market farmers and retailers react quicker and with a similar magnitude to market changes, while in the conventional cheese market, retailers benefit in the short run from quicker and of higher magnitude responses to unanticipated market shocks.</jats:p>"

By creating a solar reactor in which meshes coated with TiO2 were stacked, we demonstrated that degradation of humic acids with four superimposed stainless steel meshes was up to 3.4 times faster than in a single plate flat-bed reactor. Incorporation of TiO2 coated mesh structures resulted in a high specific photocatalytically active surface area with sufficient light penetration in the reactor, while the coated area for one mesh was 0.77 m2 per m2 projected area. This brought the photocatalytic efficiency of such reactors closer to that of dispersed-phase reactors, but without the complex separation of the very fine TiO2 particles from the treated water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers a two-stage supply chain with a component production facility and an end item production facility and studies a joint order admission, component production, and end product production rate control policy which maximizes the supply chain’s profit.\r\nCustomer orders can be accepted or rejected depending on the system status. A revenue is generated if each customer order is accepted, while a penalty is incurred if each incoming customer order is rejected. The MTO facility has the option of changing its production rate within the given limits. The component production facility produces components based on the make-to-stock mode.\r\nComponents in inventory incur holding costs per uni time and backlogged customer orders incur backorder costs per unit time. An energy consumption cost is generated per unit time with the available MTO production rates. It increases as the MTO production rate increases. The customer order inter-arrival times and MTO and component production times are stochastic.\r\nRecently, most of manufacturing companies consider customized manufacturing as a significant core competency that must be acquired. Although customized manufacturing reduces the burden of inventories, product variability due to customization raises the problem of managing production capacity facing with variable customer demands.\r\nFor this reason, the effective and efficient use of production capacity becomes essential in MTO production. Recent works in the production literature show that the ability to dynamically control production capacity may cope with this problem. In particular, a flexible production capacity enables companies to become energy efficient in their manufacturing process and so reap environmental and economic benefits.\r\nThe set of decision epochs in our model corresponds to the epochs of customer order, MTO production completion, and component production completion. At each decision epoch, the manufacturer determines whether or not the component production facility produces a unit of component and what production rate the MTO production facility should choose to process an outstanding customer order. Furthermore, when a customer order arrives, the MTO production facility must make a decision about whether to accept or reject it.\r\nTo model the problem presented in this paper, we adopt the Markov decision process model. To this end, the customer order inter-arrival times and MTO and component production times are assumed to be exponentially distributed. Then, we numerically investigate the structure of the optimal order admission, component production, and end product production rate control policy using an example.\r\nThe numerical investigation indicates that the optimal admission control accepts more customer orders as the component inventory increases, the optimal component production control allows more production as the backorder level increases, and the optimal end product production rate control increases the production rate as the component inventory level increases.\r\nWe examine the impact of an end product production rate control option on the manufacturer’s profit. The study confirms that the production system with a controllable production rate has a great percentage improvement in the profit over the one with a fixed mean production rate.\r\nOur numerical study also indicates that the economic benefits can vary depending on system parameters. The performance difference of the systems with and without a controllable production rate option becomes larger as the customer arrival rate, backorder cost, and unit component production cost increase, while it becomes smaller as the product revenue increases.\r\nWe also investigate how the size of standard deviation of the customer inter-arrival, product production, and component production times affect the performance difference of the systems with and without a controllable production rate option.</jats:p>",

Mitochondria play a key role in meeting axonal energy demand by generating adenosine triphosphate through oxidative phosphorylation. Recent evidence demonstrates how axonal mitochondrial trafficking and anchoring are coordinated to sense and respond to altered energy requirements. If and when these mechanisms are impacted in pathological conditions, such as injury and neurodegenerative disease, is an emerging research frontier. Recent evidence also suggests that axonal energy demand may be supplemented by local glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In this review, we provide an updated discussion of how oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic glycolysis, and oligodendrocyte‐derived metabolic support contribute to the maintenance of axonal energy homeostasis.</jats:p>",

The sustainable electrical supply chain system contained: (a) power generation; (b) transmission substations; (c) distribution substations; and (d) customer. The production rates depend on the demand rate, and demand for electricity by the customers is dependent on the price of electricity where the electrical energy was generated and transmitted through multiple substations to customers. Moreover, we considered that the capacities of transmission rates, power generation, and distances in between two stations are associated with the distribution costs and transmission cost. Here, we used the theory of inventory to develop a new model and suggested a procedure to deduce an optimal solution for this model. Finally, a numerical example and sensitivity analysis are employed to illustrate the present study and with managerial insights.</jats:p>"

We employ a multi‐industry dataset consisting of 163 focal firms and their supply bases, spanning the years 1976 to 2009. Focal firms that have higher R &amp; D expenditure compared to their industry average, enjoy greater performance benefits from their own R &amp; D and commercialization efforts, as compared to when they have a Low R &amp; D‐intense supply base. On the other hand, focal firms with lower R &amp; D expenditure compared to their industry average, benefit more from their own R &amp; D and commercialization expenditure when they have a High R &amp; D supply base. When levels of R &amp; D expenditure are matched with respect to the supply base (Low–Low or High–High), focal firms tend to derive less marginal performance benefits from their own R &amp; D and commercialization expenditures. This pattern of results constitutes a “polarity effects” phenomenon, i.e., unlike poles attract. Further, for the High R &amp; D focal firm–Low R &amp; D supply base combination (and vice versa), we show that although both R &amp; D and commercialization efforts have a separate and positive effect on the focal firm's financial performance; taken together, they have a negative synergy. Through a response surface analysis, we are able to show that there is a commercialization threshold, below which the Low R &amp; D focal firm–High R &amp; D supply base derives lower total benefits as compared to a High R &amp; D focal firm–Low R &amp; D supply base combination.</jats:p>",

Our analysis shows that in most circumstances, the MPSC will choose the bundled channel as long as the price elasticity is higher; however, this property is invalid under certain conditions. Our analysis further shows that the introduction of fairness may have significant effects on channel choice decisions. First, the manufacturer's fairness may hinder the MPSC from choosing the bundled channel when the channel power between the operator and the manufacturer is sufficiently asymmetric. Second, when the manufacturer is almost neck‐and‐neck with the operator, the manufacturer's fairness concerns may be conducive to the deployment of the bundled channel. Third, the bundled channel would never be a reasonable choice for both the operator and the MPSC when the manufacturer has a relatively powerful status, in particular under the situation when the manufacturer has strong fairness concerns. Fourth, the operator's fairness concerns are always detrimental to the bundled cooperation which is different from the effect of the manufacturer's fairness concerns, and the bundled channel would never be a reasonable choice for the MPSC when the operator is extremely powerful.</jats:p>",

Here, we apply a generalized modeling (GM) approach, which has a strong pedigree in the analysis of dynamical systems, to study the stability of real‐world supply networks. It goes beyond purely structural network analysis approaches by incorporating material flows, which are defining characteristics of supply networks. The analysis focuses on the network of interactions between material flows, providing new conceptualizations to capture key aspects of production and inventory policies. We provide stability analyses of two contrasting real‐world networks—that of an industrial engine manufacturer and an industry‐level network in the luxury goods sector. We highlight the criticality of links with suppliers that involve the dispatch, processing, and return of parts or sub‐assemblies, cyclic motifs that involve separate paths from a common supplier to a common firm downstream, and competing demands of different end products at specific nodes. Based on a critical discussion of our findings in the context of the supply chain management literature, we generate five propositions to advance knowledge and understanding of supply network stability. We discuss the implications of the propositions for the effective management, control, and development of supply networks. The GM approach enables fast screening to identify hidden vulnerabilities in extensive supply networks.</jats:p>",

The CCM procures key components from and simultaneously competes with the CS in the consumer market. To address the CCM's capital constraint, we consider three financing strategies, namely, trade credit, bank loan, and hybrid financing (i.e., combined use of bank loan and equity financing). Game models are established to characterize the interactions between the CS and CCM. The corresponding equilibria are derived under each strategy. Then, comparative analyses are conducted, and the CS's and CCM's preference structures regarding the three strategies are revealed. On this basis, the equilibrium strategy can be concluded as either trade credit or hybrid financing, but never bank loan. Specifically, when the equity financing ratio is small or large, trade credit is an equilibrium strategy. When the equity financing ratio is medium, the equilibrium strategy between trade credit and hybrid financing is determined by consumers’ product preference and loan interest rate.</jats:p>",

This paper uses a game theory approach to investigate this strategy of a manufacturer under a closed-loop supply chain consisting of one supplier, one manufacturer, and one third-party remanufacturer (TPR), with the consideration of customer environmental awareness. In particular, the supplier supplies the components to the manufacturer and the manufacturer adopts technology licensing remanufacturing via the TPR. We explicitly characterize the reactions between the supplier and the manufacturer as being in equilibrium after adopting the technology licensing. We find that only when remanufacturing is a potential threat to the supplier is the performance of the supply chain improved and the double marginalization effect effectively eliminated. Moreover, remanufacturing by technology licensing only increases the profit of the manufacturer, but decreases the profit of the supplier. Interestingly, contrary to traditional wisdom, the existence of remanufactured products does not reduce the quantity of new products. Furthermore, remanufacturing by technology licensing may not always improve the environment, but customers in the market have environmental awareness that facilitates remanufacturing.</jats:p>"

Based on the results of the analysis of value added by Hayami's method, it was known that retailers' profit margins tend to be bigger, but the contribution of value added is lower than that of farmers and companies.  The results of risk measurement showed that the biggest risk index was in farmers due to the large risk of supply shortages.  Measurement of efficiency using DEA showed that retailer actors were more efficient but tend to avoid risk.  Achieving high efficiency at retailers indicated the ability to balance risk and revenue so that the delivery of organic vegetables in the supply chain was more efficient.  Through a risk management mechanism with risk balancing and cost incentives because of the risk showed an increase in supply chain efficiency. This efficiency can be seen from the increase in the number of retailers 'demand and a decrease in supply / shipping inefficiency of farmers and companies in meeting retailers' demands.</jats:p>"

The impact of flooding goes beyond the immediately obvious socio-aspects of disruption, cascading and affecting a wide range of connected systems. The issues caused by flooding need to be treated in a fashion which adopts an SoS approach to evaluate the risks associated with interconnected systems and to assess resilience against flooding from various perspectives. Changes in climate result in deviations in frequency and intensity of precipitation; variations in annual patterns make planning and management for resilience more challenging. This article presents a verified model-based system engineering methodology for decision-makers in the water sector to holistically, and systematically implement resilience within the water context, specifically focusing on effects of flooding on water supply. A novel resilience viewpoint has been created which is solely focused on the resilience aspects of architecture that is presented within this paper. Systems architecture modelling forms the basis of the methodology and includes an innovative resilience viewpoint to help evaluate current SoS resilience, and to design for future resilient states. Architecting for resilience, and subsequently simulating designs, is seen as the solution to successfully ensuring system performance does not suffer, and systems continue to function at the desired levels of operability. The case study presented within this paper demonstrates the application of the SoS resilience methodology on water supply networks in times of flooding, highlighting how such a methodology can be used for approaching resilience in the water sector from an SoS perspective. The methodology highlights where resilience improvements are necessary and also provides a process where architecture solutions can be proposed and tested.</jats:p>"

This study evaluates whether coverage targets set out within the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) inadvertently increased the challenge to sustainably manage water supply infrastructure. Furthermore, the drive towards decentralised service delivery contributes to the financial burden of water supply assets. A sample size of 14,943 Afridev hand pump boreholes was extracted from a comprehensive live data set of 68,984 water points across Malawi to investigate the sustainability burden as emphasis shifts to the 2030 agenda. The results demonstrate that the push for coverage within the MDG era has impacted the sustainability of assets. A lack of proactive approaches towards major repairs and sub-standard borehole construction alongside aging infrastructure contributes to reduced functionality of decentralised supplies. Furthermore, costly rehabilitation is required to bring assets to operational standards, in which external support is commonly relied upon. Acceleration towards the coverage targets has contributed towards unsustainable infrastructure that has further implications moving forward. These findings support the need for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) investment planning to move from a focus on coverage targets to a focus on quality infrastructure and proactive monitoring approaches to reduce the future burden placed on communities.</jats:p>"

Market‐chasing pricing policy aims at minimizing the market share loss, while profit‐chasing pricing policy aims to minimize the profit loss under supply disruption. Stackelberg games are established to analyze the equilibrium pricing behaviors with both pricing policies under supply disruption. It is shown that the effectiveness of market‐chasing pricing policy depends on the competitive power of the manufacturer and competitor, while profit‐chasing pricing policy is always helpful for the manufacturer to reduce her profit loss under supply disruption. Furthermore, to minimize market share loss, firms need to lower both the price of the disrupted product and the undisrupted product. But firms can lower the price of the disrupted product only and increase the price of other undisrupted products to minimize the profit loss.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a dyadic supply chain model with one buyer who contracts the manufacturing of a new product to a supplier. Due to the lack of experience in manufacturing, the extent of supply risk is unknown to both the buyer and supplier before the time of contract. However, after the contract is accepted, the supplier may invest in a diagnostic test to acquire information about his true reliability, and use this information when deciding on a process improvement effort. Using this setting, we identify both operational and strategic benefits and costs of the diagnostic test. Operationally, it helps the supplier to take the first‐best level of improvement effort, which would increase efficiency of the total supply chain. Strategically, it enables the buyer to reduce the agency costs associated with implementing process improvement on the supplier. Besides these benefits, diagnostic test increases the degree of information asymmetry along the supply chain. This in turn provides the supplier with proprietary information, whose rent would be demanded from the buyer in equilibrium. Benefit‐cost analysis reveals two key factors in determining the value of diagnostic test: (i) degree of endogenous information asymmetry between supply chain firms, and (ii) the relative cost of a diagnostic test with respect to process improvement cost. Our results indicate that when both are high, the mere presence of a diagnostic test can result in less reliable supply chain. This implies that when incentives are not properly aligned, information asymmetry amplified due to diagnostic test neutralizes all its benefits. </jats:p>",

This study provides a comparative assessment of blending 10 % corn‐ethanol and using an electrolytic hydrogen supply via PtG on the well to wheel of gasoline fuel, based on Ontario's energy system. The analysis is performed using the GREET<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> model to investigate the energy and emissions results of the subject comparison. Consequently, PtG renewable hydrogen, when used for gasoline production, is found to decrease 4.6 % of the natural gas consumption of the gasoline cycle and, therefore, increase the renewable content of gasoline. Furthermore, the deployment of electrolytic hydrogen at the refinery results in minimizing gasoline carbon intensity by 0.15 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e per 100 km (0.5 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e per MJ) of the fuel. When associated with the annual gasoline sales in Ontario, the use of electrolytic hydrogen can offer a reduction of 0.26 MT of greenhouse gas emissions yearly. Moreover, the hydrogen supply from the PtG method used for gasoline production may contribute to lowering VOCs, NO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>, PM<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>, and PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> criteria air pollutants from the gasoline cycle, which cannot be achieved with blending corn‐based ethanol.

The improvement of WDS management is a complex task that can be addressed by providing services to maximize revenues while ensuring that the quality standards required by national and international regulations are upheld. These two objectives can be fulfilled by utilizing optimized techniques for the operational and maintenance strategies of WDS. This paper proposes a methodology for assisting engineers in identifying water leakages in WDS, thus providing an effective procedure for ensuring high level hydraulic network functionality. The proposed approach is based on an inverse analysis of measured flow rates and pressure data, and consists of three steps: The analysis of measurements to select the most suitable period for leakage identification, the localization of the best measurement points based on a correlation analysis, and leakage identification with a hybrid optimization that combines the exploration capability of the differential evolution algorithm with the rapid convergence of particle swarm optimization. The proposed procedure is validated on a reference hydraulic network, known as the Apulian network.</jats:p>"

This will provide critical information for various surgical procedures. Ten specimens of embalmed Korean cadavers were dissected and subjected to modified Sihler's method to reveal the branching pattern of the arteries surrounding the subscapularis, and its intramuscular blood supply. The SSC muscle was generally supplied by branches from the subclavian artery (suprascapular artery, supraSA; circumflex scapular artery, CxSA; and dorsal scapular artery, dSA) and the axillary artery (subscapular artery, subSA; lateral thoracic artery, LTA; posterior circumflex humeral artery, PCxHA; and a branch of the axillary artery, AAbr). The anterior aspect of the muscle was supplied by the subSA, LTA, CxSA, supraSA, and AAbr. The posterior aspect of the muscle was supplied by the supraSA, PCxHA, and subSA. The dSA was more scarcely distributed than the other arteries. In two cases, the dSA supplied the portion of the muscle near the medial border of the scapular. The anterior side of the muscle tendon was supplied by the CxSA, and its posterior side was supplied by the PCxHA. The subSA can be considered to be the main branch supplying the SSA based on its distribution area of arteries. It was mostly situated within the lower region of the SSC. After distributing to the anterior surface of the SSC, some branches of the subSA reached the posterior surface as perforating branches. Clin.

The treatments consisted of a control (0.8 dS m−1) and two RWs: RW1 (2.0 dS m−1) and RW2 (5.0 dS m−1). In general, nutrients were accumulated in a greater proportion in shoots than in roots and increased in the RW treatments, with the exception of potassium and phosphorus. This behaviour produced a progressive decrease in the root water potential, which hindered the mobility of water to the leaves. This in turn caused a drop in leaf water potential and gas exchange parameters, especially in the RW2 treatment. The intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi, Pn/gs) did not show differences in any treatment. The RW2 treatment provoked a loss of biomass in the leaves but not in the stems and roots, resulting in more compact plants. Considering these results together, it is feasible to use RWs for plant irrigation, despite their high electrical conductivity. RWs are thus a viable alternative to scarce conventional water resources in a future scenario of climate change.</jats:p>",

The results show that the participation in a short supply chain is a profit‐maximising strategy and risk management tool for farmers. The increase in profit is attributed to productivity advantages, farm size expansion, and risk reduction rather than because of price premiums or cost savings. A policy implication is that short supply chain promotion has many benefits, but the government should be more concerned about the sustainability of short supply chains.</jats:p>",

The analysis builds on the electricity generation forecast for the Czech Republic for 2015–2050. The impact of different sources of electricity supply on carbon and water footprints were analyzed based on electricity generation by source for the period. Within the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the carbon footprint was calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method, while the water footprint was determined by the Water Scarcity method. The computational LCA model was provided by the SimaPro v. 8.5 package with the Ecoinvent v. 3 database. The functional unit of study was running an electric vehicle over 100 km. The system boundary covered an electric vehicle life cycle from cradle to grave. For the analysis, we chose a vehicle powered by a lithium-ion battery with assumed consumption 19.9 kWh/100 km. The results show that electricity generated to charge electric vehicle batteries is the main determinant of carbon and water footprints related to electric vehicles in the Czech Republic. Another important factor is passenger car production. Nuclear power is the main determinant of the water footprint for the current and future electric vehicle charging, while, currently, lignite and hard coal are the main determinants of carbon footprint.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>La administración de la cadena de suministro sustentable (sustainable supply chain management o SSCM por sus siglas en inglés) es un tema de investigación que ha cobrado mayor interés en los últimos años; sin embargo, todavía faltan estudios que se enfoquen en la SSCM y en las pequeñas y medianas empresas (pymes) con inversión nacional, principalmente en economías emergentes como la mexicana. Por esta razón, el objetivo de este trabajo fue realizar una revisión literaria para conocer y comprender la situación en la que se encuentran la SSCM y las pymes mexicanas con inversión nacional. El método de investigación para lograr la revisión y alcanzar el objetivo fue por medio de un análisis de contenido. En síntesis, los resultados demuestran que aún existen varios vacíos teóricos a nivel estratégico, táctico y operacional, por lo cual no es posible generalizar modelos conceptuales y matemáticos, ni tampoco es posible generalizar dicha teoría entre economías emergentes y desarrolladas. En consecuencia, se deben concretar más investigaciones centradas en determinados sectores mexicanos en los que también se puedan considerar diversas metodologías para tener una perspectiva más profunda. Aun así, se puede asegurar que la incentivación de la SSCM en las pymes mexicanas puede generar beneficios económicos, sociales y ambientales para los miembros de la cadena de suministro, dependiendo del sector y del caso de estudio.</jats:p>"

Therefore, their interplay and the associated effects on consumer population growth are important for predator–prey interactions and community dynamics. Experiments in which consumers were exposed to elemental nutrient limitations along food quantity gradients suggest that food quality effects on consumer performance are relevant only at high food quantities. However, elemental nutrients act differently on physiological processes than biochemical nutrients. So far, the interactive effects of food quantity and biochemical compounds on consumer performance have been insufficiently studied.</jats:p>\n</jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item>\n<jats:p>We studied interactive effects of food quantity and biochemical food quality on population growth, including fecundity and survival, of the freshwater rotifer <jats:italic>Brachionus calyciflorus</jats:italic>. We hypothesised that these life history traits are differently affected by the availability of biochemical nutrients and that food quality effects gain importance with increasing food quantity. In a first experiment, we established food quantity and quality gradients by providing rotifers with different concentrations of a low‐quality food, the sterol‐free cyanobacterium <jats:italic>Synechococcus elongatus</jats:italic>, supplemented with increasing amounts of cholesterol. In a second experiment, food quantity and quality gradients were established by providing different proportions of two prey species differing in biochemical food quality, i.e. <jats:italic>S. elongatus</jats:italic> and the lipid‐rich alga <jats:italic>Nannochloropsis limnetica</jats:italic>, at different total food concentrations.</jats:p>\n</jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item>\n<jats:p>We found that the effects of cholesterol supplementation on population growth increased with increasing food quantity. This interactive effect on population growth was mainly due to food quality effects on fecundity, as effects on survival remained constant along the food quantity gradient. In contrast, when feeding on the mixed algal diet, the food quality effect associated with increasing the proportion of the high‐quality alga did not change along the food quantity gradient. The data on survival and fecundity demonstrate the missing interactive effect of food quantity and quality on population growth, as both traits were oppositely affected. Survival was affected by food quality primarily at low food quantity, whereas food quality effects on fecundity were stronger at high food quantity.</jats:p>\n</jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item>\n<jats:p>Our results highlight the significance of essential biochemicals in mediating the interactive effects of food quantity and quality on population growth. The interplay between food quantity and biochemical food quality limitation seems to influence resource allocation patterns in order to optimise survival or reproduction, which may strongly affect population dynamics in variable environments. As opposed to exploring the function of a single nutrient via supplementation, using algae mixtures allowed us to assess food quality effects on consumer performance in a more natural context by taking potential interactive effects of multiple co‐limiting nutrients into account.</jats:p>\n</jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Today, most of the car manufacturers world-wide have embraced the principles of lean manufacturing on strategic and operational level. On strategic level car companies like Toyota (Womack et al., 1990) shifted 63 per cent of the value of the car towards the first, second and third tier suppliers for the co-production and co-development of cars as an effect of lean implementation. However, lean implementation was also followed by for instance Ford and GM in the USA, the latter company faced a sudden disruption in 2009 due to the break-out of the financial crisis in 2008, while Ford survived. Could this be foreseen? The exclusive use of (classic) financial performance indicators may give a false image of a company’s current and future performance. There is a need for a model to identify “the stars and the laggards’ regarding car companies by taking into account non-financial and intangible dimensions as advocated by Neely et al. (2003) regarding the third generation of business performance measurement systems. The purpose of this paper is therefor to propose a method to measure and benchmark car company performance which includes the non-financial R&amp;D dimension as well as supply chain, value creating and employee dimensions. These dimensions are present in the value leverage model (van Blokland et al., 2012a, 2012b) which can serve as a basis for this method. The aim is to contribute to the third generation business performance measurement systems by further development of the value leverage model towards a maturity model for benchmarking car company performance. The proposed method can provide a big picture and give insight regarding company performance and direction of the performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Value leverage can be measured by a correlation analysis regarding three dimensions, namely, supply chain, R&amp;D and value creation, all relative to the employee or capita which results in the average value leverage (AVL) factor. This AVL factor can be used to compose a combined relative and absolute ranking. The score regarding the AVL results in a relative ranking expressing the level of stability regarding the car companies value chain and system. For the absolute ranking the car companies receive per variable parameter a score according to their absolute performance relative to the other car companies. The relative and absolute ranking are presented on the vertical and horizontal axes forming a matrix. The matrix is the basis for the stability-value leverage maturity model for measuring and benchmarking company performance. With the proposed method, the following main research question can be answered: “How can company performance be measured and benchmarked from a stability-value leverage perspective?”.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>With the proposed method, stability-value leverage performance can be measured. The relative ranking on the vertical axis and the absolute ranking form together a matrix which is presented by a scatterplot. A matrix with four maturity levels emerged from the analysis by introducing the average score of all the car companies together in the data set crossing the matrix vertical and horizontal. The four levels are as follows: Level I, low stability – low value leverage; Level II, low stability – high value leverage; Level III, high stability – low value leverage; and Level IV, high stability – high value leverage. Stability-value leverage performance of car companies can be measured over time which makes it possible to observe to which direction the car company migrates for instance from Level I to Level III, before and after the financial crises in 2008. The car companies BMW, Daimler, Audi, Ford and Honda are the best performing companies in stability-value leverage over the period 2000-2014, as they are situated at Level IV. With the findings, the main research question can be answered. The value leverage indicators can be used for measuring and benchmarking company performance regarding four maturity levels of stability and value leverage. The direction of performance can be observed as well.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research/limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This research is limited to the car industry.

Using activity-based costing (ABC), we can breakdown the cost drivers and understand the cost levers associated with ALM process. This can help us in finding the innovative ways to enhance the ALM process operation’s efficiency. We have considered an aircraft bracket manufacturing using the direct metal laser sintering process as a business case for our ABC analysis on additive layer manufacturing technologies in aerospace and defence supply chain. The additive layer manufactured components associated cost can be divided into design cost, production cost, post-processing cost and qualification cost. Each step in the additive manufacturing process performs at one organisation or across a supply chain based on the various internal and external suppliers. Also, there are overhead costs associated with each step of this additive manufacturing process. This article explains the cost involved in the component design and its relevance to supply chain. It explains the cost involved in the component production such as materials cost, machine set-up cost, machine runtime cost and final build plate removal cost. It also explains the cost involved in the post-processing such as heat-treating cost, machining cost and surface finish cost. The component process cost is required to qualify based on its end use. The component qualification cost is required to add significantly to the component overall cost including the labour cost and computer tomography scan cost. The overhead cost is depending on the individual operation and it assigns these costs appropriately. It computes the ABC for an aerospace bracket and concludes with analysis to make a convinceable business case for the use of innovative technology and to enable to identify the cost of drivers and levers, so it can drive business with more efficiently. </jats:p>",

We first considered a pure bonded warehouse mode in which the e-commerce company makes bulk purchase from an overseas supplier to a bonded warehouse and will deliver goods to customers from the bonded warehouse when customers order online. We constructed a Stackelberg model to obtain the equilibrium solution by using backward induction, and then properties of equilibrium strategy and equilibrium profit is discussed. We then studied the combined bonded warehouse and direct mailing mode in which the e-commerce company will purchase a single piece and mail to the customer directly if the bonded warehouse is out of stock. Analytical results demonstrate that the combined bonded warehouse and direct mailing mode may increase the profit of suppliers and decrease the profit of e-commerce companies.</jats:p>"

In agricultural systems, these processes can be considerably altered by chemical fertilizer and compost application due to changes in nitrogen (N) supply and substrate quality (decomposability). We conducted a field experiment including control, urea, and four compost treatments. Ra and Rh were separated using the root exclusion method. Composts were characterized by chemical analyses, <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance, and lignin monomers. Annual cumulative Ra, along with root biomass, increased with soil mineral N, while Rh was suppressed by excessive N supply. Thus, Ra was stimulated but Rh was decreased by urea alone application. Annual Rh was increased by application of compost, especially that containing most lignin vanillyl and syringyl units, O‐alkyl C, di‐O‐alkyl C, and manganese. However, during the initial period, Rh was most effectively stimulated by the compost containing most carbohydrates, lignin cinnamyl units, phenolic C, and calcium. Ra was mediated by N release from compost decomposition and thus exhibited similar responses to compost quality as Rh. The Rh <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub> was reduced, while Ra <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub>was increased by chemical fertilizer and compost application.

In this article, we apply the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition method to analyze the carbon emissions of China's electricity and thermal supply industry from 2003 to 2012. Under different scenarios, this study also forecasts the carbon emissions and calculates reduction potential of The Production and Supply of Electric and Heat Power Industry. The results show the economic output effect and energy intensity effect promote the sector's CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions growth, however the energy structure effect decrease the sector's carbon emissions. At the end of 2030, the accumulated emission reduction will be 4160.84 Mt in moderate reduction scenario and 11,593.27 Mt in strong reduction scenario. If all the indexes maintain the current change rate, the industry will reach carbon emissions peak at the time of 2030, What is more, the time for emissions peak will be 2025 and 2020 in moderate reduction scenario and strong reduction scenario. Finally, the article proposes to improve energy efficiency and promote the development of clean energy to reduce the carbon emissions of the Production and Supply of Electric and Heat Power Industry. Draw more stringent environmental standards and incentives to promote energy‐saving existing technology, the application can also combine with the means of financial subsidies to encourage the companies to reduce the energy intensity of the sector or strengthen the impact of energy intensity effect on the change of carbon emissions, promote the industry early peak. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well‐known that adding a little flexibility to the right place is an effective strategy to improve the performance of operations in the face of demand uncertainties, to ensure high level of capacity utilization. However, given that system disruptions are ubiquitous, the legacy flexibility designs may perform poorly under disruptions to supply or capacity installations. In this study, we focus on the design of reliable and sparse flexibility structures that consistently meet a reasonable performance criterion under disruptions to both demand and supply. Specifically, we propose a class of structures termed as extended probabilistic expanders, based on the conjecture that the expansion property, rather than the global connectivity, is critical to good performance of the structures. We prove that for a system with n retailers, essentially only O( n) supply routes between suppliers and retailers are necessary to ensure good performance under disruption. In addition, we present an efficient randomized algorithm to construct extended probabilistic expanders, and demonstrate that the construction yields very good structure with the least number of edges asymptotically. We also investigate an extension to systems with structural constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that our design has not only a wide range of applications, but also better performance than a variety of known structures. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose eHAPAC, a novel privacy-preserving access control model for IP-enabled wireless sensor networks. The contributions of our paper include three parts. First, this paper integrates the Hidra access control protocol and APAC privacy-preserving model, addressing the issue of privacy-preserving access control in resource-constrained devices. Second, this paper proposes an enhanced Hidra protocol to implement the unlinkability of protocol message exchanges.

After the start-up period, we found that Mn2+ could be removed efficiently by MeOx, even if the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the influent was only about 1.0–1.5 mg/L. This means that the removal process of Mn2+ does not need to consume DO. The kinetic experiments for Mn2+ indicated that the adsorption and oxidation kinetics followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The film (MeOx) was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All manganese adsorbed on the surface of the sand was the oxidized form, and the manganese oxide coated onto the sand effectively oxidized Mn2+ to Mn3+ or Mn4+. The binding energy of the observed photoelectron peaks of O(1s) showed the existence of [≡Mn-OH] on the surface of the film by XPS, which might be a key intermediate in the mechanism of Mn2+ oxidation. Finally, a chemical catalytic oxidation mechanism for Mn2+ removal was proposed by the analysis of the oxidation process.</jats:p>",

This study determined the potential of the novel bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS) to recover human enteric viruses and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) from wastewater and wastewater-impacted surface waters, examined PMMoV use as a fecal contamination indicator in Kenya, and identified potential BMFS process controls. From April 2015 to April 2016, BMFS samples were collected from seven sites in Kenya (n = 59). Enteroviruses and PMMoV were detected in 100% of samples, and human adenovirus, human astrovirus, hepatitis A virus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, sapovirus, and human rotavirus were detected in the majority of samples. The consistent detection of enteroviruses and PMMoV suggests that these viruses could be used as indicators in similarly fecally contaminated sites and BMFS process controls. As contamination of surface water sources remains a global issue, enteric virus environmental surveillance is necessary. This study demonstrates an effective way to sample large volumes of wastewater and wastewater-impacted surface waters for the detection of multiple enteric viruses simultaneously.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Silicone rubber material is widely used in high-voltage external insulation systems due to its excellent hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity transfer performance. However, silicone rubber is a polymeric material with a poor ability to resist electrical tracking and erosion; therefore, some fillers must be added to the material for performance enhancement. The inclined plane test is a standard method used for evaluating the tracking and erosion resistance by subjecting the materials to a combination of voltage stress and contaminate droplets to produce failure. This test is time-consuming and difficult to apply in field inspection. In this paper, a new and faster way to evaluate the tracking and erosion resistance performance is proposed using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The influence of filler content on the tracking and erosion resistance performance was studied, and the filler content was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and the LIBS technique. In this paper, the tracking and erosion resistance of silicone rubber samples was correctly classified using principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network algorithms based on LIBS spectra. The conclusions of this work are of great significance to the performance characterization of silicone rubber composite materials.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.</jats:p>"

Next, we simulate the damage repercussions regarding production capacity over the entire supply chain through many tiers, and extract bottlenecks of company risk within the supply chain. It was found that bottleneck companies tend have a slow recovery rate as compared to other affected companies.

Of the four-level irrigation districts, only the fractal dimension of the Wutong River irrigation district was 3.037, which was beyond the upper limit of approximately 1.23%. Using gray relational analysis, the correlation degrees of four factors such as the effective irrigated area, the water-saving area ratio, the complexity of the canal structure, the channel density with the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water and the fractal dimensions were all above 0.5 in the three- and four-level irrigation districts.</jats:p>",
