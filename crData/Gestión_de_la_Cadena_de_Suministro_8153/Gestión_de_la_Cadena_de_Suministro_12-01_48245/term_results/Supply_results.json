      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the early 2000s, the Boeing Company was experiencing a market shrink due to a downturn in the aerospace industry after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as severe competition from its rival Airbus. To deal with the situation and salvage its market share, Boeing proposed the design of a new aircraft called Boeing 787 or the Dreamliner. This futuristic aircraft was received very well by the airlines. Very soon, it became the fastest-selling new airplane in the history of commercial aviation. Nevertheless, after the initial successful launch, the company faced many supply-chain-related problems, which resulted in repeated delays and huge extra costs. These delays (now more than two and a half years) could add up to as long as three years. In this research, the authors investigate how the mismatch between the supply-chain capabilities and the Boeing’s strategy for developing this airplane led to these delays and extra costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The adoption of the behavioural approach for the study of OM and Supply Chain Management is still fairly novel. However, there is evidence that in order to improve supply chain management it is crucial to develop models that correctly describe human behaviour. Failure to account for behavioural components such as risk perception, time effects and social interaction may lead to models that are biased in their predictions. This chapter reviews extant behavioural research relevant to supply chain risk management. In particular, its implications for supply chain management are outlined, and opportunities for future developments of theory that is robust to behavioural effects are identified.</jats:p>"

The role of a diverse workforce, particularly women, is reexamined from the perspective of maximizing the bottom-line and profit sharing in the logistics industry.

These include the more obvious inequities in salaries, to the more insidious and often invisible assumptions that may underlie policy. The net result is detrimental for both business and the basic ethical imperative of equity. The narrative places the discussion of logistics business operations and decision-making in the context of the current research on gender differences, and examines possible ways to create more equitable enterprises, while maintaining and improving the bottom-line.</jats:p>"

The advantages associated with the integrated approach have been articulated, as have possible approaches to planning for SCI. However, there is a dearth of literature in the area of SCI implementation. This chapter describes a piece of action research that aims to identify some of the critical success factors and inhibitors to success in relation to SCI. The action research was carried out in a complex hospital environment. Implementing anything that is new is typically met with resistance. Resistance to change is a natural response and the only way to get buy-in is to impress. That usually means presenting something of benefit and interesting. SCI in this regard requires that innovation is present in both concept and output. Innovative ideas, approaches and re-invention is a constant requirement for operational and strategic efficiencies. Similarly in SCI new and challenging ways must be incorporated into the implementation process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its introduction by management consultants in the early 1980s, supply chain management (SCM) has been primarily concerned with the integration of processes and activities both within and between organisations. The concept of supply chain integration (SCI) is based on documented evidence that suggests that much of the waste throughout businesses is a consequence of fragmented supply chain configurations. However, there is also evidence to suggest that the achievement of higher levels of intra- and inter-firm integration presents an array of managerial challenges. The need for innovation in all aspects of SCM is widely recognised. Given the pivotal role of the integration paradigm within SCM, any meaningful innovation in this area must focus heavily on this issue. This chapter outlines some of the challenges by exploring the evolving SCM business context. It goes on to relate SCM theory to the widely cited Porter value chain concept. The core of the chapter provides a detailed description of SCI based on a wide variety of literature. It does so with particular reference to the challenges inherent in implementing an integrated business paradigm with a view to identifying a range of possible innovative solutions. The adoption of more integrated supply chain structures raises questions regarding the nature of both internal and external customer/supplier relationships. The effective management of such relationships is, therefore, given particular focus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product distribution represents a significant portion of logistics costs. A well designed distribution network may provide substantial long-term benefits, but as the infrastructure develops, the optimal strategy may not be taken for granted. Product distribution costs are dependent on the supply chain network design, and the issue assumes more importance in emerging economies. When the emerging economies mature with time, both the supply as well as demand points shift, thus making it necessary to re-visit the network design problem in the future. This case analyses the supply chain retail network design of a company that distributes petroleum products throughout the Sultanate of Oman. The network design strategy employs an optimization model to identify the depot locations and gas station allocations in its distribution network. The case leads to identify the petroleum depot locations and gas station allocations and allows for designing an efficient distribution system. Additionally, the case study provides an opportunity to explore the major challenges faced by the petroleum supply chains in emerging economies. These challenges include changed business scenarios due to the diversification agenda of these economies, memberships in trade organizations and bilateral agreements, emergence of additional competition, lowering or elimination of tariffs, less protectionism of the local companies, and other risks associated with the supply chains.</jats:p>"

One such gap in the literature represents the focus of the current study; little research has addressed the role of nonwork focused personal relationships (i.e., friendships) formed between employees of supply chain partner firms, and specifically how such relationships impact business‐related communication processes. Because research in this area is limited, and qualitative methods are considered most appropriate to assess emergent research phenomena, grounded theory building (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b89\">Strauss and Corbin 1990</jats:ext-link>) via semi‐structured interviews was undertaken. The results reveal that interpersonal relationships facilitate business communications through four emergent process themes. Our analysis thus allows us to develop initial theory related to how two different personal social network layers – personal relationships and interorganizational communications – relate within supply chain settings. Implications for future research are also considered.</jats:p>",

Coordination is achieved by two types of decisions: economic (concerning prices established and stated over a contract), and physical exchange of products (concerning the inventory that is going to be held by the retailer). First one contract with a simple pricing scheme is considered, and then two contracts with inventory holding cost shared among the companies of the supply chain. The former is presented to explain the general situation and the two last ones to explain different schemes of inventory cost share. A numerical example is also shown.

Four key players undertaking five processes were involved. These companies planned to operate sell-buy relationships. Upon starting to ramp-up of the first product component sets, it became clear that companies did not trust their successors to pay for all goods delivered. Similarly, suppliers were not trusted to deliver perfect goods. Companies receiving component sets refused liability for damage or defects introduced by companies further up the supply chain. A remedial quick-fix using centralised inspection at the principal supplier soon was adopted to facilitate supply of complete sets of mechanical parts to the assembler. Significant similarities exist between the case study supply chain and the concepts used in business process reengineering. The chapter identifies stages undertaken to improve an inbound supply chain for complex plastic mouldings assemblies. The principal research methods used were participant-observer and action orientation. All company names have been disguised to comply with confidentiality agreements.

Environmental risks and problems are widening. The issues of managing environment impacts are capturing public attention. Modernization and technology up-gradation is a continuous process for any growing industry and is equally true for the cement industry. With increasing awareness of environmental protection worldwide, the green trend of conserving the Earth’s resources and protecting the environment is overwhelming, thereby exerting pressure on corporations in India. The pressure and drive accompanying globalization has prompted enterprises to improve their environmental performance (Zhu and Sarkis, 2006). Consequently, corporations have shown growing concern for the environment over the past ten years (Sheu, et al., 2005). The pressure on corporations to improve their environmental performances comes from globalization rather than localization (Sarkis and Tamarkin, 2005). Increasing environmental concern has gradually become part of the overall corporation culture and, in turn, has helped to reengineer the strategies of corporations (Madu, et al., 2002).</jats:p>"

Yet, few managers comprehend the nuanced complexities involved in assessing heterogeneously dispersed resources and bringing complimentary competencies together up and down the supply chain. As a result, gains from collaborative initiatives are often disappointing. Several literature streams including systems design, competency development (e.g., resource‐based view and relational view), and change management predict these outcomes. Building on insights from the literature, we sought to enrich theory of collaboration via inductive, interview‐driven research. Specifically, we conducted approximately 50 structured interviews at each of two points in time. Rigorous analysis of the interview firms' experience with collaborative initiatives provided insight into the motivations, resistors, enablers, and outcomes of collaboration. These insights form the foundation for a theoretical model to explain collaboration successes and failures as well as to provide prescriptions for using collaboration to achieve differential firm and supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rice is one of the major commodities produced and consumed in India. India is also home to one of the finest varieties of rice sold under the name of Basmati. The State of Chhattisgarh is considered the Rice Bowl of India as it is one of the largest contributors to paddy production in India. Around 3 million families subsist on farming in Chhattisgarh, out of which, 1.522 million families are small farmers (owning less than 2 hectares of land). The Government of Chhattisgarh procures paddy in Chhattisgarh on behalf of Government of India. This scheme benefits about 1 million farmer families by procuring about 3 million metric tons of paddy in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) of a year, spending about 600 Million US Dollars. The procurement takes place through about 1333 Primary Agricultural Societies in the whole state covering geographical area of 135000 sq. km. The paddy procured is converted into rice by millers after entering into an agreement. Rice is then handed over to Chhattisgarh State Civil Supplies Corporation to use it in another important scheme for providing food security to the poor. The supply chain of rice production is very simple. It is harvested in the form of paddy from the field and sold to the millers who then process the rice. The processed rice is then sold to the market. Although simple, there are a number of inefficiencies present in its supply chain. This case familiarizes the readers of the distribution system of rice, various government policies in its distribution system, and the issues that need to be addressed in a typical distribution system of rice. The case also urges the readers to mull over how these inefficiencies can be overcome with the latest supply chain management techniques so as to make its distribution efficient and cost effective.</jats:p>"

For intellectuals, the mechanism provides a new approach to explicate knowledge sharing in supply networks. Besides, it provides deep-rooted opening point for supplementary empirical assessment. The mechanism facilitates managers to expand their understanding of composite circumstances embedded into global supply networks to share their knowledge. With that enhanced understanding, the managers can spotlight their actions, which help further to perk up their firms’ competitiveness provoked by the knowledge sharing activities.</jats:p>"

The supply chain integration analysis was done through the use of the quick scan audit methodology and it was observed that there was no integrated supply chain in the Thai textile and garment industry. The majority of the existing textile and garment supply chain relationship in Thailand was mostly limited to internal functions within member firms with some dyadic relationships. This means that most Thai textile and garment firms are still struggling with internal integration and are still not able to integrate their respective supply chain thus affecting innovation capability of Thai textile and garment supply chain.

ETO is basically a product development process, which starts with a product specification and finishes with an engineering design as its deliverable. It rarely includes manufacturing processes. The main drawback is with issues concerning its long lead-time. Research shows that an excessive lead-time is more often than not caused directly or indirectly by factors related to the design phase. This chapter thus, endeavours to introduce a best practice concurrent approach for reducing the lead-time at an engineer-to-order product design/development stage by seeking to integrate business information technology systems in the design and operational phases. It also introduces a new concurrent best practice approach by way of seeking to integrate other related business systems, e.g., (Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)) such as (Enterprise Service Architecture (ESA) application processes with Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)) as a platform for applications and processes for effective communication. Furthermore, the chapter presents and discusses a model of classical concurrent engineering (CE) ETO operational process. ETO key elements, ETO success factors, and series of state of the art ETO classical ERP engineering design tools, as well as the “best practice” product life cycle are all discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades several studies have highlighted that the competitive advantage of large customer firms arises significantly from their ability to achieve a successful supply system through the adoption of effective tools and methodologies for evaluating suppliers. Nevertheless it emerges that a gap exists between a growing number of applications and the scarce empirical evidence of the practical usefulness of such applications. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a contribution to bridging this gap through applying the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodology suppliers’ evaluation. The evaluation tree of the AHP assures transparency and traceability, features that allow using it as a tool for strategic management of the supply system. The AHP evaluation tree provides relevant indications for the strategic decision that both customers and suppliers have to adopt to reinforce the supply system and their competitive position. Relevant issues arising from the application and managerial implications for both customer and suppliers are discussed. In particular, we underline how the AHP methodology is not only a tool for supplier evaluation but also a strategic management tool to develop the supply system.</jats:p>"

On November 28, 2001 the Supreme Court of India passed an order which mandated that: “A cooked mid-day meal is to be provided in all the government and government-aided primary schools in all the states.” Akshaya Patra was called in to give testimonies to the Supreme Court in order to implement the mandate. With the partnership of the Government of India and various State Governments as well as the generosity of thousands of supporters, it has grown from a small endeavor to a mammoth force that stretches across the country. Now Akshaya Patra is the world’s largest Non-Governmental Organization, providing a free midday meal to 1.2 million underprivileged children in India (Akshaya Patra India, n.d.). It houses one of the finest technologies, and its kitchen operations are exemplary. The case specifically discusses its operations in Bhilai (Chhattisgarh State), India’s Steel City, where it provides free meals to around 31,768 children in about 156 schools around Bhilai.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several healthcare disasters have occurred in the past decade, and their occurrence has become more frequent recently due to one natural catastrophe after another. The medical application requirement for such a disaster management system includes effective, reliable, and coordinated responses to disease and injury, accurate surveillance of area hospitals, and efficient management of clinical and research information. Based on the application requirements, this case study describes a grid-based system in a health information supply chain that monitors and detects national infectious events using geographical information system (GIS), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and grid computing technology. This system is fault-tolerant, highly secure, flexible, and extensible, thus making it capable of operation in case of a national catastrophe. It has a low cost of deployment and is designed for large-scale and quick responses. Owing to the grid-based nature of the network, no central server or data centre needs to be built. To reinforce the responsiveness of the national health information supply chain, this case study proposes a practical, tracking-based, spatially-aware, steady, and flexible architecture, based on GIS and RFID, for developing successful infectious disaster management plans to tackle technical issues. The architecture achieves a common understanding of spatial data and processes. Therefore, the system can efficiently and effectively share, compare, and federate—yet integrate—most local health information providers and results in more informed planning and better outcome.</jats:p>"

The effective use of integrated SPDP not only enhances the performance rather decreases inventory cost, holding cost, shortage cost and overall supply chain costs. A quantitative mathematical model is used to the problem articulation, and then it is solved by applying heuristic genetic algorithm (GA) method. The proposed model with genetic algorithm could provide the best satisfactory result with the minimum cost.

In this article, various models are constructed that examine how supply chain actors' usage of contracts to manage their exposure to supply (demand)‐side transaction risks can affect their exposure to demand (supply)‐side transaction risks. The models show that when supply chain actors follow the recommendations from the traditional <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TCE</jats:styled-content> model regarding the use of contracts, it may increase rather than decrease their exposure to transaction risks. However, when supply chain actors take into account simultaneously both supply‐ and demand‐side transactions when making their contract decisions, as is recommended in this article, a reduction in exposure to transaction risks is more likely.

The ever growing complexity of managing global flows of products, information and capital increases the risk of deploying inapt operations leading to deterioration of profits. To address this problem, the authors propose a unified business process design framework based on the paradigm of intelligence. Intelligence allows humans and human-designed systems cope with environmental volatility, and the authors argue that its principles applied to the context of organizational processes can increase the success rate of business operations. The framework is created using a set of theoretical based constructs grounded in a discussion across several streams of research including psychology, pedagogy, artificial intelligence, learning, business process management and supply chain management. It outlines a number of system tasks combined in four integrated management perspectives: build, execute, grow and innovate, put forward as business process design propositions for Intelligent Supply Chains.</p>",

Balancing the conflicts between the improvement of visibility and the decrease of sensitive information shared is paramount. In this paper, the authors propose a leader-follower game model called LFM to model the strategic game between buyer and supplier. A Stackelberg equilibrium state is then computed as the solution to this game model. The proposed approach exhibits better performance when compared with conventional optimization approaches via derivation in terms of the total information sharing level and the total gain acquired verified by the experiments. In the future, the authors will extend this approach to a more complex situation with more participants in a dynamic environment.</jats:p>"

The first of these refers to ‘doing what is already done but better.’ The latter may come through the emergence of a new technology, a completely new market or a new business model and refers to decision making under uncertainty. The focus of this chapter is the implementation of discontinuous innovation (DI) in supply chain relationships. The authors review two research-led projects: the development and implementation of the SCRIA (Supply Chain Relationship in Aerospace) Relationship Evaluation Tool (RET) and the development of the concept of Value-Transparency (V-T). Both projects originated in the authors’ academic research in the early 1990s and were aimed at subsequent implementation in the context of supply chain relationships. One was successfully implemented; the other was not. The authors introduce future research exploring some supply relationship context-specific barriers and enablers in the implementation of radical concepts or DI through case based research method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demand uncertainty leads to fluctuations in inventory position at each echelon of a supply chain causing bullwhip effect, which can lead to significant cost and loss of efficiency and waste of resources. One of the aspects that can reduce potential bullwhip effect is the sharing of real time information for which the recently mass produced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can be of great value. The use of RFID technology can also help in increasing the visibility of the flow of goods and material, keeping track of the location and quantity at each distribution centre and warehouses. This will also help in the periodic and near real time optimization of inventory level of goods and material. The data collected with RFID can be analysed in artificial Neural Network (NN) to forecast the future demand. In this chapter, a framework is proposed by combining RFID with artificial neural network so that lean logistics can be realized in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The bullwhip effect is a supply-chain phenomenon that reveals a lack of business agility characterized by the amplification of inventory variance. This study employs an experiment involving a modified Beer Distribution Game to simulate an RFID-enabled supply chain. The results provide empirical evidence that RFID technology can increase a supply chain’s agility and reduce the bullwhip effect by reducing inventory holding costs, stockout costs, and inventory-level variances. The results are all the more important when applied to interorganizational e-commerce systems.</jats:p>"

Insights from the organizational behavior and entrepreneurship literature help to sharpen understanding of how organizational structure and entrepreneurial culture relate to firm‐level trait preferences in personnel hiring and promotion decisions. Using an inductive, theory‐building approach, a typology of four different organizational structures within the transportation brokerage space is proposed. Working propositions are presented that relate organizational structure, entrepreneurial orientation, the differential prioritization of proactive personality and self‐management at various stages of career progression, and perceptions of firm performance vis‐á‐vis competitors. Contributions to theory and practice, and the broader implications for supply chain intermediaries are discussed.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the author proposes a method for service scheduling and optimization based on an ontology to describe business services and related concepts. The author schedules operations required to create a service. With each service process and its operations, soft and hard constraints on the execution of operations and the required resources are posted. These constraints are derived from service level agreements. A legal plan must then satisfy all hard constraints. All soft constraints are matter of optimization. Using a tabu search, a near-optimal solution of the service scheduling problem is achieved.</jats:p>"

This study integrates transaction cost economics and reference price thinking from consumer behavior to understand better how a seller's reservation price, aspiration price, and initial price offering might influence the ultimate settlement price. We apply ridge regression to negotiation data from 282 business relationships of a<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">G</jats:styled-content>erman chemicals supplier with customers in six client industries. Overall, the three determinants explain 86 percent of the variation in the settlement price. A seller's reservation price is substantially less important than the aspiration price or the initial price offering. Although this outcome can be explained via a reference price perspective, transaction cost economics theory helps clarify the industry differences that determine the impact of reservation prices and initial price offerings on settlement prices.</jats:p>",

The determinants of timber supply in China  were investigated with panel data from 25 provinces from 1999 to 2009.  The results indicated that Chinaâs timber supply had responded to both  market forces, reflected by timber prices largely determined by world  demand and supply, and to government policies expressed by production  quotas and the tenure reform on collective forestland. The price  elasticity of Chinaâs timber supply was estimated at 0.31Â±0.12. The  inelastic response of production to the quota (0.20Â±0.02) suggested that  government had a limited, though significant, control of timber supply.  Other things being equal, the land tenure reform increased timber  supply by 18Â±8 percent, where and when it had been implemented.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The continued trend of globalization and technology improvement like the internet and transportation have spawned an increasing number of complex service chains that span across local, regional and national boundaries. Service level agreement (SLA) plays a crucial role in gluing service chains together. In that regard, this paper provides a complete guidance of end-to-end lifecycle management of SLA, including SLA-aware service modelling and terms optimization, contract drafting and compliance tracking. Among these, the author introduces his work in the area of enterprise SLA optimization to address existing deficiencies in this area including a roadmap for industry-strength SLA optimization capability and an initial version of SLA modeling and optimization toolset—code-named SLA-OASIS. Some out-of-box toolsets for SLA contract drafting and compliance tracking are also introduced.</jats:p>"

The most common method of measuring the environmental performance is the international standards of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Typically, measuring is based on estimations and average values at product category level. In this chapter, the authors present a framework for measuring environmental impact at the item level. Using Traceability Graph emissions and resources, it can be monitored from the data management perspective. The model can be mapped to any precision level of physical tracing. At the most precise level, even a single physical object and its components can be analyzed. This, of course, demands that the related objects and their components are identified and mapped to the database. From the opposite perspective, the authors’ model also supports rough level analysis of products and their histories. In terms of the Traceability Cube, multidimensional analysis can be applied for traceability data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the volatility of house prices is often ascribed to demand-side factors, constraints on housing supply have important and little-studied implications for housing dynamics. I illustrate the strong relationship in city-level data between the volatility of house prices and the regulation of new housing supply. I then employ a dynamic structural model of housing investment to estimate the effect of supply constraints on both the level of new construction and the responsiveness of investment to house prices. I find that supply constraints increase volatility through two channels: First, regulation lowers the elasticity of new housing supply by increasing lags in the permit process and adding to the cost of supplying new houses on the margin. Second, geographic limitations on the area available for building houses, such as steep slopes and water bodies, lead to less investment on average relative to the size of the existing housing stock, leaving less scope for the supply response to attenuate the effects of a demand shock. My estimates and simulations confirm that regulation and geographic constraints play critical and complementary roles in decreasing the responsiveness of investment to demand shocks, which in turn amplifies house price volatility.</jats:p>"

While they aim at cooperating and coordinating their activities to support actions within these new markets, the firms involved still compete in other, more established, export markets. This “coopetitive” relationship allows the group many benefits related to their ability to source material and ensure a more consistent supply, but opens them up to challenges, such as dealing with opportunistic behaviour by other members. This case outlines the background of the firms and introduces the most recent significant challenge they face. The implications of their structure are discussed with emphasis on supply, risk pooling, information sharing, and revenue- and cost-sharing. The successes gained by the group are not without sacrifice; the challenges of their operations are discussed with stress on the most recent and perhaps the most significant challenge yet.</jats:p>"

This study identified key characteristics and attributes of supplier-oriented purchasing behaviors in project-oriented environments. The review of recent literature indicated that very little research exists that examines project procurement experts’ perceptions of key aspects of supplier-oriented purchasing behavior. This research utilized a two round, modified Delphi methodology to capture the perceptions of 19 experienced project management procurement specialists. Results showed that the most strongly valued attributes could be clustered under the headings of quality, communications, attentiveness, and professionalism. Even though projects were typically characterized as short term endeavors, the characteristics found most important to project procurement managers were similar to those previously reported by procurement professionals in long-term functional environments.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes OR/MS decision support from the viewpoint of what is necessary for high quality service, and the issue of a communication gap is clarified. Through analyzing preceding research in OR/MS (Operations Research/Management Science), the author discovers a communication gap between decision makers and decision supporters. Finally, the author shows that it is effective to utilize “problem specification”, which is a decision-maker friendly description of problems proposed by research group including the author, as one approach to bridge the communication gap.</jats:p>"

This work explores the potential of computational intelligence approaches as forecasting mechanisms for predicting customer demand at the first level of organization of a supply chain where products are presented and sold to customers. The computational intelligence approaches that we utilize are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), trained with the OLMAM algorithm (Optimized Levenberg-Marquardt with Adaptive Momentum), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for regression. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated using public data from the Netflix movie rental online DVD store in order to predict the demand for movie rentals during the critical, for sales, Christmas holiday season.</jats:p>"

Firstly, considering four clustering variables on poultry meat, i.e. production, export and import in kg/capita, as well as the producer price in US $/t, using descriptive exploratory and cluster analysis, the hypothesis that the clusters of countries may be recognized was confirmed. As a result six clusters of similar countries were distinguished. Secondly, based on multiple regression analysis, this paper proofs that there exists the statistically significant relationship of poultry meat production on export and import of that kind of meat, all measured in kg/capita. There is also a high correlation between production, as a dependent, and each of two independent variables.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demands on the electronics industry for smaller, better, and cheaper packages have made the supply chain more complex. Outsourcing, new technologies, and increasing performance requirements make designing and building the right product for the right price more difficult than ever. We will present a framework for understanding and managing the supply chain through cost modeling. Cost models that accurately reflect the cost impact from technology and design decisions enable a more precise understanding of supply chain behavior. Cost models can show the extra cost of adding a layer, the expected savings from relaxing design rules, or the cost of package on package assembly compared to 3D packaging with through silicon vias (TSVs).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The models also provide context to understanding the ″should cost″ of a product and the path to achieving it. Since the guidance from cost models is based on the actual supplier cost drivers and pricing behavior, designer cost reduction efforts will result in higher savings compared to not using the cost models. Without cost models, designers risk missing their suppliers' real cost drivers and, therefore, the opportunity to decrease cost. This cost modeling framework allows the designers to realize the lowest cost product by matching the right design with the right supplier. It is a method for understanding a design decision's cost impact: a design change, a supplier change, or even the impact of new technology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing supply chains in today’s complex, dynamic, and uncertain environment is one of the key challenges affecting the success of the businesses. One of the crucial determinants of effective supply chain management is the ability to recognize customer demand patterns and react accordingly to the changes in face of intense competition. Thus the ability to adequately predict demand by the participants in a supply chain is vital to the survival of businesses. Demand prediction is aggravated by the fact that communication patterns between participants that emerge in a supply chain tend to distort the original consumer’s demand and create high levels of noise. Distortion and noise negatively impact forecast quality of the participants. This work investigates the applicability of machine learning (ML) techniques and compares their performances with the more traditional methods in order to improve demand forecast accuracy in supply chains. To this end we used two data sets from particular companies (chocolate manufacturer and toner cartridge manufacturer), as well as data from the Statistics Canada manufacturing survey. A representative set of traditional and ML-based forecasting techniques have been applied to the demand data and the accuracy of the methods was compared. As a group, Machine Learning techniques outperformed traditional techniques in terms of overall average, but not in terms of overall ranking. We also found that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on multiple demand series produced the most accurate forecasts.</jats:p>"

A technology-organization-environment framework of the contextual influences on technological innovation adoption is used to inform an analysis of three companies’ adoption and use of mobile data solutions for sales automation, freight tracking and service support. Analysis of the three case studies found that the relative advantage of the technological innovation and the information intensity of the company were the most important factors influencing adoption. Other factors that appeared to influence adoption included the compatibility of the technology with the company’s business approach, the presence of top management support and the degree of organizational readiness. Environmental factors such as competition within the industry or business partner influence seemed less influential for these pioneers of mobile technology use in supply-side activities.</jats:p>"

Once at the lower end of internationalization and controlled by its Western partners without its own brands and distribution channels, Wanxiang has managed to climb the ladder of internationalization and taken a greater share of supply chain profits using its coopetition strategy with Western partners. Two mini-cases are presented and discussed in this chapter. The first describes how Wanxiang obtained more direct market access and the appropriation of supply chain profits in competition with its Western partners. The second describes how Wanxiang acquired more sophisticated technological assets for value-addition and managed them astutely. Two important areas were explored: (i) prudent use of diversification for capital accumulation to support capability building; and (ii) management of technology acquisitions and markets by maintaining a proper balance between autonomy and the integration of the acquired business units.</jats:p>"

This paper begins with an introduction and construction of the modified s-curve membership function. A numerical real life example of supply production planning problem is then presented. The computational results show the usefulness of the modified s-curve membership function with fuzzy linear programming technique in optimising individual objective functions, compared to non-fuzzy linear programming approach. Futhermore, the optimal solution helps to conclude that by incorporating fuzziness in a linear programming model through the objective function and constraints, a better level of satisfactory solution will be provided in respect to vagueness, compared to non-fuzzy linear programming. \t\t\t</jats:p>"

The analysis uses performance scorecards and financial performance data collected from a major manufacturer regarding its contractual arrangements with 156 distributors. I find that distributors engage in less extensive process integration and information sharing with the manufacturer as the potential for hold-up increases, measured by the asymmetry of interdependence between partners. I also find that distributors engage in more extensive process integration and information sharing as the potential for hold-up decreases, measured by the magnitude of interdependence between partners. Additional evidence shows that more extensive process integration and information sharing have favorable financial performance implications for supply chain partners and enhance the likelihood of distributor contract renewal. Overall, the results indicate that the potential for hold-up can restrict the performance benefits available to partners from developing more extensive supply chain integration practices.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: A confidentiality agreement restricts data availability.

As a result, this paper investigates the use of RFID in hospitals in an emerging application, that of using RFID as part of the prescription process, including pharmacists generation of the prescription and nurses’ administration of the medicine. Using activity theory, activity templates are generated for pharmacists, nurses and the hospital to investigate the introduction of RFID. This paper finds that the introduction of RFID involves changes in the activities, as measured by changes in context variables, not just changes in technology. Also, the RFID-based approach eliminates substantial “medicine” slack. Further, using activity theory, the activity design for using RFID facilitates “technologically insulation” of pharmacists and nurses, from each other and doctors. Finally, such “digital specification” of activities likely leads to fewer errors, and constrains action, limiting inappropriate use of prescription drugs.</jats:p>"

Though logistics originated and developed from military operations, it is now widely adopted in the area of manufacturing, production, and business management. This case study analyzes the difference between military and commercial logistics in terms of their entire supply chain management, which includes procurement, inventory management, warehouse location and operation, ABC categories, material handling, network, transportation, information flow and technology, and security management.</jats:p>"

During their 10th Summit, the leaders of ASEAN agreed to integrate their priority sectors with a vision to developing an ASEAN economic community whereby there would be a free flow of goods, services, investment and a freer flow of capital, equitable economic development, and reduced poverty and socio-economic disparities. This market would have no price discrimination for commodities and against foreign goods, services, capital, and labor. The aim of this chapter is to assess the current state of the cross-border trade in logistics services among ASEAN. The extent of the ease of cross-border trade is measured in terms of trade friendliness. The trade friendliness is a measure of the openness of ASEAN towards conducting free cross-border trade.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The structural transformation of modern societies (e.g., aging of population, mobility) as well as continuously increasing market dynamics (e.g., mergers, technological advancement) induces health care organizations to reduce their costs while enhancing service delivery. In other industrial sectors this was achieved by optimizing cooperation, coordination, and communication particularly with regard to the supplier base. However, as the pressure to innovate will increase extensively in the next years, similar developments are becoming relevant for the health care supply chain. In this paper, the authors adapt the current findings on supplier relationship management (SRM) to the health care context. The authors analyze theoretical foundations of SRM and explore a particular area of application in health care, namely the ordering of pharmaceuticals by hospitals. Finally, on the basis of a case study, applications of different SRM services are discussed.</jats:p>"

In the public sector, there exist major challenges, some reflective of the need to efficiently manage and coordinate such a huge undertaking while others stem from the uncertainties of a competitive global market-place.

The motivation is to ensure stability in money supply through sustainable interest rate management.  The period 1990-2007 was covered. The Eviews software was used to carry out autoregressive analysis on the variable as well as an assessment of the effects on interest rate indices on money supply. The results among others show that minimum rediscount rate and savings rate have made significant positive impact on money supply. On the other hand, lending rate has made insignificant negative impact on money supply.   Based on the above results the conclusion of the study the inability of the monetary authority to narrow the gap between saving and lending rate remains a key to the problem of instability in money supply, hence concerted effort must by made to strengthen the capacity of regulatory authorities to use market based options monitor and control periodic volatility in money supply through an effective interest rate regimes.</jats:p>"

We must feed a human population that is expected to grow to more than nine billion by mid-century. Agricultural biotechnology is one tool that holds potential promise to alleviate hunger and poverty. However, there are complex and interrelated scientific, social, political and ethical questions regarding the widespread use of biotechnology in the food supply. This edited volume discusses diverse perspectives on sustainable food production systems in terms of challenges, opportunities, success stories, barriers and risks associated with agricultural and food biotechnology. The effects of biotechnology on the environment, ethical and moral issues, potential changes to government policies and economics, and social implications are summarised. This book will interest students, professionals and researchers from the areas of bioengineering, agriculture and ecosystem science to economics and political science.</jats:p>",

Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, which can provide a mobile, scalable, and reliable monitoring solution, has gone through rapid development in recent years. The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview about wireless sensor network technology and a discussion on how this technology can be applied to modern industries and especially bring service innovation to supply chain management. An overview of the history and potential applications of WSN is provided for the necessary background. The architecture, topology, standards, and protocols of WSN are fundamentally important and thus introduced in details. In a general sense, the impact of information technologies on supply chain management and service innovation is then briefly discussed. After that, much emphasis is placed on the possibility, procedures, and critical challenges of implementing WSN in supply chain management. In the end, two case studies are provided to illustrate the application of WSN for service innovation in both cold chain management and healthcare settings.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve this objective, a literature study was conducted, looking for relevant up-to-date literature within the fields of transportation, logistics, and information and communication technology (ICT) and environmental impacts of freight transportation. In addition, two separate rounds of empirical studies were made. From literature, as well as from part of the empirical data collection, a requirement analysis was done to understand issues and problems in transport operations that can be addressed with more sophisticated information and communication systems. The second round of empirical data collection was done to identify potential solutions of the identified issues. Finally an analysis was made to understand the functionalities of possible IFTS solutions. Many effects were found that can contribute to increased performance of transport operations including automatic item identification, safety and security prevention, real-time navigation, traffic situation notification and carbon footprint registration.</jats:p>"

A novel method based on phase-to-phase current difference is proposed as line selection criterion in this paper. The method builds on that the phase-to-phase current difference based on fault phase in fault line is equal to the grounding fault current while the phase-to-phase current difference based on fault phase in sound lines is equal to zero. Thus the fault line was selected by the biggest phase-to-phase current difference of the lines. The simulation results using PSCAD and experiment results show that the method has a high accuracy and a great ability of anti-disturbance. It is quite effective when single-phase-to-earth fault occurs in one of the parallel supply lines. It also applies to any distribution system with different grounding patterns and won’t be affected by the value of grounding resistance or the degree of fault phase.</jats:p>"

Secondly, the authors aim to develop new tools for automatic data mining. In this paper, they study how to transform these data to investigate the division of labor, the intra-colonial cooperation and conflict in an ant colony. They also develop a new unsupervised learning data mining method (DS2L-SOM: Density-based Simultaneous Two-Level - Self Organizing Map) to find homogeneous clusters (i.e., sets of individual which share a similar behavior). According to the experimental results, this method is very fast and efficient. It also allows a very useful visualization of the results.</jats:p>"

Each of these provides an independent, specific and relatively small piece of functionality, which is typically accessible through the Internet from internal or external service providers. There are no standards or models that describe the sourcing process of these software based services (SBS). The authors identify the sourcing requirements for SBS and associate the key characteristics of SBS (with the sourcing requirements introduced). Furthermore, this paper investigates the sourcing of SBS with the related works in the field of classical procurement, business process outsourcing, and information systems sourcing. Based on the analysis, the authors conclude that the direct adoption of these approaches for SBS is not feasible and new approaches are required for sourcing SBS.</jats:p>"

In the past, businesses have integrated cloud computing partially to meet their technology needs due to skepticism, reliability, and cost of the concept. However, the era is approaching where this could be a feasible solution that meets technology needs and assists businesses in meeting their goals in a reliable and efficient way. Can businesses be convinced yet? (O’Donnell, 2009). In a nutshell, cloud computing has grown over the last ten years and is still growing but making waves in the industry now more than ever, but why all this hype? Perhaps because cloud computing is seen as a viable replacement of enterprise owned local IT infrastructure (Francis, 2009).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are large differences between the microeconometric estimates of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (0-0.5) and the values used by macroeconomists to calibrate general equilibrium models (2-4). The microeconometric estimates of the Frisch are typically estimated by regressing changes in hours on changes in wages conditional on the individual being a married male head of household, working some minimum number of hours and being of prime working age. In contrast macroeconomic calibration values are typically set such that fluctuations in a general equilibrium model match the observed changes in the aggregate hours and wages from the whole population over time. This paper aims to explain the gap by estimating an aggregate Frisch elasticity which is consistent with the concept of macro calibration values using the microeconometric techniques. In order to estimate the Frisch consistent with the macro concept, this paper alters the typical microeconometric approach in order to incorporate fluctuations on the extensive margin and also broadens the scope of the sample to include single males, females, secondary earners, young individuals, and old individuals. This paper finds that estimates of the aggregate macro Frisch elasticity are in the middle of the range of macroeconomic calibration values (around 3.0). Furthermore, it finds that the key to explaining the difference are the fluctuations on the extensive margin of single males, females, secondary earners, older individuals, and younger individuals.</jats:p>"

The basis of this research study is a comprehensive questionnaire with relevant and probing questions that have collected data on obsolescence of requirements. Through analysis of the gathered data and information, this study aimed to present these risk factors, their impact, and a possible way to measure them. The critical factors identified and the result of this research project can be a trigger to conduct further in-depth analysis of project risks based on categories of projects (maintenance &amp; support projects, development projects, data conversion projects, etc.), or rather, analysis of projects based on the business area/function.

On the respect of region cooperation, Shandong Province proposes the policy to construct the central urban circle which is centered on Jinan. Therefore, it is necessary to speed up to sign the agreement “Jinan-Dezhou with the city” .The formation of Jinan-Dezhou with the city must be economy integration of two cites firstly. This paper focuses on coal industry which can cause fast fusion of two cities’ economy in the energy field, because the coal industry is the life gate to the Jinan Major industry’s development, simultaneously it is also Dezhou city’s superior industry. Moreover, these enterprises base on the same supply chain, and they can reach the cooperative agreement or form strategy combination quickly. When discussing concrete questions, the paper applies analysis to the coal enterprise. First, it elaborates significance of the physical distribution enterprise's conformity under the supply chain pattern. Next, it states inevitability of the supply chain strategy choice of coal group enterprise conformity under the market mechanism. Then, it proposes the “three centralisms” management pattern in the coal group enterprise. Last, it designs the supplied chain management pattern in the coal group business events flow.</jats:p>"

The research shows that the option contract relocates interests and risks between the members, and effectively response the changes in market demand with B2B E-markets under disruptions.

The negotiation protocol defined budget approach is based on a financial asset that each part obtains when it is released into the manufacturing system for processing. The part spends the budget to perform the manufacturing operations by the workstations; the virtual market in which part agent and workstation agents coordinate the decentralized system. A fuzzy tool is proposed to assign the budget to each part based on the objectives pursued. A simulation environment based on Rockwell ARENA® platform has been developed in order to test the proposed approach. The simulations are used to compare the proposed approach with classical dynamical scheduling approaches proposed in literature. The results show how the proposed approach leads to better results, and it can be selective among the different priority of the parts.</jats:p>"

Data was obtained using a self-administered survey involving a convenience sample of 134 retail banking customers in Malaysia. The results show that image is both directly and indirectly related to retention through satisfaction, while perceived service quality is indirectly related to retention through satisfaction. The chapter concludes that satisfaction is not the sole determinant of retention in retail banking. Some managerial implications of this research find that the interrelationships between the determinants (image, quality, and satisfaction) allow bank managers to better understand the dynamics of customer retention formation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Double marginalization effect refers to the phenomenon that when both upstream and downstream firms have monopolistic power, customers pay higher retail price and firms make less profit than when the supply chain is vertically integrated (Tirole, 1988). Although double marginalization effect has been extensively studied in the context of supply chain management for mature products, very limited attention has been given to innovative products whose demand is generated through word-of-mouth effect. The authors study the pricing decisions in a supply chain that sells innovative products. Using a modified Bass diffusion model to capture demand trajectory over time, the authors identify the optimal way for the retailer and supplier to adjust prices when profit is not discounted, and also provide numerical examples when profit is discounted. The authors show that (1) when profit is not discounted the optimal retail prices are adjusted over time, while the optimal wholesale price should be kept as a constant, and (2) double marginalization effect also exists in an innovative product supply chain, but its degree depends on a number of factors, such as the innovation and imitation coefficients.</p>",

This paper focuses on countries supplying major conventional weapons (MCW), and investigates whether changes in political conditions impact the quantity of MCW supplied to third countries. In particular, it concentrates on democratic exporters and estimates a gravity‐type panel tobit for the years 1975–2004. Results suggest that the exporter's chief executive, being right‐wing, has a positive and significant impact on MCW exports. This may reflect a general right‐wing tendency to support national industry and deregulate heavy industry exports. It is also found that higher concentration of power is associated with lower MCW exports, and that executives which serve the last year of their term and can run for re‐election tend to decrease MCW exports.</jats:p>",

The goal of the automated technical support system is reducing operational cost and increasing customer satisfaction. This paper examines the set of challenges that knowledge engineers face in building automated technical support software. This paper uses a technical services engagement with a major online auction house with tens of millions of users to highlight the challenges and present an automated knowledge map generation technique. The objective of this automated technique was to improve the quality of expressions extracted from documents, which would reduce the burden on knowledge engineers to construct knowledge maps. The technique was run on large corpora of documents in the online auction house and found a significant increase in the quality of the knowledge map. Further experimentation showed that the technique works well for other domains as well.</jats:p>"

The chapter presents a methodology for component based modeling and development of an Information System, starting from the requirements definition phase, arriving at candidate components and creation of final components and their interfaces. The methodology aims at clarifying the intricate details and usage of an Information System via business type models and use-case models. The chapter presents the interaction diagrams in order to describe interactions among objects in systems perspective, and context diagrams for reflecting upon the business domain. Finally, the chapter proposes component replacement as a methodology for system reengineering, and model-view-control framework for component refinement and evolution in order to achieve a reengineered information system that reflects upon current requirements in business domain. The reengineering techniques proposed in this chapter can be applied to legacy systems to turn them into a component-oriented reengineered system.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the role of e-SC/L in the context of global business to business (B2B) electronic commerce (e-commerce). A major beneficiary of e-SC/L are small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who can leverage information technology to bypass the extra cost associated with employing a third-party broker, who traditionally bridges the gap between suppliers and retailers. In this paper, a framework for incorporating both e-commerce and e-SC/L for SMEs is proposed in an e-marketplace context. The model consists of a trading platform with e-SC/L capabilities, and a classification scheme for different levels e-SC/L collaboration, presented with relevant types of information, communication and transportation technology (ICTT) needed to facilitate the design of each collaboration level. Included in the highest level are transportation, identification, and modeling and simulation technologies that enable the design of effective forward-looking collaboration.</jats:p>"

By categorizing customer-perceived risks, and by integrating control measures and assurances into their offer, providers can design new and valuable services. Service value-chains involve various providers (implicitly or otherwise) who may engender annoyance and damages as risks are a sequence of events. This paper holds the potential to contribute to extending an understanding and management capacity of customer-perceived risks of knowledge-based services. It brings into play a new framework and new risk management process. It also helps with formalizing and making tangible customer added-value.</jats:p>"

These companies employ strategies that vary from proactive, reactive, resilient, to no supply chain risk management (SCRM) strategies to mitigate risks and ensure business continuity. When a company's competitive advantage is speed to market, it is only logical that its front-end low-cost country sourcing (LCCS) decision model should include a Disruption Contingency Plan (DCP) as one of the factors for evaluation. In this research, we focus on the company's financial performance with or without the up-front DCP in a closed loop outsourcing decision model, exploring and analyzing its relative effect on the firms' Economic Value Added (EVA). In doing so, we reason, the decision to adopt low-cost outsourcing in foreign countries should not be reached without addressing the company's speed-to-market capability. Using a US company that manufactures industrial printers as an example, various scenarios and options are explored for EVA comparisons in terms of a company's ability to maintain normal sales, and capture competitors' market share during supply chain disruptions. This example links the relevance among the outsourcing decision, the up-front DCP, and the company's EVA during supply chain disruptions. Even when disruption strikes, there is still an opportunity for profitability.</jats:p>",

QTDFS-ALOHA, a hybrid protocol which combines the query tree protocol and the dynamic frame slot ALOHA protocol, is proposed. In each frame of this protocol, only tags in the active set are allowed to answer in randomly selected slots. Afterwards, the population of tags in the active set is estimated. According to the identification accuracy required, the protocol may choose to continue the identification of the active set with delicately calculated frame length, or to divide the active set into multiple subsets using some binary prefix strings and identify each subset subsequently in the following frames. This process is performed recursively for all tag sets until the required accuracy is achieved. Proposed tag population estimation methods are summarized and evaluated. Numeric simulation verifies that this hybrid protocol outperforms other frame slot ALOHA based protocols.</jats:p>"

In this changing business environment, the most successful companies are those that leverage their investment in Web-based technologies by implementing e-business solutions supported by sound existing infrastructures based on well-functioning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Companies must also forge tighter links in the supply chain, from raw materials to customers and have increasingly turned to the Internet and Web-based technologies to do so. This paper presents a framework for understanding e-business opportunities within the context of a traditional enterprise and its infrastructure and examines the evolving relationship between e-business and ERP. These developments are moving businesses toward the concept of e-Supply Chain to achieve true supply chain integration. The issues and challenges faced by organizations in moving to such a complete e-business environment are discussed and suggestions are offered for businesses to navigate this challenging transformation.</jats:p>"

This reduces the total number of vehicle-kilometres required to distribute a given quantity of goods, saving money and reducing environmental impacts. Proposals to legalise longer and heavier vehicles, (LHVs) have, nevertheless, generated intense debate, particularly in Europe where they are strongly resisted by railway and environmental organisations. This chapter reviews recent studies on this subject, presents an analytical framework and focuses on three critical issues: the extent to which loads can be consolidated in LHVs, their effect on the freight modal split and the possibility that the resulting reduction in road freight costs will stimulate additional traffic growth. Most of the recent studies support the development of LHVs, particularly those based on actual experience of their use in countries such as Australia, Sweden and the United States.</jats:p>"

They are often considered as reactive and quite passive in their role vis-à-vis their customers though many possess the critical logistics capabilities required to make distribution operations less damaging to the environment. Developing green logistics service offerings can be one way of greening the whole supply chain, though today there appears to be little demand for these services. In the longer term, however LSPs are likely to benefit from being an environmentally innovative and to apply their environmental knowledge more effectively inside their organisations. This will strengthen their competitive position in a future logistics market in which environmental capabilities become major selection criteria. Many of the innovative systems and practices may not be motivated primarily by a desire to preserve the environment but will, nevertheless, contribute to sustainable development. To make a major commitment to greening client’s supply chain, an LSP will often require a longer-term contract that supports investment in more environmentally friendly technology and business processes.</jats:p>"

Each of these supply chains present unique challenges and issues that need attention. The three main objectives in these studies are to understand the distribution systems as well as cost economics of the supply chains, identify potential conflicts and issues in their distribution system, and to study the effect of macro-environment on the distribution system. Apart from these objectives, these cases are also meant to prepare those venturing into such supply chains to come up with efficient solutions for improving these supply chains.</jats:p>"

Although the de facto standard for describing object-oriented systems is the Unified Modeling Language (UML), many legacy systems have been documented using non-object-oriented structured analysis and design methods. Problems arise in the migration because non-object-oriented documentation is inherently not conducive to the development of object-oriented systems. This chapter presents a set of rules to automate the conversion of systems which were originally modeled using structured techniques to UML. The newly created UML documentation can then be used in developing an object-oriented equivalent system. The UML model may also be used by computer aided software engineering tools to implement a new system. The reengineering rules are tested on an example structured system to demonstrate their viability.</jats:p>"

Because this situation is likely to worsen in the near future and since neither the European Union nor the OECD seem to consider revising their initial approach, this paper will also suggest an alternative approach that could significantly reduce the compliance burden while at the same time limiting the potential for fraud.</jats:p>",

The global market is putting the shipping industry under strong pressure as new trends in logistics seek new opportunities to cut unnecessary costs and players in the supply chain management and in the intermodal transport. For this reason we performed a research on how the intermodal transport can secure efficient transport operations. The emphasis is mainly on setting up the agile port and intermodal transport model, in which all necessary subjects should be involved in a unique supply chain. Thus we analyzed port operators, shipping lines and inland transport operators and the way they eliminate waste processes in their everyday operation procedure. Considering all important dynamic facts in the container and shipping industry and our analyses of the intermodal service through the port of Koper we propose the agile port and inland operations model suitable to improve intermodal service and to secure lean supply chains for containerized cargo. Consequently, we came to the conclusion that some traditional subjects in the traditional supply chain are not needed; while others, like customs authorities and inspection companies should be involved adequately to secure efficient organization of agile services in the ports, on the borders between different countries and at final destinations.\nKEY WORDS: lean supply chains, agile intermodal operations, shipping lines, port operators, inland transport operators\n</jats:p>"

Lean management is one of the key techniques businesses adopt in redesigning their processes. The technique is a vital strategy to increase productivity and effectiveness with respect to the movement of goods. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was utilized to evaluate the performance of work cell, shift, worker’s experience, and kaizen event participation level during a lean enterprise deployment effort at a multinational organization. The significance of the effects of these variables were assessed based on various lean supply chain factors such as First In First Out (FIFO), Setup Wheel System (SWS), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Clip System(CS), and Key Performances Indicators (KPI). The results support the criticality of metrics and their impact in implementing a lean manufacturing process in a global supply chain environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the growing demand on high efficient heat ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, how to improve the efficiency of HVAC system regarding reduces energy consumption of system has become one of the critical issues. Reports indicate that efficiency and availability are heavily dependent upon high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the fault detection and isolation (FDI) system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Finding healthy HVAC source as the reference for health monitoring is the main aim in this area. To dispel this concern a comprehensive transient model of heat ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is developed in this study. The transient model equations can be solved efficiently using MATLAB coding and simulation technique. Our proposed model is validated against real HVAC system regarding different parts of HVAC. The developed model in this study can be used for a pre tuning of control system and put to good use for fault detection and isolation in order to accomplish high-quality health monitoring and result in energy saving. Fan supply consider as faulty device of HVAC system with six fault type. A sensitivity analysis based on evaluated model shows us three features are sensitive to all faults type and three auxiliary features are sensitive to some faults. The magnitude and trait of features are a good potential for automatic fault tolerant system based on machine learning systems</jats:p>"

We constructed the Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) of the Constant Speed Constant Frequency Alternation Current (CSCF-AC) power supply system based on the Priority Dynamic Fault Tree (PDFT). And by adding a new temporal operator BEFORE (BF) to the usual Boolean operators, we derived the structure function of the top event. Then two laws were provided to reduce this structure function to a sum-of-product canonical form, where each product term defined a minimal cut set (MCS) or a minimal cut sequence set (MCSS) of this fault tree. This approach provides a complete qualitative description of the system without resorting to the corresponding Markov model. Then a 3-layer network diagnosis system was designed and realized for the fault diagnosis of aircraft power supply, including onboard layer, ground maintenance layer and remote expert layer. This 3-layer system enhances the flow of complex fault data into higher expert layer to realize the advanced diagnosis.</jats:p>"

It discusses the details of systems development and evolution models mainly aiming at an ongoing reengineering of legacy systems. It proposes few strategies for reengineering of both data oriented model and process oriented models. The legacy systems often miss automatic interfaces to external systems, so the chapter presents a strategy focusing on automatic update of data of the system. Likewise, the chapter also presents a strategy for process reengineering in order to integrate external systems. Finally, a legacy system is envisioned as a comprehensive mix of both data and process oriented, while proposing a gradual ongoing reengineering of both data structures and process methods.</jats:p>"

At an abstract architecture level, this paper identifies important requirements for RFID data provisioning and points of integration. A non-invasive architecture style is proposed to satisfy these requirements. It has the advantages of low entry barriers, low latency, high flexibility, and independent evolvability. The architecture style is used as a basis for evaluating three existing architectures for RFID data provisioning. Various architecture mismatches that could hinder the pace of RFID adoption are identified and discussed. A new asymmetric integration approach is suggested as an alternative to existing methods.</jats:p>"

Az írás első része az irodalomkutatás eredményeit feldolgozva az ellátási láncok kockázati kitettségének növekedése mögött rejlő okokat törekszik feltárni, s röviden bemutatja a vállalati kockázatkezelés lehetséges lépéseit e téren. A cikk második gondolati egysége mélyinterjúk segítségével összefoglalja és rendszerezi a disztribúció kiszervezéséhez kapcsolódó kockázatokat, számba veszi a kapcsolódó kockázatkezelési lehetőségeket, s bemutatja a megkérdezett vállalatok által alkalmazott kockázat-megelőzési alternatívákat. ______ The aim of this paper is to introduce operational risks of supply chains, especially risks deriving from the outsourcing of distribution management. Based on literature review the first part of the paper talks about the potential reasons of increasing global supply chain risks, and the general business activities of risk assessment. Analyzing the results of semi-structured qualitative interviews, the second part summarizes the risks belonging to the outsourcing of distribution and introduces the potential risk assessment and avoidance opportunities and alternatives in practice.</jats:p>",

The findings show that using RFID devices increases supply chain efficiency and improves the security of containerized cargo movements, particularly when E-seals replace common mechanical seals. Before the benefits of E-seals can be realized, several barriers must be addressed. A lack of frequency standards for E-seals is a major problem, hindering their acceptability for global trade. Routine use of E-seals also requires new processes that may slow their acceptance by the shipping industry. Disposable E-seals, which decrease industry concerns about costs and enforcement agency concerns about security by eliminating the need to recycle E-seals, are not common because they must be manufactured in large quantities to be cost effective. Compatibility with existing highway systems could also promote E-seal acceptance, as containers could be tracked on roadways.</jats:p>"

The empirical study investigates the ability of information technology (IT) infrastructure integration and supply chain process integration to moderate the relationships between the importance of the perceived seven adoption attributes and system deployment outcomes, operational efficiency and market knowledge creation in radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled supply chains. Using the online survey method, data was collected from members of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals in North America. The moderated regression procedure suggested by Aguinis (2004) was applied. The three adoption attributes, relative advantage, results, and images turned out to be the most important attributes in these RFID systems. Indeed, both IT infrastructure integration and supply chain process integration moderate the relationships between these three adoption attributes and the RFID system outcomes.</jats:p>"

Technical challenges exist, but the main barriers to recycling pgms lie in ensuring the collection of scrap and in the capacity and technical capabilities of recycling chains around the world. Economic and legislative drivers are also significant. The “seven conditions” for effective recycling and their impact within Europe are discussed in this article; industrial applications are found to lead the way in terms of recycling rates while automotive and particularly electronic areas are currently some way behind. New business models are recommended, to enable precious metal-containing waste to be seen as a valuable resource and ensure the sustainability and security of pgms supply for the future.</jats:italic>\n               </jats:p>",

This paper’s findings show that while the relative importance of physical capital to human capital has dramatically risen, adequate provisions and utilizations of physical facilities for landside operations appear to be a more significant driving force for an airport’s cargo traffic performances compared to those of airside operations. Even though cost savings are found to have regained their importance in the recent years, the degree of scale economies has fallen so sharply that airports can no longer rely on size for competitive edge. Nevertheless, there is still a close positive relationship between a nation’s economic development and the volume of cargo traffic at its airport.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>DNA information has the potential to generate value for each sector of the beef-cattle industry. The value distribution among sectors (breeding, commercial, feedlot, processing) will differ depending on marketing. The more descendants an animal produces, the more valuable each unit of genetic improvement becomes. Therefore, the value of using DNA testing to increase the accuracy of selection and accelerate the rate of genetic gain is highest in the breeding sector, particularly for replacement stud animals. There is a lesser value associated with increasing the accuracy of yearling commercial bulls. The cost to DNA test commercial sires will likely be incurred by breeders before sale, and must be recouped through higher bull sale prices or increased market share. Commercial farmers could also use DNA tests to improve the accuracy of replacement female selection. This assumes the development of DNA tests that perform well for the low-heritability traits that directly affect maternal performance (e.g. days to calving) in commercial cattle populations. DNA tests may provide the sole source of information for traits that are not routinely measured on commercial farms. In that case, DNA test information will provide new selection criteria to allow for genetic improvement in those traits. As DNA test offerings mature to have improved accuracy for traits of great value to the feedlot (e.g. feed conversion, disease resistance) and processing (e.g. meat quality) sectors, the added value derived from DNA-enabled selection for these traits will need to be efficiently transferred up the beef production chain to incentivise continued investment. The widespread adoption of DNA testing to enhance the accuracy of selection will likely require an approach to share the value realised by downstream sectors of the beef-cattle industry with those upstream sectors incurring DNA collection and testing expenses.</jats:p>"

Trends in the supply of pathologists in Canada's managed care system may provide some useful insights in any analysis and projection of future pathologist needs in the United States.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Objective.—In this study, population-based Canadian databases were used to devise a parameter for physician supply, cancer cases per physician. The trend in this supply parameter for pathologists was compared to that for radiation oncologists.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Design.—The number of Canadian pathologists and radiation oncologists and the annual number of new cancer cases in each of 2 years, 1999 and 2009, were extracted from reliable databases. Cancer cases per pathologist and oncologist were calculated, and relative trends in supply of physicians in both specialties were identified.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results.—The annual number of new cancer cases increased from 129 300 to 171 000 from 1999 to 2009. The absolute numbers of both pathologists and oncologists also increased in this time period. However, while the increase in the number of radiation oncologists led to an 8.2% decrease in cancer cases per radiation oncologist, the modest increase in the number of pathologists led to an increase of 17.1% in cancer cases per pathologist.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions.—There is a trend toward a decreasing supply of Canadian pathologists relative to that of cancer demands. This finding confirms an earlier population-based study showing a decreased supply relative to population and number of clinical physicians. It is uncertain whether this decreased supply is a result of appropriate application of new, efficient methods or whether health care has been rationed or adversely impacted. Outcome measures to monitor Canadian pathology practice quality are clearly needed.</jats:p>",

Delivery planning of LNG offers challenging multi-origin vehicle routing problems, with vessels of various capacities and fuel performance. There are also unique challenges due to the nature of LNG trading and shipping. We propose a framework design for this planning problem by considering the multiple objectives and unique characteristics of the problem to develop efficient solutions. We aim to study the planning problems at various levels by using mixed-integer programming solution techniques, heuristics, and meta-heuristics. A critical analysis of the existing literature for similar problems was conducted and the formulations for the LNG delivery problems of Qatar are presented. The LNG inventory and routing problems are fairly complicated problems due to their unique features. The formulations developed are an attempt at solving the large LNG distribution challenges in the case of Qatargas and Rasgas in Qatar.</jats:p>"

A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively close proximity to the area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electrically-assisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified.</jats:p>"

Econometric evidence indicates that immigration policy reforms had unintended consequences for farm labour supply. The long-term trend in migration from rural Mexico to US farms is decreasing, and in recent years, US farms have drawn more labour from remote and less developed areas of rural Mexico. Other high income countries, as well as some developing nations, mirror the US in reliance on foreign agricultural workers. Our analysis questions the sustainability of an agricultural system that depends on foreign sources of labour, and highlights the importance of labour productivity-enhancing technological change.</jats:p>"

This research decomposes the problem and explores it from the perspective of one of these stakeholders, that is, a company seeking to implement RFID in order to achieve specific business objectives. The authors establish a theoretical framework, based on social justice theory in business ethics, that identifies the factors contributing to consumer and societal resistance to an RFID implementation. Within this framework, they outline the technical and managerial elements of an implementation plan, and relate those elements to the underlying components of social justice theory. The result is a strategy for technology managers that 1) considers the complex mix of consumer, societal and governmental concerns hindering adoption of the technologies, and 2) indicates areas of potential compromise.</jats:p>"

The City of Oulu is a remarkable planning and administration centre of ICT branch in Finland. In this study we - instead of using commonly used cluster or resource dependence theories - utilize SCM framework to describe the development and path-dependence of knowledge-intensive geographical area, which is specialized in high tech or actually ICT business. In the context of geographical analysis, or of geographical economics, SCM is less-used viewpoint. This case study shows that SCM, and especially strategic level SC endowment viewpoint (introduced initially in Rusko, Kylänen &amp; Saari, 2009), is valuable and useful tool in analysing the geo-economic development and path-dependence of a high tech centre. As a result, we notice that the development of Oulu is based on the development of SC endowment connected with amounts of talents and also multi-dimensional coopetition. One essential result is the observed erosion in the SC endowment of high tech Oulu, which sets remarkable challenges for city planning.</jats:p>"

This chapter reports a study assessing the “workflow ability” of ERP systems and comparing this with that of Workflow Management Systems.

We find that on average men and women from remittance‐receiving households are less likely to participate in the labour market and supply fewer hours when they do. The negative effect of remittances on labour supply is smaller for women, which is an intriguing result as other studies on remittances and labour supply (primarily focused on Latin America) have shown that female labour supply is more responsive to remittances. The results are robust to using different measures of remittances and inclusion of variables measuring migration of household members. We estimate a joint effect of remittances and an individual's residence in a conflict‐affected area during the Tajik civil war. Remittances had a larger impact on the labour supply of men living in conflict‐affected areas compared to men in less conflict‐affected areas. The impact of remittances on the labour supply of women does not differ by their residence in both the more or less conflict affected area.</jats:p>",

In this study we - instead of using commonly used cluster or resource dependence theories - utilize SCM framework to describe the development and path-dependence of knowledge-intensive geographical area, which is specialized in high tech or actually ICT business. In the context of geographical analysis, or of geographical economics, SCM is less-used viewpoint. This case study shows that SCM, and especially strategic level SC endowment viewpoint (introduced initially in Rusko, Kylänen &amp; Saari, 2009), is valuable and useful tool in analysing the geo-economic development and path-dependence of a high tech centre. As a result, we notice that the development of Oulu is based on the development of SC endowment connected with amounts of talents and also multi-dimensional coopetition. One essential result is the observed erosion in the SC endowment of high tech Oulu, which sets remarkable challenges for city planning.</jats:p>"

Web services are gaining significance due to inherent features like interoperability, simple implementation, and exploiting the boom in Internet infrastructure.

A manufacturer faces the trade‐off between investing in unreliable but high‐margin offshore supply and in reliable but low‐margin local supply, where the latter allows for production that is responsively contingent on the actual demand and offshore supply conditions. Cost thresholds for both types of supply determine the optimal resource allocation: single offshore sourcing, single responsive sourcing, or dual sourcing. Relying on the concept of concordance orders, we study the effects of correlation between supply and demand uncertainty. Adding offshore supply to the sourcing portfolio becomes more favorable under positive correlation, since offshore supply is likely to satisfy demand when needed. Selecting responsive capacity under correlated supply and demand uncertainty is not as straightforward, yet we establish the managerially relevant conditions under which responsive capacity either gains or loses in importance. Our key results are extended to the broad class of endogenous supply uncertainty developed by Dada et al.

The design of experiment (DOE) approach has been employed. DOE is important as a formal way of maximizing information gained by available resources. It has more to offer than &amp;ldquo;one change at a time&amp;rdquo; experimental methods because it allows a judgment on the significance to the output of input variables acting alone, as well as input variables acting in combination with one another. Using the results of the simulations, a regression analysis has been performed, providing multi-dimensional response surfaces expressing the dependency of throughput and demurrage days on the independent variables considered.

When the lowest-lying lakes flood, the water crosses the grounding line and enters the sub-ice-shelf cavity. Modeling results suggest that this additional freshwater influx may significantly enhance melting at the ice-shelf base. We examine the spatial and temporal variability in subglacial water supply to the grounding lines of the Siple Coast ice streams, by combining estimates for lake volume change derived from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data with a model for subglacial water transport. Our results suggest that subglacial outflow tends to concentrate towards six embayments in the Siple Coast grounding line. Although mean grounding line outflow is ~60m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> for the entire Siple Coast, maximum local grounding line outflow may temporarily exceed 300 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> during the synchronized flooding of multiple lakes in a hydrologic basin. Variability in subglacial outflow due to subglacial lake drainage may account for a substantial portion of the observed variability in freshwater flux out of the Ross Ice Shelf cavity. The temporal variability in grounding line outflow results in a net reduction in long-term average melt rate, but temporary peak melting rates may exceed the long-term average by a factor of three.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Normally for an average to good catchment, ratio of command area to catchment of an irrigation project varies from 0.3 to 0.5. But in case of Salandi Irrigation project, the first major irrigation project of Orissa commissioned during 1967, the ratio exceeds unity, i.e., 1.276, which is extraordinary. The theoretical crop water requirement considering the cropping practice in vogue over the command and adopting the parameters considered in the project report works out to 0.858m in Kharif and 1.296m in Rabi. But, it is found that in practice the actual water supplied in the distribution system for the period from1985-86 to 2005-06 during Kharif and Rabi is 0.283m and 0.929m, respectively. This less quantity of water supply for irrigation in the command than the theoretical requirement has not affected the crop yield but has made the agriculture successful. Various aspects of the Project such as the geophysical features of the catchment, hydro-geological formation of the command, soil characteristics, percolation rate through the top soil, amount of rainfall and its distribution, cropping pattern in the command and unusual phenomenon of irrigation practice in the Salandi irrigation command and probable reason for success of this project in providing irrigation over the years with much less quantum of water has been analyzed and presented in this paper.</jats:p>",

During the vegetative and generative\n   plant growth phases, besides genetic potential many factors affect their\n   productivity. The aim was to investigate genome expression dependent on\n   nitrogen nutrition and light interception. Nitrogen in correlation with light\n   availability has important effect on the growth of plants and the formation\n   of leaf area, what it is necessary for yield of dry matter. Investigation has\n   been done in open field grown leek commercial hybrid Alita (Allium porrum\n   L.,) to consider the way of its genotype response to correlation of light\n   interception and nitrogen nutrition. Investigated traits are leek crop\n   productivity, light interception and chemical analyses of plants. Leek crop\n   productivity was determined through the dry matter production, leaf area\n   development and light interception. Analyses of leek plants comprehended\n   chemical determination and calculation of total nitrogen concentration,\n   nitrogen critical concentration in dry matter, nitrogen demand and, nitrogen\n   uptake in leek crop. Correlation among investigated parameters was assigned\n   to comprehensive hypothetical model of growth and productivity of leek crop\n   grown at open field.It was shown that for nitrogen uptake (Nu), nitrogen\n   demand (ND) and total nitrogen concentration (Nt) parameters variants of\n   mineral nutrition plays significant role (pNu=0.002; pND=0.045; pNt=0.011).\n   Obtained results indicated that correlation of nitrogen and light\n   interception could be used as criteria in plant breeding.</jats:p>"

At the beginning of the game, the manufacturer makes efforts on advertising and then the retailer decides its order quantity before demand realization. The retailer's risk aversion is modeled by the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach with the downside risk constraint. The analysis of equilibrium strategies indicates some characteristics of the game are different from those under risk-neutral assumptions. We find that the manufacturer can effectively prevent the risk-averse retailer from downsizing the order quantity through advertising. In order to explain the difference, we investigate the impacts of risk aversion on the manufacturer's advertising decision and the retailer's ordering decision. We find that the retailer with moderate degree of risk aversion orders a larger volume and receives greater advertising support from the manufacturer. Moreover, the feasible combinations of target profit and downside risk for moderate risk aversion are discussed to derive the relationship of the two parameters. In addition, we make a simple analysis of the situation with two independent retailers who have heterogeneous degrees of risk aversion.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, many logistics service companies had failed to use ICT to gain competitive advantage as the implementation of technology innovation is a challenging and risky process involving huge resources. In the context of small 3PLs, technology adoption is particularly critical and ICT investments need to be carefully planned. The objective of this chapter is to investigate ICT adoption in small 3PLs through a case study analysis conducted in the Italian logistics service market. The role of technology in supporting service customization together with inhibitors and enabling factors influencing technology innovation are explored.

Without sensor technologies, these disruptions are often not detectable in early stages of the supply chains. As a result, losses accumulate at the end of supply chains where a lot of energy as already invested for delivering these goods up to this point. This chapter shows how sensor technologies can enable a new way of data-driven decision making at the distribution stage of a supply chain. It demonstrates when and how sensors can be used for smart removal and sorting decisions. The results indicate that these decisions can reduce the environmental impact and even increase profits significantly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Motivated by the mixed evidence concerning the adoption level and value of collaborative forecasting (CF) implementations in retail supply chains, in this paper, we explore the conditions under which CF offers the highest potential. We consider a two-stage supply chain with a single supplier selling its product to consumers through a single retailer. We assume that both the supplier and the retailer can improve the quality of their demand forecasts by making costly forecasting investments to gather and analyze information. First, we consider a noncollaborative model where the supplier and the retailer can invest in forecasting but do not share forecast information. Next, we examine a collaborative forecasting model where the supplier and the retailer combine their information to form a single shared demand forecast. We investigate the value of CF by comparing each party's profits in these scenarios under three contractual forms that are widely used in practice (two variations of the simple wholesale price contract as well as the buyback contract). We show that for a given set of parameters, CF may be Pareto improving for none to all three of the contractual structures, and that the Pareto regions under all three contractual structures can be expressed with a unifying expression that admits an intuitive interpretation. We observe that these regions are limited and explain how they are shaped by the contractual structure, power balance, and relative forecasting capability of the parties. To determine the specific value of collaborative forecasting as a function of different factors, we carry out a numerical analysis and observe the following. First, under noncoordinating contracts, improved information as a result of CF has the added benefit of countering the adverse effects of double marginalization in addition to reducing the cost of supply–demand mismatch. Second, one may expect the value of CF to increase with bargaining power, however this does not hold in general: The value of CF for the newsvendor first increases and then decreases in his bargaining power. Finally, whereas one may expect CF to be more valuable under coordinating contracts, rather than a simple wholesale price contract that is prone to double marginalization, the magnitude of the gain from CF is in many cases higher in the absence of quantity coordination. </jats:p>",

Using a questionnaire study, we assess collaborative planning and its antecedents in supply chain relationships, incorporating the forestry and timber industry. While no interactive effects hold for task interdependence, outcome interdependence only facilitates collaborative planning for individuals with low work autonomy. Individuals with high autonomy always invest in collaborative planning. This study provides a picture of supply chain reality more complete than that sketched in studies that have assessed interdependence as a one-dimensional construct and alludes to the importance, often overlooked, of work autonomy in supply chain relationships.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this chapter, the authors introduce the concept of preferred customer status as a means for creating supply-side induced advantages in highly competitive supplier markets. For the authors, being a preferred customer means that a buyer is awarded preferential treatment of important suppliers compared to what their other customers receive. Taking this into account, having Preferred Customer Status might also have a positive impact on the generation of innovation upstream the supply chain. As there is a lack of knowledge of what motivates suppliers to serve selected buyers better than others, the research presented here focuses on the suppliers’ evaluation of customers and how it can be influenced by buyers. Based on an extensive literature review, an overview is provided of recent contributions on customer attractiveness and supplier satisfaction as the prerequisites for becoming a preferred customer of strategic suppliers. Furthermore, the authors stress the importance of being a preferred customer particularly in a new product development context by empirically testing the impact of preferred customer status on supplier innovativeness in a buyer-seller relationship. They conclude that implementing a preferred customer policy in buying firms can improve the conditions for innovating with suppliers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>By using a case study example and focusing on the implementation phase, this chapter presents and emphasises the validity of specific risk management model. Briefly, an overview of another two ERP projects risk management’s models will be provided; the first model deals with ERP as technology where risks are managed in accordance to Information Technology and Information System (IT &amp; IS) projects governance. The second model considers the integrated and interdisciplinary nature of ERP systems and introduces the term “ERP Governance” as a model that demands balance between IT and business governance. The third model, while similar to the second, relies heavily on best-practises and assessment frameworks from the industry. Throughout this chapter, the author explores this model, its importance, and application in contexts similar in nature to those found in the hierarchically structured intergovernmental organizations. Finally, the author concludes that embedding risk management best practices into the organization culture and business processes can positively influence the success of ERP system implementation. In other words, earlier adoption of risk management best practices for ERP system implementation will help both business &amp; projects to meet their intended objectives and thus positively influence the success of ERP projects by ensuring that prescribed goals are met.</jats:p>"

Pertaining to that, the offshore and marine industry is one of the many industries that have seldom received much consideration when it comes to management of the supply chain system. The rig building facet of the offshore and marine industry was thus chosen as the main focus of the project to manage the risks that arise in a particular oil rig building project. A risk mitigation plan framework was proposed to act as a guideline to identify as much risk as possible, eliminate trivial ones, and subsequently, prioritizing the remaining ones. The final step involves the formulation of a mathematical model based on the selected risk. In this case, the risk of raw material price fluctuation is studied. The demonstration of the Monte Carlo simulation using the Risk Solver program was also done to quantify the risks. Two case scenarios were then developed along with the implementation of risk management techniques in order to observe the effectiveness of the risk management of the overall rig building supply chain. </jats:p>",

In computer simulations, production facilities and planning processes are modeled in order to correctly characterize the supply chain behavior. However, very little attention has been given so far in these models to human decisions. Because human decisions are very complex and may vary across individuals or with time, they are largely neglected in traditional simulation models. This restricts the models’ reliability and utility. The first thing that must be done in order to include human decisions in simulation models is to capture how people actually make decisions. This chapter presents a serious game called DecisionTack, which was specifically developed to capture the human decision-making process in operations management (the procurement process). It captures both the information the human agent consults and the decisions he or she makes.</jats:p>"

Severe water shortages and extremely fragile ecological conditions necessitate careful attention to water resources management. The aim of this study is to analyze Rheraya’s future water situation under different scenarios of socio-economic development and climate change until 2100. The Water Evaluation and Planning System model (WEAP) has been applied to estimate the current water demands and the increased water demands resulting from climate change. WEAP was calibrated using meteorological and demand observations, then, updated with present-day and future climatic conditions using the Statistical Down-scaling Model with two projections (A2, B2) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Those projections show an increase in temperature of about 2–3 °C and a reduction in precipitation of 40–60% with respect to baseline. The results show that the pressure on Rheraya’s water resources will increase, leading to greater competition for surface water, and that domestic, tourist, livestock and agricultural demands will not be met by the year 2100. The Results also demonstrate that the assessments of adaptation strategies proposed by decision makers are effective but not sustainable for the watershed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The globalization of markets and geographic dispersion of production facilities, combined with a heavy outsourcing of supply chain processes, have substantially increased the exposure of supply chains to supply lead‐times of long and uncertain nature. In this paper, we study the potential use of two contingency strategies on top of the conventionally used time buffer—statically planned safety lead‐time (SL)—approach to deal with the lead‐time uncertainty. These are (1) the ex‐ante planning for disruption safety stock (DSS) to be released when a “disruption” (in this case, late delivery of the order) occurs; and (2) the ex‐post dynamic emergency response (DER), which dynamically decides on the timing and size of an emergency order to be placed. Our work elaborates on the optimal parameter setting for these strategies, compares their added values when used to complement the traditional SL approach, and examines how the use of the contingency strategies affects the SL and corresponding cycle length of a periodic review system. Our research finds that: (1) the above contingency strategies reduce the reliance on the SL and are cost effective when the coefficient of variation (CV) of the uncertain lead‐time is high; (2) it is important to re‐optimize the SL to account for the contingency plans; and (3) re‐optimization of the cycle length to account for the presence of the contingency responses, as opposed to using an EOQ‐determined cycle length, does not significantly improve the cost performance. However, such re‐optimization does well in the SL approach when the CV of the uncertain lead‐time is high. </jats:p>",

This is despite emphasis on the need to involve all actors in the supply chain in order to best achieve the aims of EPR. In this paper, we examine the economic and environmental implications of product recovery mandates and shared responsibility within a supply chain. We use a two‐echelon model consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer to determine the impacts of product collection and recycling mandates on the incentive to recycle and resulting profits in the integrated and decentralized supply chains. For the decentralized supply chain, we demonstrate how the sharing of responsibility for product recovery between the echelons can improve total supply chain profit and suggest a contract menu that can Pareto‐improve profits. To examine both the economic and environmental performance associated with responsibility sharing, we propose a social welfare construct that includes supply chain profit, consumer surplus, and the externalities associated with virgin material extraction, product consumption, and disposal of nonrecycled products. Using a numerical example, we discuss how responsibility sharing may or may not improve social welfare. The results of this paper are of value to firms either anticipating or subject to product recovery legislation, and to social planners that attempt to balance economic and environmental impacts and ensure fairness of such legislation. </jats:p>",

It provides a model of different levels of customer centric information use in organizations. The authors review implications for future research in this emerging area and conclude that the challenges of ICT deployment and use must be addressed with an uncompromising focus on customer value as the central principle of both ICT design and deployment, and of information management in service organizations.</jats:p>"

This fact leads us to the development of optimized solar panel and all circuits for reliable power supply of wireless sensors. A special charging circuit for Li-ION battery and DC-DC adapter circuit for stabilization of wireless sensor working voltage were developed and optimized for very low energy consumption and high efficiency.</jats:p>"

Subsequently, the results obtained will serve to propose a forecasting model enabling to calculate the potential variability of orders placed by each echelon on the basis of the price pattern used. Finally, under the hypothesis of an environment of collaboration between the different members of the chain, we propose a predictive model that makes it possible to quantify the distortion of the orders generated by each level.\nKEYWORDS: Bullwhip effect, systems dynamics, price fluctuation, supply chain management\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drinking water distribution system takes a significant place in sustainable urban development. In order to solve some environmental issues it is necessary to improve the maintenance of the environmental impact of chemical compounds which can come in contact with water. The aim of the research is to complete the analysis of the sustainable development of drinking water pipelines in Lithuania as well as to structure the chemical content of pipelines for further increase of supplied water quality and simplification of maintenance. Analytical and descriptive methods were used in the research process. The investigation included 150 samples that were obtained in different water stagnation times in lab-scaled pipelines. During the research the following indicators were set: total iron, manganese, ammonium ions, nitrate and nitrite concentrations, turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr). To ensure sustainability of drinking water distribution system in the end of this research the appliance of a certain model of actions was considered. This model says that material of potable water network must be chosen depending on water chemical indicators, water reaction with pipeline material and scale formation causes. Consequently, to reduce a negative effect of chemical processes on the drinking water supply measures of sustainable ecological development have to be taken. Santrauka Geriamojo vandens tiekimo sistema yra labai svarbus darnios miesto plėtros objektas. Siekiant išspręsti tam tikras aplinkosaugos problemas, būtina padidinti cheminių junginių, kurie gali kontaktuoti su vandeniu, kontrolę, taip užtikrinant tinkamą poveikio aplinkai priežiūrą. Šio mokslinio tyrimo tikslas – atlikti geriamojo vandens vamzdyno Lietuvoje analizę darnaus vystymosi aspektu, struktūrizuoti cheminę vamzdynų sudėtį, siekiant pagerinti tiekiamo vandens kokybę ir supaprastinti tolesnę vandentiekio vamzdynų priežiūrą. Mokslinio darbo metu buvo taikomi analitiniai ir eksperimentiniai tyrimo metodai. Buvo ištirta 150 mėginių, paimtų iš laboratorijoje sukonstruoto vamzdyno. Mėginiai tirti atsižvelgiant į vandens išbuvimo vamzdyne trukmę. Tyrimo metu buvo nustatomi šie cheminiai indikatoriai: bendroji geležis, mangano koncentracija, amonio jonų kiekis, nitritų ir nitratų koncentracijos, drumstumas ir cheminis deguonies suvartojimas (ChDSCr). Siekiant užtikrinti geriamojo vandens tiekimo sistemos tvarumą, tyrimo pabaigoje buvo pasiūlytas tam tikras veiksmų modelis. Jis rodo, kad vandentiekio vamzdynų medžiaga turi būti parinkta pagal tiekiamo vandens cheminius indikatorius, vandens sąveikos su vamzdyno medžiaga ir nuosėdų formavimosi priežastis. Todėl būtina imtis darnaus vystymo priemonių, mažinant neigiamą cheminių procesų įtaką tiekiamo vandens kokybei.</jats:p>",

Its development is an important symbol of a country’s modernization and national strength. It also works as an accelerator in economic development. At the initial stage of transforming traditional logistics service to a modern logistics service in China, logistics enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems including an imbalanced supply and demand, distempered industrial structure, faultiness of serving process and backwardness of logistics technology since 2005.Compared with developed countries, there is a great gap between Chinese logistics enterprises and advanced countries’ in the aspects of service concepts, model, and content and techniques. Therefore, based on the service innovation driving model theory, the authors analyze the integrated innovation model of logistics enterprises, logistics technology and network model, and the value-added service model. The authors select Shenzhen China Overseas Logistics Co. LTD (COL) as the empirical object to analyze its operation of technology and non-technology innovation and summarize its inner and outer driving force on promoting service innovation.</jats:p>"

We also tested the effects of fire severity and distance from unburned edges on the density and composition of the seed bank and the immediate off-site seed rain. Our results showed that although seed density did not differ between them, their composition was markedly different. The soil seed bank was dominated by species from the Fabaceae family with limited dispersal mechanisms such as autochory and barochory, whereas the seed rain was mainly composed of species from the Asteraceae family with wind-dispersed seeds. These patterns were not affected either by fire severity or distance from the fire edge. The main conclusion of the study is that both the soil seed bank and the seed rain play an important role in providing seeds for immediate regeneration after a large wildfire throughout the burned area. We suggest that the role of seed rain on immediate post-fire recovery of Mediterranean plant communities might be more important than has previously been thought. However, the effective role of this group of species on the longer term should be evaluated.</jats:p>"

However, there is diverse perception of research in supply chain risk because these researchers have approached this area from different domains. This paper presents our study of this diversity from the perspectives of operations and supply chain management scholars: First, we reviewed the researchers' output, i.e., the recent research literature. Next, we surveyed two focus groups (members of Supply Chain Thought Leaders and International SCRM groups) with open‐ended questions. Finally, we surveyed operations and supply chain management researchers during the 2009 INFORMS meeting in San Diego. Our findings characterize the diversity in terms of three “gaps”: a definition gap in how researchers define SCRM, a process gap in terms of inadequate coverage of response to risk incidents, and a methodology gap in terms of inadequate use of empirical methods. We also list ways to close these gaps as suggested by the researchers. </jats:p>",

The study argues that even though greater economic wealth may encourage people to buy legal software instead of using pirated software, the ease of access to pirated copies in the open market as a result of corruption can have a stronger influence on the decision to use pirated software. The empirical results also reveal that while an increase in economic wealth can reduce software piracy, its effect tends to be moderated by the level of corruption in a country. These results indicate that a pricing strategy that makes software more affordable is not a sufficient policy for combating software piracy. Additional policies aimed at combating corruption should be implemented concomitantly for effective resolution of this problem.</p>",

It comprises operation links to represent business activities including manufacturing/remanufacturing activities, treatment activities for EOL products, transportation activities, and storage activities, which are performed by the firms. Among all closed‐loop supply chain problems, the horizontal merger of oligopolistic firms is so important and attracting to both businessman and researchers. In this paper, the interaction of the competitive firms prior to horizontal merger is analyzed. Three networks including prior to horizontal merger, postpartial merger, and complete merger are studied. Simultaneously, three economical models for these networks on different conditions of mergers are established and discussed. The variational inequality formulations are used for these three models, whose solutions give out the production quantity of new products, and remanufactured products, the product flows for new products, remanufactured products and end‐of‐life products at every path, the demand quantity, the recovery quantity of end‐of‐life products and the equilibrium prices. Finally, numerical examples are tested and illustrated for the proposed models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Today, the food sector is one of the sectors most vulnerable to intentional contamination by debilitating agents [ 1 ]. Some cases of contaminated food have indicated that product quality risk is one of the vulnerabilities in the global supply chain. A series of company scandals, affecting reputation and causing the recall of products and increasing costs have hit the food industry. The obvious problem is that even a minor incident in one part of the chain can have disastrous effects on other parts of the supply chain. Thus, risks are transmitted through the chain. Even though the dangers from members in the supply chain are small, the cumulative effect becomes significant. The aim of this study is to propose an integrated supply chain risk management framework for practitioners that can provide directions for how to evaluate food quality risk in the global supply chain. For validating the proposed model in-depth, a case study is conducted on a food SME distributor in Central America. The case study investigates how product quality risks are handled according to the proposed framework. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The wood supply chains encompass a multitude of agents with independent business processes and information systems. The network of interrelationships and information flows among the agents is often neglected when designing information systems. Common processes and automatic data exchanges can enhance collaboration as well as improve IT alignment with business needs across multiple organizations in the supply chain. This article proposes an Enterprise Architecture methodological approach for designing an integrated modular Wood Supply Management System. Both Process Architecture Framework and Information Architecture were developed and used to define individual systems and integration requirements, discussed on the Applications Architecture. The Technological Architecture was further addressed. Results of its application to the Portuguese pulpwood, biomass and lumber-based supply chains are presented. Results show that this approach can effectively specify individual systems requirements driven from the processes descriptions built in collaboration with the agents. It further shows that a Service-Oriented Architecture can be derived, ensuring systems integration and interoperability.</jats:p>"

The rapid change in engineering software, especially for the Aerospace industry, highlights the importance of software management. Negligence of any maintenance component can put the organization into risk. Therefore, standardizing processes are necessary to avoid not only these risks, but also minimize costs and ensure employee productivity. Currently, an Aerospace company upgrades most of their engineering software on an ad-hoc basis. This means that an upgrade is only done when an end-user requests it. The study will therefore examine the current operations and offer a strategic reengineered process. The objective of such changes is to ultimately streamline the distribution of engineering software upgrades proactively throughout the organization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Product quality and product warranty coverage are two important and closely related operational decisions. A longer warranty protection period can boost sales, but it may also result in dramatically increased warranty cost, if product quality is poor. To investigate how these two decisions interact with each other and influence supply chain performance, we develop a single‐period model with a supplier that provides a product to an original equipment manufacturer, which in turn sells it to customers. Customer demand is random and affected by the length of the product warranty period. Warranty costs are incurred by both the supplier and the manufacturer. We analyze two different scenarios based on which party sets the warranty period: manufacturer warranty and supplier warranty. Product quality is controlled by the supplier, and the manufacturer determines the ordering quantity. We analyze these decentralized systems and provide the structural properties of the equilibrium strategies. We also compare the results of centralized and decentralized systems and identify the conditions under which one system provides a longer warranty and better product quality than the other. Our numerical study further shows that, in decentralized settings, when the warranty period is determined by the firm sharing the larger proportion of total warranty costs, the supply chain can achieve greater system‐wide profit. Both parties can therefore benefit from properly delegating the warranty decision and sharing the resulting additional profit. We further design a supplier‐development and buy‐back contract for coordinating decentralized supply chains. Several extensions are also discussed. </jats:p>",

However, water resource pressures put existing abstractions at risk and often require complex analysis to support new source development. Thames Water develops and uses regional groundwater models for such analysis to support communication with stakeholders such as the Environment Agency, the environmental regulator of England and Wales. Using two case studies, the importance of regional models as Thames Water assets is demonstrated. While Thames Water has developed regional models as a context for sub-catchment scale analysis of groundwater source development, they are subsequently used to address other issues. As a result, the models are updated regularly, enhancing both conceptual understanding and calibration. These models cost less than 1% of the capital cost of new water source schemes. However, as they are enhanced and applied more widely, the models accrue further value as active decision support tools. Regional model usage to investigate a range of local systems and interactions is of particular value to Thames Water. In this regard, it is important to appreciate and promote the clarity and consistency generated when stakeholder-specific issues can be analysed within an agreed regional model framework.</jats:p>",

Through the analysis of mortality profiles, this paper argues that the sheep and goats consumed by the residents of Yinxu were mostly juvenile individuals, matching the slaughter profile for sheep and goat husbandry aimed at meat consumption. The sources of the sheep and goats slaughtered for consumption were mainly from outside supplies. The sheep and goats in the animal victims were also mainly juvenile individuals, reflecting the funeral rituals of“ serving the dead as they were alive”.</jats:p>",

At any point of time, the facilities are subject to various types of disruptions caused by natural disasters, man‐made defections, and equipment breakdowns. We formulate the problem as a mixed‐integer nonlinear program which maximizes the total profit for the whole system. The model simultaneously determines the number and location of facilities, the subset of customers to serve, the assignment of customers to facilities, and the cycle‐order quantities at facilities. In order to obtain near‐optimal solutions with reasonable computational requirements for large problem instances, two solution methods based on Lagrangian relaxation and genetic algorithm are developed. The effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches is shown using numerical experiments. The computational results, in addition, demonstrate that the benefits of considering disruptions in the supply chain design model can be significant.</jats:p>",

To better understand how nutrient signals are integrated into root developmental programs, we investigated the morphological response of Arabidopsis thaliana roots to iron (Fe). Relative to a homogeneous supply, localized Fe supply in horizontally separated agar plates doubled lateral root length without having a differential effect on lateral root number. In the Fe uptake-defective mutant iron-regulated transporter1 (irt1), lateral root development was severely repressed, but a requirement for IRT1 could be circumvented by Fe application to shoots, indicating that symplastic Fe triggered the local elongation of lateral roots. The Fe-stimulated emergence of lateral root primordia and root cell elongation depended on the rootward auxin stream and was accompanied by a higher activity of the auxin reporter DR5-β-glucuronidase in lateral root apices. A crucial role of the auxin transporter AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1) in Fe-triggered lateral root elongation was indicated by Fe-responsive AUX1 promoter activities in lateral root apices and by the failure of the aux1-T mutant to elongate lateral roots into Fe-enriched agar patches. We conclude that a local symplastic Fe gradient in lateral roots upregulates AUX1 to accumulate auxin in lateral root apices as a prerequisite for lateral root elongation.</jats:p>",

A peak geologist strength (about 20) was achieved in the 1980s, to provide expertise that included hydrogeology. Roles in these Cold War years were confined to Germany, but included guidance to ensure that potable water would be available both to the civilian population and armed forces during a state of emergency, and the optimum siting of boreholes to supply water to military installations. In 1993,\n            <jats:italic>Bundeswehr</jats:italic>\n            troops deployed overseas, to support United Nations (UN) peace-keeping operations in Somalia. Military geological expertise was used to site wells that enhanced secure water supplies for German and other UN personnel, and the civilian population. In 1999,\n            <jats:italic>Bundeswehr</jats:italic>\n            troops were among those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) deployed to Kosovo. Wells to supply water to German troops in Albania and Yugoslavian Macedonia prior to deployment, and in Kosovo itself, were drilled under civilian contract but military geologist guidance. From 2002,\n            <jats:italic>Bundeswehr</jats:italic>\n            troops joined coalition forces in Afghanistan. Well drilling was again guided by military geologist expertise, but contract drilling proved inadequate, so was supplemented by rigs operated by military engineers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the impact of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) on healthcare-product supply chains. The supply chain we study consists of a profit-maximizing manufacturer with a quantity-discount schedule that is nonincreasing in quantity and ensures nondecreasing revenue, a profit-maximizing GPO, a competitive source selling at a fixed unit price, and n providers (e.g., hospitals) with fixed demands for a single product. Each provider seeks to minimize its total purchasing cost (i.e., the cost of the goods plus the provider's own fixed transaction cost). Buying through the GPO offers providers possible cost reductions but may involve a membership fee. Selling through the GPO offers the manufacturer possibly higher volumes, but requires that the manufacturer pay the GPO a contract administration fee (CAF), i.e., a percentage of all revenue contracted through it. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine questions about this supply chain, including how the presence of a GPO affects the providers' total purchasing costs. We also address the controversy about whether Congress should amend the Social Security Act, which, under current law, permits CAFs. Among other things, we conclude that although CAFs affect the distribution of profits between manufacturers and GPOs, they do not affect the providers' total purchasing costs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Seine watershed has long been the food-supplying hinterland of Paris, providing most of the animal and vegetal protein consumed in the city. Nowadays, the shift from manure-based to synthetic nitrogen fertilisation, has made possible a strong land specialisation of agriculture in the Seine watershed: it still provides most of the cereal consumed by the Paris agglomeration, but exports 80% of its huge cereal production. On the other hand the meat and milk supply originates mainly from regions in the North and West of France, specialised in animal farming and importing about 30% of their feed from South America. As it works today, this system is responsible for a severe nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater resources. Herein two scenarios of re-localising Paris's food supply are explored, based on organic farming and local provision of animal feed. We show that for the Seine watershed it is technically possible to design an agricultural system able to provide all the plant- and animal-based food required by the population, to deliver sub-root water meeting the drinking water standards and still to export a significant proportion of its production to areas less suitable for cereal cultivation. Decreasing the share of animal products in the human diet has a strong impact on the nitrogen imprint of urban food supply.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, in the case of supply chains more than one business unit may need to be modelled as different organisations may be responsible for various supply chain operations such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, distribution, warehouse operations, etc. Organisations can be protective about their internal processes and can have concerns regarding data/information security and privacy. Thus it could be argued that creating a single<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DES</jats:styled-content>supply chain model representing the various inter‐organisational processes is usually not an option since this will run counter to organisational privacy. Further, issues such as data transfer, model composability and execution speed may also make a single model approach problematic. A potential solution could be to create several distinct and well‐defined<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DES</jats:styled-content>models, each modelling the processes associated with one specific supply chain business unit, linked together over the internet.

Focusing on competition between two supply chains, it is considered that each customer as an independent player selects products of these chains based on random utility model. Similar to quantal response equilibrium approach, we take account of customer rationality as an exogenous parameter. Moreover, it is assumed that decision makers in a supply chain can perceive an estimation of rival strategies about price and service level formulated in the model by fuzzy strategies. In the competition model, chain’s decision makers consider a subjective probability for wining each customer which is formulated by coupled constraints. These constraints connect chains strategies regarding to each customer and yield a generalized Nash equilibrium problem. Since price cutting and increasing service level are main responses to rival supply chain, after calculating optimal strategies, we show that more efficient responses depend on customer preferences.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce within the Australian pharmaceutical supply chain can potentially assist in setting up an infrastructure which supports complex, multiparty Internet-based trading and transactions among pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, medical supply importers and exporters, and other players in the healthcare system. Effective use of B2B e-commerce can help these organizations reduce costs in supplying and distributing medicines and other medical-related products to the general public. However, despite high expectations for realizing the benefits of B2B e-commerce in the pharmaceutical supply chain, issues surrounding its evaluation and management remain poorly understood and relatively under-researched. This chapter presents case study findings on key management and evaluation issues and challenges in adopting and utilizing B2B e-commerce systems on eight pharmaceutical organizations in Australia. The key objectives of this study are: (1) to establish current practices and norms in evaluating B2B e-commerce investments and projects in the pharmaceutical industry; and (2) to identify key B2B e-commerce management issues and challenges within the Australian pharmaceutical supply chain. A key contribution of this chapter is the identification and examination of key issues and challenges faced by the pharmaceutical organizations undertaking B2B e-commerce activities within their supply chain. The findings will guide senior executives in these organizations to develop their own approaches or strategies to manage the opportunities and threats that exist in the Australian pharmaceutical supply chain.</jats:p>"

We present the design, key specifications, performance and the hardware of this new beamline which receives an intense and highly collimated x-ray beam generated by an in-vacuum undulator. With the simple optics (a double-crystal monochromator, harmonic rejection mirrors and slits), a high purity beam of low energy-bandpass X-rays optimised at 15 keV is delivered at the sample. The heavy duty diffraction instrument is designed to have the flexibility to house a variety of sample environments and holds two detection systems to collect high quality diffraction data, i.e. multi-analysing crystals (MAC) for high angular resolution experiments and a fast position sensitive detector (PSD) for time-resolved studies. A recent addition to the beamline capabilities is the installation of a specifically designed gas control system. This allows the in-situ dosing of a powder sample with gases such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, at low (~10 mbar) and high pressures (&lt;100 bar). In addition a low pressure capillary sample cell is described which is now available to users of the beamline.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Even though numerous articles and real life cases have highlighted the benefits of radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking for supply chain management for almost a decade, companies are rather slow to implement the technology. This paper concentrates on researching the reasons for the slow adoption of RFID tracking in the supply chain management using literature review and multiple case studies as the research methodology. The literature review of the articles classifies different challenges for RFID tracking implementation and elicits the academic explanations for the slow acceptance of the technology. The conclusion of the literature review is that most of the published articles have been concentrating on presenting technological obstacles to RFID tracking implementation, while the problems nowadays are increasingly organizational or inter-organizational. Also companies usually settle for using RFID tracking to improve their operational processes instead of exploiting the full potential in the technology and the increased visibility for improving managerial processes of the company, or upgrading the efficiency of the whole supply chain. In addition to the literature review, five RFID tracking case surveys are presented to provide experience and insights into managerial decisions concerning supply chain-wide RFID tracking solutions. Followed by the literature review and case studies, this paper presents a framework, which suggests three levels, where different potential challenges to supply chain-wide RFID tracking system implementations should be handled: the supply chain, inside a company or inside a certain function. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering is a concept that is applicable to all industries, particularly information and communication technology (ICT) projects regardless of organizational type, size, culture, or location. The enterprise resource planning (ERP) system frequently requires organizations to change their existing business processes to harmonize them its functional activities. 72% of the ERP implementation failures reported worldwide (Eric, 2010) because of the various critical success factors (CSFs). A Critical Success Factor (CSF) is defined as a factor needed to implement ERP system successfully. Assessing the importance of CSFs of Enterprise Resource Planning systems has always remained an important concern for academicians and researchers. This study explores and assesses the CSFs affecting the ERP implementation success. Long term Top management Support (LTS), Perceived ERP benefits (PEB), ERP in-house Training (EIT), Project Tracking (PTG), Visible Project Phases (VPP), Project Phase Update (PPU), Interdepartmental Cooperation (IDP), Strategic IT planning (STP), ERP vendor Support (EVS), and Data Analysis and Conversion (DAC) were found dominant critical factors for the success of the ERP implementation in the manufacturing sector. This study investigates how many CSFs are strongly correlated with each other for the success of ERP projects in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, this study also tests empirically using the Statistical Package for Social Science Analysis of Moment on Structures (SPSS AMOS 18.0) to justify the level of CSFs among the local and joint-venture companies using a t-test analysis.</jats:p>"

In particular, we examine whether the concessionary tax treatment of long‐term capital gains increases the supply of shares that qualify for long‐term status, thereby causing downward price pressure. We find evidence of abnormal seller‐initiated trading following the 12‐month anniversary of listing for IPO firms that appreciate in price (‘winners’) and report no such evidence for firms that decline in price (‘losers’). Consistent with the tax concessions being greater for individual than institutional investors, we report that abnormal seller‐initiated trading is mitigated by higher levels of ownership by institutional investors. We also report limited evidence, for winners, of declining share prices upon qualifying for long‐term tax status.</jats:p>",

This chapter covers the work to produce an architecture that shows how to reengineer traditional point of sales terminal payments in order to adapt these for payment over the Internet through Web services. With the use of Web services for payment transactions, vendors will get more freedom to choose their provider and the services they take without having to throw away their legacy applications. Given the globalization of the economy, vendors can negotiate services and fees with payment providers all over the world. Literature research and prototype tests and evaluation in this project show that transactions fees and performance of POS terminal payments transactions trough Web services can be competitive to conventional payment transactions methods and create flexibility for vendors POS terminal application. Vendor’s available Internet connections and the Web services standards in the market can be used for payment transactions. With Web services, the system can be created and changed relatively quickly and simply if the right skills are available.</jats:p>"

Efficient computational tools are needed to schedule pipeline operations in a reliable and cost-effective manner. This work presents a novel discrete event simulation system for the detailed scheduling of a multiproduct pipeline consisting of a sequence of pipes that connects a single input station to several receiving terminals. The pipeline is modeled as a non-traditional multi-server queuing system involving a number of servers at every pipe end that perform their tasks in a synchronized manner. By using alternative priority rules, the model decides which server should dispatch the entity waiting for service to the associated depot. Also, the model deals with the timely fulfillment of terminal demands and the system response to unexpected events. In combination with optimization tools, the proposed simulation technique permits to easily manage real-world pipelines operations with low computational effort.</p>",

A series of analogue and numerical models were developed in order to assess the supply of salt from the footwall and hanging wall to a diapir and to study the influence of basin inversion on the diapir development. The modelling scenario was based on the Kłodawa Salt Structure evolution (central Poland). The experiments show that the ductile material derived from the footwall constitutes the dominant portion of the diapir developed due to model extension, and this material occurs both in the footwall and hanging wall parts of the diapir. Shortening of the analogue models resulted in thinning of the diapir and shifting its stem onto the footwall. Ductile material become redistributed inside the diapir, however footwall material still prevails in the diapir structure. Results from the numerical models show that the magnitude of the basement fault governs the amount of salt supply to a diapir across the fault and that there is a differential salt supply from the hanging wall and footwall with time.</jats:p>",

Drawing on multiple case studies across the supermarket supply chain, this article explores what kind of human resource migrant labour is perceived to be, particularly by employers, and what happens in practice as the dynamic tensions of the employment relationship unfolds in particular sector contexts. It argues that utilisation is conditioned more by the requirements of temporal flexibility – framed by the dynamics of employment within the supply chain – than any essential features of migrant labour power.</jats:p>",

In Supply Chain Risk Management field tools such as modeling and computer simulation are assuming an increasingly important role in supporting strategic, tactical and operational business decisions. In particular, these are applied to the risk sharing phase and to evaluate appropriate management and mitigation strategies. In a company's perspective, a SD approach provides a reading key of reality through an analysis of how policies and decisions influence and are influenced by the environment and how these impact on dynamics of available resources. In this context a model to assess supply risks has been defined. This model considers the operational characteristics of a generic company operating in its supply chain environment, and their interactions. This problem has been approached through several steps with an increasing level of detail. We start by decomposing the supply risk problem in its subparts, in order to understand the mechanisms making this system complex. The simulation based approach proposed here allows to carry out an analysis and subsequent mitigation of supply risks, furthermore providing some counterintuitive advices in order to maximize company's profitability.</jats:p>"

Oestrous cycles were synchronised in 22 Sarda ewes by the insertion (Day 0) of one intravaginal progestagen-impregnated sponge that was removed after 6 days. After removal, the ewes were randomly allocated into two experimental groups (treated and control ewes) and, from Day 7 to Day 11, treated ewes received oral administration of a glucogenic mixture, whereas control animals received water. Follicular development was stimulated by FSH administration from Days 8 to 10. Glucose metabolism was assessed from Days 7 to 11, whilst follicle and corpus luteum growth dynamics and functionality were evaluated between Days 6 and 11. At Day 11 ovaries were collected and processed for in vitro embryo production. Glucogenic treatment increased both the plasma levels of glucose, progesterone, oestradiol and the number of 2–3-mm follicles (P &lt; 0.05). Higher fertilisation and blastocyst rates (P &lt; 0.05) were obtained after IVM of oocytes recovered from treated ewes compared with control ones. In conclusion, glucogenic treatment modifies follicle and corpus luteum functionality and improves oocyte quality, as evaluated by in vitro developmental kinetics and blastocyst output.</jats:p>"

The military engineer Captain Thomas Hyde Page was tasked with identifying any water resources within the confines of the forts and garrisons that might be developed. At Sheerness he supervised the sinking of a deep, large-diameter well through the London Clay, which tapped water in underlying sands. The idea of a deep well was possibly influenced by the results of deepening a well at nearby Queenborough Castle some 60 years before. At Landguard Fort he constructed an infiltration gallery that skimmed water from the upper surface of a thin freshwater lens. At Harwich he sank two simple shallow wells to abstract water from beneath the London Clay. At each locality he used a different solution appropriate to local hydrogeological conditions. Although some of his ideas were outdated, he recognized that fresh water appeared to be floating on underlying salt water and speculated that this might be the result of differences in specific gravity. His work was important in publicizing the use of groundwater and foreshadowed the major developments of the following century.</jats:p>",

Volumes are mandated for each year from 2009 to 2022. In this study, the author simulated the industry required to meet the 2018 mandate, with special attention to the geographic layout. The methodology built a series of scenarios by varying market and technology parameters that influence the design of the biofuel industry. The industry was then modeled with an integrated supply chain model that was spatially explicit. This model described the optimal behavior of a biofuel industry given the constraints of fuel demand, biofuel selling price, and feedstock supply. All the analyzed scenarios achieved the 2018 RFS2 mandate at wholesale fuel prices between $2.65 and $3.78/gal of gasoline-equivalent biofuels. Between $57.7 billion and $140.7 billion in capital investment was required to bring the fuels to market. The results were most sensitive to the level of technological optimism and the access to waste and residue biomass resources. </jats:p>",

The city of Araçatuba, in the Northwest region of the São Paulo state, Brazil, started public water supply fluoridation in 1972 and, based on the average annual highest temperature, has kept the fluoride concentration between 0.6 to 0.8 mgF/L. The purpose of this study was to analyze monthly the fluoride concentration in public water supply in the city of Araçatuba during 72 months. Water samples were collected monthly on weekdays, directly from the water distribution network, on pre-established locations and analyzed in duplicate between November 2004 and October 2010 at the Research Laboratory of the Nucleus for Public Health (NEPESCO) of the Public Health Graduate Program from Araçatuba Dental School/UNESP, Brazil, using an fluoride-specific electrode connected to an ion analyzer. From the total of samples (n=591), 67.2% (n=397) presented fluoride concentration between 0.6 and 0.8 mgF/L; 20.6% (n=122) below 0.6 mgF/L; 11.5% (n=68) between 0.8 and 1.2 mgF/L and 0.7% (n=4) above 1.2 mgF/L. Most samples showed fluoride levels within the recommended parameters. Minimal variation was observed among the analyzed collection locations, showing that the city has been able to control the fluoride levels in the public water supply and reinforcing the importance of surveillance and constant monitoring to assure the quality of the water delivered to the population.</jats:p>"

We conduct both analytical and numerical analyses via a mean‐variance framework with reference to real empirical data. To be specific, we evaluate the expected profits and variance of profits (risk) of the fashion supply chains, fashion retailers, and manufacturers under (1) the currently implemented sales rebate practices, (2) the case without sales rebate, and (3) the theoretical coordination situation (if target sales rebate is adopted). In addition, we analyze how sales effort affects the performances of the supply chain and its agents. Our analysis indicates that the rebate contracts may hurt the retailer and the manufacturer of a fashion supply chain when it is inappropriately set. Moreover, a properly designed sales rebate contract not only can coordinate the supply chain (with retail sales effort) but can also improve expected profits and lower the levels of risk for both the manufacturer and the retailer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Trade credit financing has become a powerful tool to improve sales &amp; profit\n   in an industry. In general, a supplier/retailer frequently offers trade\n   credit to its credit risk downstream member in order to stimulate their\n   respective sales. This trade credit may either be full or partial depending\n   upon the past profile of the downstream member. Partial trade credit may be\n   offered by the supplier/retailer to their credit risk downstream member who\n   must pay a portion of the purchase amount at the time of placing an order and\n   then receives a permissible delay on the rest of the outstanding amount to\n   avoid non-payment risks. The present study investigates the retailer?s\n   inventory problem under partial trade credit financing for two echelon supply\n   chain where the supplier, as well as the retailer, offers partial trade\n   credit to the subsequent downstream member. An algebraic approach has been\n   applied for finding the retailer?s optimal ordering policy under minimizing\n   the annual total relevant cost. Results have been validated with the help of\n   examples followed by comprehensive sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work a two echelon merge supply chain is examined. Specifically, two non identical reliable suppliers feed a distribution centre with a shared buffer. The first echelon consists of the distribution centre and the shared buffer, the second echelon includes two non identical reliable suppliers. There is an unlimited supply of materials to suppliers and an unlimited capacity shipping area after the distribution centre. In other words, suppliers are never starved, and the distribution centre is never blocked. The materials are processed by suppliers with rates following the Erlang distribution. The distribution centre has a reliable machine that pushes material with service times following the Erlang distribution. Blocking appears when one or more suppliers finish their process and try to feed the buffer that is full. The supply network is modelled as a continuous time Markov process with discrete states. The structures of the transition matrices of those systems are explored and a computational algorithm is developed. Our aim is to generate stationary distributions for different values of system's parameters so as the various measures of the system can be estimated. Finally, for the mathematical programming model and the rest of the calculations the Matlab software is used.</jats:p>"

For several years, there has been discussion within the profession whether and how ergonomics and human factors can play a role. Based on our research, we have identified five major challenges from global supply chains especially related to the social aspects of sustainability: (1) criteria for social sustainability, (2) the role of key performance indicators in the management of supply chains, (3) the constant changes in supply chains, (4) the challenge in establishing participation, and (5) the development of agency and regulatory mechanisms. There are obviously no clear and simple solutions to these challenges. One possible avenue for progress might lie in acquiring a greater understanding of the challenges from global supply chains and developing a strategy which combines social and long-term business sustainability. Starting from such a basis, the next step would be to find ways for the ergonomics and human factors community to create international collaboration which can impact specific global supply chains.</jats:p>",

After presenting the background of the project and discussing related work, the chapter describes the ARNEIS framework, starting from its architecture and user interaction flow. The domain analysis of the CRM field and role of ontologies is then discussed. The chapter then focuses on the user interfaces and matching between semantic descriptions of offers and needs.

The method involves an empirical analysis of the content, use, and users of the World Transit Research Clearinghouse website ( http://www.worldtransitresearch.info ). Results indicate that the Transportation Research Record is the academic journal that publishes the most transit research, but only 14% of its papers are on transit. Transport Policy is the second-largest source, but papers on transit make up 58% of its publications. Most research papers on transit concern bus, rail, or mass transit. In the past decade, the most significant change in publications by transit mode is that the segment on bus rapid transit research has grown, although it still accounts for a small share of overall content. Consumption of research content by mode is highest for bus rapid transit, followed by light rail or tram, then by bicycle or pedestrian. A comparison of research supply and research consumption suggests that research papers concerning (in order) sustainability, urban density, and ridership growth have the highest readership but represent a small share of research content in the field. User surveys had a low response rate but the responses received suggest that professionals including government policy makers, consultants, and academics are the major research users. The most common use of transit research is to be kept informed; however, research also is cited as evidence, notably by academics. A modest but significant share of professionals use transit research for transit policy, service development, or both. Opportunities for future research are identified. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This paper examines the problem of scheduling of inbound trucks to the inbound doors at a cross-docking facility. The authors optimize for two conflicting objectives: minimize the total service time for all the inbound trucks and minimize the delayed completion of service for a subset of the inbound trucks, which are considered as preferential customers. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective and as a bi-level mixed integer problem. Due to the nature of the former and the complexity of the latter formulation, a genetic algorithm and a k-th best based algorithm are proposed as the solution approaches. Computational examples are used to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each formulation.</p>",

The concept of component part commonality, which derives from research on effective inventory management using material resource planning (MRP), can also be applied to human resource planning and educational resource management in higher education systems. Therefore, this paper proposed a systematic method to analyze student recruitment numbers for future needs, based on the concept of MRP. The research studied the relationship between a curricular structure tree and the associated commonalities. It explored the relationship between the commonality of students and the aggregated level of student replenishment. Based on that, systematic guidelines for curriculum design can be established for undeclared programs at collages. Two simple examples were used to illustrate the implementation of MRP in analysis of the replenishment levels (necessary safety stock levels) in an education system such as an engineering college.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The calibration of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models has evolved rapidly over the past decade and has been fueled by the need for applications ranging from long-term planning to real-time traffic operation. Numerous formulations and solution approaches based on either analytical or simulation-based approaches have been introduced. The aim of this paper is the documentation of the existing DTA model calibration approaches for future reference. The literature on the calibration of DTA models can be categorized on the basis of the two major components that need to be calibrated: demand and supply model estimation. Travel behavior modeling and origin–destination demand estimation problems are considered in the determination of demand models. Supply models simulate traffic dynamics, queue formation, dissipation, and spillback in either a microscopic or mesoscopic context. Early DTA model calibration efforts were based on iteration between the two demand and supply components. Recent frameworks have focused on the simultaneous calibration of both components. Therefore, different solution approaches have been addressed with various functional needs and degrees of robustness. This paper summarizes the current understanding of calibration and estimation of all input parameters for a DTA model, reviews the existing literature, and highlights the gaps that need to be addressed in future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper highlights the importance of the e-government initiative to support the supply chain integration among Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs). It has been reported that organisations need to integrate their Information Technology (IT) infrastructures to support the integration of their supply chains to increase their efficiency. However, the current research suggests that Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs), due to their lack of expertise and financial resources to invest in the necessary technologies, seem to need further support from the government in their efforts to adopt IT. Therefore, the role of the government is fundamental in supporting them to adopt supply chain management technologies, especially in geographical contexts such as this of Taiwan. A case study is therefore carried out in this paper to study an initiative taken in Taiwan by the government in order to help the supply chain integration of Taiwanese IT manufacturing companies. The findings suggest that the adoption of IT by SMEs (i.e. suppliers) is very much dependent on external forces (resource-dependency view), thus the government has a very important role to play when it comes to supporting SMEs to join supply chain networks. In doing so, this research provides a broader understanding of the phenomenon of e-government initiatives to support supply chain integration in practice.</jats:p>",

The supplier provides the retailer with all requirements, and the retailer sells products to the customers. The supplying process is randomly subject to disruptions. Partial backordering is applied when a stock out occurs, and customer can select either to leave the system without purchasing or to backorder products. The customers are categorized into two main classes regarding to their backordering probabilities. The main contribution of this paper is including the customer differentiation in the inventory model. We used simulation technique to verify the impact of supply disruptions and customer differentiation and carried out sensitivity analysis. To test the performance of the model, we have compared our model to one from the latest related research. As the results show, the average of total annual cost of the (<jats:italic>Q, r</jats:italic>) inventory system is lower than that of the previously developed models such as (<jats:italic>r, T</jats:italic>) inventory systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low inorganic phosphorus (Pi) supply limits the photosynthetic process and hence plants growth and development. Contradictory reports exist in the literature on whether mycorrhyzal association can attenuate the negative effects of low Pi supply on photosynthesis and growth. In the present paper, the effect that low Pi supply may have on photosynthesis and growth of papaya Maradol plants was evaluated in intact plants and in those inoculated with two different strains of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi <jats:italic>Glomus intraradices</jats:italic>. Plant growth was significantly reduced as the Pi supply decreased. However, inoculation with any strain of <jats:italic>G. intraradices</jats:italic> was able to attenuate such effect. Without Pi in the nutrient solution, the mycorrhizal plants had on average 6.1 times and 7.5 higher photosynthesis than non mycorrhizal plants. The chlorophyll fluorescence values were significantly higher in mycorrhizal than in non-mycorrhizal plants. These results could be associated to an increased ability of mycorhyzal plants to take up Pi from the substrate, as they had higher Pi content than non-mycorrhizal plants. A high correlation was found between internal Pi content and plant biomass. The lower correlation between Pi content and photosynthesis, suggests that some photosynthates could had been used to maintain the symbiosis.</jats:p>",

Based on previous studies in which tryptophan has been shown to be present in fresh cherries, the aim of the present work was to analyze the tryptophan content of a Jerte Valley cherry-based product. A previously optimized method of analysis of tryptophan was used, ie, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC/FL). As expected, HPLC/FL technique permitted to detect and quantify the tryptophan content in a different matrix rather than fresh cherries. In fact, the Jerte Valley cherry-based product contained 69.54 ± 10.64 ppm of tryptophan, thereby showing that this product is a good source of tryptophan. In summary, it has been proven that the Jerte Valley cherry-based product is rich in tryptophan and may be indicated as a supply of this essential amino acid as well as having potential health benefits for conditions where tryptophan is necessary. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that determine buyer acceptance of G2B e-government services in the context of inter-entity supply contracts. Based primarily on an adapted version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a sample of 185 organizational buyers of real G2B e-government services in Taiwan was examined. The findings show that perceived usefulness, perceived risk, external influence, interpersonal influence, self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions are critical factors in determining buyer acceptance. The resulting implications and recommendations for G2B e-government services research and practice are also discussed.</jats:p>",

Specifically, this study attempts to fill the gap between the technical features of commercial RFID solutions currently available on the market and the characteristics required to RFID technology for its successful application in the fashion context. The analysis is grounded on two primary sources of information. First, 5 RFID technical providers are examined with the purpose of identifying the available RFID solutions designed for application in the fashion industry, and to assess their performance. Second, 6 end-users of RFID technology, operating as distributors or manufacturers of fashion items, were asked to provide their opinions related to the technical features of RFID tags required for their successful application in the fashion industry supply chain. By comparing the findings obtained from those sources of data, it is found that RFID solutions currently available do not fully meet the requirements expressed by the fashion end-users; hence, the successful design of RFID tags for the fashion supply chain requires further efforts, and a close collaboration between end-users and technical solutions developers. Results of this study provide an exhaustive overview of the commercial RFID solutions designed for the fashion industry; moreover, our findings can be used as guidelines by practitioners, for the design of more efficient RFID solutions. </jats:p>",

Using 2D gel proteomics and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, we recently identified altered abundance of proteins associated with glucose and amino acid metabolism in neonatal rat liver with increased n-3 fatty acids. Here, we extend studies on n-3 fatty acids in hepatic metabolic development to targeted gene and metabolite analyses and map the results into metabolic pathways to consider the role of n-3 fatty acids in glucose, fatty acid, and amino metabolism. Feeding rats 1.5% compared with &lt;0.1% energy 18:3n-3 during gestation led to higher 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in 3-day-old offspring liver, higher serine hydroxymethyltransferase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, and acyl CoA oxidase and lower pyruvate kinase and stearoyl CoA desaturase gene expression, with higher cholesterol, NADPH and glutathione, and lower glycine ( P &lt; 0.05). Integration of the results suggests that the n-3 fatty acids may be important in facilitating hepatic metabolic adaptation from in utero nutrition to the postnatal high-fat milk diet, by increasing fatty acid oxidation and directing glucose and amino acids to anabolic pathways.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increasing demand for customized logistics services in the manufacturing industry, the key factor in realizing the competitiveness of a logistics service supply chain (LSSC) is whether it can meet specific requirements with the cost of mass service. In this case, in‐depth research on the time‐scheduling of LSSC is required. Setting the total cost, completion time, and the satisfaction of functional logistics service providers (FLSPs) as optimal targets, this paper establishes a time scheduling model of LSSC, which is constrained by the service order time requirement. Numerical analysis is conducted by using Matlab 7.0 software. The effects of the relationship cost coefficient and the time delay coefficient on the comprehensive performance of LSSC are discussed. The results demonstrate that with the time scheduling model in mass‐customized logistics services (MCLSs) environment, the logistics service integrator (LSI) can complete the order earlier or later than scheduled. With the increase of the relationship cost coefficient and the time delay coefficient, the comprehensive performance of LSSC also increases and tends towards stability. In addition, the time delay coefficient has a better effect in increasing the LSSC’s comprehensive performance than the relationship cost coefficient does.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The expansion of land used for crop production causes variable direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and other economic, social and environmental effects. We analyse the use of life cycle analysis (LCA) for estimating the carbon intensity of biofuel production from indirect land-use change (ILUC). Two approaches are critiqued: direct, attributional life cycle analysis and consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA). A proposed hybrid ‘combined model’ of the two approaches for ILUC analysis relies on first defining the system boundary of the resulting full LCA. Choices are then made as to the modelling methodology (economic equilibrium or cause–effect), data inputs, land area analysis, carbon stock accounting and uncertainty analysis to be included. We conclude that CLCA is applicable for estimating the historic emissions from ILUC, although improvements to the hybrid approach proposed, coupled with regular updating, are required, and uncertainly values must be adequately represented; however, the scope and the depth of the expansion of the system boundaries required for CLCA remain controversial. In addition, robust prediction, monitoring and accounting frameworks for the dynamic and highly uncertain nature of future crop yields and the effectiveness of policies to reduce deforestation and encourage afforestation remain elusive. Finally, establishing compatible and comparable accounting frameworks for ILUC between the USA, the European Union, South East Asia, Africa, Brazil and other major biofuel trading blocs is urgently needed if substantial distortions between these markets, which would reduce its application in policy outcomes, are to be avoided.</jats:p>",

The reason why the singularity induced bifurcation does not occur while the hard limit encounters is analyzed. The transformer ratio should be larger than a critical value while LIB occurs and the formulas for critical value of LIB in defferent types are derived in this paper. The sensitivities of critical value to parameters are calcaulated, from which some bifurcation points are eliminated and the stable region is augmented. And, the effects of field voltage limit on critical value and stable region are discussed. Finally, a mechanism of limit induced bifurcation is proposed. The increase of reactive power consumed in converter transformer and the decrease of the reactive power compensation in converter AC bus and the transform of control mode result in the system destabilization due to the lack of reactive power.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The first part of this paper draws the lessons for flood management from the experience of the recent major flooding events of 2009 TS Ketsana (Ondoy), 2009 TS Panna (Peping) in Luzon, and the adverse impacts of 2011 TS Sendong on Visayas and Mindanao. NDRRMC data are analyzed in terms of the relative intensities and distribution of population impacts (killed, injured, missing) and economic damages reported among the different storms and regions of impacts. The paper emphasizes the need for implementing structural mitigation measures in poor unprotected towns and regions in the country, as part of an adaptation strategy, under the challenge and threat posed by growing population and anticipated climate change. Likewise, non-structural mitigation measures (which have shorter gestation periods of months and few years only, compared to decades for major structural measures) must also be provided under the imperative or necessity implied by the quantified \"structural gap\" of existing structures to adequately reduce and effectively manage the increasing flood hazard risks caused by growing population and climate change. In the second part of this paper dealing with water supply and sewerage (sanitation), recent NEDA and ADB reports were cited which make very clear the necessity that the Philippines has to achieve a faster rate of providing access to improved sanitation facilities, at a rate at par with that of providing access to improved drinking water, in the quest of the country to attain the \"early achiever\" status before 2015 in both water supply and sanitation targets. After all, the improvement of water supply facilities brings in the potential for producing higher volumetric rates of wastewater. The needs for wastewater treatment (and possible reuse of treated water) are met in the medium term by septage truck-collection and septage plant treatment (in Metro Manila, for example), but better in the longer term with piped sewerage collection networks and sewage treatment plants in both developed and developing communities and towns nation-wide. It is strongly recommended that new programs and projects in water supply development be accompanied with parallel and coupled sewerage (sanitation) programs and projects.  This two-part article deals with the two important sub-sectors of the water sector: namely, flood control &amp; drainage (flood management), on one hand, and water supply &amp; sewerage (or sanitation) on the other hand. The article aims to explain and share with the general reading public the results of a long series of round-table discussions (RTDs), research studies, and annual scientific meetings held in the period 2009-2012, organized by the National Academy of Science &amp; Technology (NAST) of the Philippines in pursuit of its policy-making and advisory mission and function to the nation. These fora and activities were done also with the cooperation and support of the UNESCO National Commission, national government agencies (NGAs such as NEDA, NWRB, DPWH, DENR and DOST), NGCCs (MWSS, water districts, etc.), NGOs (PWP and professional societies), the academe (UP Diliman, Mapua (MIT) and Manila Observatory-Ateneo), and representatives of certain LGUs and the private sector (such as MWCI, MWSl, and consulting firms). In addition lo the consensus established and recommended in the various water fora, the personal views and recommendations of the author are also indicated where they help in clarification of issues or demonstration of solutions. The other major sub-sectors of irrigation, hydropower and other water uses may be covered in future articles by other writers among the academicians of NAST.</jats:p>"

Data about HIV status among blood donors in Antananarivo are scarce. The aim of this study is to assess the HIV seroprevalence among blood donors at the National Centre of Transfusion Supply (NCTS) in Antananarivo from 2003 to May 2009. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study. Data included age, sex and the result of serological screening. HIV testing was performed with an immunochromatographic testing, Determine HIV1-2 (Abbott Laboratories, Japan). Results. There were 47,635 first time blood donors. The prevalence of HIV was increasing from 0.08% in 2003 to 1.06% in 2009. There was no significant difference between male and female donors. No HIV infection was identified among people aged of 60 years and over. Conclusion. Even though seroprevalence of HIV infection is increasing in our departement. It still one of the lowest seroprevalence in sub- Saharan Africa countries. It is important to revise items of our current questionnaire to improve the reliability of our data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Corona discharges are usually generated at sharp points, edges or on thin wires where the electric field is strongly concentrated. With the rapid development of extra and ultra high-voltage transmission lines, the air corona discharge becomes one of the critical problems associated with high-voltage lines, which can lead to the deterioration of insulation systems, power loss, radio noise. Corona discharge studies have been undertaken for many years, not only because of the scientific interest in the corona mechanism but also because of its practical engineering importance. Transient space charge distribution effect that is one of the important canses in the process of corona discharge, is closely related to the corona discharge mechanism and onset, self-sustaining. In this paper, we present an improved self-consistent, multi-component and two-dimensional plasma hybrid model for simulating the DC positive corona discharge under atmospheric environment. The model is based on the plasma hydrodynamics and the chemical dynamics, and it includes 12 species and 27 reactions. Besides, the photoionization effect is also considered in the proposed model. The simulation and the experiment on bar-plate electrode configuration with an inter-electrode gap of 5.0 mm at 2-5.5 kV are carried out. The discharge voltage-current characteristics and single pulse waveform are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Based on this model, the electric field distribution, the electron temperature distribution, and the evolution of charged species distribution are investigated in detail. The results show that distributions of electron temperature and electric field have the same patterns, In the process of discharge, electron density is kept at 1019 m-3 or so. O4+ is dominant compared with the other charged heavy species, and O2+ and N2+ play the key role in secondary electron emission: the unmbers of O2- and O are the largest in negative ions and neutral particle respectively, they play a negligible role in discharge process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fabaceae is of great ethnobotanical importance in indigenous and urban communities throughout the world. This work presents a revision of the use of Fabaceae as a food and/or medicinal resource in Argentine-Chilean Patagonia. It is based on a bibliographical analysis of 27 ethnobotanical sources and catalogues of regional flora. Approximately 234 wild species grow in Patagonia, mainly (60%) in arid environments, whilst the remainder belong to Sub-Antarctic forest. It was found that 12.8% (30 species), mainly woody, conspicuous plants, are collected for food or medicines. Most of the species used grow in arid environments. Cultivation and purchase/barter enrich the Fabaceae offer, bringing it up to a total of 63 species. The richness of native and exotic species, and the existence of multiple strategies for obtaining these plants, indicates hybridization of knowledge and practices. Only 22% of the total species used are mentioned in bothcontexts of food and medicine, reflecting low-use complementation. This study suggests a significant ecological appearance and a high level of availability in shops and exchange networks in Patagonia, highlighting the need to consider the full set of environmental and socioeconomic factors in research related to the use and cultural importance of plants in regional contexts.</jats:p>"

In this setting, consumers decide whether to buy and then whether to return the product, the retailer sets the retail price, quantity, and refund price, and the supplier chooses the wholesale price and buyback price. Both the demand uncertainty and consumers′ valuation uncertainty are considered; consumers realize their valuations only after purchase. We discuss four scenarios for each party in the supply chain that may offer or not offer return policy. We characterize each party′s optimal decisions for all scenarios and we show that the supplier′s best choice is to provide buyback policy and the retailer′s optimal response is to set refund price to be the same as supplier′s buyback price.</jats:p>",
