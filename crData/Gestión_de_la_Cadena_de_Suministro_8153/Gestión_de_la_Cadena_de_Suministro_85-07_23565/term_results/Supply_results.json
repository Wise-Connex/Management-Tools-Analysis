The concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was normal, however, significantly lower concentrations (p less than 0.05) were found in 7 patients with cutaneous calcinosis in comparison with 13 patients with no calcinosis. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 24-25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D-binding protein (Gc globulin) were all within the normal range. The 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D level correlated with the duration of disease (r = 0.4453, p less than 0.05), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D tended to correlate (r = 0.3016, NS). The study strongly indicates that cutaneous synthesis, intestinal absorption and hepatic hydroxylation of vitamin D are not deficient in scleroderma. A relative but specific decrease in the renal hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, i.e. the active hormone, as the disease progresses and calcinosis occurs, is suspected.</jats:p>"

Intravenous administration of D‐glucose enhanced efferent activity in the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve, whereas 2‐deoxyglucose and insulin suppressed this activity. The rate at which these fibres fire was found to be related to the concentration of glucose in the blood. Vagal hepatic nerve activity was effectively blocked by section of the left cervical vagus indicating that this nerve is the main pathway of vagal efferent fibres innervating the liver. It is concluded that changes in the rate of hepatic glycogenesis, which occur in response to changes in blood glucose concentration, are mediated in part by the vagal efferent innervation of the liver.</jats:p>",

In both years, tracer measurements from this area included data from samples of the dense overflow water from the north through Denmark Strait. All three tracers were strongly correlated inversely with salinity in the dense outflows—the tracer maxima being related directly to the salinity minimum. When the tracer characteristics in the outflows in 1972 and 1981 were compared, concentrations of all in 1981 were observed to be about double the 1972 values. The individual tracer concentrations—on a decay‐corrected, density‐normalized basis—were higher in increasing order: <jats:sup>90</jats:sup>Sr (+93%) &lt; <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H (+115%) &lt; <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs (+150%). The relatively greater increases for <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs were attributed to contributions of new sources of these tracers in northern surface waters: the <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H source is argued to derive from atmospheric hydrological recycling, whereas the <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs source is identified as the input to the Greenland and Iceland seas of advected European nuclear fuel reprocessing wastes. Both the tracer and hydrographic data are used to identify northern locations of intermediate water formation capable of supplying the observed dense overflow water characteristics. It is argued, from the time taken for the overflow water to reflect the new surface <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs source, that transport from the source to the overflow can be quite rapid (about 2 years).</jats:p>",
