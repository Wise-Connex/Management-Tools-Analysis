      "abstract": "<jats:p>“Bullwhip” describes the general tendency for small changes in end‐customer demand to be amplified within a production‐distribution system. A 10 per cent increase in sales to end‐customers can precipitate a 40 per cent upswing in production and subsequent downswing (as excess stocks are depleted) within a three‐echelon supply chain. It is shown how proven material flow control principles significantly reduce bullwhip in a global supply chain. The evidence demonstrates that a methodology, which has evolved over several decades, provides a suitable framework for effective change. Bullwhip is not a new problem; it is a new name coined to describe a very well‐known problem. Some observed barriers to change are briefly reviewed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological innovation is a major driver in the consumer electronics industry, bringing consumers exciting new products more quickly and at lower cost than ever before. However, technological innovation alone cannot deliver competitive advantage to manufacturers, no matter how large their scale or scope. Delivering innovative new products quickly and at competitive prices requires an efficient and effective supply chain, in which inventory is minimalised but without the loss of responsiveness that is essential in such a dynamic market. Hewlett‐Packard’s experience with its CD re‐writer is a classic case of an existing supply chain infrastructure failing to support the commercial exploitation of technological innovation. Their experience demonstrates graphically the importance of a supply chain design in keeping with market requirements. The results of their supply chain analysis illustrate the significant benefits of centralized distribution and the implementation highlights the importance of project management and the incentives for change amongst supply partners.</jats:p>",

On one hand, the promise of technology for enhanced learning has created a demand from faculty to be provided with cutting‐edge hardware, software, and training aimed at technology implementation into their curriculum. However, education, economy and businesses’ need for technically‐savvy scholars and workers has meant an increase in the supply of students returning to receive education in technology‐related fields. We argue that merging these two in advanced technology courses solves an institute’s need for software and training; it also provides incoming students with an authentic learning environment for appreciating the complex domain of technological tools in education. The creation, development, and implementation of the Physical Science Activity Database is provided to demonstrate that, although this idea is not necessarily new, using Web and database networks enables widespread reusability as well as complexity of learning.</jats:p>",

Two common forms of channel rebates are linear rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold, and target rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed target rebate achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear rebate in a way that is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed target rebate and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome. Other contracts, such as linear rebate and returns or target rebate alone, cannot achieve coordination in a way that is implementable. Contrary to the view expressed in the literature that accepting returns weakens incentives for retailer sales effort, we find that the provision of returns strengthens incentives for effort. </jats:p>",

Coordination between all supply chain organizations on strategic, tactical and operation levels will lead to more effective supply chains. This supply chain coordination processes is complex and practitioners need a systems thinking approach and broad understanding of topics that are related to the field of supply chain management. To fulfill this task supply chain managers have to speak the same language and understand the importance of possible problems. As part of the development of a professional course in supply chain management a supply chain analysis tool has been developed and tested during four courses in a realistic case situation. This supply chain analysis tool gives support in finding possible problems that should be tackled to optimize the supply chain. This tool is based on the two phases of a structured problem solving process that resembles the first phases of Systems Engineering approaches.</jats:p>",

Today, Latin America has the capability to develop some of its own technologies and is able to export some of its experiences. Nevertheless, a new set of challenges is bringing about a new demand for transfer of experiences to LAC. The new challenges are basically in the area of sector policies, sector structures, institutional and human development, and the application of technologies for specific and indigenous technical problems.</jats:p>",

The supply chain environments that are taken into consideration include agile, leagile, and lean. Based on a weighted organizational performance index, the sample organizations are segregated into three groups: high, average, and low performers. For each of the performance groups, benchmarks the performance ratings of the MPC system and its five modules, subject to different supply chain environments. Concludes that: MPC system performance really has a positive effect upon organization performance; four of the proposed benchmarking modules of the MPC systems can be used to assess an organization’s strengths and weaknesses with regard to their use in planning and control of manufacture; and supply chain strategy may associate with the MPC system performance.</jats:p>",

In this paper a solution that would allow collaboration on a wide scale is presented. The forecasting approach is called “rank and share” and uses input from the retailer’s existing planning process – the category management process. The benefit of using category management as the basis is that the retailer can scale up collaboration with a large number of suppliers without increasing planning resources. For the supplier the benefit is point of sales forecasts at the time of the assortment decision. To support this collaborative forecasting process there is a need for more robust replenishment solutions, new measures to illustrate benefits, and for a distributed planning architecture and software. Potential solutions for these are also discussed in the paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Earlier views of the development of the coronary vasculature included angiogenic budding and growth of arteries from the aortic sinuses and veins from the coronary sinus. The current concept begins with the establishment of the epicardium from the proepicardial organ, an outgrowth of the dorsal wall of the pericardial cavity. Capillaries form in a subepicardial mesenchymal population, extending as a plexus toward the truncus arteriosus and the atria. Multiple vessels grow from a peritruncal ring of capillaries, preferentially invading the newly formed aorta. In a process involving apoptotic changes of both the aortic wall and the invading capillaries, orifices open at the level of the aortic sinuses. Smooth muscle cells and pericytes, recruited from the surrounding mesenchyme, contribute to the vessel walls, and the definitive coronary artery pattern is established. Similar events are occurring on the venous side of the coronary circulation, following a slightly earlier time course. Multiple factors govern this process, including VEGF and FGF‐1 stimulating vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and the angiopoietins and their tyrosine kinase receptors modulating interactions between endothelial cells and the mural components. As remodeling of the capillary plexus and the coronary orifices progresses, TGFβ released by apoptotic cells or from other sources likely modulates VEGF and FGF‐1, and also contributes to further apoptotic changes. A better appreciation of the controls of the mechanisms of coronary vessel development may direct further research in the prevention of arteriosclerosis and ischemic tissue injuries.

In a sudden and unexpected `dash for gas', previously unused combined cycle gas turbine plant was adopted for all new large power stations. Gas turbine technology, politically and institutionally excluded from the industry before privatization, gained ascendancy due to the coincidence and interaction of ESI liberalization with lower fuel prices and greater availability, improved turbine performance, pollution abatement legislation, and the manifestation of institutional tensions accumulated under nationalization. </jats:p><jats:p> An earlier paper found that the demise of established generation technology, particularly the British nuclear power programme, exposed the inadequacies of autonomistic and deterministic notions of technological change. The present paper considers the value of a more subtle framework - Hughes' sociotechnical systems model - for analysing the rise of gas turbines in the British ESI. The systems perspective enables the dash for gas to be understood, rather than as a result of technical and economic imperatives, or structural and regulatory reform, as a contingent and largely unplanned outcome of the interplay of previously excluded international forces with latent local interests, mediated by policymaking expediency. Liberalization swiftly led to the replacement of centralized system building with fragmented `postmodern' change. </jats:p>",

We document that approximately 38 percent of the decline can be attributed to the requirement. The other 62 percent of the decline remains unexplained.

The present study examined the importance of body fatness and insulin sensitivity as variables that may be associated with muscle oxygen supply. We studied 38 adolescents (22 males, 16 females; age 15.3–18.6 years; body mass index 17.7–34.7kg/m2) and used near-IR spectroscopy to measure the muscle re-oxygenation rate after ischaemic finger flexion exercise. Total body fat content was estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by homoeostasis model assessment. Regional lipid compartments were also assessed for potential associations with muscle oxygen supply. Abdominal adiposity (visceral and subcutaneous) was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and soleus intramyocellular lipid levels were determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Total body fat content (r = 0.67, P&amp;lt;0.001), abdominal subcutaneous fat area (r = 0.78, P&amp;lt;0.001), abdominal visceral fat area (r = 0.54, P&amp;lt;0.001) and intramyocellular lipid levels (r = 0.68, P&amp;lt;0.001) were significantly related to forearm re-oxygenation half-time. After adjusting for insulin sensitivity, both total body fat content (r = 0.395, P = 0.02) and abdominal subcutaneous fat area (r = 0.543, P = 0.001) remained positively associated with relatively reduced muscle oxygen supply in adolescent subjects. After adjusting for body fat content, abdominal subcutaneous fat area (r = 0. 511, P = 0.002) was significantly associated with muscle oxygen supply. Thus muscle oxygen supply is associated with body fat content, and certain fat compartments may be more influential than others.</jats:p>",

Cells were grown in media of defined amino acid composition, based on physiological concentrations (P.C.) of amino acids in sheep plasma. Relative to culture in 5 x P.C., amino acid limitation to 0.2 x P.C. had inhibitory effects on IGF-I RNA expression, peptide release and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation (P&lt;0.01 in each case). Limitation of methionine levels to 0.2 x P.C. against a background of 5 x P.C. for the other amino acids blocked GH-stimulated IGF-I peptide release and RNA expression, although basal expression was unaffected. In contrast, limitation of the other amino acids present in the culture medium had no effect on basal or GH-stimulated IGF-I expression. Selective methionine limitation to 0.2xP.C. levels had no effect on cellular or secretory protein synthesis rates relative to cells grown in complete 5 x P.C. medium but did cause a partial reduction in p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, which was also observed when medium was selectively limited for other essential amino acids. The addition of rapamycin (5 ng/ml) to cells grown in 5xP.C. media completely abolished p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation (P&lt;0.001), implicating mTOR in the response of S6 kinase phosphorylation to changing amino acid supply. By contrast, inclusion of rapamycin (100 ng/ml) had no effect on levels of IGF-I gene expression. These results indicate that methionine is the key limiting amino acid involved in the modulation of IGF-I expression in the ovine liver. This nutrient-hormone interaction is a highly selective phenomenon, occurring against a background of modest effects on general protein synthetic control. The partial inhibitory effects of methionine on mTOR activity are not sufficient to account for this selectivity of action.</jats:p>",

A major shortcoming of these models is a timber supply specification that inadequately accounts for suppliers choosing the structure of their forest capital to self-produce nontimber amenities. This inadequate characterization of resource use, if significant, can impede the development of sound forest policy, particularly in settings where forest owners possess diverse preferences for forest amenities. In this article, we develop and estimate a timber supply model that is consistent with the idea of joint self-production of timber and nontimber amenities, such that timber supply is a function of an endogenous distribution of forest inventory that correlates to ownership and management characteristics. Using data for the U.S. South and three-stage least squares procedures, we confirm that timber and nontimber amenities are jointly produced by private forest owners. We also note that owner and management characteristics influence joint production decisions. We believe that the parameters estimated through such an integrated empirical exercise could critically improve forest sector forecasting models and the related forest policy analyses. FOR.

Citrine) were treated with various Zn concentrations (0.67 to 700 muM Zn) in the presence and absence of 0.2 mM Na-succinate. Plants pre-treated with succinate and then exposed to Zn exhibited higher dry root, stem and leaf weight than the plants treated with Zn alone. An increase in Zn supply resulted in a decrease in the concentrations of Ca, Mg, P in the roots and an increase of Ca and N levels in the stems and leaves. The amount of Zn in the roots, stems and leaves increased with greater Zn rates. The succinate treatment increased P in the roots but did not affect the Ca, N and Mg contents in Zn-treated plants. Most of the Zn taken up was retained in the roots after succinate treatment. The ameliorative effect of succinate on plant growth could be due to a lower Zn translocation in the leaves and stems and increased Zn accumulation in the roots. Lower Zn translocation in aboveground parts seemed to result from Zn complexing by organic anion in the roots. This probably caused less Zn transport to the stems and leaves and suggested that succinate has potential for complexing with Zn and may play a role in tolerance to high Zn levels.</jats:p>",

In the industrial ecosystem and eco‐industrial park approaches the material cycles and energy cascades in a natural ecosystem serve as the metaphoric vision for a local/regional industrial system in which waste material and waste (residual) energy are utilized through cooperation between the actors in the system. In this paper, a local/regional recycling network scenario is presented with the energy supply system of the city of Joensuu in Finland. The conditions of success include the co‐production of heat and electricity (heat and power, CHP), waste energy utilization for industrial steam and renewable flow use as fuel. Some difficulties in the industrial ecosystem‐type development of the system are discussed. Methodological suggestions for industrial ecosystem and eco‐industrial park case studies are considered and the experience from this Finnish case is discussed in terms of wider application of IE in local/regional economic energy systems. For future research on the theme, it is suggested that regional industrial ecology may benefit from regional economics theory and, <jats:italic>vice versa</jats:italic>, regional economics theory may find a new area of application in regional industrial ecology.

Where supply chain patterns have changed, changes are associated with changes in production, changes in supply chain strategy, or exogenous factors, such as heightened competition and changes in the geography of potential suppliers. High levels of stability in the geography of the supply chain provide a challenge to arguments that there is now a rapid process of globalisation within MNEs.

This problem of multiple interest groups competing for a limited resource is compounded by sharp disagreement in the scientific community over endangered species' needs for instream flows. In this study, game theory was used to address one dimension of this resource management problem. A sequential auction with repeated bidding was used to determine how much instream flow water each of three states — Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming — will provide and at what price. The results suggest that the use of auction mechanisms can improve the prospects for reaching a multi‐state agreement on who will supply instream flow water, if the auction is structured to discourage misrepresentation of costs and if political compensation is allowed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays supply chain management has gained a tremendous amount of attention from both academics and practitioners. It provides an innovative management technology in order to assist enterprises to survive in the ever-increasing business competition and to sustain competitive advantages. Although there is an ever-increasing amount of literature addressing theories and practices of supply chain management, the existing performance measurement methods fail to provide significant assistance in supply chain development and an effective method is lacking. The objective of this paper is to propose an innovative channel-spanning performance measurement method from a system perspective. Fuzzy set theory is introduced to address the real situation in the judgement and evaluation processes. A simple example is given. The whole framework of this method is outlined with some suggestions, which, if appropriately applied, aims to facilitate performance improvement of supply chains. </jats:p>",
