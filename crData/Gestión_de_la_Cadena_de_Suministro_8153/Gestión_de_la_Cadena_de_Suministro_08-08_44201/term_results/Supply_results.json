Electronic books remain a minority market but the literature at least remains optimistic. Open Access continues to grow but with continuing and widely differing views on its impact. Recent mandating decisions will mean a step change in the both the creation and the growth of institutional and subject repositories.

The objectives are to: identify the range of trading relationships that exist between an SME in the manufacturing sector and its customers and suppliers; examine the implications of these external relationships for the SME's internal enterprise‐planning system; develop a composite framework of enterprise planning and supply chain management which allows manufacturing SMEs to understand how these interact and can be aligned.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper develops a composite framework that allows first‐ or second‐tier manufacturing SMEs to identify the types of relationships in which they are involved and how they can understand and address their internal arrangements in order to meet their external obligations.

For a manufacturing SME, these issues and mechanisms will be the responsibility of only a few people whose interactions are likely to focus on short‐term issues, but they can begin to move their perspective from day‐to‐day pressures and take a more holistic, long‐term view of the business. By so doing, they can achieve a more effective alignment of external and internal requirements and mechanisms which will benefit themselves, their customers and the entire supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This composite framework of supply chain management and enterprise planning should enable those who run manufacturing SMEs to take an overview of their business and better align their internal priorities with the external requirements of their customers.

The network can be simple or complex. It may include suppliers, factories, final assembly locations, and distribution centers. Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) Strategic Planning and Modeling (SPaM) team has helped company executives to analyze numerous supply chain networks using spreadsheets (with and without Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)), spreadsheets with add-ins, custom-written software programs, and packaged software applications. Spreadsheets with and without VBA and add-ins are the most frequently used approach for analyzing supply chain networks. The team employs many advanced spreadsheet and VBA capabilities. It also minimizes unnecessary modeling complexity wherever possible. In this paper, we review why and how we use spreadsheets to analyze supply chains and discuss some of the ways of overcoming their limitations. </jats:p>",

Each retailer has some private information about the uncertain demand function which he may choose to disclose to the manufacturer. The manufacturer then sets a wholesale price based on the information received. The information exchange is said to be confidential if the manufacturer keeps the received information to herself, or nonconfidential if she discloses the information to some or all other retailers. Without confidentiality, information sharing is not possible because it benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailers. With confidentiality, all parties have incentive to engage in information sharing if retail competition is intense. Under confidentiality, the retailers infer the shared information from the wholesale price and this gives rise to a signaling effect that makes the manufacturer's demand more price elastic, resulting in a lower equilibrium wholesale price and a higher supply chain profit. When all retailers share their information confidentially, they will truthfully report the information and the supply chain profit will achieve its maximum in equilibrium. </jats:p>",

Players take actions in the following sequence. First (stage 1), the suppliers form coalitions among themselves. Second (stage 2), the coalitions compete for a position in the negotiation sequence. Finally (stage 3), the coalitions negotiate with the assembler on allocations of the supply chain's profit. We model the multilateral negotiations between the suppliers and the assembler sequentially, i.e., the assembler negotiates with one coalition at a time. Each of these negotiations is modeled using the Nash bargaining concept. Further, in forming coalitions we assume that players are farsighted. We then predict at equilibrium the structure of the supply chain as a function of the players' relative negotiation powers. In particular, we show that the assembler always prefers the outcome where suppliers do not form coalitions. However, when the assembler is weak (low negotiation power) the suppliers join forces as a grand coalition, but when the assembler is powerful the suppliers stay independent, which is the preferred outcome to the assembler.</jats:p>",

Each source faces a random yield factor with a general probability distribution. The model considers a single demand season. All supplies need to be ordered before the start of the season. The planning problem amounts to selecting which of the given set of suppliers to retain, and how much to order from each, so as to minimize total procurement costs while ensuring that the uncertain demand is met with a given probability. The total procurement costs consist of variable costs that are proportional to the total quantity delivered by the suppliers, and a fixed cost for each participating supplier, incurred irrespective of his supply level. Each potential supplier is characterized by a given fixed cost and a given distribution of his random yield factor. The yield factors at different suppliers are assumed to be independent of the season's demand, which is described by a general probability distribution. </jats:p><jats:p> Determining the optimal set of suppliers, the aggregate order and its allocation among the suppliers, on the basis of the exact shortfall probability, is prohibitively difficult. We have therefore developed two approximations for the shortfall probability. Although both approximations are shown to be highly accurate, the first, based on a large-deviations technique (LDT), has the advantage of resulting in a rigorous upper bound for the required total order and associated costs. The second approximation is based on a central limit theorem (CLT) and is shown to be asymptotically accurate, whereas the order quantities determined by this method are asymptotically optimal as the number of suppliers grows. Most importantly, this CLT-based approximation permits many important qualitative insights. </jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper develops and presents a categorization of SCS based on existing research. This categorization of supply chain literature can help academics and practitioners to better understand SCS and also helps to identify a research agenda.

The predicted demand of formal childcare and the predicted costs of informal childcare arising from these models are then used to impute total childcare costs at different levels of labour supply. Finally, the predicted total costs are incorporated in the estimation procedure of structural labour supply models for couple and sole parent families. By making several extensions to the methodology adopted in <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b9\">Doiron and Kalb (2005a</jats:ext-link>), who estimated similar models based on 1996 Australian data and which this paper largely replicates in terms of methodology, it is found that the average elasticities of labour supply with regard to the cost of childcare are quite similar to the earlier estimates. The elasticities remain at the lower end of the range found in the international literature with the exception of the elasticities for sole parents with preschool children and/or on relatively low wages.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that the endogenously determined structural breaks happened near the time when this fishery implemented individual fishing quotas. Furthermore, the estimation of the cointegrating vector indicates that the processors of this fishery are significantly more price‐responsive after the change in management.</jats:p>",

We construct a life-cycle model of female participation and savings, and calibrate the model to match the behavior of the middle cohort. We investigate which changes in the determinants of labor supply account for the increases in participation early in the life-cycle observed for the youngest cohort. A combination of a reduction in the cost of children alongside a reduction in the wage-gender gap is needed. (JEL D91, J16, J22, J31) </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts in practical applications, e.g., in bearings, operate in the starved lubrication regime. As a result their performance is sensitive to variations of the lubricant layers present on the surfaces, which form the supply to the contact. Their shape is often determined by previous overrollings of the track and also by replenishment mechanisms and various migration effects. Variations of the layers induced in the direction of rolling lead to a time-varying lubricant supply to the contact. In this paper, by means of numerical simulations using a starved lubrication model, the film thickness modulations in the center of the contact induced by a harmonically varying inlet supply have been investigated. First, for a given load condition and layer wavelength, the effect of the nominal layer thickness (degree of starvation) and the layer variation amplitude is illustrated. Subsequently, using results for different load conditions, wavelengths, and degrees of starvation, it is shown that the response of the contact to such variations is determined by a nondimensional parameter, which represents the ratio of the entrainment length of the contact to the wavelength of the induced variation, and by the degree of starvation. A simple formula is presented for use in engineering predicting the ratio of the amplitude of the film modulations in the center of the contact to the amplitude of the layer variations in the inlet.</jats:p>",

To partly address this knowledge gap, primary producer biomass and consumer abundance and biomass were quantified on nutrient‐diffusing substrata along a light gradient created by four riparian reserve treatments (forested controls, 30‐m wide riparian reserve, 10‐m reserve, clear‐cut) each replicated twice in headwater streams of southwestern British Columbia in 2001 and 2002. Predation pressure, as estimated by trout abundance varied among streams, and was treated as a covariate, with nutrient enrichment and riparian reserve width as fixed effects. Primary producer and consumer biomass were limited by light flux as determined by reserve width, and nutrients, especially phosphorus. In 2002, nutrient effects on algal biomass were conditional upon reserve width: chlorophyll a biomass was higher on P‐ and N+P‐amended pots compared to controls, but only in the 10‐m reserve and clear‐cut treatments or when light flux was greater than 75 μmol m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The effects of fish predators on primary consumers were also conditional upon reserve width, with strong predator effects occurring in the 10‐m and clear‐cut riparian treatments. The interactive effects of light flux, nutrient supply and predator abundance in constraining lower trophic levels may be common in nature. My results, therefore, suggest interactive effects were manisfested above a specific threshold condition. The interactive effects of light flux, nutrient supply and predator abundance in constraining lower trophic levels may be common in nature. Results from my study support this hypothesis and suggest that variation in light flux was an important condition dictating the strength of nutrient limitation and redation pressure in these headwater streams.</jats:p>",

The most pressing\nneed is to develop global logistic processes and models that satisfy rapidly changing business and\noperational objectives. This research studies how the automotive industry in Taiwan has adopted its\nlogistic hubs to improve international business operations and objectives. In the first phase of the\nstudy, Taiwan automotive firms were surveyed and their current (as-is) logistic models were derived.\nIn the second phase, based on the industry characteristics and the company’s global strategy, the\nimproved (to-be) logistic processes were derived. Further, a case of Taiwan automobile\nmanufacturers is used to apply and demonstrate the to-be logistic models and evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed models. The resulting framework for a global logistic hub is designed to\nimprove the operations of automotive companies with respect to time and cost, as well as to ensure\ninformation sharing among automotive supply chain partners.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Microturbomachinery implements gas bearings in compact units of enhanced mechanical reliability. Gas bearings, however, have little damping and wear quickly during transient rub events. Flexure pivot tilting pad bearings offer little or no cross-coupled stiffnesses with enhanced rotordynamic stability; and when modified for hydrostatic pressurization, demonstrate superior rotordynamic performance over other bearing types. External pressurization stiffens gas bearings thus increasing system critical speeds, albeit reducing system damping. Most importantly, measurements demonstrate that external pressurization is not needed for rotor supercritical speed operation. In practice, the supply pressure could be shut off at high rotor speeds with substantial gains in efficiency. This paper introduces a simple strategy, employing an inexpensive air pressure regulator to control the supply pressure into the hybrid bearings, to reduce or even eliminate high amplitudes of rotor motion while crossing the system critical speeds. Rotor speed coast-down tests with the pressure controller demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A simple on-off supply pressure control, i.e., a sudden increase in pressure while approaching a critical speed, is the best since it changes abruptly the bearing stiffness coefficients and moves the system critical speed to a higher speed. A rotordynamic analysis integrating predicted bearing force coefficients forwards critical speeds in agreement with the test results. Predicted rotor responses for the controlled supply conditions show an excellent correlation with measured data. The experiments validate the predictive tools and demonstrate the controllable rotordynamic characteristics of flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings.</jats:p>",

According to the literature, we know<jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic>that the balanced decision making forges a better (financial) outcome than the dominating case does. Therefore, our primary research objective is to analyze detailed dynamics of resource allocation and sources of the benefit of the balanced decision making.

The proposal involves periodically allocation (e.g. by auction) of existing water stock held in urban catchments to virtual suppliers who then compete in providing bulk water. This change when coupled with effective third party access and retail competition would lead to a competitive market for the provision of urban water.

Each TSC is assumed to consists of three sectors with the following service providers—a theme park operator, accommodation providers, and tour operators. Game theory is used to investigate the cooperation and competition between these two TSCs, between the three sectors within each TSC, and between the enterprises within each sector when configuring and marketing package holidays. Several important findings are obtained. First, a larger membership in each of the TSC sectors strengthens the sector's overall capacity and intensifies the internal competition, thus reducing members' profits while other sectors benefit from this internal competition. Second, decision makers of the two competing TSCs should adopt appropriate product differentiation strategies by carefully positioning their package holiday products to optimize their performance. Third, the theme park would benefit from integration with the accommodation provider. There exists a win-win situation in which the performances of both TSCs could be improved, if the integration adequately increases the TSCs' preference. </jats:p>",

The Duck River program quickly became involved with many federal, state, and local partners who were beginning to tackle the water supply challenges facing several communities in the river's watershed. One of the Nature Conservancy's key partners, and the local force behind water resource planning in the watershed, is the Duck River Agency (DRA). From 2000 to 2002, DRA members worked to build trust between all partners within the watershed, improving tools for water management planning and coordinating research priorities and efforts. This article discusses how those first steps at building trust and partnerships within the watershed would pay off very soon. When Tennessee's exceptional drought came along in 2007, it put the relatively new collaboration straight to the test.</jats:p>",

Lam.], available reports are also contradictory. The aim of this study was to shed light on the effects of long‐term restricted water supply on shoot development, photosynthesis and storage root yield in field‐grown sweet potato. Experiments were conducted under a rainout shelter where effects of restricted water supply were assessed in two varieties (Resisto and A15). Large decreases in stomatal conductance occurred in both varieties after 5 weeks of treatment. However, continued measurements revealed a large varietal difference in persistence of this response and effects on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation. Although restricted water supply decreased leaf relative water content similarly in both varieties, the negative effects on stomatal conductance disappeared with time in A15 (indicating high drought acclimation capacity) but not in Resisto, thus leading to inhibition of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation in Resisto. Chlorophyll <jats:italic>a </jats:italic>fluorescence measurements, and the relationship between stomatal conductance, intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation rate, indicated that drought stress inhibited photosynthesis primarily through stomatal closure. Although yield loss was considerably larger in Resisto, it was also reduced by up to 60% in A15, even though photosynthesis, expressed on a leaf area basis, was not inhibited in this variety. In A15 yield loss appears to be closely associated with decreased aboveground biomass accumulation, whereas in Resisto, combined effects on biomass accumulation and photosynthesis per unit leaf area are indicated, suggesting that research aimed at improving drought tolerance in sweet potato should consider both these factors.</jats:p>",

(2006) Biotechnol Bioeng 95(6): 1167–1176]. This study aims to understand the role of NADPH supply in xylitol yield and the contribution of key central carbon metabolism enzymes toward xylitol production. Studies in which the expression of CbXR or a xylose transporter was increased suggest that enzyme activity and xylose transport are not limiting xylitol production in PC09. A constraints‐based stoichiometric metabolic network model was used to understand the roles of central carbon metabolism reactions and xylose transport energetics on the theoretical maximum molar xylitol yield (xylitol produced per glucose consumed), and xylitol yields (<jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>RPG</jats:sub>) were measured from resting cell biotransformations with various PC09 derivative strains. For the case of xylose‐proton symport, omitting the Zwf (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase) or PntAB (membrane‐bound transhydrogenase) reactions or TCA cycle activity from the model reduces the theoretical maximum yield from 9.2 to 8.8, 3.6, and 8.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. Experimentally, deleting <jats:italic>pgi</jats:italic> (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase) from strain PC09 improves the yield from 3.4 to 4.0 mol xylitol (mol glucose)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, while deleting either or both <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> transhydrogenases (<jats:italic>sthA</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>pntA</jats:italic>) has no significant effect on the measured yield. Deleting either <jats:italic>zwf</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>sucC</jats:italic> (TCA cycle) significantly reduces the yield from 3.4 to 2.0 and 2.3 mol xylitol (mol glucose)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. Expression of a xylose reductase with relaxed cofactor specificity increases the yield to 4.0. The large discrepancy between theoretical maximum and experimentally determined yield values suggests that biocatalysis is compromised by pathways competing for reducing equivalents and dissipating energy. The metabolic role of transhydrogenases during <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> biocatalysis has remained largely unspecified. Our results demonstrate the importance of direct NADPH supply by NADP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>‐utilizing enzymes in central metabolism for driving heterologous NADPH‐dependent reactions, and suggest that the pool of reduced cofactors available for biotransformation is not readily interchangeable via transhydrogenase.

We developed an empirical yield model for <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> from harvestable dry matter yields at 14 field trials in the UK to estimate site‐specific and regional yields derived from meteorological variables and soil available water. Harvestable yields of crops established for at least 3 years at 14 arable sites across the UK ranged from 5 to 18 t/ha, averaging at 12.8 (±2.9) t/ha. Variables considered to affect yield were number of years after planting, length of season (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>air</jats:sub> &gt; 9 °C), temperature, global solar radiation, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration during the season, and soil available water capacity (<jats:italic>AWC</jats:italic>). At a single site (Rothamsted), <jats:italic>AWC</jats:italic> and the relative average potential soil moisture deficit during the main growing season explained 70% of annual yield variation (RMSE = 1.38 t/ha, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). For the complete UK data set (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 67), yield variation was related to <jats:italic>AWC</jats:italic>, air temperature and precipitation (RMSE = 2.1 t/ha, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). Linking soil survey and spatially interpolated weather data we calculated an overall national average dry matter yield of 9.6 t/ha. As shown for two counties (Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire), estimated yield may decrease by 1 t/ha, and its uncertainty may rise from 15 to &gt;20%, when soil survey instead of local soil data are used. Using data from a single weather station can introduce a bias (&lt;1 t/ha) because of differences in elevation and local temperature and precipitation. Overall, it seems most important for bioenergy plantings to assure sufficient water supply from the soil (<jats:italic>AWC</jats:italic> &gt; 150 mm) during the main growing season.</jats:p>",

For all the 61 isolates, the sequence of the amplified mip gene fragment identified Legionella pneumophila strain Wadsworth. Genotype testing by PFGE analysis showed three different patterns, correspondent to three SBT types according to the allelic profiles. Both PFGE and SBT indicated the circulation and the persistence in the hospital potable water-system of three types randomly distributed in space and time. The two molecular methods adopted showed a 100% concordance, although a low degree of genetic heterogeneity characterized the isolates. The electrophoretic patterns were sufficiently unambiguous to consider PFGE a highly discriminatory typing method, but the SBT technique besides accurately characterizing isolates, was able to identify Legionella strains through analysis of the mip gene. A typing method with this level of discriminatory power has great potential for assisting in epidemiological studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Because of its portable data, discriminatory power, and recently proposed standardization, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing has become a major method for the epidemiological tracking of<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>complex (MTBC) clones. However, no public MIRU-VNTR database based on well-characterized reference strains has been available hitherto for easy strain identification. Therefore, a collection of 186 reference strains representing the primary MTBC lineages was used to build a database, which is freely accessible at<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"url\" xlink:href=\"http://www.MIRU-VNTRplus.org\">http://www.MIRU-VNTRplus.org</jats:ext-link>. The geographical origin and the drug susceptibility profile of each strain were stored together with comprehensive genetic lineage information, including the 24-locus MIRU-VNTR profile, the spoligotyping pattern, the single-nucleotide- and large-sequence-polymorphism profiles, and the IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint. Thanks to flexible import functions, a single or multiple user strains can be analyzed, e.g., for lineage identification with or without the use of reference strains, by best-match or tree-based analyses with single or combined marker data sets. The results can easily be exported. In the present study, we evaluated the database consistency and various analysis parameters both by testing the reference collection against itself and by using an external population-based data set comprising 629 different strains. Under the optimal conditions found, lineage predictions based on typing by 24-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis optionally combined with spoligotyping were verified in &gt;99% of the cases. On the basis of this evaluation, a user strategy was defined, which consisted of best-match analysis followed, if necessary, by tree-based analysis. The MIRU-VNTR<jats:italic>plus</jats:italic>database is a powerful tool for high-resolution clonal identification and has little equivalent in terms of functionalities among the bacterial genotyping databases available so far.</jats:p>",
