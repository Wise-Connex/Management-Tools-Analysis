      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the late 1950s it has been recognised that the systems used internally within supply chains can lead to oscillations in demand and inventory as orders pass through the system. The uncertainty generated by these oscillations can result in late deliveries, order cancellations and an increased reliance on inventory to buffer these effects. Despite the best efforts of organisations to stabilise the dynamics generated, industry still experiences a high degree of uncertainty from this source. The “supply chain complexity triangle” describes the interaction of deterministic chaos, parallel interactions and demand amplification. It provides a framework for understanding the generation of uncertainty within supply chains. The implications for supply chain strategy and manufacturing logistics are discussed.</jats:p>",

With the exception of some applications, such as hospital rooms where air is supplied to create a positive pressure, such an air amount that can be used for empty space ventilation can be taken as the minimum air supply that has to be provided at all times. Any additional air supply to the conditioned space is primarily for respiration purposes. This respiration amount has a minimum based on ;i per person oxygen need, and an additional amount to dilute whatever pollutants are present in the conditioned space, as defined by standards, codes, and regulatory aerosol concentration limits. This paper discusses and defines the minimum air supply, the respiration air need, and the dilution terms. It combines these terms into a basic air supply equation to serve IAQ criteria. The approach can be used as a practical guideline for the designer to calculate the total air supply needs to a conditioned space.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health has long been recognised as an influence on labour supply. To date there has been little New Zealand research on this topic. This paper uses census area unit level data from the 1996 Census to estimate the effects of changes in the prevalence of self-assessed disability and health problems on the labour force participation race. The best results were obtained from questions asking about the effect of health on ability to carry out common everyday activities, and having a long-term disability. Despite the use of aggregate data the goodness of fit of the models was low (approximately 0.50). Coefficients on non-health variables were robust to changes in the specification of the health variable. The elasticity of labour force participation rates with respect to ill health varied between -0.02 and 0.02. The use of grouped data is less than ideal, and the impact of different corrections for this data structure is explored. The weighted least squares methods used in this paper have been argued to be inefficient if group sizes vary widely, and this is an area for future research with the current dataset. Future research directions with New Zealand survey data are suggested.</jats:p>"

A physiological response to EAS has been demonstrated in container experiments with restricted rooting volumes and uniform N distribution, but less is known about root responses to EAS when distributions of N forms are not uniform. Greenhouse and 2‐yr field experiments were conducted to determine how the root system of wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) responds to EAS. Three N sources: (i) calcium nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>); (ii) urea with a nitrification inhibitor, nitrapyrin (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> + NI); and (iii) 50% NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> + 50% NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> + NI were uniformly incorporated in the field into the top 20 cm of a Shano silt loam soil (Coarse‐silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambid).

A straightforward concept in which multiple extruder units operate in tandem has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A prototype with three large-volume extruder units has been fabricated and tested in the laboratory. In experiments, it was found that each extruder could provide volumetric ice flow rates of up to ∼1.3 cm3/s (for ∼10 s), which is sufficient for fueling fusion reactors at the gigawatt power level. With the three extruders of the prototype operating in sequence, a steady rate of ∼0.33 cm3/s was maintained for a duration of 1 h. Even steady-state rates approaching the full ITER design value (∼1 cm3/s) may be feasible with the prototype. However, additional extruder units (1–3) would facilitate operations at the higher throughputs and reduce the duty cycle of each unit. The prototype can easily accommodate steady-state pellet fueling of present large tokamaks or other near-term plasma experiments.</jats:p>",

First, the current logistic performance of the Dutch catering chain was analysed and performance indicators and logistic scenarios were formulated.

The same PC species with AA were also decreased in the patient’s platelets. Thus the supply of phospholipid-bound AA from LDL to the platelets was probably diminished after the apheresis. We therefore analyzed the concentration dependence of the transfer of phospholipid-bound AA from LDL to the platelets under in vitro conditions. The amount of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]AA-PC transferred to platelets strongly increased upon elevation of LDL from 0.1 to 1 mg protein/ml, with a less marked elevation being noted at higher LDL concentrations. After stimulation with thrombin (0.5 U/ml), 7.1% ([<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]AA-PC) and 10.6% ([<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]AA-phosphatidylethanolamine) of the<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C transferred from LDL to the platelets were recovered in the eicosanoids [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]thromboxane B<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(TxB<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) plus 12-[<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid.

In an exploratory study based on data collected from 84 companies, the authors develop a process model for supplier development. Using this process model as a framework, the authors then compare two approaches buying firms use in supplier development: (1) reactive efforts to increase the performance of laggard suppliers, and (2) strategic efforts to increase the capabilities of the supply base to enhance the buying firm's long‐term competitive advantage. Strategic efforts were found to significantly increase the buying company's involvement in suppliers' processes, and required greater dedication of resources, personnel and communication.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

From a review of quantitative and more qualitative managerial literature, we believe that Supply Chain Management should be concerned with the reduction or even elimination of uncertainties to improve the performance of the chain. The following clusters of sources of uncertainty are identified: order forecast horizon, input data, administrative and decision processes and inherent uncertainties. For each source of uncertainty, several improvement principles are identified. A case study was conducted in a food chain in which a simulation model helped quantify the effects of alternative configurations and operational management concepts. By comparing this simulation study with a pilot study, the model is validated against real data, and organisational consequences are identified. The results of the case study suggest that reduction of uncertainties can improve service levels significantly, although current supply chain configurations restrict possible benefits. The availability of real‐time information systems is found to be a requirement for obtaining efficient and effective Supply Chain Management concepts.</jats:p>",

Introducing GlyBet accumulation into plants that lack it is a well‐established target for metabolic engineering because GlyBet can lessen damage from osmotic stress. The first step in GlyBet synthesis is catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO), a stromal enzyme with a Rieske‐type [2Fe‐2S] center. The absence of CMO is the primary constraint on GlyBet production in GlyBet‐deficient plants such as tobacco, but the endogenous choline supply is also potentially problematic. To investigate this, we constructed transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express a spinach CMO cDNA. The CMO protein was correctly compartmented in chloroplasts and was enzymatically active, showing that its [2Fe‐2S] cluster had been inserted. Salinization increased CMO protein levels, apparently via a post‐transcriptional mechanism, to as high as 10% of that in salinized spinach. However, the GlyBet contents of CMO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> plants were very low (0.02– 0.05 μmol g<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> fresh weight) in both unstressed and salinized conditions. Experiments with [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]GlyBet demonstrated that this was not due to GlyBet catabolism. When CMO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> plants were supplied in culture with 5 mM choline or phosphocholine, their choline and GlyBet levels increased by at least 30‐fold. The choline precursors mono‐ and dimethylethanolamine also enhanced choline and GlyBet levels but ethanolamine did not, pointing to a major constraint on flux to choline at the first methylation step in its synthesis. The extractable activity of the enzyme mediating this step in tobacco was only 3% that of spinach. We conclude that in GlyBet‐deficient plants engineered with choline‐oxidizing genes, the size of the free choline pool and the metabolic flux to choline need to be increased to attain GlyBet levels as high as those in natural accumulators.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",
