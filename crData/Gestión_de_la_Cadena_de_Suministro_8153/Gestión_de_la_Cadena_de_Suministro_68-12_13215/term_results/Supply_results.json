      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses a program of data collection, forecasting, and publishing called the California Cooperative Snow Survey. There are 41 agencies, private and public, that contribute either data or funds to the program. These agencies over the years have identified and maintained over 300 snow courses throughout the mountainous areas of the state at all elevations. From the surveys that are made monthly, forecasts of the flow from 19 major stream basins are prepared from February through May of each year. The forecasts are of spring and summer runoffs, and accuracy is dependent on weather conditions that follow the date of the forecast. During each forecast period, 54 individual forecasts are prepared and a report published. This bulletin is released on the tenth of each month, February through May, and in critical years a bulletin may be published in June. Each fall a report is also released that summarizes state water conditions, after the summer season and before the advent of the new water crop. In addition to water using agencies that need the bulletin for operational purposes, the news media find the report of great public interest. The article also discusses snow survey equipment and methods, snow tubes, river terminal, water recreational uses, and snow pillow.</jats:p>",

It includes the cost of studies to determine available supplies of surface and groundwater, the construction of physical works such as dams, aqueducts, pipelines, pumping plants and storage facilities, right of way, financing, and operation and maintenance after completion of construction. The article presents the California Water Project as an example of determining the wholesale costs of water for a surface water supply system. The article also discusses how the water project was planned, its service areas defined, costs estimated, and arrangements made for financing and for repayment of costs. This example represents a minimum of federal subsidy and a maximum of cost repayment with interest.</jats:p>",
